CLAIR\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I was deeply saddened by the recent death of \nElnora Hall St. Clair, a loving mother, a doting grandmother, and the \ndevoted wife of Arthur M. ``Tinker'' St. Clair, an important individual \nin our Senate family and a man whom I have been long glad to count as \nmy friend.\n\n[[Page S4958]]\n\n  Elnora Hall was born in Waiteville, in southern West Virginia, deep \nin the heart of mining country. Like my own wife, Erma, Elnora was a \ncoal miner's daughter. She grew up among solid, hard-working, faithful \npeople--mountain people--in the hollows of my State. She graduated from \nGary High School in McDowell County. On May 25, 1940, she married \nTinker St. Clair, a lucky day for each of us whose lives that this \ncouple has touched.\n\n  Elnora was a homemaker, and that is a noble occupation that is vastly \nundervalued today. In addition to her membership in the Eastern Star of \nWelch, WV, and the Parent Teachers Association, she was active in the \nDemocratic Party. Her interest in politics--Democratic politics--was \none of the many passions that she and Tinker shared.\n  With Elnora at his side, Tinker--after several years of driving a \nschool bus and a company bus--became a deputy sheriff in McDowell \nCounty. He served as a court bailiff, the criminal investigator for the \ncounty's prosecuting attorney, and later became a justice of the peace.\n  In 1965, Tinker was elected county clerk of McDowell County and \nElnora pitched in whenever she could be of help. In 1971, well \nsatisfied with his performance of his duties, the people of McDowell \nCounty selected him again to serve another 6-year term.\n  But in 1979, Elnora informed Tinker that she wanted to go to \nWashington and she wanted to go to stay and she would not be coming \nback. ``The grandchildren are there,'' she told him, and she wanted to \nbe near them. So, in July of that year, Tinker retired as county clerk \nof McDowell County, and he was appointed by me to serve as a doorkeeper \nin the U.S. Senate. Thus, this pair of southern West Virginians ended \nup here in Washington, where they would be close to their grandchildren \nand could watch them grow.\n  While Elnora and Tinker set up house here, they never severed their \nties to their West Virginia home. In all the years that they lived in \nthe Washington area, Tinker rarely missed a Jefferson/Jackson Day \ndinner back in Charleston. He is a life member of the Brown's Creek \nDemocratic Committee, and in election years, he still travels along the \nwinding mountain roads of southern West Virginia, going up and down the \nhills and back into the hollows nailing up the campaign posters and \nspreading the Democratic word. Elnora accompanied him on many of those \n``politicking'' trips. Whenever possible, they would drive back to \nWelch and visit with long-time friends, and when it came time to lay \nher to rest, Tinker took Elnora back home to West Virginia, back in \nMercer County.\n  Mr. President, on May 25, Tinker and Elnora would have celebrated 56 \nyears of marriage. How blessed they were that God would give them so \nmany years together. Indeed, how blessed many of us have been by their \nlong union.\n\n  They made quite a pair. Elnora was lively and animated. She loved to \nhear a good joke and she had a knack for telling them. She complemented \nTinker very well. He, the more serious, you would think, more reserved \nof the two, delighted in her ways. They cajoled and kidded each other. \nShe would tease him about his thrifty ways. He would tell folks of his \nplans to hand her a toothpick and take her to the Price Club for Sunday \nbrunch. They looked after each other. She would fiddle with his twisted \nsuspenders. They loved each other.\n  In addition to Tinker, Elnora is survived by two daughters, Patty St. \nClair and Linda Pence, and three grandchildren, Kimberly George, and \nEddie and Mack Pence. Also surviving is one great grandson, Nicholas \nGeorge, in whom Elnora revelled.\n  And so Erma and I extend our sympathies to this wonderful family, and \nespecially to Tinker, a diligent and loyal Senate staffer--one who \nreveres this institution--a solid citizen, a compassionate, honorable \nman, an outstanding West Virginian.\n  And on a personal note, I would say to Tinker, you have the promise \nof seeing Elnora again. She knows of your grief today. I lost a loving \ngrandson about 14 years ago, and I felt that Michael knew of my grief \nand I was sustained, as I walked through the deep valley, by the hope \nthat some day I might see Michael again, because we are taught by the \nBible to believe in a life beyond the grave.\n  William Jennings Bryan perhaps said it best when he said:\n\n       If the Father deigns to touch with divine power the cold \n     and pulseless heart of the buried acorn to make it burst \n     forth from its prison walls, again the mighty oak, will he \n     leave neglected in the cold and silent grave, the soul of \n     man, made in his own image? And if he stoops to give to the \n     rosebush, whose withered blossoms float upon the Autumn \n     breeze, the sweet assurance of another springtime, will he \n     refuse the words of hope to the Sons of Men when the frosts \n     of winter come? And if matter, mute and inanimate, though \n     changed by the forces of nature into a multitude of forms, \n     can never be destroyed, then will the imperial spirit of man \n     suffer annihilation after a brief visit like a royal guest to \n     this tenement of clay? No, I prefer to believe that He, who, \n     in His apparent prodigality, created nothing without a \n     purpose and wasted not a single atom in all of his vast \n     creation, has made provision for a future life in which \n     man's universal longing for immortality shall achieve its \n     realization. I am as sure that we will live again, as I am \n     sure that we live today.\n\n  That was William Jennings Bryan in his book ``The Prince of Peace.''\n  I should like to think, in closing, of a bit of verse written by \nsomeone--I know not whom--which conveys a comforting thought that I \nwould like to dedicate to Tinker and his daughters and grandchildren.\n\n     Near a shady wall a rose once grew,\n     Budded and blossomed in God's free light,\n     Watered and fed by morning dew,\n     Shedding its sweetness day and night.\n\n     As it grew and blossomed fair and tall,\n     Slowly rising to loftier height,\n     It came to a crevice in the wall,\n     Through which there shone a beam of light.\n\n     Onward it crept with added strength,\n     With never a thought of fear or pride.\n     It followed the light through the crevice's length,\n     And unfolded itself on the other side.\n\n     The light, the dew, the broadening view\n     Were found the same as they were before,\n     And it lost itself in beauties new,\n     Spreading its fragrance more and more.\n\n     Shall claim of death cause us to grieve,\n     And make our courage faint or fall?\n     Nay! Let us hope and faith receive:\n     The rose still grows beyond the wall.\n\n     Scattering fragrance far and wide,\n     And just as it did in days of yore,\n     Just as it did on the other side,\n     And just as it will forevermore.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it was on Friday, February 23, 1996, that \nthe Federal debt broke the $5 trillion sound barrier for the first time \nin history. The records show that on that day, at the close of \nbusiness, the debt stood at $5,017,056,630,040.53.\n  Twenty years earlier, in 1976, the Federal debt stood at $629 \nbillion, after the first 200 years of America's history, including two \nworld wars. The total 1976 Federal debt, I repeat, stood at $629 \nbillion.\n  Then the big spenders really went to work and the interest on the \nFederal debt really began to take off--and, presto, during the past two \ndecades the Federal debt has soared into the stratosphere, increasing \nby more than $4 trillion in two decades--from 1976 to 1996.\n  So, Mr. President, as of the close of business Friday, May 10, 1996, \nthe Federal debt stood--down-to-the-penny--at $5,092,815,215,705.75. On \na per capita basis, every man, woman, and child in America owes \n$19,230.19 as his or her share of that debt.\n  This enormous debt is a festering, escalating burden on all citizens \nand especially it is jeopardizing the liberty of our children and \ngrandchildren. As Jefferson once warned, ``to preserve [our] \nindependence, we must not let our leaders load us with perpetual debt. \nWe\n\n[[Page S4959]]\n\nmust make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and \nservitude.'' Isn't it about time that Congress heeded the wise words of \nthe author of the Declaration of Independence?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/13/senate-section/article/S4958-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           JUSTICE FLORENCE K. MURRAY--40 YEARS OF EXCELLENCE\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues the good \nnews of a major landmark in Rhode Island history and in the life of \nJustice Florence Kerins Murray. This month we celebrated the 40th \nanniversary of her appointment as the first woman justice in Rhode \nIsland history.\n  I have known and admired Justice Murray for much of my life, and I \nwould like to share some of the many highlights of this remarkable \nwoman's dramatic career with you.\n  She was born in Newport on October 21, 1916, educated in Newport \npublic schools and received her B.A. from Syracuse University. After a \nbrief teaching career at the Prudence Island School, she earned her \nLL.B. in 1942 from Boston University Law School and was admitted to the \nMassachusetts Bar.\n  With World War II in progress, Justice Murray enlisted in the Women's \nArmy Corps, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1942. \nServing in a variety of posts she left the corps as a lieutenant \ncolonel at war's end, only to be recalled to duty for a special \nassignment in 1947.\n  Returning to Rhode Island, she sat for the State bar, was admitted, \nand practiced law alone and in association with her husband, Paul F. \nMurray, to whom she was married in 1943 at St. Mary's Church, Newport. \nThey are the parents of a son, Paul M. Murray.\n  She began her distinguished political career in 1948, serving \nsimultaneously on the Newport School Committee and in the Rhode Island \nState Senate until 1956. She focused on issues ranging from the welfare \nof children and youth to facilities for the elderly.\n  In 1956, Florence Murray was appointed by Governor Dennis J. Roberts \nas an associate justice of the Rhode Island Superior Court, the first \nwoman justice in Rhode Island history.\n  Twenty-two years later she became the first woman presiding justice \nof that court. In 1979, she was elected to her present position on the \nRhode Island Supreme Court, one of the first women to serve on a State \ncourt of last resort in the United States.\n  Justice Murray's career is marked by service and leadership in the \nregional and national Trial Judges Association, and the National \nJudicial College--where she served as chair of the board of directors \nof the college.\n  The recipient of numerous awards for outstanding service, including \nnine honorary doctorates, Justice Murray was honored at a ceremony 6 \nyears ago in which the Newport County Courthouse was rededicated as the \nFlorence Kerins Murray Judicial Complex.\n  Once again, it was a first. The program notes from the ceremony state \nthe rededication ``marks the first time that a major court facility in \nthe United States has been designated in honor of a woman jurist.''\n  Justice Murray is truly a wonderful, remarkable individual who has \nearned her place in the history of both Rhode Island and the Nation. I \nknow that I reflect the thoughts of countless Rhode Islanders as we \nwish her well on the 40th anniversary of her appointment as a Rhode \nIsland State Justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/13/senate-section/article/S4959-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS DAY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this past Saturday was Vietnam Human \nRights Day, and I join in urging all Members of the Senate to express \ntheir support for it. Six years ago, on May 11, 1990, one of Vietnam's \nforemost human rights advocates, Dr. Nguyen Dan Que, published the \nManifesto of the Non-Violent Movement for Human Rights in Vietnam. \nVietnam Human Rights Day marks that historic occasion. The manifesto \ncalls on the Vietnamese Government to respect basic human rights, \nestablish a multiparty system of government, and allow free and fair \nelections.\n  Tragically, Dr. Que's appeal led to his arrest and imprisonment in \n1990. He was sentenced to 20 years of hard labor, and he has spent the \npast 2 years in solitary confinement.\n  Last November, Dr. Que and Prof. Doan Viet Hoat, a leading Vietnamese \ndissident who has also been imprisoned, were recipients of the Robert \nF. Kennedy Human Rights Award. At that time, I called on the Vietnamese \nGovernment to release Dr. Que and Professor Hoat and all political \nprisoners in Vietnam. Today, 6 months later, Dr. Que and Professor Hoat \nand other political prisoners remain in prison, and their plight and \nthe future of human rights in Vietnam remain bleak.\n  I take this opportunity on Vietnam Human Rights Day to call on the \nGovernment of Vietnam to respect fundamental human rights and release \ntheir political prisoners. The people of Vietnam have waited too long \nfor these basic changes to take place.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this weekend there was an important \nconference in Prague, the Czech Republic, in which both Europeans and \nAmericans discussed the future of the Atlantic alliance.\n  I wanted to report briefly on that and submit statements for the \nRecord later.\n  First, let me ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an \nop-ed piece written by our colleague, the Senator from Mississippi, \nSenator Cochran, relating to the subject of missile defense.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 8, 1996]\n\n                       Unready for Rogue Threats\n\n                           (By Thad Cochran)\n\n       When it comes to thinking about ballistic missile defense \n     (BMD), most opponents of defending America are mired in the \n     logic of the Cold War. Critics would do well to consider new \n     ideas, as their old logic is inadequate for the emerging \n     security environment.\n       It was suggested in an op-ed piece by Michael Krepon [The \n     Last 15 Minutes, March 27] that the START process of reducing \n     the number of Russian nuclear weapons should be a preferred \n     alternative to national missile defense. This argument is, in \n     fact, a staple from the past. The ability to defend against \n     Soviet missiles was considered anathema to achieving U.S.-\n     Soviet strategic arms control agreements, and therefore it \n     was sacrificed for the goal of reducing Soviet nuclear arms \n     through negotiation.\n       This position, questionable at the time, now ignores \n     reality. It misses one of the primary features of the changed \n     world: the proliferation of missiles and nuclear weapons to \n     rogue states outside the old East Bloc. The central point of \n     the Defend America Act now before Congress is that American \n     cities must be protected against those rogues now bent on \n     acquiring long-range missiles and nuclear, biological and \n     chemical weapons. The START process does not help us here--it \n     doesn't even apply.\n       START II, ratified by the Senate with overwhelming \n     bipartisan support, cannot and does not pretend to take a \n     single missile or mass-destruction weapon out of the hands of \n     countries such as North Korea, Iran and Libya. The Defend \n     America Act calls for defenses against the limited missile \n     arsenals existing and sought by such rogue states.\n       The notion is also put forward that we should focus on \n     various multilateral and nonproliferation measures instead of \n     national missile defense. Again, the old Cold War debating \n     tactic of pitting diplomatic efforts against BMD shines \n     through. And again, it does not fit the new world. We know \n     that diplomatic efforts to prevent the spread of missile \n     technology alone are inadequate to address the \n     proliferation threat.\n       Despite some modest diplomatic successes, such as with the \n     Missile Technology Control Regime, the list of countries \n     acquiring missiles and mass-destruction weapons continues to \n     grow. Rogue states have proven themselves capable of \n     sidestepping our diplomatic nonproliferation measures. For \n     example, inspections in Iraq, the world's most heavily \n     inspected regime, have been on the ground for years, yet we \n     are regularly surprised by new revelations of previously \n     unknown Iraqi proliferation efforts.\n       Diplomatic efforts to help slow the pace of proliferation \n     must continue. But nobody should be fooled into believing \n     that arms control agreements alone can solve the problem; and \n     nobody should be fooled by the old Cold War argument that \n     missile defense must be sacrificed to pursue various arms \n     control efforts. This is not an either/or choice, as the \n     critics would like us to believe.\n\n[[Page S4960]]\n\n       It should be common knowledge, but it isn't, that America \n     has no operational national missile defense system. \n     Consequently, because we cannot be confident in our various \n     diplomatic efforts to stop missiles before the ``last 15 \n     minutes'' of their deadly flight, it makes sense to focus \n     attention and resources now on the capability to intercept \n     missiles and warheads before they reach their targets. The \n     proliferation of missiles and mass-destruction weapons now \n     makes missile defenses essential to American security.\n       Some argue that there is no missile threat to the United \n     States for the foreseeable future. This notion comes on the \n     heels of statements by Chinese officials to American \n     officials that the United States would not support Taiwan in \n     a crisis because of the Chinese capability to rain nuclear \n     bombs on Los Angeles. It also ignores the fact that, \n     according to U.S. intelligence estimates and private \n     accounts, the North Koreans have in development a missile \n     that, when operations, will be able to target parts of the \n     United States. In the past, the North Koreans have sold \n     missiles to anybody with the cash to pay. How far and wide \n     might this missile be sold? Nobody inside or outside the \n     intelligence community knows.\n       We do know that North Korea has sold its missiles to rogue \n     states in the past, including Iran. We also know that Libya's \n     Qadhafi and Saddam Hussein have both expressed their longing \n     for missiles and nuclear weapons with which to threaten the \n     United States, and willing sources of technology and brain \n     power exist to help them.\n       For America to delay moving ahead on BMD until multiple \n     rogue missile threats emerge--and there is consensus in the \n     intelligence community that such is the case-- carries high \n     risks that Americans need not be vulnerable to.\n       Some think tanks may be able to convince American leaders \n     that they should not worry about emerging missile threats, \n     but providing the common defense is a constitutional \n     responsibility those in authority dare not forfeit or ignore. \n     That is why I support the Defend America Act and that is why \n     the president should sign it.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the conference to which I referred was to \ndiscuss the future of the Atlantic alliance given the fact that the \nCentral European nations of Europe have not yet been taken into either \nthe economic or the political organizations to which the Western \nEuropean nations have belonged since the end of World War II. \nSpecifically, would these countries be taken into NATO, and would they \nbe taken into the community of European nations in terms of the \neconomic arrangements that currently exist? The answer to those \nquestions by most of the members at this conference was that it was \ntime for the Western European nations, including the United States, to \nreach out to the Central European countries like the Czech Republic, \nPoland, Hungary, and others who wished to be a part of the alliance \nboth to develop stronger economic ties and also to provide for common \nsecurity arrangements. The basis for this conclusion was primarily \nphilosophical, not practical, though the practical benefits of the \narrangement are clear for all to see.\n  From a practical standpoint, it goes without saying that exports and \nimports benefit all nations participating, that there are benefits to \ncommon defense, and certainly from the United States' perspective a \nforward defense by having friends in Europe as preferable to an \nisolationist position. But the philosophical reasons were the ones that \nwere dwelt upon by the participants in this Atlantic alliance \nconference because of the understanding that the Western nations, among \nothers in the world, share a common set of values, a common heritage, \nand an understanding that mankind should be free, that government \nshould protect that freedom and independence based upon the \nphilosophical and moral values of the Western nations. There is a sense \nthat we do not have an option to be apart but rather must continue to \nwork together to advance that philosophy.\n  Why is that so? Mr. President, it is important for the people of the \nUnited States to see the advantages of democracy in the world. If I \ncould sum up in one sentence what our national interest is abroad, it \nwould be to advance the cause of democracy for the peoples who share \nthat common value with us.\n  As I said, it benefits the United States from a philosophical point \nof view because, if there is conflict in the world, the United States \nis less free not only from a military point of view but from the point \nof view of the rights that we exercise as American citizens. We know \nfrom the depths of the cold war that Americans were less free at home \nbecause of the commitments that we had to make abroad.\n  That is why, both from a practical and a philosophical point of view, \nit is important for the United States to participate with our Western \nEuropean allies and why it is important for all of us to try to advance \nthe cause of freedom by extending the number of democratic states in \nthe world.\n\n  There is another important point that was reached by most \nparticipants in the conference. That was that of all of the threats \nthat face the civilized nations of the world today, as Lady Margaret \nThatcher said in one of the key addresses at the conference, the most \ncritical threat of all is the threat of weapons of mass destruction and \nthe missiles to deliver those weapons. That same theme was articulated \nby others at the conference as well.\n  The conclusion of the policy statement at the conference was that a \nconcerted action by the alliance leaders to develop and to deploy an \neffective ballistic missile defense for all of the democratic peoples \nof the world was an important goal for us to be achieving, and that, if \nwe could achieve that goal, we would no longer have to answer the \nquestion of why NATO continued to have a purpose in the world today.\n  Conceived as an organization to protect Western Europe from the \nthreat of communism and the expansion of communism, some have felt that \nNATO has no more purpose because that ideological threat no longer \nexists. That is true; but what does exist is the threat from rogue \nnations, whether ideologically oriented or not, rogue nations who are, \none could say, the world's criminal element because they have no regard \nfor the democratic rights of other nations and have exhibited \naggressive tendencies. Iraq and Iran are two of the most recent \nexamples. These are nations, along with others like North Korea, who \nhave acquired or are acquiring both weapons of mass destruction and the \nmissiles, the means, to deliver them, and who can use those missiles \nnot only in military activity against the Western alliance such as in \nthe gulf war but also in conduct of their foreign policy to blackmail \nstates such as the Western European nations and the United States.\n  Let me conclude with this point. As Margaret Thatcher pointed out to \nthe conference, the threat is primarily against nations of the so-\ncalled civilized world attempting to advance legitimate foreign policy \ngoals by making threats with the use of ballistic missiles. If Iraq, \nfor example, had had a nuclear capability and we knew that, the \nquestion that I posed in the conference was, would the United States \nhave, and would the United States conference have voted to use military \naction against Saddam Hussein? It was a close enough question in the \nconference even knowing that we could defeat Saddam Hussein, but if \nSaddam Hussein had had a nuclear warhead, or if we knew that he would \nuse chemical or biological weapons, would the United States Congress \nhave voted to thwart his actions after he invaded Kuwait? For that \nmatter, would the European nations have joined the grand coalition if \nthey knew that they were vulnerable to a missile attack from Saddam \nHussein?\n\n  Asking that question raises the point of the use of these weapons for \nblackmail, because a nation which can blackmail, others obviously is a \ncriminal nation and a nation who can expand its foreign policy goals \nand thwart ours. But with the development and deployment of effective \nmissile defenses, that ability to blackmail is gone because the United \nStates and the Western European allies, who would have such an \neffective defense at that point, would be able to say to Saddam Hussein \nor to the rulers of Iran or North Korea or Syria, whatever country it \nmight be, ``You cannot push us around; you cannot threaten the nations \nof Europe; you cannot threaten your neighbors with these ballistic \nmissiles because, as you know, we can destroy them; we have a defense \nagainst them.''\n  So, Mr. President, I think it is an important development that, at \nthis Atlantic alliance, leaders there concluded by and large that it \nwas important for us to develop in a concerted way--our European allies \nas well as the United States--an effective ballistic missile defense to \nthwart this blackmail use of weapons of mass destruction by the outlaw \nor so-called rogue regimes of the world.\n\n[[Page S4961]]\n\n  I will just conclude by saying that the importance of the United \nStates proceeding with this and bringing it to the floor in the next \ncouple of weeks, along with the budget that we will be debating later \nthis week and the authorization bill for the Armed Services Committee \nwhich the distinguished Presiding Officer sits on--as we debate this \nbill we will be discussing specifically the issue of whether or not we \nwill continue to adequately fund and to begin deployment of an \neffective missile defense system.\n  That will be a matter of great debate on this Senate floor, and I \nhope my colleagues, in consideration of that, will pause and reflect \nupon the conclusions of this Atlantic alliance which, as I said, has \nnow come much farther along the path of agreeing that in the end there \nshould be a coordinated, combined effort. It would not just be the \nUnited States, but it would be our Atlantic allies as well \nparticipating with us in some kind of effective global ballistic \nmissile defense system.\n  Mr. President, I will at a future time insert in the Record some of \nthe statements that were made at this important conference. For the \nmoment, I simply wanted to alert my colleagues to the fact that, as we \nbegin this budget debate and as we begin the debate on the Defense \nauthorization bill, a consensus is developing around the world, and the \nUnited States needs to lead in this effort. I know the distinguished \nPresiding Officer and I will be involved in that debate in a \nsignificant way as it unfolds in the next few days.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 3:30 shall be under the \ncontrol of the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Chair.\n  It is my understanding that before the Senate we have a cloture \nmotion against the travel provision against which lays the majority \nleader's proposal to repeal the administration's 4.3-cent gas tax \ninaugurated in August 1993. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion the Senator talks about will be \nvoted on tomorrow.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. At what time, if I might ask the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is set for 2:15 p.m.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/13/senate-section/article/S4959-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4961-S4969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GAS TAX AND THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, for an extended period of time, we have \nbeen engaged in an attempt to repeal the President's and this \nadministration's imposition of a 4.3-cent gas tax that was imposed on \nthe country in August 1993. The President has now said that he will \nsign the repeal of this gas tax, and he gave several suggestions as to \nhow it should be funded. The other side of the aisle for the last week \nhas been standing in front of our attempt to repeal this gas tax; it \nhas gotten caught up in the minimum wage, whereupon the majority leader \ncame forward with new suggestions about the new workplace. That was \nobjected to by the other side of the aisle.\n  We are now in the midst of having to file a cloture motion to see if \nwe can end debate on the majority leader's suggestion and proposal to \nrepeal the gas tax. As the Chair has suggested, there will be a vote at \n2:15 p.m. tomorrow on whether or not we can come to cloture, whether or \nnot we can end debate, whether or not we can stop day after day after \nday of standing in the way of the repeal which is so important to \nAmerica's average working families.\n  The specific amendment offered by Senator Dole, repeals the 4.3-cent-\nper-gallon gas tax until December 31, 1996, although there are many of \nus--this is the interim repeal--who, in the budget, want to repeal it \npermanently. It expresses the sense of Congress that 4.3 cents per \ngallon should be passed on to the customers.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about whether or not this would \nactually get to the pump and that the price was lowered in the midst of \nthese very large gasoline prices at the pumps all across the country. \nSo this has a sense of the Congress that this reduction in tax we \nexpect to see occur at the pump. It authorizes a study by the \nComptroller General as to whether the 4.3-cents-per-gallon savings were \npassed through to the consumer. That report would be due January 31, \n1997.\n\n  The repeal does not add to the deficit. It specifically pays for it. \nThis has been modified; $800 million of this tax relief will come in \nreduced expenditures at the Department of Energy in their \nadministrative overhead; $2.5 billion of this tax relief will come from \nthe spectrum auction completed by March 1997, and $1.7 billion in the \noffset from the bank insurance fund and the savings association \ninsurance fund, raising the revenues to capitalize that fund, reduce \npressure on the general fund, bringing $1.7 billion in additional tax \nrelief.\n  So, as you can see here, it is about $4.5 billion worth of tax \nreductions on the average working families in our country.\n  With regard to the suggestions which began to surface last week that \nthis was an exercise in futility because the American people would \nnever see it, you will note that it commissions the Comptroller General \nto certify that the consumers got it. It has a sense of the Congress \nsuggesting that it must be passed on to the consumers.\n  In addition to this, when Senator Dole spoke late last week, he \nintroduced into the Record letters from Arco, Texaco, and Exxon. Here \nis one:\n\n       ARCO Chairman and CEO, Mike R. Bowlin, said today that ``if \n     the Federal Government reduces the gasoline excise tax by 4.3 \n     cents per gallon, ARCO will immediately reduce its total \n     price at its company-operated stations and to its dealers by \n     4.3 cents per gallon.''\n\n  A similar letter from Texaco, Incorporated; a letter to Senator Dole \nfrom the American Bus Association:\n\n       Dear Senator Dole: On behalf of the American Bus \n     Association, I thank you once again for your proposal to \n     repeal the 4.3 cents per gallon deficit reduction fuel tax. \n     We fully support your efforts in this regard.\n\n  From Carol Hallett, the Air Transport Association:\n\n       Dear Mr. Leader: We have been asked whether the reduction \n     in the 4.3 cents-per-gallon transportation fuels tax will \n     result in lower air fares to consumers. As you know, the Air \n     Transport Association has no role in the setting of air \n     fares. Moreover, we do not suggest or take any action which \n     may result in our member carriers adjusting fares. However, \n     notwithstanding those limits, I would like to address your \n     inquiry.\n\n  It goes on to say that it would, indeed, reduce air fares.\n  So air fares, bus fares, cab fares, the working family, the car pool, \nthis effort puts additional and very much needed funds into the \nchecking account of every working family, every working business, all \nthose who depend on public transportation and private transportation. \nIt has a positive effect that is reached all across the board.\n  So, I am very hopeful that this week we will see a conclusion and a \npositive step taken on behalf of American families and businesses all \nacross our land as we begin the process of reducing the economic burden \non those families.\n  Mr. President, I understand the Presiding Officer would like to speak \non this proposal. I am prepared to yield up to 10 minutes to the \nPresiding Officer to match with his schedule, and then I will assume \nthe role of Presiding Officer during the remarks of the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  (Mr. COVERDELL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to take advantage of the 10 \nminutes you granted to talk a little bit about this tax decrease that \nis on our menu today. We have talked about it for some time, but I \nthink it is always useful to refresh ourselves about exactly what we \nare talking about, as the Senator from Georgia indicated, and I \nappreciate him bringing together this time to talk about it.\n  We are talking about 4.3-cent tax cut on the gas tax. The average gas \ntax in this country is about 38 cents, about half of which is Federal, \nhalf of which is State. We had a chart the other day at a hearing that \nwe held. It showed the cost of crude, the cost of refining, and the \ncost of taxes. The three of\n\n[[Page S4962]]\n\nthem were nearly equal. So we have substantial tax on fuel. The unique \nthing about this 4.3 cents, that I think everyone needs to understand, \nis that it is the only part of the gas tax that does not go to the \nmaintenance and preparation of highways. This was added onto highway \nusers and to drivers for other purposes--to go to social programs, to \ngo to general spending. I think that is a problem. I think that is a \nproblem in direction. We have always tied together the gas tax to the \npreparation of highways and the maintenance of highways, to building \nthe Federal highway program to serve all States. Here, now, we deviate \nfrom that and use this source--we take it away from what gas taxes were \nreally intended to be for and to use them for general spending. I think \nthat is a mistake. Why should it not be 10 cents more or 15 cents more, \nwhen some believe we need the money?\n  The reduction would be, temporarily at least, until the end of this \ncalendar year. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about \na tax that was part of the President's tax increase in 1993, the \nlargest tax increase in the history of this country, $260 billion of \ntax increase. The President has indicated when he had his tax increase \nhe was going to tax the rich. Let me tell you, a gas tax does not tax \nthe rich. A gas tax taxes everyone. Selfishly, I have to tell you, it \ntaxes people in my State twice as much as it does the people in the \nDistrict of Columbia because we are the ninth largest State--100,000 \nsquare miles and 50,000 people. We drive a lot. We have no public \ntransportation.\n\n  So it is an unfair tax regionally. It is an unfair tax in terms of \nincome. It is paid by everyone, despite their income. In fact, the \nlower one-fifth of earners in this country pay 4\\1/2\\ times as much in \nthis tax as do the top fifth, because it is not related to income.\n  Mr. President, I have never favored the tax. I voted against it, as \nyou did, and all Republicans did; partly because I am not one who \nthinks we ought to look for more taxes. I believe strongly in what I \nthink was the message of the 1994 election, that the Federal Government \nis too big and it costs too much and we are overregulated. So we ought \nto be looking at ways to find efficiency, we ought to be looking at \nways to reduce the expenditures, as opposed to finding more taxes so we \ncan continue to grow.\n  By the way, there is a great deal of talk, and I am pleased for that, \nthat the deficit is down. It is down because we have more taxes. \nSpending is up. Spending continues to go up. I think we ought to be \ngoing the other way.\n  Some say a reduction in taxes by 4.3 cents will not go to the \nconsumer. I think it will. I do not think it should be done necessarily \nbecause gas prices are high. That does focus on it and gives us an \nopportunity to talk about it, but I think it should be done regardless \nof where gas prices are. When the money does not go to highways, when \nit is an increase in taxes to the lowest income-earners in our country, \nthen I think we ought to change that.\n  I ran into this in the House a couple of years ago. When we talk \nabout the details of issues--in that case it happened to be land use \nissues, in this case it happens to be taxes--we can go on and on about \nthe details of why you should do it or why you should not do it. The \nfact is, it is basically a philosophical question. My friend on the \nother side of the aisle who talks quite often comes from a Western \nState and is against the repeal. He is against the repeal and I am for \nit because he and I differ in philosophy. He likes more Government. I \nwould like to have some less. If you like more Government you need more \ntaxes. If you think the Government is better at spending people's money \nthan having them keep it for themselves, then more taxes are the \nappropriate thing to do, and I understand that. It is a legitimate \npoint of view. It does not happen to be mine. My only point is, when we \nget into the details of some of these things, the details really are \nnot the issue. The issue is the philosophy. The issue is the \nphilosophy.\n\n  If you want more Government, if Government is the best answer to all \nof our problems, then you should be for more taxes because you \ncertainly ought to pay for at least a portion of the program you have. \nIf you believe Government can spend the money better than the people \nwho earn it, and more efficiently--and there are those who do--then you \nshould be for more taxes.\n  The argument that is used is: It harms the deficit. Let me tell you \nsomething, spending next year will be $1,600 billion, $1.6 trillion. In \nthat budget, if we cannot find offsets of $4 billion in programs that \nought to be reduced, indeed ought to be eliminated, I will--almost \nanybody can find them. The Presiding Officer has outlined most of them. \nThey will be used for offsets.\n  The other argument is it will not be used for consumers. I do not \nbelieve that. As competitive as this industry is, if I have a service \nstation on one corner and I reduce the price, you do not think everyone \nelse on the other corners is going to? Of course they are. Furthermore, \nthey have said they would.\n  So, I think this is an issue that really reaches in the direction we \nhave been going. I think the Presiding Officer talked a little bit \nabout the frustration of the slowness of action on this particular \nissue. We have been talking about it now for 2 weeks. Our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle will not let it move and have adopted a \nvery defensive position about everything that is sought to be done.\n  I just want to say a little bit, off that subject. I have thought \nabout this a little bit, and frankly I am a little frustrated. This is \nmy second year in the Senate. I am pretty frustrated with the fact we \ndo not move, we do not decide to take up an issue and vote on it. That \nis what voting is for, to make those decisions. Instead, we use the \nsystem to procrastinate.\n  But, as I reflected on it, I am really pleased in what has happened \nover the last year and a half. We have seen a total redirection in this \nSenate. We have seen a total redirection from what has been going on \nfor 40 years--and that has been one of the difficulties. We have been \ngoing along with pretty much of a New Society, Great Society Program \nstarted with Lyndon Johnson. How long ago was that? Each year we have \ncome here and we have said, ``How much more will we spend on these same \nprograms?'' For the first time in 25 years, we talked about balancing \nthe budget. We are going to balance the budget. We are going to commit \nourselves to it.\n\n  We have changed the whole direction of the discussion from how much \nmore do you add to balancing the budget and doing it by reducing the \nsize of Government and reducing taxes, by transferring some functions \nto States, doing away with some functions, putting some functions in \nthe private sector, but continuing then to look for efficient ways to \ndeliver those services that are essential, that do need to be there. \nLet me tell you, there are plenty of them that are not that essential \nand many that are.\n  So I am delighted that we have done that. We have done a lot of \nthings. We have the line-item veto; we have congressional \naccountability; we passed unfunded mandates reform; we reduced \ncongressional spending; we have small business regulatory reform; a \ntelecommunications bill; lobbying reform; gift ban; a farm bill that \nmoves it back to the marketplace for the first time in how many years? \nFifty. Securities litigation reform.\n  So, Mr. President, I think we get frustrated, and we should. On the \nother hand, we have changed the whole complexion of this place in 1 \nyear, and it is going to take longer than that to change 40 years of \nhabits. But this is one of the ways that I think you begin, by saying, \n``Look, gas taxes ought to be dedicated to highways and highway \nconstruction.'' We have one here that is not. We have one here that is \ndesigned to keep the Government going as it was. We have an opportunity \nto reduce spending for the American families. We have a chance to do \nthat.\n  I am very hopeful that the other side of the aisle will give us an \nopportunity to vote on the gas tax reduction and give us a chance to \nvote on some of the other issues that are there as well so we can move \nforward. The fact there is now a Presidential election going on does \nnot mean that we should stop doing something, that everything has to be \ntied to the Presidential election. Things ought to be talked about on \nthe merits. I understand there is a difference of view, and I recognize \nthat.\n\n[[Page S4963]]\n\n  I guess that is really what I have been trying to say. There is a \nphilosophical difference about the size of Government, a philosophical \ndifference about how people ought to spend their own money, a \nphilosophical difference about taxation. And that is where we are.\n  I support strongly the idea of reducing this tax of 4.3 cents, \ncontinuing to reduce it in the budget and finding some places in this \n$1.6 trillion budget that we can offset this and continue to do that, \ncontinue to make programs more efficient, more responsive, more close \nto people by involving the States.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate you giving me this opportunity. I \nappreciate what you are doing on the floor. I think we need to talk \nabout these issues. People need to know what they are. People need to \nknow this is a different gas tax than the other 14, 15 cents that is \nthere. This was designed for a specific purpose, and this is a great \nopportunity to change it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am convinced if Thomas Jefferson, or \nany of our august Founders were here today, they would be absolutely \naghast to find that this Nation, that the workers--and it is better to \ncharacterize workers as working families today, because virtually 80 \npercent of what has happened in the workplace has been about working \nfamilies. It is no longer a breadwinner with the family at home; it is \nthe whole family in the workplace. Not only are both spouses in the \nworkplace, often children of the spouses are in the workplace.\n  We did not have a celebration but we had a revelation last week when \nwe were here on the floor on May 8--May 8--to acknowledge that that \nwould be the first day that these working families would have the right \nto keep their paychecks. Every day prior to that--May 7, 6, 5, 4, all \nthe way back to January 1--their paychecks belonged to the Government. \nIt is almost unfathomable that we would have come to the point that a \nfamily would work from January 1 to May 7 and forfeit all of those \nwages to the Government before they had the first dime for themselves \nto take care of those very special needs that we charge the American \nfamily to do--house, educate, transport, feed, health, prepare the \nNation for the future, to get America up the next day and to school and \nto work, to get them home, to get ready for the next week, the next \nmonth, the next generation. January 1 to May 7 before they get to keep \ntheir first check--that is hard to fathom.\n  Just to put this in perspective, and I am going to in a moment \nrecognize the distinguished Senator from Texas, but in 1992, the \nPresident, in his campaign for Presidency, said the gas tax was a bad \nthing to do. He was right. The gas tax, he said, would punish the poor \ninordinately and the elderly. He was right. But when he got to the \nWhite House, he adopted this 4.3-cent gas tax, and as the Chair has \nacknowledged, the tax did not even go to build better highways or safer \nhighways; it was put into new Federal spending--out of the pocket, out \nof the checking accounts of working America into the checking account \nof the Treasury.\n\n  Here we are 3 years later and we are simply trying to fulfill what \nthe President said when he campaigned. We are trying to get rid of this \ntax that he has called an improper tax, one that is particularly hard \non the poor, particularly hard on the elderly. It is exceedingly \ndifficult for the poor. The lowest 20 percent are faced with having to \npay somewhere between 7 and 8 percent of all their disposable income on \ngasoline. So it is entirely appropriate that this regressive tax be \nrepealed.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to my \ndistinguished colleague from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nGeorgia for taking this time to talk about this gas tax and why we are \nstill talking about it.\n  We had this bill on the floor last week. We have been trying to make \ntax cuts throughout this Congress. Every time we submit a tax cut to \nthe President, it comes back with a big veto on it.\n  I think we need to talk a little bit about the philosophy of why we \nwant tax cuts. A lot of people say, ``Well, why do you want tax cuts \nwhen you have a deficit?'' The reason is twofold. One is, if you are \ngoing to lower the rate of growth of spending by the Government, tax \ncuts put more money into the economy.\n  But the second reason is who makes the decision about how to spend \nthe people's hard-earned money. That is the question here. So when \nsomeone says, why tax cuts? it is because we believe that the people of \nthis country who are working so hard to make a living for themselves \nand for their families should have the ability to spend their money \nthat they earn rather than sending it to Washington for someone to \ndecide whether this program is more important to your family than going \non a family vacation or buying food to eat or having a new dress for \nthe senior prom. Whatever the decision for a family is, we believe that \nfamily ought to be able to decide how they spend their money. That is \nwhy we are trying so hard to provide tax cuts for the middle class.\n  This is something that the President promised in 1992. He promised it \nin his election campaign in the book ``Putting People First.'' He said \nhis would pass tax cuts for the middle class. But instead, what the \nmiddle-class people of this country got was the largest tax increase in \nthe history of America. That is what happened in 1993. There were no \ntax cuts for the middle class in 1993 or 1994 or 1995.\n  The only tax bills that have been passed have been tax increases. In \nthe 1993 President Clinton budget he increased taxes, including a 4.3-\ncent-per-gallon increase in gasoline taxes. This was a different kind \nof gasoline tax than we have seen in the past. In the past, a gasoline \ntax has automatically gone into the highway trust fund. It has gone as \na user fee to finish and maintain our National Highway System. But not \nthe 4.3-cent-per-gallon tax of 1993. No. That was a tax increase that \nwas supposed to go against the deficit. 4.3 cents per gallon just went \ninto the general fund. So we have been trying to repeal this tax since \nthe time we voted against passing it in the first place. In fact, every \nRepublican in the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Senate voted against this \ntax increase in 1993.\n  We are now trying to repeal the gas tax. We believe the American \nfamily is quite capable of making the decision on how that family \nspends its money, and so we oppose all tax increases. We think the \nfamily is more capable of making good decisions about what is right for \nthem than somebody in Washington, DC. In my home State of Texas or in \nSenator Coverdell's home State of Georgia, we believe the people who \nearn the money can make the decisions.\n  So that is why we are fighting so hard against the Democrat \nfilibuster for this gasoline tax cut, because we believe it is very \nimportant for the working people. It is especially important in a State \nlike mine, where people have to drive so much because there are wide \nopen spaces and they have to go so far to get to work and to school. We \nthink that this tax cut will be very beneficial to the working families \nand particularly the families that are barely making ends meet and have \nto drive long distances to go to work or for the essential needs for \nthemselves and for their families.\n  So, Mr. President, we are trying very hard to stay consistent. We did \nnot vote for this tax increase in the first place. Now that gasoline \nprices are so high, we want to take this opportunity to give a little \nrelief to the people who are using their cars for the essentials of \nlife, or even if it is for recreation--that is important in a family, \ntoo--we want people to have a little relief from these high gasoline \nprices.\n  We think 4.3 cents per gallon is a good place to start. I heard it \nsaid the other day say that somebody in California was trying to make \nthe decision on whether to pay their home mortgage this month or fill \nup the van with gasoline. That is not a serious statement, but a joke, \nbut it is getting to be\n\n[[Page S4964]]\n\nmore and more serious when it costs $60 to fill up a van. That will \nmake a dent in a working person's salary and their expendable income.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that the people who are going to be voting \non the floor of the Senate tomorrow on this very important measure will \nconsider the working people of this country and the tax relief that \nthey were promised, and I hope they will make their promise good \nbecause I think it is about time that the people in Washington, DC, \nstarted thinking about the people who are out there earning a living, \nhoping that Government will not continue to encroach on their lives to \na greater extent than is absolutely necessary.\n  That is what we are trying to do, Mr. President. So I appreciate the \nSenator from Georgia. I hope that people will think about the 4.3 cents \nper gallon for somebody who is filling up a car every 4 days or so. It \nmay not seem like a lot, but it is a lot if you are barely making ends \nmeet. This determines what disposable income is and whether you are \nable to do some of those extra things that you would like to do for \nyour own family.\n  The bottom line is, Mr. President, we want the working people of this \ncountry to have as much of the money they earn as we can possibly let \nthem keep. That is the difference between Congress and the President. \nThe President would rather have Washington make these decisions.\n  He does not like the gas tax cut. As I understand it, he has now said \nthat he would sign it because he is hoping to have this with the \nminimum wage increase as well, but it is clear that it was not his \nfirst choice. He has said on many occasions he does not want this tax \ncut. But, Mr. President, I hope this is just the first of many tax \ncuts.\n  I hope that we will enact the tax cuts for families in this country \nthat were vetoed last year because that is what is going to make a \ndifference for American families--the $500 per child tax credit, \nhomemaker IRA's, so the women who are staying home and raising their \nchildren will have the same opportunities for retirement security that \nanyone who works outside the home has. That is in the bill we sent to \nthe President that he vetoed along with the $500 per child tax credit \nand lessening the marriage penalties so families would not have to pay \nsuch a great price for getting married.\n  All of these things will help the American family keep the money they \nearn. That is the bright red line of difference between the President \nand this Congress. We want people to keep the money they earn for their \nfamilies. We think that will make the American family stronger.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that everyone will think about how much \nthis could mean to the people of this country. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am going to yield in a moment to my \ndistinguished colleague from Idaho, but I do want to make a point about \nthis. When President Clinton campaigned for the highest office in the \nland, he told America that he was going to lower--lower--the pressure--\nI want to thank my colleague from Texas for her remarks here today; I \nappreciate her very much, all that she does; and she alluded to this as \nwell--but that he was going to lower the economic pressure on the \nworking family. And I just said a moment ago that Americans work from \nJanuary 1 to May 7, and every paycheck they get for every one of those \ndays goes to the Government.\n\n  The point I want to make before I yield to the Senator from Idaho is \nthat when President Clinton came to the White House, they earned their \nfirst check on May 6. So he has added 3 more days because of his \npolicies--3 more days that American families have to work in addition. \nThat is going in the wrong direction, particularly when you promised \nyou were going to reduce the number of days that they had to work. And \nthen we turn around and we have American families working even more. \nJust another example of the campaign pledge that got jettisoned in the \nWhite House.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Georgia for, \nonce again, taking time to bring us to the floor of the Senate to \ndebate what has become a very important issue to Americans--America's \nconsumers and America's driving public.\n  As has been said by our colleague from Texas, there are those of us \nwho live in rural States where it is literally hundreds of miles \nbetween communities, where people commute 60, 70 miles a day, where \nbusiness occurs and goods and services are provided by long distances \nof transportation. Any time we raise the cost of delivery of goods and \nservices, or the cost it takes the individual consumer to provide for \nthemselves and their families in the normal course of daily activity, \nwe have impaired the economy of our country. That is exactly what has \nhappened here with the kind of tax that President Clinton pushed \nthrough several years ago, of which a part was the 4.3 cent gas tax \nthat we are talking about today and that I hope the Senate will vote to \nrepeal this week.\n  Unique to this gas tax increase was the fact that, up until that \ntime, in a temporary way, we had only had one small gas tax that had \never gone to the general fund. All the rest of the permanent increases, \nlike this particular increase, had gone to the highway or \ntransportation trust funds of our country, which then were dedicated to \nthe building of roads and bridges and transportation infrastructure. As \na result of that, we have an excellent highway and transportation \nsystem, because we have always been smart enough and clear enough in \nour direction as a country to recognize that citizens would be willing \nto pay dedicated taxes to dedicated funds for specific purposes. And \nthat has always largely been true of raises or increases in the fuel or \ngas tax when it was dedicated. I know it has certainly been true in my \nState of Idaho.\n\n  While our citizens are concerned about taxes and believe, as I do, \nthat they are much too high, they have always largely been willing to \nsupport the kind of taxes that were dedicated to a broad, general \npurpose like transportation. And as a result of it, we have had and \nseen built excellent transportation systems.\n  This is different--substantially different. Our President said that \nhe would oppose increasing a gas tax as a candidate in 1992. He said it \nwas regressive and unfair to working families. And he was right. In \nfact, I have a letter here from the International Brotherhood of \nTeamsters, Ron Carey, general president, asking the Senate of the \nUnited States and the Congress to repeal the 4.3-cent tax. The reason \nis exactly the kind of reason I have just given. Not only does it \naffect the working men and women of the Brotherhood of Teamsters, but \nbased on the average trucker purchasing 14,000 gallons per year of \ndiesel fuel, it is estimated that a repeal of the 4.3-cent tax per \ngallon will save trucking companies $600 per vehicle per year--largely \na $600 cost that must be passed through to the goods and services that \nthe trucking industry sends around our country.\n  That, of course, is exactly, I think, the concern that many of us \nhave. Once you start a tax like this, unless it is truly a dedicated \ntax, it simply begins the snowballing effect of being added onto the \ncost of consuming in this country and to the costs that our families \nmust bear up under as they go about their daily lives. Certainly, in \nthe farming and ranching business of my State, where all goods and \nservices must be transported over long distances to get to the home \noperation, this kind of tax increase has a substantial impact upon the \nworking families of my State.\n  It is said that the tax-and-spend attitude of this administration, \nand this tax, coupled with the largest tax increase in history that was \npushed through by a Democrat Congress and by this President several \nyears ago, has destroyed over 1.2 million jobs in our country, and that \nthe cost to the average American family has been $2,600 a year in \nhigher taxes and lower earnings. We have heard of the frustration that \nthe working families of our country have this year, and that the \naverage citizen has, that somehow their wage increases do not translate \ninto greater spendable income. Mr. President, here is one of the \nreasons why. Immediately, they have to pay more\n\n[[Page S4965]]\n\ndollars at the pump on an annual basis, and their cost of living and \nproviding for their families, as a result, goes up. That has clearly \nbeen a part of the reason that we have seen the rather flat growth in \nthe U.S. economy, as a result of the Clinton tax increase. Now I think \nall of us recognize it as truly the Clinton crunch on the working men \nand women of our country.\n\n  In Idaho alone, repeal of this gas tax increase would represent a $32 \nmillion savings to consumers, to people who stop nearly two times a \nweek at the gas pump to fill up because of their long-distance \ncommuting.\n  There is something else that is interesting. I serve, as does the \nPresiding Officer, on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee here \nin the Senate. Just last week, we went through a morning of hearings \nlooking at why we are in the gas price spiral that the consuming public \nis now experiencing, and what it was doing, and whether we could \nanticipate some leveling off of it, and what the general impact is of \nwhat is happening.\n  Here is a chart that came out of that hearing that I thought was most \nsignificant. It begins to explain part of the overall picture of what \nthe average consumer pays for at the gas pump. The real cost of raw \nmaterials is 42 percent of what you pay for at the pump. But the thing \nI found most interesting was this figure over here--that motor fuel \ntaxes represents over 30 percent of every dollar spent at the fuel \npump. That is both State and Federal. You know, Mr. President, I know \nof no other consumer good in our country where within the cost of the \npurchase of that good is built in a 30-percent tax. While I think all \nof us would agree that some of these taxes over the years built into \nthe cost of fuel have been very positive--I have already talked about \nthe roads, bridges, interstate transportation system, and now some of \nthe inner-city rail that is receiving the benefits of this tax--but \nnone of it ever went in a permanent way--I repeat, a permanent way--to \nwelfare, to food stamps, to the general fund expenditures of the \nFederal Government, until President Clinton pushed through this tax a \ncouple of years ago. This tax had always been dedicated to the general \neconomic well-being of our country. By that I mean the constant ability \nto improve the transportation systems that allow the flow of our \neconomy to improve on an aggressive basis. Clearly, our wealth as a \nnation has been our ability to move goods and services at low costs, \nand that is why we were always committed to this kind of a tax.\n  That is why I stood on the floor of the Senate, having opposed this \ntax when it was passed and now supporting its repeal because instead of \nit going into the pool that builds the roads and bridges, it is now \nbeing used in a way where it should not be. And, yet, the American \npeople are led to believe, because of the historic use, that it is part \nof this mix.\n  I think 30 percent of any good in the market going to taxes is \nextremely high, and is in this instance much, much too high.\n  I hope that the Senate will agree with us this week and support a \nfull repeal of the 4.3-cent gas tax.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the \npresident of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         International Brotherhood\n\n\n                                        of Teamsters, AFL-CIO,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: The International Brotherood of Teamsters \n     supports the repeal of the 4.3 cents per gallon gas tax. \n     Almost three-hundred thousand of our members who work in the \n     trucking industry are directly affected by the recent upward \n     spiral of gasoline prices. And, all of our 1.5 million \n     members and their families, as consumers, are paying much \n     higher prices for gas at the pump than a few weeks ago.\n       The trucking industry, in particular the less-than-\n     truckload (LTL) sector, has experienced a severe decline in \n     recent years due to industry overcapacity and the severe \n     erosion of rates. Deregulation of intrastate trucking in \n     January 1995 has produced a wave of discounting as regional \n     carriers expanded aggressively into new shortfall markets, \n     while demand for trucking services softened because of slower \n     economic growth. Those trucking companies hanging on for \n     survival are now experiencing increased costs because of the \n     jump in gas prices at a time when they can least afford it.\n       Based on the average trucker purchasing 14,000 gallons per \n     year of diesel fuel, it is estimated that a repeal of the 4.3 \n     cents per gallon gas tax will save trucking companies $600 \n     per vehicle per year. For many, that means the difference \n     between surviving the current downturn in the industry or \n     going out of business. Teamsters and other truck drivers face \n     a ``double whammy.'' They may not only lose their jobs, but \n     they also suffer from the regressive nature of a gas tax at \n     the pump.\n       While repeal of this gas tax would mean a loss of revenue \n     of over $5 billion a year, the Teamsters offer this \n     solution--put real ``fairness'' back in the tax code. A good \n     first step would be to repeal or modify the oil depletion \n     allowance, which lets oil companies claim tax deductions that \n     are worth more than the cost of their investments. That would \n     more than make up for this shortfall! We urge you to support \n     the repeal of the 4.3 cents per gallon gas tax.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Ron Carey,\n                                                General President.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me close by saying that the billions of \ndollars that the consuming public now pays in the form of this tax--the \n$32.1 million that Idahoans pay--does nothing to improve or stimulate \nthe economy of our country. It is not building a road. It is not \nbuilding a bridge. It is not patching a pothole. It is being spent on \nday-to-day costs of our Government through the general fund. This is \nthe first time in our history that we have done this.\n  It is now time that in a little but most significant way we can drop \nthe price of gas at the pump by repealing this tax and, as importantly, \nrighting the wrong that occurred several years ago when President \nClinton passed this tax through. I hope once we correct this, we will \nsay that never again will we ever put a dedicated fuel tax into the \ngeneral fund of our country, that, if we are going to continue to \nincrease this part of the dollar purchasing pie of the American \nconsumer, when it comes to transportation costs of fuel, that it go to \nserve the transportation needs of our country and to continue to build \nand maintain that infrastructure that has served us so well.\n  Having said those words, I believe it is so important that we respond \nnow and as soon as the Senate can to this issue. I heard from a good \nmany of my constituents who think the Senate is clearly moving in the \nright direction to repeal this tax. I hope we respond this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for his \nvery informative demonstration of the distribution of the cost of \ngasoline. I wonder before he leaves the Chamber if I might borrow the \nletter that he entered into the Record for discussion maybe a little \nbit later on this afternoon.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I am going to yield to my colleague from \nArizona up to 10 minutes on the issue of repeal of the gasoline tax.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Georgia \nfor yielding the time and for bringing us to the floor to talk about \nthis most important matter.\n  In my State of Arizona, people drive long distances, as they do in \nthe State of Idaho. The gas tax, therefore, is a very important matter \nto us. Most Arizonans, by the way, are very much in favor of the repeal \nof this Clinton gas tax.\n  I want to start by quoting from Bill Clinton, who was then a \ncandidate for President. When he ran for office, he said, ``I oppose \nFederal excise gas tax increases.'' Then, of course, about 2\\1/2\\ years \nlater, he included a Federal gasoline excise tax as part of the biggest \ntax increase in the history of this country, which he and the majority \nof the Members of Congress imposed upon our taxpayers.\n\n  The point that I would like to begin with is that, as much as the \nPresident talks about trying to protect the poorer in our society, the \ngasoline tax is a tax that hits the poor the hardest. As a matter of \nfact, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 1987, it shows \nthat the poorest 20 percent of Americans devote 8.8 percent of their \nexpenditures to gasoline and motor oil while the wealthiest 20 percent \ndevote only 3.1 percent of their expenditures to such things.\n  So when we talk about a tax that really hits those who are the \npoorest in\n\n[[Page S4966]]\n\nour society, it is the gasoline tax that stands right up there as one \nof the harshest taxes on the poor. That is one of the reasons why \nRepublicans are so dedicated right now to trying to repeal this 4.3-\ncent gas tax because of the harm that it does to the poorest in our \nsociety.\n  Taxes are a lot like Federal spending programs. They are very \ndifficult to cut, and once they are in place they are almost impossible \nto repeal. Repealing this Clinton gas tax is illustrative of the \nefforts that we have had underway here to change the status quo in \nWashington and to begin to send power back to the people. It is very \nhard to do. But it is a question of whom you trust. Who would you \nrather have spending the money--the people of the country, the \ntaxpayers, or the bureaucrats here in Washington? We believe that \nrepealing this Clinton gas tax of 4.3 cents per gallon is a small but \nnecessary step toward reducing the overall tax burden imposed upon the \nAmerican people. It represents a ratcheting down of the size of the \nGovernment. It reduces taxes and it reduces spending.\n  Mr. President, I want to make the point. Opponents of repealing the \ngas tax said, ``Well, Republicans are just trying to make a political \nissue out of this. It is not very much money,'' to which there are two \nor three answers.\n  First, if it is not very much money, then why are you so concerned \nabout it? Why are you opposing our efforts to repeal the tax if it is \nnot a big deal?\n  Second, if it is not very much money, then we certainly do not have \nto worry about what it does to our efforts to balance the budget. As a \nmatter of fact, we can balance the budget very easily, as I will point \nout in a minute. Our budget for this next year assumes the repeal of \nthe gas tax. We do not need that money to run the Federal Government. \nIt seems to me that there is not a good argument against reducing the--\n--\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield to my friend from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator from Arizona is clarifying a point that I \ndid not mention effectively in the beginning--that, while the majority \nleader's proposal for the repeal is through December, the new budget \nrevision is a permanent repeal, as the Senator just alluded to.\n  Am I not correct?\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator is absolutely correct. According to the budget \nwhich we will be taking up here in the next couple of days, revenues to \nthe Treasury are expected to exceed $1.7 trillion in the 1997 fiscal \nyear. This amount factors in the proposed repeal of the Clinton gas \ntax.\n  I also note that that figure compares to $1.05 trillion collected by \nthe Government just 5 years ago. In other words, Mr. President, the \nTreasury is flush with a 40-percent increase in revenues in just the \nlast 5 years. We hardly need the revenue from this 4.3-cent gas tax.\n  I talked in the beginning about the effect on the State of Arizona \nwhere motorists have to travel fairly large distances to get where they \nare going. I note that in my own State, in the city of Phoenix, for \nexample, the price of regular unleaded gas is now about $1.39 to $1.45 \na gallon. Super is about $1.63 gallon. So clearly this spike in \ngasoline prices is hurting motorists.\n  One thing we can do. The Congress cannot repeal the law of supply and \ndemand. We cannot directly affect the market by what we do. At least, \nwe should not try to. Clearly, the market is working here. But if we \ncan have an effect on the tax burden imposed by the gas tax and reduce \nthat by 4.3 cents, that is an additional savings for the people in my \nState which would certainly help them. It may not be a big deal, as \nsome of the opponents are talking about here, but it does add up.\n  As a matter of fact, I point out that the Heritage Foundation \nrecently estimated that the cost of the Clinton gas tax on a State-by-\nState basis--in this case for the State of Arizona--will result in \nmotorists paying an additional $78 million in 1996. To some opponents \nof the gas tax, $78 million may not seem like a lot of money. But, \nfrankly, to the people of the State of Arizona, $78 million out of \ntheir pockets is a fair amount of money. Repeal will put that much \nmoney back into the pockets of the citizens of Arizona, whom I trust to \nmake better decisions on how to spend that money than I do bureaucrats \nback here in Washington, DC.\n  It was also pointed out by the Senator from Idaho that no part of \nthis 4.3-cent levy goes toward transportation costs, which most \nmotorists think is happening to their money. It goes instead to the \ngeneral fund of the Treasury where the President would like to use it \nto finance additional Government spending rather than to be used for \ndeficit reduction.\n\n  In order to satisfy the President's demand for more spending, \nCongress recently had to add $5 billion to the omnibus appropriations \nbill. Although the additional spending was ostensibly offset by savings \nin other areas, Congress had in fact counted on using much of that \nsavings to implement the balanced budget that it passed last year. \nUsing the offsets to finance the President's additional spending \ninstead will, in effect, make it $5 billion harder to achieve the \nbalanced budget.\n  Mr. President, as I said a moment ago, the real question here is, \nWhom do you trust to spend the money the best? Is it the people who \nearn it, who would like to spend it on their families back home, or is \nit bureaucrats back here in Washington, DC? This money is not being \nused to build more highways. It goes into the general fund where the \nPresident wants to use it to spend more money. I believe, and we \nRepublicans believe, that this is the time and the place to start by \ncutting.\n  For those who say it is not much, I say a long journey starts with \nthe first step. Every little bit will help. If we can cut out this 4.3-\ncent gas tax that was part of the Clinton increase of 2 years ago, No. \n1, it will help reduce the price of gasoline a little bit; No. 2, it \nwill help restore some balance to our budget because we will be cutting \nthe size of Government rather than using this money to spend on \nGovernment programs. And third, and perhaps most importantly, it will \nbegin to further our efforts to put more trust in the American people--\nlet them keep what they earn rather than sending money back here to \nWashington to be spent by Washington bureaucrats.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding this \ntime.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I wish to underscore one more time that \nthe majority leader's amendment to this legislation repeals it through \nDecember 1996 but that the intent is to repeal the 4.3-cent gas tax not \nonly through December but thereafter, which is being shaped, as the new \nPresiding Officer alluded to, through the new budgets that the majority \nwill be bringing forward very shortly.\n  With that, I should like to yield up to 15 minutes to the majority \nwhip, the distinguished Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the distinguished Senator from Georgia for \narranging for us to have this time to talk about the gas tax repeal \nand, frankly, about other opportunities to return taxes to the people \nwho are working and earning those wages and our desire to see them be \nable to keep the fruits of their labor. It is important we have this \ndiscussion this afternoon under the leadership of the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia because there has been a lot of misunderstanding \nand misinformation that has been put out with regard to what we are \ntrying to accomplish.\n  First, let me sum up where we are in terms of considering this issue. \nWhen the Senate resumes consideration this afternoon of the White House \nTravel Office employee reimbursement, the pending amendment will be the \nDole amendment to repeal President Clinton's gas tax increase. There \nhas been a great deal of confusion over exactly what that amendment \ndoes, so let me take a brief moment to explain that.\n  Two weeks ago, Senator Dole proposed that we repeal the 4.3-cent gas \ntax which was implemented by the Congress in 1993. And I emphasize, \nthat was done by the Democrats in the Congress. Not one Republican \nvoted for it because, as has been pointed out by the Senator from \nArizona, we thought it was a mistake to turn what has traditionally \nbeen a user fee going into the\n\n[[Page S4967]]\n\nhighway trust fund into just another tax being put into the deep dark \nhole of the General Treasury, in fact, in my opinion, not really \nreducing the deficit and maybe even contributing to it because, once \nagain, it puts a damper on the ability of people to work and keep their \nown money. Any time you take money in taxes away from people, I think \nit hurts the enterprise of those people to do their job.\n\n  With gasoline costs rising, though, the majority leader proposed to \nhelp Americans by cutting part of the taxes levied back in 1993 on \nAmerican consumers. Last week, many Democrats, including President \nClinton, conceded that they would support this tax rollback. In \nresponse to this, Senator Dole offered an amendment to repeal the gas \ntax as part of a package that included the minimum wage increase and \nthe so-called TEAM Act, which is a bill that would allow employers and \nemployees to work together for more safety and productivity in \nAmerica's workplace.\n  Despite weeks, then, of claiming that all they wanted was a straight \nup-or-down vote on the Kennedy minimum wage amendment, there was an \nobjection offered by Senator Daschle saying that that was not \nsufficient. Even though they would have a straight up-or-down vote on \nthe minimum wage, they did not like it because it was connected to \nthese other very important issues, the repeal of the gas tax and \nallowing us to have cooperation in the workplace. They objected to \nthat.\n  So Senator Dole offered the minority a straight up-or-down vote on \nthe minimum wage, on the gas tax repeal, and on the TEAM Act, and again \nthat was objected to. Now you are talking about obstructionist tactics. \nAs a matter of fact, the majority leader has had to file more cloture \nmotions in this Congress than the other two Congresses combined, the \n102d and 103d. Sixty-three times cloture motions have had to have been \nfiled to cut off filibusters.\n  So now we find ourselves where the people who are saying, yes, we \nthink maybe we will be for a gas tax repeal, they are now filibustering \nthat very issue.\n  As a matter of fact, I have the statistics here now. In the 102d and \n103d Congresses, we had a total of 87 cloture motions. In the 104th \nCongress alone, which has just been 1 year and 4 months, we have \nalready had to file 64 cloture motions to cut off these obstructionist \nefforts to keep us from getting a straight vote on these issues.\n  Why is this happening? Because they now have an outside partner, \noutside of this institution; the President will not allow the Senate to \nwork together to reach a compromise, a fair compromise to move beyond \nthis parliamentary impasse. The Senate's Democrats do not want to vote \non repealing the gas tax if it is in any way combined with these other \nissues. And so they have objected.\n\n  Now we are trying to see if there is some other way that we could \nmove this issue forward.\n  On Thursday, Senator Dole withdrew his original amendment and offered \na new one which now contains the gas tax repeal only. It has been \ndisconnected from the other two issues I have been talking about. The \npending business is the gas tax repeal only. Senator Dole did so to \naccommodate President Clinton and other Members in the Senate who said \nthey wanted to support the gas tax, but they will only do it as a \nseparate bill. So he has now set it up that way.\n  The majority leader further accommodated the President by changing \nthe amendment's offset to use an issue which President Clinton has been \nvery aggressively advocating, and that is the BIF-SAIF issue. It is not \nthe way I would prefer to go, but it is one that has been promoted by \nthe President. The Secretary of the Treasury is sending letters to the \nSenate saying we want to get this done. So now the argument that maybe \nit is not paid for or they did not like the offset, that has even been \naddressed.\n  Now the Senate is scheduled to vote on the gas tax repeal amendment \non Tuesday at 2:15 so that we can get beyond the filibuster and get to \na direct vote. This should not be a partisan vote. The President said \nhe is for it. Many Democrats say they support repeal of the gas tax. \nThe question is, will they vote that way?\n  The national awareness of the direct impact of that 1993 gas tax \nincrease and what it is doing to taxpayers today is affecting this \nissue. That is why it is picking up momentum. President Clinton has \nadmitted that he had raised the people's taxes too much in 1993, with \nhis own words, and he, too, has indicated he would support this \nrollback. So I think it is time that we do it.\n  Now, in a typical Washington, inside-the-beltway mentality, you hear \nvarious and sundry complaints about why we should not repeal this tax. \nThey say, well, it should not have been added to the general Treasury, \nmaybe it should have gone in the highway trust fund, but it will affect \nthe deficit if you take it away. Well, it is paid for. It is offset. It \nwill not contribute to the increase of the deficit directly or \nindirectly. I think, in fact, by repealing that gas tax you will have \nmore revenue coming into the Treasury. But that is the kind of attitude \nyou get: Well, it is not much.\n  As a part of the big 1993 tax increase--$265 billion, the biggest in \nthe history of this country--maybe this is a small amount, but when you \nask the people out in the real world it is not small. First of all, it \nis about $25 billion over the next 6 years, and it affects middle-class \nworking people. I understand that about 23 percent of this gas tax \nrepeal will go to people making under $20,000 a year.\n\n  Mr. President, $35 or $40 a year to a family that is only making \n$20,000 a year, that makes a difference. But it is more than that.\n  Let me just tell you what it means to the poor State that I have the \ngreat honor of representing, the State of Mississippi. As a matter of \nfact, it would reduce the fuel costs for the average Mississippi \nautomobile $38 over the course of a year. But it affects much more than \nthat. Many of the people in my State have their own trucking rigs. They \nhave their own commercial truck. They contract with others but they are \nthe driver and they drive their own truck. For that commercial truck \ndriver in my State it would mean over $766 in a year. That is an \nimpact. Remember, this is not just automobile gas. We are also talking \nabout diesel fuel for farmers, for inland waterways, for jet fuel. By \nthe time you add it all up, once again in my State, the estimated \nrevenue that will be raised in 1996 from this 4.3-cent-per-gallon \nFederal gas tax, it will cost our State $86 million. This is not \ninsignificant. This is a real tax burden on the American people.\n  When you couple it with all the other taxes, again they say it is \nsuch a small part--yes, it is. When you consider Federal taxes, payroll \ntaxes, State income taxes, property taxes, capital gains taxes, \ngasoline taxes, death taxes--there is no end to this. In my State, when \nyou couple the Federal gas tax with the State gas tax you are talking \nabout 36.3 cents per gallon. In other States it is more than that. I \nunderstand the average nationally is 39.9 percent, or something like \nthat--40 cents a gallon in taxes, Federal and State.\n  Also, when you live in California and some other States, gasoline \nprices have gone up to $2 a gallon. If you could roll back a little bit \non the Federal gas tax, maybe a little bit on the State gas tax, you \nwill see this does add up to real money. Plus I do not view this as an \nend-all, of all of our problems--no. This is a first small step. It is \na downpayment. What we need to do is give the people some real tax \nrelief on their payroll taxes. What we need is across-the-board tax \nrelief for the American people who are working and paying all these \ntaxes. What we really need is genuine tax reform. The income tax system \nis the worst possible tax. Then you add on top of that the payroll tax. \nThe working people are really getting hammered.\n  Unfortunately we made a sincere effort last year to get tax relief \nfor the American people and it was vetoed by the President. We tried to \nget $400 per child tax credit for families with children. We tried to \ngive spouses working in the home the opportunity to have an individual \nretirement account. We tried to give an adoption tax credit. It looks \nlike maybe we will get that now that the President signed on board to \nthat. We tried to give relief from the marriage penalty. We tried to \ngive relief to the American workers from the unfairness of the Tax Code \nand also\n\n[[Page S4968]]\n\ntake some action to provide a little growth in the economy with capital \ngains relief.\n\n  We also tried to raise the earnings of our seniors who are retired. \nWhy in the world do we want to make people who are between 65 and 70 \nyears old pay, really, for continuing to work if they make over $11,500 \na year? Of course we have now raised that, thank goodness. We are \ngetting it up to $30,000, and I hope that is a step toward eliminating \nthe penalty on Social Security if you are between 65 and 70 and you \nwant to keep working. You are productive. You want to pay into the \nGeneral Treasury. You make more money and you pay taxes on it.\n  There is a terrible disincentive in America to work hard and be \nproductive so you can provide for your children, for your family, for \nthe needs in your community and in your churches and synagogues. There \nis a mentality in this city that Washington knows best. We will bring \nit to Washington in every form of tax increase known to the minds of \nmen and then we will decide how your children will be taken care of, \nwhat money will go for what education programs.\n  That is wrongheaded. We should begin tomorrow by eliminating this gas \ntax increase. I appreciate this opportunity to address this issue. I \nbelieve the American people are overwhelmingly with us on this issue \nand, as a matter of fact, on overall fairness in the Tax Code and some \nrelief so they can keep more of their money and invest it or save it or \nuse it to help their children in a way that, frankly, will help the \nfuture economy of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the majority whip, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Mississippi, for the contributions he has made to this debate, \nlaying it out, underscoring the pressures that this tax has put on the \nAmerican working family.\n  Just as an aside, the third paragraph of the letter that was referred \nto by the Senator from Idaho a few moments ago is very interesting. It \nhas been printed for the Record but I want to underscore it:\n\n       Based on the average trucker purchasing 14,000 gallons per \n     year of diesel fuel, it is estimated that a repeal of the 4.3 \n     cents per gallon tax will save trucking companies $600 per \n     vehicle per year.\n\n  Across the board--we have been talking about what it means to the \naverage family. We have seen figures from $50-plus to nearly $200 per \nyear that the average working family will save, that will stay in their \nchecking account instead of being sent to the Treasury. But the thing \nwe have not heard a great deal about is that when you lower the cost to \noperate that truck $600 per year, when you lower the cost to operate \nthe sales fleet thousands of dollars, when you lower the cost of every \nform of public transportation--of jet fuel, taxicab gasoline, the \npublic bus--what happens is throughout the economy the costs come down \nso the consumer will ultimately save, not only their own direct costs, \nwhich is what we have heard so much about, but the indirect saving. \nSomewhere down the line the cost of goods is less. It does not cost as \nmuch to ship the jar of peanut butter. So somewhere down the line there \nis a saving that works its way through the entire economic system.\n  We have had a lot of discussion about: This is just a beginning. \nUnfortunately, that is the case. But it is going in the right \ndirection. A few moments ago I said every working family gave their \npaycheck to the Government from January 1 to May 7 and that it was May \n8 before they got to keep their first paycheck. Maybe this repeal will \nstart moving it back towards May 6, keeping in mind that, as far as the \nAmerican people are concerned, we need to move that day all the way \nback to March 1. That is the date. January 1st to March 1 is the period \nof time which every segment of American society is prepared to \ncontribute to the Government for the services they receive. Every day \nafter March 1, March 2, 3, 4, 5--all the way through May 7, the \nAmerican people feel is an excessive burden. And they are right. I am \ngoing to come back to that in just a moment.\n  President Clinton in his book, ``Putting People First,'' declared, \n``I oppose Federal excise gas tax increases.'' Earlier that year, \nreacting to Paul Tsongas, who was also a candidate for President, and \nwho had proposed increasing the gas tax, President Clinton, then \ncandidate Clinton said: ``It sticks it to the lower income and middle \nincome retired people in the country and it is wrong.'' He was right. \nIt is wrong. But then the President was elected and in August of the \nnext year he proposed the largest tax increase in American history, \nwhich included raising gas taxes--diesel fuel, jet fuel--4.3 cents per \ngallon.\n  There was a lot of debate at that time, just like there is right now. \nAll these facts that have been pointed out by all these Senators on the \nfloor were made clear then. But the President sided with those in his \nadministration who wanted very much to impose this new tax increase.\n  This is a statement that I find uniquely interesting:\n\n       ``A buck a week''--\n\n  Mr. President, I want to repeat that.\n\n       ``A buck a week,'' Clinton scoffed at those who suggested \n     he was hurting the very middle class he had promised to help.\n\n  He scoffed at it; it is only a buck a week.\n  I will tell you what, Mr. President, about 2 years ago, the Georgia \nLegislature, responding to a request from the Governor's office, \nimposed a license on auto tags, a new fee. It ranged from $10 to $15 \nper tag. That is $1 a month, not $1 a week; just $1 a month, and we \nalmost had another Boston Tea Party in Georgia. That was repealed very \nquickly. A buck a month.\n  Of course, as we now know, it is not just a buck a week, but say it \nwas. You do not scoff at this, and the reason you do not is because the \nAmerican working family has been pushed to the wall--pushed to the \nwall--in their ability to do those things which we ask them to do.\n  To revisit it, a Georgia working family earns on an average $45,000 a \nyear. They have two parents working and two kids. Their total Federal \ntax on income comes to $9,511. The total State and local tax is $5,234. \nThe estimated cost of Federal regulation to the family--and this is a \nnumber most Americans are not appreciative of--is $6,615.\n  Incidentally, Mr. President, if you add the cost of regulatory \nburdens, you do not really get to keep your paycheck on May 8. That is \njust taxes. You really--and it is a unique date--you really do not get \nto keep your first paycheck until--it is an interesting day--July 4th, \nIndependence Day. That is really the first day when you add on \nregulatory burdens.\n  But this average family, then, in Georgia is basically paying 52 \npercent of their gross income to the government, to regulatory burdens, \nand it is no wonder they have become so anxiety ridden. It is no wonder \nthat they are so worried about fulfilling their responsibilities for \ntheir family, their community and their country.\n  As I said when I began these remarks, Thomas Jefferson, if he were \nhere today, would wonder if we are still free. He would pose the \nquestion: ``Can a country be free when the governments that run it \nconfiscate and take over half the wages of the bread earner?\"\n\n  If you read through Thomas Jefferson's work, he alludes to this \nthroughout his work. It was the nature of government to grow, and it is \nthe nature of government to consume the wages of those who deserve it, \nthose who work for it. He warned us not to do that. This repeal of the \ngas tax is the first step of a long, arduous journey. It is at the core \nof fundamentally sound policy that we begin to return the fruits of \nlabor to those who work for it and that we quit interfering with their \nrights to determine their own priorities for their own family, for \ntheir own dreams.\n  This is an elegant work, Mr. President. It is an allegiance to the \nfounding principles of this country, to the work of Thomas Jefferson, \nAdams, Monroe, and Franklin. They never would have envisioned--ever--\nthat this country would be governed in such a way as to absolutely take \nfrom the bread earner half of what they earned. They would never in \ntheir wildest dreams have imagined that we could come to that kind of \ncondition.\n  In Georgia alone, this fuel tax, which has been described by some on \nthe\n\n[[Page S4969]]\n\nother side of the aisle as inconsequential, removes from the State \nnearly a quarter of a billion dollars. This 4.3 cents takes $168 \nmillion out of the checking accounts of the working families and \nbusinesses in motor fuel. It takes $28.5 million out of the State in \nnew taxes for diesel fuel. It takes $27.5 million out of the State in \njet fuel. It takes it out of those local accounts and moves it to the \nTreasury for an expanding Federal Government.\n  It was wrong when it was imposed. It is a regressive tax, uniquely \nhard on the elderly and the poor. It was appropriated from users to \nexpand Federal spending. It was not even used to make better highways \nand safer highways for the people who use them. It was used to expand \nFederal spending. It hurts the working family, it hurts the economy, \nand it raises costs of all goods, because energy is built into the cost \nof all goods.\n  So, Mr. President, as I said, the American family cannot keep their \nfirst check until May 8. Maybe we can save them a day and give them 1 \nmore day's pay by getting this money back into their checking accounts \nwhere it belongs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/13/senate-section/article/S4961-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   OBSERVANCE OF 1 MINUTE OF SILENCE\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Mr. President, the Los Angeles Times ran an article \ntoday, May 13, 1996, and it is just a stunning article.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, May 13, 1996]\n\n             Drug Runners Arrested at Border Often Go Free\n\n                             (By H.G. Reza)\n\n       San Diego.--During the federal government's yearlong \n     narcotics crackdown along the Southwest border; hundreds of \n     suspected smugglers have been allowed to go free after U.S. \n     authorities arrested them with substantial quantities of \n     drugs at ports of entry in California.\n       In the past year, about 2,300 suspected traffickers were \n     taken into custody for bringing drugs across the border but, \n     according to records and interviews, more than one in four \n     were simply sent home to Mexico because of jail overcrowding \n     and prosecutorial discretion.\n       Two suspects with 32 pounds of methamphetamine, and another \n     with 37,000 Quaalude tablets, were simply ``excluded'' from \n     the United States after their drugs and vehicles were \n     confiscated.\n       The handling of drug cases at the border, most involving at \n     least 50 pounds of marijuana, reflects shifting and sometimes \n     conflicting pressures on the federal law enforcement \n     community.\n       The threshold for prosecutions, drug agents say, has risen \n     as the government has stepped up narcotics interdiction at \n     border crossings and made more seizures. In addition, they \n     say there often is no room for drug suspects at the federal \n     jail here because it is overflowing with people awaiting \n     trial on immigration law violations and other charges.\n       After a seizure of 158 pounds of cocaine, one defendant was \n     cited and released because there was no room at the federal \n     jail, said the woman's attorney. The charges against her were \n     dropped, the attorney added.\n       Officials at the U.S. attorney's office confirm that under \n     a program quietly adopted two years ago, an increasing number \n     of suspected traffickers have been sent back to Mexico \n     without arrest or prosecution in either federal or state \n     court. Instead, they are prohibited from returning to this \n     country pending an immigration hearing.\n       Government figures show that more than 1,000 smuggling \n     suspects have been processed this way since 1994 after \n     seizures by the U.S. Customs Service and the Border Patrol.\n       The number of such cases rose from 215 in 1994 to 636 last \n     year at San Ysidro, Tecate and Otay Mesa. There were 288 \n     cases in the first four months of 1996--and officials project \n     that the total will reach more than 800 for the year.\n       ``This is, in our opinion, a powerful prosecutorial tool,'' \n     Assistant U.S. Atty. John Kramer said in an interview, \n     ``Immigration exclusion cases principally involve first-time \n     offenders who face the sanction of losing permanent residency \n     in the United States or their border crossing cards.''\n       Justice Department and U.S. Customs Service officials have \n     reported unprecedented drug seizures in the first year of \n     Operation Hard Line, an anti-drug program along the entire \n     border with Mexico. Last year, they said, total drug seizures \n     from vehicles, cargo containers and pedestrians at all ports \n     were up 25% over the previous year.\n       ``To the extent that drug seizures are up, there is perhaps \n     the perception that we're not doing more in the prosecuting \n     area [but] more felony cases have been filed than ever \n     before,'' Kramer said.\n       The overall number of felony drug prosecutions originating \n     from border arrests more than doubled in San Diego County, \n     Kramer said, with almost two-thirds prosecuted in state \n     court.\n       The government's ``exclusion policy'' has caused \n     frustration among some Customs inspectors, who are making \n     increasing numbers of seizures. After two Mexican women with \n     32 pounds of methamphetamine and 24 pounds of marijuana were \n     sent back across the border, one inspector wrote in an Aug. \n     13, 1995, report:\n       ``Lack of enforcement is not because inspectors aren't \n     trying. It's because of the policy coming from upstairs.''\n       Anyone caught smuggling drugs, even a single marijuana \n     cigarette, can be charged with a felony offense, carrying a \n     minimum of two years in prison, or a misdemeanor, carrying up \n     to a year in jail.\n       But since the early 1990s, the U.S. attorney's office has \n     struggled with its inability to prosecute all drug cases--\n     especially marijuana cases--because of inadequate resources. \n     Officials previously had set loose guidelines for deciding \n     whether to seek misdemeanor or felony charges, depending on \n     the amount of marijuana.\n       Now, officials say the U.S. Customs Service is operating \n     under guidelines limiting any prosecution--including \n     misdemeanors--to cases involving 125 pounds of marijuana or \n     more.\n       And Mexican nationals who are first-time offenders usually \n     are taken before an immigration judge and given the option of \n     being excluded from the country, pending an immigration \n     appeal, or of being prosecuted. So far, officials said, no \n     one has chosen prosecution.\n       ``Generally prosecution is deferred if the amount is below \n     125 pounds, or if the defendant is a Mexican citizen, or if \n     in the opinion of the prosecutor, it's not a strong case,'' \n     said Jeff Casey, Customs deputy special agent in charge in \n     San Diego.\n       However, Kramer said, suspects who escape prosecution for \n     their first seizure will automatically be charged if they are \n     caught a second time, regardless of the drug type or \n     quantity.\n       U.S. Customs Service records reviewed by The Times show \n     that some smugglers have been caught two or more times--even \n     in the same week--yet still were not jailed or prosecuted. In \n     addition, no action was taken against a number of suspected \n     smugglers captured with more than 125 pounds of marijuana.\n       One 58-year-old U.S. citizen, according to seizure records, \n     was arrested three times this year at the border--in January \n     with 53 pounds of marijuana, in February with 51 pounds and \n     this month with 41 pounds. Although he had a criminal history \n     that stretched back four decades and included an alien \n     smuggling charge, he was not prosecuted for the first two \n     seizures, according to a law enforcement source.\n       In one case that exceeded the threshold, records show that \n     two U.S. citizens arrested Oct. 22, 1995, for smuggling 151 \n     pounds of marijuana were not prosecuted. And neither was a \n     21-year-old U.S. citizen arrested March 16 with 386 pounds of \n     marijuana who had been caught a week earlier with a smaller \n     amount.\n\n[[Page S4970]]\n\n       Citing privacy concerns, the U.S. attorney's office \n     declined to state the reasons why specific cases were not \n     prosecuted.\n       ``If a person is arrested at the border and a case isn't \n     filed, sometimes there are legitimate law enforcement reasons \n     to do that,'' Kramer said. ``The point is, there are a number \n     of reasons other than not wanting to go forward with the \n     case.''\n       Some federal law enforcement officials have complained that \n     lack of jail space has forced them to release drug suspects \n     outright or issue them citations, which are also promises to \n     appear in court.\n       Kramer acknowledged that prosecutors and law enforcement \n     agents are sometimes ``forced to make hard decisions because \n     of a lack of bed space'' at the jail. But, he added, ``If \n     there is a belief that our emphasis on immigration \n     prosecutions has detracted us from felony prosecutions of \n     drug cases, that assumption is incorrect.''\n       One cause of the overcrowding, critics say, is Operation \n     Gatekeeper, a controversial crackdown on illegal immigration \n     that has helped fill the local federal jail.\n       Last week, 49% of the 930 inmates housed at the \n     Metropolitan Correction Center were charged with immigration \n     law violations, while 36% were being held for drug offenses, \n     said a spokeswoman.\n       Mario Conte, head of the Federal Defenders of San Diego \n     Inc., alleged that U.S. Atty. Alan Bersin, the Clinton \n     administration's border czar, is pursuing a tough prosecution \n     policy on illegal immigration to score political points for \n     the White House.\n       ``He's created a crisis by his policy, which has led to \n     overcrowding at [the federal jail],'' said Conte, whose group \n     of attorneys represents indigent defendants in U.S. District \n     Court.\n       Bersin denied that the immigration prosecutions are \n     politically motivated, noting that most of the defendants \n     have previous convictions for serious crimes. ``By targeting \n     people with substantial criminal histories, we have not only \n     helped reduce crime . . . but have stopped targeting economic \n     migrants who were previously filling the jail,'' he said.\n       The jail has an approved capacity of 950 but until recently \n     housed an average of 1,200 inmates each month. To ease \n     overcrowding, officials sent 174 inmates facing immigration \n     charges to Miramar Naval Air Station, where they rioted and \n     burned part of the brig in March.\n       In examining federal court records for 30 of the biggest \n     seizure cases at San Ysidro, The Times found that felony \n     charges are often plea-bargained to misdemeanors, and those \n     convicted seldom do more than six months in jail. Many other \n     cases are settled, with federal attorneys agreeing not to \n     prosecute if the suspect does not commit attention offenses \n     for a year.\n       Customs inspectors and federal drug agents said narcotics \n     rings know that chances are slim that a marijuana courier \n     will be prosecuted. So, they say, traffickers have no trouble \n     recruiting people and paying them $200 to drive small loads \n     of marijuana through the port, time and again.\n       ``There is virtually no risk [to smugglers] as long as they \n     keep quantities down. First of all, the chances of getting \n     caught are slim, and the chances of prosecution are almost \n     zero if you get caught with a small quantity and if you're a \n     Mexican national,'' said a veteran Drug Enforcement \n     Administration agent who requested anonymity.\n       Even when smuggled in small amounts, marijuana generates \n     huge profits for dealers, said the agent. A Jamaican drug \n     ring recently was buying Mexican marijuana in San Diego at \n     $500 per pound--purchasing 20 pounds to 50 pounds at a time--\n     and selling it in Rhode Island for $1,500 a pound, the agent \n     added.\n       Cases are turned over to the district attorney here for \n     prosecution when the suspect or vehicle owner lives in San \n     Diego County, or the drugs are destined for the county. \n     Officials said that in the last two years, 1,462 cases were \n     referred to local prosecutors, compared to 1,030 handled by \n     the federal government.\n       Deputy Dist. Atty. Joan Stein said that in almost every \n     case the defendant pleads guilty to a single felony count. \n     Usually, she said, defendants are first-time offenders and \n     are given light sentences by judges.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The headline reads, ``Drug Runners Arrested at Border \nOften Go Free.''\n\n       Smuggling: Crackdown leads to more seizures, but jail \n     overcrowding and clashing priorities force suspects' release.\n       During the Federal Government's yearlong narcotics \n     crackdown along the Southwest border.\n\n  I know this will be of interest to the Presiding Officer.\n\n     Hundreds of suspected smugglers have been allowed to go free \n     after U.S. authorities arrested them with substantial \n     quantities of drugs at ports of entry in California.\n       In the past year, about 2,300 suspected traffickers were \n     taken into custody for bringing drugs across the border but, \n     according to records and interviews, more than one in four \n     were simply sent home to Mexico because of jail overcrowding. \n     . .\n       Two suspects with 32 pounds of methamphetamine, and another \n     with 37,000 Quaalude tablets, were simply ``excluded'' from \n     the United States after their drugs and vehicles were \n     confiscated.\n       After a seizure of 158 pounds of cocaine, one defendant was \n     cited and released because there was no room at the federal \n     jail, said the women's attorney. The charges against her were \n     dropped, the attorney added.\n\n  Mr. President, it is just one travesty after another.\n\n       One 58-year-old U.S. citizen, according to seizure records, \n     was arrested three times this year at the border--in January \n     with 53 pounds of marijuana, in February with 51 pounds and \n     this month with 41 pounds.\n       Customs inspectors and federal drug agents said narcotic \n     rings know that chances are slim that a marijuana courier \n     will be prosecuted. So, they say, traffickers have no trouble \n     recruiting people and paying them $200 to drive small loads \n     of marijuana through the port, time and again.\n\n  Mr. President, in the last 36 months drug use among our children age \n8 to 13 has doubled--doubled. We are in the midst of a drug epidemic \nthat threatens our youth from Georgia to Arizona to California. The \nfact that this condition is not immediately rectified is deplorable. \nInterdiction has been decimated, and this is the result we get from it. \nInterdiction is a key component, not the only one.\n  We need to be supporting parent and community groups and education \nbecause children today have not had a proper role model. The White \nHouse has been silent on this, and does not think drugs are a problem. \nWe have to turn that around. But we must get this straightened out, Mr. \nPresident.\n  I will be entering remarks in the Record later today. We will \nimmediately begin looking for amendments and funding so that this \ncondition simply will not be tolerated by U.S. authorities on our side \nof the border. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/13/senate-section/article/S4969-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to provide temporary emergency livestock feed \nassistance for certain producers, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n     The Temporary Emergency Livestock Feed Assistance Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, my home State of New Mexico is currently \nexperiencing a very severe drought, as is much of the Southwest. As \nwith any drought, many of my State's citizens are experiencing severe \nhardships.\n  Saturday, 2 days ago, I saw what fire had done to the Carson National \nForest in my State. This is one of several major fires that New Mexico \nhas experienced this year. The fire in the Carson National Forest was \ndesignated the Hondo fire. To date, over 20,000 acres have burned in \nour State. People have been burned out of their homes, Bandelier \nNational Monument, Questa, Red River, NM, have all had their existence \nthreatened, and the community of La Lama in northern New Mexico has \nbeen utterly destroyed.\n  The size of these fires can be directly attributed to the lack of \nrain in our State for a very long period of time. And if the current \nweather conditions continue and no relief is in sight, the rest of this \nyear will be tense and dangerous.\n  Mr. President, I am here today to talk about another danger that is \nposed by this same lack of rain, and it is a threat to the finances and \nthe livelihood of those who depend on the rain to make the grass that \nfeeds their herds.\n  The bill that I am introducing today along with my cosponsors, \nSenator Domenici and Senator Daschle, is entitled the ``Temporary \nEmergency Livestock Feed Assistance Act of 1996.'' It is intended to \nhelp those ranchers who otherwise cannot afford to feed their cattle \nduring this time of drought. With terrible range conditions, the \noptions available to a rancher have become very limited.\n  The rancher can either buy feed or he can sell the livestock that he \nowns at market prices. Neither option is very desirable at this time. \nFeed prices are extremely high, and cattle prices are the lowest that \nthey have been for over a decade. The situation places the rancher in \ndire straits. In Lea County in southeastern New Mexico, ranchers \nusually budget about $125 to raise a cow. Now the cost has risen to \nabout $250 to $300 per head because of the high cost of feed.\n  In Curry County on the eastern side of New Mexico, the local paper \nreported that winter wheat crop faces an 80 to 90 percent loss. That \ncrop is usually about 2.5 million bushels that are harvested. All parts \nof New Mexico are suffering. For the third year in a row, we have had \nless than our average rainfall in the northwest part of the State. Near \nWindow Rock, AZ, we had 2.1 inches of precipitation during the period \nfrom October to March, the driest for that period since the year 1904. \nIn the western part of our State, in Quay County, we have reported much \nless than average amounts of rainfall. In the south, Las Cruces usually \nreceives about 8.5 inches a year, which I know would be a drought for \nmost parts of the country even if we were to receive that, but for the \npast 3 years Las Cruces has consistently received less than that \namount.\n\n[[Page S4973]]\n\n  This bill, this Temporary Emergency Livestock Feed Assistance Act of \n1996, is not meant to be a permanent solution to the current problem. \nThe bill revives the livestock feed program for a 1-year period. That \nis 1996. The program was suspended in the recently enacted farm bill. \nUnder the provisions of this act, those who raise cattle or sheep or \ngoats would be eligible for assistance.\n  Funding for the old program was through the Commodity Credit \nCorporation, and this bill changes that funding mechanism. It restricts \nthe program to $18 million, specifically identifies a fund that already \nhas 1996 appropriations dedicated to it.\n  If market conditions remain, the funds that are targeted for use by \nthis particular bill we are introducing today will otherwise remain \nunspent at the end of the fiscal year. So given the current crisis, it \nis clear to me that this money will be best utilized in helping the \nranchers to survive the situation they face.\n  Several provisions have been placed into the bill to ensure against \nabuses of the program. For example, a rancher will have to have owned \nor leased the livestock for at least 180 days. If the rancher has not \nowned or leased the livestock for the required time, there are certain \nexceptions that the Secretary of Agriculture will have to approve. This \nwill ensure that additional livestock are not purchased for the sole \npurpose of benefiting from this program we are proposing to enact.\n  Also, there is language that allows the Secretary to determine the \nquantities of forage sufficient to maintain livestock, based on the \nnormal carrying capacity of the land. This language is intended to \ndiscourage a person from overstocking the land above the carrying \ncapacity and receiving assistance for that effort. This will help to \nensure that long-term damage to the land does not occur.\n  Another important provision concerns the commodities reserve program. \nThe bill asks the Secretary to examine using the Department's millions \nof bushels of stored grain for the emergency that we now face. The \nSecretary is asked to report back to Congress within 30 days of \nenactment of this bill. If the reserve can be used, the ranchers will \nbe able to receive grain at lower than market prices.\n\n  After examining the facts, I am confident that my colleagues here in \nCongress will agree that the current emergency situation demands \nimmediate action. This legislation extends the program--for only 1 \nyear--that was suspended permanently by the farm bill. Consistently in \ntimes of need, the rancher has turned to this program. Clearly, \nranchers are in need of this program one more time.\n  The reintroduction of this program will not dramatically alter the \nbudget that was agreed upon in the farm bill. Instead, this legislation \nwill spend funds that have already been appropriated for fiscal year \n1996 and in all likelihood will go unspent this year if this bill is \nnot enacted.\n  Mr. President, a former Member of this Senate and a former President, \nHarry Truman, used to state that the facts should determine the \nconclusion that we reach. In this matter, the severe conditions of the \ndrought warrant immediate action by Congress. I urge serious \nconsideration of this legislation and expeditious passage of this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1744. A bill to permit duty free treatment for certain structures, \nparts, and components used in the Gemini telescope project; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                the gemini telescope project act of 1996\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nis of great importance to the entire international scientific community \nand to the State of Hawaii. This legislation grants tariff relief to \nthe Gemini project, an international astronomical project.\n  The Gemini project, which is run by the Association of Universities \nfor Research in Astronomy [AURA] on behalf of the National Science \nFoundation [NSF] and several foreign nations, consists of two 8-meter \noptical telescopes to be constructed over the next few years on Mauna \nKea, HI, and on Cerro Pachon, Chile.\n  AURA is a private, nonprofit consortium of United States and foreign \naffiliated education and other nonprofit institutions that operate \nseveral world-class astronomical observatories throughout the world. \nThe Gemini project is an international partnership and draws funding \nfrom the Governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, \nChile, Argentina, and Brazil. Fifty percent of the project's cost is \nborne by the United States and 50 percent by the project's foreign \npartners.\n  Because of the international cooperation involved in the Gemini \nproject, the specific partner countries have been assigned work \npackages and bids for components of the telescope have been requested \nfrom both United States and international suppliers. For example, \nCorning Glass Works in New York produced the 8-meter mirrors required \nfor the telescopes and then shipped them to France for polishing. Once \nthis polishing is completed, the mirrors will be sent to Hawaii for \ninstallation.\n  Gemini's international cooperation is a model for major scientific \nprojects in the future. We all realize that we must reduce the Federal \ndeficit, and that will mean belt-tightening across Government. The \nGemini model offers an innovative way to do significant scientific \nresearch in such a climate because the United States and its \ninternational partners share the cost of construction, and, in turn, \nbenefit by shared use of the telescopes once they are constructed.\n  However, this international cooperation has presented a problem for \nAURA. Although all non-U.S. partner countries have already waived all \ntaxes and duties related to the Gemini project, the U.S. Customs \nService has initially ruled that the mirror is subject to duties upon \nreentry into the United States. The Customs Service classifies the \nmirror as a component of the telescope. This initial ruling appears to \nnegate the terms of the ``Florence Agreement,'' an international trade \nagreement from the 1950's which permits scientific instruments duty-\nfree entry when used by a nonprofit organization.\n  The customs duties for the importation of all Gemini project, \ncomponents basically means that one Federal Government agency--the \nNSF--will end up paying another Federal Government agency--the U.S. \nCustoms Service--for an import duty which, I believe, clearly violates \nthe terms of the ``Florence Agreement.''\n  Not only will the Customs Service's tariff ruling cause a problem \nwith cost and schedule for the Gemini project, but it will also \nthreaten future international scientific collaborations because of the \npotential problem it poses to such a project's cost. It would appear \nthat as these international partnerships become more crucial in this \nera of ever-tightening budgets, the Customs Service's position will \nundermine the viability of these kinds of scientific arrangements.\n   Mr. President, I am pleased to advise my colleagues that there is a \nstrong precedent for the Congress to enact legislation that would \nprovide relief for the Gemini project. In the Omnibus Trade and \nCompetitiveness Act of 1988--Public Law 100-418, the Congress agreed \nwith the same arguments I have described here today and provided tariff \nrelief for the W.M. Keck Observatory project administered by the \nCalifornia Association for Research in Astronomy. This legislation is \ncomparable in scope to the 1988 provision, except for the fact that the \nKeck Observatory was a privately funded telescope whereas the Gemini \nproject carries an official designation as a U.S.-owned and operated \nfacility.\n  Time is critical to the successful completion of the Gemini project. \nKey components of the telescope are scheduled for arrival in the United \nStates early next year, and it does not appear that the U.S. Customs \nService will provide any specific relief for the Gemini project. As a \nresult, this legislation is vital to avoiding serious cost or schedule \ndisruption to the Gemini Program.\n  I urge my colleagues on the Finance Committee to take up this \nimportant legislation at the earliest possible opportunity so that the \nGemini project may proceed on schedule and within budget.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S4974]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1744\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to permit the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nreorganize the Veterans Health Administration notwithstanding the \nnotice and wait requirements of section 510 of title 38, United States \nCode, and to amend title 38, United States Code, to facilitate the \norganization of the headquarters of the Veterans Health Administration; \nto the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                         VETERANS' LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, as chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I have today introduced, at the request of the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs, S. 1748, a bill to facilitate the \nreorganization of the headquarters of the Veterans Health \nAdministration [VHA], Department of Veterans Affairs. The Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs submitted this legislation to the President of the \nSenate by letter dated June 22, 1995. That letter was referred to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs on July 20, 1995.\n  This measure, Mr. President, also requests that the Congress \nauthorize a VHA reorganization notwithstanding the notice and wait \nprovisions of section 510 of title 38, United States Code. By the time \nthat this request had been referred to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, July 20, 1995, the waiting period specified under section 510 \nof title 38, United States Code, had nearly expired and, thus, those \nprovisions were, for practical purposes, moot at the time the committee \nreceived this request. Nonetheless, I have introduced this bill in its \nentirety today since it contains provisions which are not related \ndirectly to the reorganization which is now being implemented.\n  My introduction of this measure is in keeping with the policy which I \nhave adopted of generally introducing--so that there will be specific \nbills to which my colleagues and others may direct their attention and \ncomments--all Administration-proposed draft legislation referred to the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. Thus, I reserve the right to support or \noppose the provisions of, as well as any amendment to, this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record, together with the transmittal letter and the \nenclosed analysis of the draft legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1748\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this Act \n     an amendment is expressed in terms of an amendment to a \n     section or other provision, the reference shall be considered \n     to be made to a section or other provision of title 38, \n     United States Code.\n       Sec. 2. (a) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may proceed \n     with the reorganization described in subsection (b) of this \n     section without regard to section 510 of title 38, United \n     States Code.\n       (b) The administrative reorganization referred to in \n     subsection (a) is the reorganization of the Veterans Health \n     Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs as that \n     reorganization and related activity are described in a letter \n     dated March 17, 1995, and the detailed plan and justification \n     enclosed therewith, submitted by the Secretary to the \n     Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives pursuant to section 510 of title 38, \n     United States Code.\n       Sec. 3. Section 7305 is amended to read as follows:\n       ``The Veterans Health Administration shall include the \n     Office of the Under Secretary for Health and such \n     professional and auxiliary services as the Secretary may find \n     to be necessary to carry out the functions of the \n     Administration.''.\n       Sec. 4. Section 7306 is amended--\n       (a) in subsection (a)--\n       (1) by striking ``and who shall be a qualified doctor of \n     medicine'' in paragraph (2);\n       (2) by striking paragraphs (5) and (6) and redesignating \n     paragraphs (7), (8), and (9) as paragraphs (5), (6), and (7).\n       (b) by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:\n       ``(b) Of the Assistant Under Secretaries for Health \n     appointed under subsection (a)(3), not more than two may be \n     persons qualified in the administration of health services \n     who are not doctors of medicine, dental surgery, or dental \n     medicines.''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                            The Secretary of Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                        Washington, June 22, 1995.\n     Hon. Al Gore,\n     President of the Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: There is transmitted herewith a draft \n     bill, ``To permit the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \n     reorganize the Veterans Health Administration notwithstanding \n     the notice and wait requirements of section 510 of title 38, \n     United States Code, and to amend title 38, United States \n     Code, to facilitate the reorganization of the headquarters of \n     the Veterans Health Administration.'' We request that it be \n     referred to the appropriate committee for prompt \n     consideration and enactment.\n       The draft bill contains several provisions intended to \n     assist VA in its reorganization of the Veterans Health \n     Administration (VHA). The first provision would waive the \n     waiting period otherwise required by 38 U.S.C. Sec. 510 for \n     the planned VHA reorganization which the Department reported \n     to its oversight committees on March 17, 1995. Enactment \n     would permit the Department to begin implementing the \n     reorganization immediately, and would assist the Under \n     Secretary for Health to more rapidly achieve the improvements \n     and advantages of that plan, as discussed extensively in our \n     report. By sending a signal of Congressional support for this \n     new direction for the VA health-care system, enactment would \n     give strong impetus to implementation of the plan, and would \n     assist the Under Secretary to achieve the ``culture change'' \n     within VHA which is essential to fully realize its benefits.\n       The other provisions in the draft bill are aimed at \n     facilitating the reorganization of VHA's headquarters. The \n     current centralized management model for VHA, which is in \n     part required by statute, impedes the system's ability to \n     adapt to the rapidly changing health-care environment. The \n     statutory structure limits the Department's flexibility to \n     establish functions and offices in the \n     organizational structure that are most necessary, and that \n     are located in the geographic setting that best supports \n     the goals of the health-care system.\n       To enhance organizational flexibility in VHA headquarters, \n     the draft bill would eliminate the statutory requirement that \n     VHA have a centralized Medical Service, Dental Service, \n     Podiatric Service, Optometric Service, and Nursing Service. \n     It would also eliminate a legal requirement that VHA have \n     Directors for each of those services. The bill would \n     additionally eliminate statutory requirements that VHA have \n     an Assistant Under Secretary for Health who is a dentist, and \n     an Assistant Under Secretary for Health with expertise and \n     training in geriatrics. The Department does not plan to \n     eliminate the functions of those offices and positions. \n     Rather, the Department seeks the flexibility to determine \n     which office and which position in the organization can best \n     provide management direction to assure that those functions \n     are appropriately carried out.\n       As a final matter, the draft bill would eliminate the \n     requirement that the Associate Deputy Under Secretary for \n     Health be a doctor of medicine. That change would provide the \n     Veterans Health Administration with greater management \n     flexibility by allowing the appointment to that position of \n     an individual whose training and experience may be primarily \n     in management, budgeting, or some other administrative area, \n     rather than in medicine.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program to the submission of this legislative proposal to the \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Jesse Brown.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 2 would waive the notice and wait requirements of \n     38 U.S.C. Sec. 510 with respect\n\n[[Page S4975]]\n\n     to an administrative reorganization of the Veterans Health \n     Administration. The reorganization is one described in a \n     letter dated March 17, 1995, and the detailed plan and \n     justification enclosed therewith, submitted by the Secretary \n     to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives pursuant to section 510 of title 38, \n     United States Code.\n       Section 3 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 7305 to delete the \n     current statutory requirement that the Veterans Health \n     Administration include a centralized Medical Service, Dental \n     Service, Podiatric Service, Optometric Service, and Nursing \n     Service. It would provide the Administration with greater \n     flexibility to provide the functions those services now \n     provide in the most appropriate setting and geographic \n     location.\n       Section 4 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 7306. It would first \n     eliminate the legal requirement that the Veterans Health \n     Administration have Directors for each of the services \n     deleted from 38 U.S.C. Sec. 7305 by section 3 of the draft \n     bill. Section 4 would also eliminate a requirement in section \n     7306 that the Veterans Health Administration have an \n     Assistant Under Secretary for Health who is a dentist, and an \n     Assistant Under Secretary for Health with expertise and \n     training in geriatrics. Finally, section 4 would delete the \n     requirement in section 7306 that the Associate Deputy Under \n     Secretary for Health be a doctor of medicine. The proposed \n     amendments would all facilitate reorganization of the \n     headquarters of the Veterans Health Administration.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMPSON (by request):\n  S. 1749.

These proposed \n     changes are a result of the Department's Office of \n     Construction Management's restructuring its design activities \n     to follow those used by private industry.\n       This proposal will not result in any additional costs to, \n     or savings for, the Department.

We request that it be referred to \n     the appropriate committee for prompt consideration and \n     enactment.\n       Typically, residents and interns are trained at a number of \n     medical institutions and each institution is individually \n     responsible for paying the residents and interns\n\n[[Page S4976]]\n\n     serving there. As a result, residents and interns often \n     receive differing levels of pay and fringe benefits from \n     institution to institution, which sometimes creates confusion \n     and morale problems. Under disbursement agreements, medical \n     institutions that participate in training residents and \n     interns designate one institution to pay all residents and \n     interns a set amount. Thus, pay and fringe benefits do not \n     change when residents and interns rotate among participating \n     institutions.\n       The enclosed draft bill would authorize VA to enter into \n     disbursement agreements with participating medical \n     institutions for the centralized administration of pay and \n     other employee benefits to residents and interns training at \n     any Department facility providing hospital care or medical \n     services. Section 7406(c) of title 38, United States Code, \n     currently provides for such agreements only ``for the period \n     that such intern or resident serves in a Department \n     hospital.'' The law does not authorize VA to enter into such \n     agreements to provide pay and fringe benefits for residents \n     and interns serving in VA outpatient clinics, nursing homes \n     or other VA medical facilities.\n       This draft bill would allow VA facilities which are not \n     hospitals, such as outpatient clinics and nursing homes, to \n     receive the cost saving and other benefits provided by \n     disbursement agreements. These facilities are an increasingly \n     important component of the VA health care delivery system. \n     With greater emphasis being placed on primary care, the \n     training of residents and interns takes place in nonhospital \n     settings such as outpatient clinics and nursing homes. This \n     draft bill is particularly important in the case of two of \n     our hospitals in California (Martinez and Sepulveda) which, \n     due to earthquakes, have been modified into clinics. Both \n     facilities have had long-standing academic affiliates and \n     residency training programs with disbursement agreements. \n     There are not costs to VA associated with this draft bill.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program to the submission of this legislative proposal to the \n     Congress.\n       Sincerely yours,\n     Jesse Brown.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                       Analysis of Proposed Bill\n\n       The bill would expand VA authority to enter into \n     disbursement agreements with participating medical \n     institutions for the central administration of pay and other \n     employee benefits for residents and interns who train at \n     Department facilities. Currently, the law authorizes the use \n     of disbursement agreements only for residents and interns \n     serving in Department hospitals, but not those serving in \n     outpatient clinics, nursing homes or other Department medical \n     facilities. The bill would eliminate this restriction and \n     provide authority for VA to enter into disbursement \n     agreements for the central administration of pay and other \n     employee benefits for interns and residents serving in any \n     Department facility providing hospital care or medical \n     services, including outpatient clinics and nursing \n     homes.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMPSON (by request):\n  S. 1751.

Albert Gore,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Transmitted herewith is a draft bill to \n     amend title 38, United States Code, to revise the procedures \n     for providing claimants and their representatives with copies \n     of Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) decisions and to \n     protect the right of claimants to appoint veterans service \n     organizations as their representatives in claims before the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This legislation would \n     permit the Board to provide copies of its appellate decisions \n     to claimants' representatives reasonably and efficiently. It \n     would also permit VA to continue a longstanding method of \n     claimant representation which has proven efficient and \n     beneficial to claimants. I request that this draft bill be \n     referred to the appropriate committee for prompt \n     consideration and enactment.\n\n\n                 provision of copies of board decisions\n\n       Section 7104(e) of title 38, United States Code, specifies \n     that ``the Board shall promptly mail a copy of its written \n     decision to the claimant and the claimant's authorized \n     representative (if any).'' In the past, the Board's method of \n     representative (if any).'' In the past, the Board's method of \n     ``mailing'' a copy of a decision to a representative depended \n     on where the representative was located. For a representative \n     at the Board's offices in Washington, D.C., a contractor \n     hand-delivered the Board decision to the representative. For \n     a representative at a VA regional office, the Board gave the \n     decision to the contractor, who ``bundled'' mail for the 58 \n     VA regional offices and delivered the bundles to the United \n     States Postal Service. After the United States Postal Service \n     delivered the bundles to the VA regional offices, each \n     regional office sorted its bundled mail and distributed any \n     Board decision to the appropriate representative at that \n     regional office. For a representative not at an office at a \n     VA facility, the Board mailed its decision directly to the \n     representative.\n       This past practice made sense considering the number of \n     Board decisions and the number of representatives who have \n     offices at VA facilities. The Board decides more than 25,000 \n     cases per year. In more than 85 percent of those cases, one \n     of the various veterans service organizations represents the \n     claimant. Often, as authorized by 38 U.S.C. Sec. 5902(a)(2), \n     the service organization occupies free office space in either \n     a VA regional office or at the Board's offices in Washington, \n     D.C. Thus, the\n\n[[Page S4977]]\n\n     Board's past practice of distributing decisions to \n     representatives was flexible and efficient.\n       This past practice, however, was invalidated by the Court \n     of Veterans Appeals. In Trammell v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 181 \n     (1994), the Court of Veterans Appeals held that an apparently \n     late notice of appeal was timely filed because the Board's \n     decision-distribution procedure did not accord with 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 7104(e). In Davis v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 298 (1995), the \n     court held that the phrase ``the Board shall promptly mail'' \n     in section 7104(e) means that the Board decision ``must be \n     correctly addressed, stamped with the proper postage, and \n     delivered directly by the [Board] into the custody of the \n     U.S. Postal Service.'' Id. at 303. The court then concluded \n     that the apparently late notice of appeal in Davis was timely \n     filed. Id. at 304.\n       The court's interpretation of section 7104(e) creates \n     problems with logistical solutions the Board has developed \n     over the years to provide representatives with copies of its \n     decisions. Indeed, it leads to some absurd results. For \n     example, instead of a Board employee (or a contractor) simply \n     walking down the hall to deliver a Board decision to a \n     service organization representative on the same floor, now \n     the employee, not a contractor, must place the decision in an \n     envelope, affix proper postage, and deliver it directly into \n     the United States Postal Service's custody. We understand \n     that the Postal Service takes this mail to Maryland for \n     sorting, then returns it to the District of Columbia for \n     delivery. The Postal Service delivers VA mail to the VA \n     building across the street from the Board's offices, where a \n     contractor sorts it for international delivery. The \n     contractor must then carry the Board decision across the \n     street to the building housing the Board and the service \n     organization representative and deliver it to the \n     representative.\n       The Board should be permitted to provide representatives \n     with copies of its decisions sensibly. Thus, we propose this \n     legislation to permit the Board to ``send'' its decisions to \n     claimants and their representatives by any means reasonably \n     calculated to provide them with a copy of the decision within \n     the same time a copy of the decision sent by first-class mail \n     would be expected to reach them.\n       Section 1(b) of this draft bill would also make a \n     corresponding change to 38 U.S.C. Sec. 7266(a)(1), which \n     currently provides that, to obtain review by the Court of \n     Veterans Appeals, a person adversely affected by a final \n     Board decision must file a notice of appeal within 120 days \n     after the date on which notice of the decision is mailed \n     pursuant to section 7104(e). Our proposed amendment would \n     require that a notice of appeal be filed within 120 days \n     after the date on which notice of the Board decision is sent \n     pursuant to section 7104(e) to the representative or, if \n     none, to the claimant.\n\n\n    appointment of a veterans service organization as a claimant's \n                             representative\n\n       Current law authorizes the Secretary to recognize \n     individuals to prepare, present, and prosecute claims for VA \n     benefits on behalf of claimants. Section 5904(a) of title 38, \n     United States Code, authorizes the Secretary to recognize any \n     individual as an agent or attorney for the preparation, \n     presentation, and prosecution of VA benefit claims. Section \n     5903 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes the \n     Secretary to recognize any individual for the preparation, \n     presentation, and prosecution of any particular VA benefit \n     claim. In addition, section 5902(a)(1) of title 38, United \n     States Code, authorizes the Secretary to recognize \n     representatives of certain veterans service organizations in \n     the preparation, presentation, and prosecution of VA benefit \n     claims.\n       With respect to representatives of veterans service \n     organizations, VA's policy and practice has been to recognize \n     any accredited representative of an approved service \n     organization if a claimant files a power of attorney in favor \n     of the organization itself, a specific office of the \n     organization, or a particular representative of the \n     organization. This practice affords several advantages. \n     First, it allows different representatives of an organization \n     to handle a particular claim at different stages of the \n     claim, without the claimant having to file a separate power \n     of attorney for each representative. For example, a \n     representative of an organization at a VA field office can \n     prosecute a claim there and initiate an appeal. Another \n     representative of the same organization at the organization's \n     national office can then argue the claim on appeal before the \n     Board in Washington, D.C. Second, it allows different \n     representatives of the organization to handle a particular \n     claim at different locations and times, without the claimant \n     having to file another power of attorney. For example, if a \n     claimant moves from New York to Los Angeles while his or her \n     claim is pending, a representative of an organization at a \n     local office in New York can initially handle the claim \n     there, and another representative of the organization at a \n     local office in Los Angeles can subsequently pursue the claim \n     at the location. Similarly, a second representative of an \n     organization can assume responsibility for the prosecution of \n     a claim if the original representative of that organization \n     moves, becomes incapacitated, or leaves the organization. \n     Third, the practice allows VA to notify a claimant's \n     representative in a manner best suited to assure notice is \n     received. For example, the Board can mail a copy of its \n     decision to a representative of a given organization in \n     Washington, D.C., as well as to a local representative at a \n     field station, thereby doubling the likelihood that the \n     claimant's representative will actually receive notice.\n       Cases pending before or recently decided by the Court of \n     Veterans Appeals are imperiling VA's longstanding practice of \n     recognizing any accredited representative of a veterans \n     service organization in a particular claim. In Leo v. Brown, \n     U.S. Vet. App. No. 93-844 (June 16, 1995), the court again \n     held that an apparently late notice of appeal was timely \n     filed because the Board's decision-distribution procedure did \n     not accord with 39 U.S.C. Sec. 7104(e). In this case, the \n     claimant executed a power of attorney in which, in the \n     space for designation of a representative, he entered the \n     American Legion and the address of the Greenville, South \n     Carolina, Veterans Affairs Office, where the American \n     Legion had a local representative. The Greenville office \n     stated that it had no record of having received a copy of \n     the Board's decision on the veteran's claim. The court \n     ruled that actual receipt of a copy of the decision by the \n     American Legion's national office in Washington, D.C., did \n     not cure the failure to mail a copy to the claimant's \n     designated representative, ``i.e., the Greenville, South \n     Carolina, office.''\n       Based on inquiries from the court in cases currently \n     pending, we are concerned that the court may go further and \n     hold that, based on the plain meaning of 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 5902(A)(1), a claimant may appoint only an individual, \n     not an organization, to prepare, present, and prosecute a \n     claim before VA on the claimant's behalf. Such a holding \n     would play havoc with the traditional role of veterans \n     service organizations in the claim process and inject \n     additional technical demands into that process. If a claimant \n     could appoint only an individual, the claimant would have to \n     file another power of attorney each time it became necessary \n     or expedient for another accredited representative to assist \n     with his or her claim. VA could not allow another \n     representative of the same organization access to the \n     claimant's files or mail another representative a copy of a \n     Board decision without risking violation of the Privacy Act. \n     Under the Leo decision, similar problems would frequently \n     arise in the cases of claimants who designate a particular \n     office of an organization on their power-of-attorney forms.\n       A recent survey at the Board showed that 79 percent of \n     appellants who designated a veterans service organization on \n     their power-of-attorney form (which, as noted above, occurs \n     in more than 85 percent of the 25,000 cases that pass through \n     the Board each year) designated only the organization, not a \n     specific office or an individual representative of the \n     organization. Thus, if the court were to invalidate VA's \n     practice of recognizing organizations rather than \n     individuals, it would cast doubt on the validity and meaning \n     of nearly 16,800 powers of attorney in cases coming before \n     the Board alone over one year. It would delay decisions on \n     numerous claims while VA tried to clarify what individual \n     representative, if any, each appellant wanted to represent \n     him or her.\n       The impact on the Compensation and Pension Service (C) \n     would be even greater. Last year, C completed action on \n     2,127,265 compensation and pension claims. As of December 31, \n     1994, national veterans service organizations represented \n     approximately 36 percent of the beneficiaries receiving \n     monthly compensation or pension payments from C It would \n     be fair to conclude that veterans service organizations \n     represented approximately 36 percent of the compensation or \n     pension claimants whose cases were handled in 1994. Although \n     C does not have statistics on the number of claimants who \n     designate only an organization (as opposed to a specific \n     office or recognized representative of an organization), let \n     us assume that, as at the Board, approximately 79 percent of \n     claimants represented by service organizations designated \n     only an organization on their powers of attorney. Thus, an \n     ``individuals only'' holding by the court would cast doubt on \n     the validity and meaning of nearly 605,000 powers of attorney \n     coming before C during one year.\n       An ``individuals only'' rule would require extensive and \n     costly reprogramming of the Veterans Benefits \n     Administration's (VBA) automated data processing system and \n     greatly increase VBA's annual postage costs. In connection \n     with claim development, award notification, and routine \n     communications concerning awards, VBA's regional offices \n     annually produce more than 3 million letters for veterans \n     service organizations representing claimants or \n     beneficiaries. Currently, the Hines, Illinois, computer \n     center prepares and mails one copy of each letter to the \n     claimant or beneficiary and ships three copies to the \n     appropriate regional office, where one copy is filed in the \n     claim folder and two are delivered through internal mail to \n     the organization. If required to notify individual \n     representatives of organizations by mail, VBA would have to \n     reprogram the computer system and, most likely, mail the \n     representatives' copies from Hines. Postage costs alone could \n     approach $1 million annually. We think that such a \n     procedure would waste limited resources, particularly \n     since the current procedure provides an efficient means of \n     notifying organizations.\n       An ``individuals only'' rule would also probably force VBA \n     to curtail or eliminate veterans service organizations' \n     access to veterans' computer records. Currently, an \n     accredited representative of an organization may access the \n     records of any veteran represented by that organization. \n     Under an ``individuals only'' system, however, VBA would\n\n[[Page S4978]]\n\n     have to restrict a representative's access to only the files \n     of those veterans whose powers of attorney designate that \n     representative. The cost of establishing appropriate security \n     for the computer files in a system that includes over 6,000 \n     individual representatives would probably be too great to \n     justify continued access to the records. The Board would also \n     face a similar problem with access it provides veterans \n     service organizations to its computer records.\n       Section 2 of the draft bill would address these problems. \n     Section 2(a) would authorize the Secretary to treat a power \n     of attorney naming an organization, a specific office of an \n     organization, or a recognized representative of an \n     organization as an appointment of the entire organization, \n     unless the claimant specifically indicated his or her desire \n     to appoint only a recognized representative of the \n     organization. Under this amendment, whether a claimant's \n     power of attorney is executed in favor of an approved \n     organization, a local office of that organization, or an \n     individual representative of the organization, the claimant \n     could rest assured of the assistance of an accredited \n     representative of the organization at every stage of the \n     claim or appeal before VA, regardless of location or the \n     inability of a particular individual to continue \n     representation, without having to file additional powers of \n     attorney.\n       Section 2(a) of the draft bill would also require the \n     Secretary, when required or permitted to notify a claimant's \n     representative, and when the claimant has in effect appointed \n     a veterans service organization as representative, to notify \n     the organization at the address designated by the \n     organization for the purpose of receiving each kind of \n     notification.\n       Under section 2(b) of the draft bill, the amendments made \n     by section 2(a) would apply to any power of attorney filed \n     with VA regardless of the date of its execution.\n\n\n                           costs and savings\n\n       We estimate that the savings from enactment of the \n     provision authorizing the sending of Board decisions would be \n     insignificant, i.e., administrative savings of less than \n     $100,000 per year. Depending on how the Court of Veterans \n     Appeals interprets current 38 U.S.C. Sec. 5902(a), enactment \n     of the provision regarding the appointment of veterans \n     service organizations as claimants' representatives could \n     result in cost avoidance in excess of $1 million annually.\n       We have been advised by the Office of Management and Budget \n     that there is no objection to the submission of this draft \n     bill to Congress from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                              Jesse Brown.\n\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMPSON (by request):\n  S. 1752.

Mr. President, as chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I have today introduced, at the request of the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs, S. 1752, a bill to amend certain \nprovisions of title 38, United States Code, to exempt full-time \nregistered nurses, physician assistants, and expanded-function dental \nauxiliaries from restrictions on remunerated outside professional \nactivities. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs submitted this \nlegislation to the President of the Senate by letter dated February 21, \n1996.\n  My introduction of this measure is in keeping with the policy which I \nhave adopted of generally introducing--so that there will be specific \nbills to which my colleagues and others may direct their attention and \ncomments--all administration-proposed draft legislation referred to the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. Thus, I reserve the right to support or \noppose the provisions of, as well as any amendment to, this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record, together with the transmittal letter and the \nenclosed analysis of the draft legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1752\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this Act \n     an amendment is expressed in terms of an amendment to a \n     section or other provision, the reference shall be considered \n     to be made to a section or other provision of title 38, \n     United States Code.\n       Sec. 2. Section 7423 is amended--\n       (a) in subsection (b) by striking paragraph (1) and \n     redesignating paragraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) as \n     paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5);\n       (b) by redesignating subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f) as \n     subsections (d), (e), (f), and (g); and\n       (b) by inserting after subsection (b) the following new \n     subsection (c):\n       ``(c) A physician, dentist, podiatrist, or optometrist \n     appointed as a full-time employee under this title (other \n     than an intern or resident appointed pursuant to section 7406 \n     of this title) may not assume responsibility for the medical \n     care of any patient other than a patient admitted for \n     treatment at a Department facility, except in those cases \n     where the appointee, upon request and with the approval of \n     the Under Secretary for Health, assumes such responsibilities \n     to assist communities or medical practice groups to meet \n     medical needs which would not otherwise be met for a period \n     not to exceed 180 calendar days, which may be extended by the \n     Under Secretary for Health for additional periods not to \n     exceed 180 calendar days each.''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                            The Secretary of Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, February 21, 1996.\n     Hon. Al Gore,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are transmitting a draft bill, ``To \n     amend title 38, United States Code, to exempt full-time \n     registered nurses, physician assistants, and expanded-\n     function dental auxiliaries from restrictions on remunerated \n     outside professional activities.'' We request that it be \n     referred to the appropriate committee for prompt \n     consideration and enactment.\n       This draft bill would amend section 7423 to exempt VHA \n     full-time registered nurses, physician assistants (PA's) , \n     and expanded-function dental auxiliaries (EFDA's) from the \n     restriction on moonlighting applicable to all title 38 \n     employees. Specifically, the draft bill would exempt these \n     professional groups from the prohibition in subsection (b) of \n     that section against assuming responsibility for the medical \n     care of any patient not admitted to a VA facility. The \n     registered nurses, PA's, and EFDA's would continue to be \n     subject to conflict of interest restrictions on outside \n     remuneration for the performance of official duties. In \n     addition, the draft bill would correct a technical flaw in \n     the recodification of title 38 by reimposing the remunerated \n     outside activity restriction on VA Central Office executive \n     physicians, dentists, podiatrists and optometrists.\n       Congress enacted the outside professional activities \n     restrictions to assure the availability of health care \n     professionals who are responsible for around the clock care \n     of VA patients. This availability primarily concerns \n     physicians, who must be on-call 24 hours a day, 7 days a \n     week, to meet patient care needs. The moonlighting \n     restriction is unnecessary as to nurses, PA's and EFDA's \n     because VA has considerable flexibility to assure adequate \n     coverage by these professional groups without it.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the submission of this draft bill and that \n     its enactment would be consistent with the Administration's \n     program.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Jesse Brown.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                         Analysis of Draft Bill\n\n       The draft bill would amend section 7423 by: 1. adding a new \n     subsection (c); 2. in subsection (b), deleting paragraph (1), \n     and redesignating paragraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6), as \n     paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5), and respectively; and \n     3. redesignating subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f) as \n     subsections (d), (e), (f), and (g), respectively.\n       The new subsection (c) would exempt full-time registered \n     nurses, physician assistants, and expanded-function dental \n     auxiliaries from restrictions on remunerated outside \n     professional employment. Instead, new subsection (c) would \n     apply the restrictions on remunerated outside professional \n     employment only to physicians, dentists, podiatrists and \n     optometrists. The registered nurses would continue to be \n     subject to restrictions on outside remuneration for the \n     performance of official duties. New subsection (c) also would \n     correct a technical flaw in the recodification of title 38 by \n     reimposing these restrictions on VA Central Office executive \n     physicians, dentists, podiatrists and optometrists, by \n     broadening its application so as to cover all title 38 \n     Veterans Health Medical Administration professionals. Current \n     law limits the restrictions to Veterans Health Administration \n     professionals appointed under Chapter 74. Executive medical \n     professionals are appointed under Chapters 3 and 73.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMPSON (by request):\n  S. 1753.

Al Gore,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: There is transmitted herewith a draft \n     bill ``To amend title 38, United States Code, to expand the \n     authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to suspend \n     special pay agreements for physicians and dentists who enter \n     residency training programs.'' We request that it be referred \n     to the appropriate committee for prompt consideration and \n     enactment.\n       Under current law, in order to recruit and retain highly \n     qualified physicians and dentists in the Veterans Health \n     Administration, the Secretary is authorized to provide them \n     special pay. This special pay is provided under an agreement \n     that stipulates a period of service in return for receipt of \n     special pay and, in the event of a breach, the amount of \n     special pay paid to the recipient under the agreement must be \n     refunded. The special pay is in addition to any other pay and \n     allowances the recipient of the special pay is entitled to \n     receive.\n       However, a physician or dentist entering a residency \n     training program must convert to a special appointment \n     category that is excluded from receipt of special pay. \n     Therefore, accepting a residency training position or \n     entering a non-VA sponsored residency program prior to the \n     expiration of the terms of the special pay agreement \n     constitutes a breach of the agreement triggering an \n     obligation to repay the special pay received in that year.\n       This proposal would amend subsection 7432(b)(2) of title \n     38, United States Code to authorize VA to suspend the special \n     pay agreement of a physician or dentist who enters a \n     residency training program, VA sponsored or not. When the \n     physician or dentist completes, withdraws from or is no \n     longer a participant in the program, the special pay \n     agreement shall be reinstated. During such suspension the \n     physician or dentist shall not be subject to the refund \n     requirement of paragraph 1.\n       The refund requirement penalty fixed in law for those \n     choosing to enter residency training programs is punitive and \n     counter-productive to VA's medical mission to provide \n     veterans the services of highly qualified and trained health \n     care professionals. In keeping with VA's mission, this \n     proposal would remove the imposition of adverse financial \n     consequences for those wishing to enter residency training \n     programs and would allow them to pursue educational \n     opportunities designed to increase and develop their \n     professional knowledge and skills.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the submission of this draft bill from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Jesse Brown.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                         Analysis of Draft Bill\n\n       This draft bill would amend subsection 7432(b)(2) of title \n     38, United States Code by adding a new subsection ``B'' that \n     would expand the authority of the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs to suspend a special pay agreement for physicians and \n     dentists who enter residency training programs. When they \n     complete, withdraw from or are no longer participants in the \n     program, the special pay agreement shall be reinstated. \n     During such suspension the physician or dentist shall not be \n     subject to the refund requirement of paragraph 1.\n       Under existing law, a physician or dentist who enters a \n     residency training program is converted to a special \n     appointment category that is excluded from receipt of special \n     pay. Entering a residency training position constitutes a \n     breach of the agreement and triggers the obligation to repay \n     the special pay the recipient received in that year.\n       The amendment would temporarily suspend the special pay \n     agreement during residency training and allow the return of \n     the physician or dentist to VA employment without incurring a \n     special pay refund obligation.

I \nwould like to bring to the attention of my colleagues the winners of \nthe 1995-96 Eighth Grade Youth Essay Contest, which I sponsor in \nassociation with the Indiana Farm Bureau and Bank One of Indianapolis. \nThese students have displayed strong writing abilities and have proven \nthemselves to be outstanding young Hoosier scholars. I submit their \nnames for the Congressional Record because they demonstrate the \ncapabilities of today's students and are fine representatives of our \nNation.\n  This year, Hoosier students wrote on the theme, ``Farming for the \nFuture.'' Students were encouraged to consider and creatively express \nwhat future they envision for Indiana agriculture. I submit for the \nRecord the winning essays of Kimberly Bogue of Howard County and Brent \nM. Frey of Carroll County. As State winners of the Youth Essay Contest, \nthese two outstanding students were recognized on Friday, May 10, 1996, \nduring a visit to our Nation's Capital.\n  The essays follow:\n\n                         Farming for the Future\n\n                   (By Kimberly Bogue, Howard County)\n\n       I woke up to the sound of the robotic maid at my door. When \n     I let her in, she gave me my breakfast. After I ate, I got \n     dressed and went outside. I sat in my tree condo and just \n     started thinking how different the farm is now from what it \n     has been over the last fifty years. . .\n       Then, they had families working on their own farms. Next, \n     25 years ago, they had corporations. That was a failure. They \n     had big factories and people worked at minimum wages. Now, we \n     are back to family farms. I know Dad likes it better.\n       Ever since Purdue pioneered the genetic engineering of \n     seed, plants have been growing a lot better. Now they are \n     more resistant to diseases and stress factors. The new oil \n     plant is a big accomplishment. Now we don't have to buy oil \n     from other countries. Instead, we can grow it in Indiana. \n     This new plant is one of our main crops, along with corn and \n     soybeans.\n       Fifty years ago, there were rolling hills in the country. \n     Now the towns are expanding into each other. The houses are \n     packed tight, along with mega-malls and office buildings. \n     There are fewer farms, but more products per acre are \n     produced than were fifty years ago.\n       Recently, we bought the perfect cow. It was an exact \n     replica of a cow from my grandparents' day, but this one was \n     cloned. Now, cloning is common since Purdue discovered the \n     safe way to clone animals. . .\n       Just then, I saw a fire in the field. A neighbor's EHM \n     (electronic harvest machine) was burning. Suddenly, there \n     were neighbors all around helping. I'm glad that's something \n     that hasn't changed. When a neighbor is in trouble, we still \n     all go together and do what we can to help. I hope it will \n     always be that way.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                         Farming for the Future\n\n                   (By Brent M. Frey, Carroll County)\n\n       The year is 2045. Imagine going to work at your 50 acre \n     self-contained climate controlled field of corn. You set the \n     temperature at a warm 70 degrees, perfect for your newest \n     variety of geneticly engineered high oil corn. This corn oil \n     will be used for gasoline and biodegradable plastics. \n     Tomorrow's weather will be programmed to be a humid 78 \n     degrees with an inch of light rainfall.\n       As the 90 day perfect growing season is coming to an end we \n     are getting ready to begin harvesting, with our computer \n     controlled hovering combine. It reduces compaction by \n     floating above the corn and using a suction device to pull \n     the corn up into the combine. The corn is sent straight to \n     the elevator where it is processed into plastic and shipped \n     out the same day. Next, you replant your field with high-\n     protein soybeans to be used for human and animal consumption.\n       Later that day you go to your off-site farrowing hog \n     building to do chores. You walk in and at the press of a \n     button the sows are fed. You do this in all 150 farrowing \n     barns. This is not uncommon because the smallest hog \n     operation around has more than one 175,000 sows. Today you \n     are selling pigs. You drive the pigs straight out of the \n     finishing building into your own personal consumer packing \n     plant. The pigs are killed and packaged within one hour of \n     arrival reducing the risk of contamination.\n       Fifty years ago in 1995 we never would have imagined the \n     technological advances we have made.\n\n\n                        1995-96 District Winners\n\n       District 1: Lyndsey Hazen, Bill Bohling.\n\n[[Page S4981]]\n\n       District 2: Jessica Monique Lieffring, Andy Rummel.\n       District 3: Rachel Carlson, Brent M.

Mr. President, for the past 2\\1/2\\ years Congress \nhas debated the reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act. The \nissues have been divisive and controversial. The issues have been so \nvolatile that for over a year there was a moratorium on the listing of \nspecies, which the proponents argued was necessary to reform a flawed \nlisting process. Obviously, others of us disagreed over the impact of \nthe moratorium and we fought to have it repealed.\n  Even more telling is the intense polarization that has existed among \nthe many different interests, including large land owners, \nenvironmental groups, State and local governments, and public service \norganizations. For too long the disputing sides in this controversy \nhave devoted more of their energies to furthering that polarization \nthan to finding workable solutions to real problems.\n  For the past 1\\1/2\\ years, I have indicated to the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee chairman, Senator Chafee; the ranking member, \nSenator Baucus; the Drinking Water, Fisheries and Wildlife Subcommittee \nchairman, Senator Kempthorne, that I want to see the Endangered Species \nAct reauthorized with necessary reasonable reforms. Clearly as \ndifferent pieces of legislation were offered in both Chambers of \nCongress, no progress was made for some time.\n  However, in a Herculean effort, some organizations representing all \nof the many different perspectives and interests sat down in a series \nof meetings and have actually come up with a reform package to the \nEndangered Species Act. The following were part of the process, the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund, the Center for Marine Conservation, the \nWorld Wildlife Fund, the Nature Conservancy, the National Realty \nCommittee, and the Western Urban Water Association, and two very \nsignificant companies, Georgia Pacific and Plum Creek Co. They were \njoined from time to time in their discussions by representatives of the \nInternational Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies and the Western \nGovernors Association. These groups began their talks about the same \ntime that we in the committee began our bipartisan discussions. I don't \nknow at this point whether all that this private compromise \naccomplished will be incorporated into legislation; but I do know that \ntheir effort, in fact, assisted our process here.\n  When Members of the Senate of opposite parties start meeting over \nlegislation, we call it responsible compromise. When some of the \nprivate interests sat down to work out compromises on the Endangered \nSpecies Act, they were isolated and scorned by the right and left. \nConsequently, these groups have suffered because they tried to assist \nthe larger public good. And isn't the public good exactly why we are \nhere?\n  Ultimately, the only way to overcome the polarization that has \ncharacterized this debate about the Endangered Species Act is to do \nwhat these folks have done. They reached across the considerable gulf \nthat separates the environmental and regulated communities in a good \nfaith effort to find common ground.\n  Whether we are able to incorporate all of the substance that they \narrived at is still uncertain, but I do know that it is true compromise \nand a respectable effort at finding consensus. This process these \norganizations have engaged in will be immensely helpful to Senator \nChafee, myself, and others who are searching for good, creative ideas \non this highly charged issue.\n  So, I have committed myself to a sincere examination of their work in \nlight of the negotiations we are conducting in the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. I hope that their good faith effort may be a \nmodel for dialog and communication to build the consensus necessary to \nbuild even stronger support for an effective endangered species \nconservation effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/13/senate-section/article/S4981-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4981-S4982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DOROTHY RABINOWITZ\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on Saturday morning last, Nat \nHentoff devoted his ever-insightful column to a tribute to Dorothy \nRabinowitz. Much deserved; beautifully accomplished. I ask that Mr. \nHentoff's column be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 11, 1996]\n\n           She Listened to the Children--and Had Some Doubts\n\n                            (By Nat Hentoff)\n\n       I.F. Stone, one of my mentors in this business, used to \n     tell young reporters: ``If you intend to use the First \n     Amendment to change the world, forget it. If you're lucky, \n     you may be able, over time, to make small, incremental \n     changes.''\n       Once in a while, however, a journalists does make a big \n     difference, even rescuing innocent people from prison--and \n     changing the way many other journalists cover a particular \n     kind of story.\n       For much of the past 10 years, Dorothy Rabinowitz has been \n     rigorously investigating cases of preschool teachers and \n     others around the country who have been convicted of sexual \n     child abuse. She first became involved in the New Jersey \n     sentencing of Kelly Michaels to 47 years in prison on 115 \n     counts of bizarrely molesting 20 children from the ages of 3 \n     to 5. (One child testified that Michaels had turned her into \n     a mouse. Others said the teacher made them eat a ``cake'' of \n     her feces.)\n       The press at the time found the testimony of the accusers \n     entirely convincing, and a Pulitzer Prize winner, Anna \n     Quindlen, then a columnist for the New York Times, urged her \n     readers to ``believe the children.''\n       Rabinowitz interviewed everyone she was able to reach, \n     including the furious parents of the allegedly abused \n     children. She also obtained transcripts of the state's \n     ``investigators'' who questioned the children until the kids \n     gave the required answers.\n       I also had those transcripts. The manipulation and \n     intimidation of the children was so obvious that if the trail \n     had not been about sexual violations of kids, the charges \n     would have been dismissed. The prosecution did not introduce \n     a single piece of physical evidence to support the charges \n     and the children's stories.\n       After five years in prison, Michaels was released because \n     lawyers who had read Dorothy Rabinowitz's investigative \n     pieces volunteered to prove her innocence. By then, most of \n     the press had come to the belated conclusion that somehow an \n     injustice had been done, but there were no apologies.\n       Rabinowitz had joined the Wall Street journal by then, \n     writing commentary. But an inveterate reporter, she bases her \n     commentaries on research that comes from legwork.\n\n[[Page S4982]]\n\n       Although she writes on other issues, Rabinowitz continues \n     to confront prosecutors and juries who have convicted \n     defendants accused by children--coached by therapists and law \n     enforcement ``specialists'' in sexual abuse. As Alan Kors, a \n     history professor at the University of Pennsylvania, notes:\n       ``What Rabinowitz has disclosed to full public scrutiny and \n     understanding is sadly reminiscent of Europe's witch-craze--a \n     jurisprudence of leading questions, sociopathology, disregard \n     of evidence and logic, and careerism joined to fanaticism.''\n       In the Massachusetts Amiraults' case, Rabinowitz's \n     persistent stories finally led to the release from prison of \n     two of the three defendants. She has not given up on the \n     third. In the Boston Globe, critic at large Ed Siegel \n     emphasizes that Rabinowitz was ``the first journalist to \n     provide in-depth reporting on the case'' and ``her series had \n     a ripple effect.'' And Malcolm Gladwell noted in The Post \n     that ``the Amiraults' case became a national cause celebre \n     because of doubts about the veracity of the children's \n     testimony against them.'' Those doubts came largely from \n     stories in the Wall Street Journal.\n       A movie could be made about Dorothy Rabinowitz, journeying \n     alone, to the city of Wenatchee in the state of Washington, \n     where many have been charged and imprisoned on the testimony \n     of children in a nightmarish setting that resembled a fusion \n     of the TV series ``Picket Fences'' and a Stephen King novel.\n       A local television reporter, Tom Grant, told me he had to \n     fight to get air time to report the story, which he \n     nonetheless did with much courage in a town that had aspects \n     of 17th-century Salem, Mass. This year, Grant received a \n     George Polk Award for local television reporting.\n       He says, however, that Wenatchee became a national concern \n     because of Dorothy Rabinowitz. ``Six months after I started \n     on the story,'' he said to me, ``Dorothy came and everything \n     exploded. Then the other media came.''\n       Rabinowitz was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize in \n     commentary this year, but was not considered worthy. Some \n     members of the ultimate Pulitzer Board had been told--as one \n     of them assured Tucker Carlson of the Standard--that she had \n     had no effect on the local situations she wrote about. So \n     much for accuracy of reporting on high.\n       In 1965, when the august Pulitzer board overruled a music \n     jury award to Duke Ellington, he said: ``Fate doesn't want me \n     to be too famous too young.'' Ellington easily survived the \n     ignorance of the Pulitzer Board. And Dorothy Rabinowitz also \n     knows she is worth a lot more than one of its prizes.\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/13/senate-section/article/S4981-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DR. PHILIP M. BLATT\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, few of us are ever called upon by \nour genes to bear a burden comparable to that which is borne by those \nin lifelong contention with the condition known as hemophilia. Even \nfewer of us, I believe, whatever physical burdens we may be obliged to \nbear, ever encounter a physician such as my friend and neighbor in \nDelaware, Dr. Philip M. Blatt, a hematologist who treats many patients \nsuffering from hemophilia.\n  On Wednesday, May 15, Dr. Blatt will be honored by the Delaware \nValley Chapter of the National Hemophilia Foundation, not merely for \napplying his medical skills to helping his patients survive, but \nespecially for the warm, human, caring manner in which he does so.\n  Hemophilia, which affects the ability of the blood to coagulate and \nthus can make even a minor injury into a major threat from the \nuncontrollable loss of blood, tends, in a sense, to isolate its \nvictims. They know that they must manage their lives with an uncommon \ndegree of caution and avoidance. They know that what might be a \nnegligible scratch for someone else can, in their case, become a life-\nthreatening wound. And because of the fragility of their blood, they \nmust often undergo constant treatment--and that necessity, in the years \nbefore the effect of the AIDS virus was known, placed many of them \ninnocently at risk to that deadly disease.\n  It would be very easy, Mr. President, for any victims of hemophilia \nto suffer as much from the psychic as from the physical effects of \ntheir condition--to perceive themselves as put upon through no fault of \ntheir own, to think of themselves as the outcast victims of a genetic \ncondition totally beyond their control--but not so easy if they are \nPhilip Blatt's patients.\n  Dr. Blatt knows that his hemophilia patients suffer from a condition \nthat has an almost all-consuming effect on their lives, but goes to \ngreat lengths to make sure it does not consume their spirits. He knows \nthat their hemophilia makes them relative rarities among the general \nrun of people, but he never forgets that they are--first, foremost, and \nalways--people, with the same general inheritance of strengths and \ndeficiencies we all share, with the same rights and responsibilities, \nwith the same dreams and aspirations.\n  Philip Blatt is not a doctor who simply treats his patients' \nfrailties, but a physician in the classic tradition who treats them as \nwhole persons, and who cares not only about saving their lives but also \nabout helping them keep their lives whole and rewarding. He practices \nmedicine in its finest sense, and it is that quality, Mr. President, \nfor which the Delaware Chapter of the National Hemophilia Society will \nhonor him this week, as I do today here on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/13/senate-section/article/S4982-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4982-S4983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE BATTLE OF ADWA\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, recently I was catching up on my \nreading and I read in a bulletin published by the Embassy of Ethiopia \nthe speech of President Negasso Gidada on the 100th anniversary of the \nbattle of Adwa.\n  Frankly I had never heard of the battle of Adwa before reading this \nspeech but because of its insight into this historic event as well as \ninsights into Ethiopia I ask to have it printed in the Record after my \nremarks.\n  Ethiopia and its neighbor Eritrea, who divided into two countries \npeacefully after years of struggle, are both making progress.\n  It is good to see the progress that Ethiopia is making and I \ncongratulate President Negasso Gidada and the people of Ethiopia on \ntheir steps forward.\n  The address follows:\n\n Address by His Excellency Dr. Negasso Gidada on the 100th Anniversary \n                   Celebration of the Battle of Adwa\n\n       [The following are selected excerpts from the speech of \n     President Negasso Gidada on March 2, 1996, in Addis Ababa]\n       Dear Peoples of Ethiopia, Invited Guests and Friends of Our \n     Country:\n       At the outset, I wish on behalf of all the peoples of \n     Ethiopia, to express my heartfelt joy as we celebrate the \n     100th anniversary of the Victory of Adwa, an event that is \n     accorded a special place of honor in our long history of \n     struggle to safeguard our independence.\n       A hundred years have passed since the victory of the battle \n     of Adwa, a victory which is a source of pride not only to us \n     Ethiopians, but to those peoples of Africa and other \n     continents who suffered under colonial rule. Today, all over \n     our country we are celebrating with great joy the one \n     hundredth anniversary of the victory achieved at Adwa by our \n     heroic fathers who, with their fervent patriotism, halted the \n     invasion designed to subjugate us under the colonial yoke \n     forced upon our African brothers at the end of the last \n     century.\n       This victory achieved by our heroic fathers over Italian \n     colonialists at Adwa, the centenary of which we celebrate \n     with great color today, had special significance not only for \n     Ethiopia but for the anti-colonial struggle of all the \n     African peoples.\n       It is to be recalled that it was in the last quarter of the \n     previous century that the rich European countries decided to \n     divide up Africa among themselves to satisfy their demand for \n     raw materials and markets. Following their decision, \n     European powers invaded all parts of Africa. They deployed \n     highly organized armies equipped with modern arms with the \n     objective of subjugating under direct colonial rule the \n     African countries, most of which were relatively at low \n     levels of development. Africa and her peoples sank into \n     the darkness of colonialism.\n       The colonial powers keen to exploit the wealth and labor \n     that Africa provided them, sought to insure that no country \n     remained free in Africa and began planning to bring Ethiopia \n     under their control. After having labored to weaken our \n     country earlier through various smaller acts of aggression, \n     they eventually launched an all out invasion in 1896. The \n     invading force deployed by Italian colonialists was, however, \n     dealt a crushing blow by our gallant forebears on March 2, \n     1989 at Adwa. Ethiopia and her peoples were saved from \n     falling under colonial rule. The colonialists suffered great \n     humiliation.\n       The historic victory scored at Adwa, coming at a time when \n     our continent was suffering from foreign domination, had the \n     strong effect of marking a new chapter in the anti-colonial \n     struggle of the African peoples. The victory of Adwa provided \n     a great example for our African brothers to rekindle their \n     struggle to regain their freedom with new vigor and hope. The \n     victory of Adwa contributed greatly to the intensification of \n     the struggle of black peoples all over the world for their \n     right to live in dignity and equality. Adwa provided a vivid \n     example not only for Africa but for peoples the world over \n     suffering under colonialism and racism to revitalize their \n     struggle.\n       It is because of these features signaling light at the end \n     of the dark tunnel of colonialism to the peoples of Africa \n     that we say that the victory of Adwa, beyond being a war \n     between Italian invaders and Ethiopia, had a special meaning \n     and dimension for Africa.\n\n[[Page S4983]]\n\n       The victory of Adwa enabled us to ensure that after the \n     battle our country remained sovereign and free. The victory \n     provided great morale for the resistance of our patriots when \n     the colonialists returned to Ethiopia in strength 40 years \n     later to invade the country for a second time. The generation \n     that struggle valiantly for five years to put to shame the \n     fascist forces who launched the second Italian invasion was \n     the beneficiary of the patriotic legacy of our fathers who \n     defeated the invaders of Adwa.\n       Furthermore the proud struggle and sacrifice of the present \n     generation against the seventeen year traitorous dictatorship \n     which provided foreign forces the opportunity to interfere in \n     our affairs, is proof that the victory of our fathers in Adwa \n     continues to be passed on from one generation to the other.\n       The century old victory of Adwa which left a legacy of \n     patriotism and resistance to the generation that followed \n     would not have succeeded had it not been for the decisive \n     participation of all the peoples of Ethiopia. If all our \n     peoples had not arisen as one and not demonstrated their \n     readiness to resist the invading army, Ethiopia would not \n     have been saved from colonialism, and either would her people \n     have been spared from humiliation. Thanks to all the heroes \n     of Ethiopia, the victory of Adwa ensured that we were \n     bequeathed a free country.\n       Peoples of Our Country,\n       It is difficult for us Ethiopians to have a clear \n     understanding of the situation in which we find ourselves as \n     well as the struggle that awaits us, unless the victories \n     registered in the struggle to resist foreign invaders and our \n     proud history of resistance are seen against the backdrop of \n     the life we have lived in other aspects of our existence. \n     Although the courage that prevailed over repeated external \n     attempts to humiliate our country guaranteed the survival of \n     our independence and kept our flag flying, it also should be \n     borne in mind that there was another side of our existence \n     that had persisted for a long time. This other side has been \n     marked by lack of social liberty and development and by a \n     system that denied us the opportunities for progress, for \n     peace and consolidating strong national unity.\n       The stark reality until recently was that all the peoples \n     of our country had been subjugated under a system in which \n     their democratic and human rights were stifled and their \n     destinies decided by dictators. Being anti-democratic the \n     system denied the peoples the freedom to uphold their \n     national rights and consigned them to national oppression as \n     well as humiliation. Although our peoples are hard working \n     and our country is endowed with abundant natural resources, \n     we have been exposed to abject poverty and associated social \n     hardships because our economy has remained stagnant. Because \n     we have been denied the opportunity to address these and \n     other related problems democratically, our country and its \n     peoples have suffered from continuous internal conflicts.\n       After a long and bitter struggle, our country has embarked \n     upon a path that will extricate it from these and related \n     difficulties. Nevertheless, poverty and backwardness, \n     oppression and national subjugation still remain today the \n     lot of most of us Africans. Therefore, it is incumbent upon \n     us in Africa to re-dedicate our resolve that had enabled us \n     to achieve independence in the direction of extricating our \n     continent from poverty and related social ills.\n       At the regional level, side by side with the responsibility \n     of promoting growth and prosperity in each country, our \n     mission calls for strict observance of the obligation to \n     adhere to the recognition and mutual interests in order to \n     promote cooperative endeavors to achieve prosperity freeing \n     the continent from its multitude of problems.\n       In recognition of the imperative need to strengthen the \n     economic and democratic foundations of our country's \n     sovereignty and independence, Ethiopia has chosen its path of \n     democratic and economic development. It has taken numerous \n     steps in this direction during the transition period and \n     continues to do more along the same lines. The prevalence of \n     peace and democracy in our country today as well as the \n     development activities in which the whole population \n     participates are concrete evidence that our aspirations are \n     unfolding. Our strong conviction is that the path of peace, \n     democracy and economic growth on which we have embarked will \n     steer our country towards the realization of a fully-fledged \n     and sustainable democratic system.\n       Peace in our country has steadily taken root because our \n     nations and nationalities have worked to make it sustainable. \n     Democracy has become a means through which the peoples \n     address their problems. The constitution of dictatorship has \n     been replaced with a democratic constitution through the \n     active participation and efforts of all our population. This \n     is a clear demonstration of the sustainability of democracy \n     in our country.\n       The lesson to be drawn from the development efforts being \n     exerted by regional governments elected by the peoples and \n     that have taken advantage of the wide and extensive powers \n     they have attained and the prevailing democratic and peaceful \n     conditions, is that any effort on the road we have chosen \n     cannot succeed in the absence of the extensive and active \n     support of our population.\n       All the peoples of our country, therefore, should mobilize \n     their energies that are characteristic of their traditional \n     culture of hard work, for the implementation of the programs \n     of peace, development and democracy drawn up by the \n     government. I would like to take this opportunity to call on \n     the peoples of our country to dedicate their energies that \n     constitute the engine of growth towards the implementation of \n     our plans, thereby fulfilling the creation of the requisite \n     internally conducive environment.\n       I thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/13/senate-section/article/S4982-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4983-S4984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             JERUSALEM 3000\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, last Tuesday evening several \nthousand New Yorkers gathered at New York City's Battery Park for a \ngala celebration of the city of Jerusalem's trimillenium. This \nmagnificent reception was hosted by New York State Gov. George E. \nPataki and cosponsored by the Jewish Community Relations Council of New \nYork.\n  Senators will recall that a similar ceremony was held in the rotunda \nof the Capitol on October 25, 1995. The main address on that occasion \nwas given by a heroic son of Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzchak \nRabin, in what would prove to be his last visit to Washington and to \nthe Congress. It was thus all the more appropriate that Governor Pataki \nchose to dedicate New York State's official celebration of Jerusalem's \ntrimillenium to Yitzchak Rabin's memory.\n  I ask that Governor Pataki's moving remarks at the Jerusalem \ncelebration be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n      Remarks by Gov. George Pataki on Jerusalem 3000 Celebration\n\n       Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to New York \n     State's celebration of the 3000th anniversary of the City of \n     Jerusalem. Today we are truly making history, as we gather \n     together in a display of unity and solidarity between the \n     people of the State of New York and the people of the State \n     of Israel.\n       We all agree that now, more than ever, Israel needs our \n     support and help. Like so many times when the United States \n     relied on Israel for help, today we return the favor with an \n     unprecedented showing of support for Jerusalem and the State \n     of Israel. We are aware that Israel has sacrificed much in \n     their support of our country. One need only to recall the \n     Gulf War, when Israel respected the wish of the United States \n     Government that Israel exercise restraint so as not to \n     disrupt Operation Desert Storm.\n       In 1003 B.C., the Bible records that King David moved the \n     Capital of Israel to Jerusalem. Since that monumental event \n     3000 years ago, Jerusalem has been a beacon of hope to all \n     those who cherish religion and spirituality. All of the major \n     religions have a special connection to this city.\n       For 3000 years, people have traveled from all over the \n     world to visit this majestic city. Poets, artists, religious \n     figures, heads-of-state, and people from all walks of life \n     have been captivated by Jerusalem and its beauty, and so have \n     we.\n       Today we are extremely honored to have guests who have \n     traveled from all of New York State, and from around the \n     world. I am particularly grateful to our most esteemed \n     guests, the Foreign Minister of Israel, General Ehud Barak, \n     Mayor Ehud Olmert of Jerusalem, and John Cardinal O'Connor \n     for taking the time out of their schedules to join us here \n     for this historic occasion, and other great men and women who \n     we heard from today.\n       To the others from the various Jewish communities and other \n     communities, who have traveled from as far away as Syracuse, \n     Albany, Buffalo, and from throughout our great State and \n     elsewhere, we welcome you and thank you for joining us here \n     this evening.\n       As the invitation for this event indicated, this evening's \n     celebration is dedicated to the memory and legacy of a great \n     hero of the State of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin. All of us here \n     today, Jew and non-Jew alike, recognize Prime Minister Rabin \n     not just as a great statesman, but as a man who gave his life \n     attempting to bring peace and security to his nation.\n       I still find it sad that my first trip to the Holy Land and \n     Jerusalem was for the purpose of paying my last respects to \n     this great man. Tonight's celebration would not be complete \n     without us taking a moment to remember his dream of a secure \n     and peaceful Israel. We miss him greatly.\n       As I indicated earlier, Jerusalem is significant to many \n     religions. This is why we have asked leaders of the various \n     faiths to join with us here today to show their unity with \n     Israel. I think we can all agree that never has there been \n     more accommodation, access and respect for sites holy to all \n     faiths and religions than through the care and consideration \n     of the government of Israel.\n       For those who have had the privilege to visit Jerusalem, \n     there is no denying its beauty, its spirituality and an \n     indescribable feeling of magic. Who could forget a trip to \n     Western Wall? How can one put into words the history that \n     surrounds the old City? I think that the Babylonian Talmud \n     described it best when it said that ``Ten Measures of beauty \n     were bestowed upon the world; nine were taken by Jerusalem, \n     and one by the rest of the world.''\n       As we rejoice this evening, I would be remiss if I did not \n     mention something about the Holocaust and the lessons taught \n     to us\n\n[[Page S4984]]\n\n     by that darkest moment in history, particularly in view of \n     the site upon which we stand today--adjacent to New York's \n     Holocaust Museum, which is under construction behind us.\n       New York is home to one of the world's largest number of \n     Holocaust survivors. New York State understands the \n     importance of remembering and teaching about the Holocaust. \n     Toward that end, I am proud of the fact that New York State \n     has allocated $10 million dollars to the construction of the \n     New York Holocaust museum. And many of us will be returning \n     next month for the formal dedication of this museum. Israel \n     has meant rebirth for the Jewish people. It is for this \n     reason that I know George Klein was right when he suggested \n     that we celebrate Israel and Jerusalem right her, next to \n     this museum.\n       Once again, I would like to thank all of you for coming, \n     and may we all hope and pray for a peaceful and secure \n     Jerusalem for another 3000 years and for all time to come. \n     May God bless you all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/13/senate-section/article/S4983-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES--H.R. 2202\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
