Mr. President, as you know, I do not take the floor very \noften unless I consider it very important.\n  One of the most lasting legacies of a President are the Federal \njudges he appoints for life. These judges are every bit as much a part \nof the Federal anti-crime effort as FBI and DEA agents and prosecutors.\n  Mr. President, the American people are going to face stark choices on \na range of issues in November. One of those choices will be whether we \nresume the appointment of hard-nosed Federal judges who are tougher on \ncrime than we can expect from the incumbent.\n  President Clinton talks about cops on the beat. Yet, he appoints some \njudges who are too willing to put criminals back on the street.\n  Let me tell the American people about Timothy Sherman of Maryland. He \nwas convicted in Maryland State court for the brutal shotgun murders of \nhis mother and step-father. The murder occurred in the middle of the \nnight when Timothy Sherman, who was 17 at the time, was at home. There \nwas no indication of forced entry. Indeed, the home had an alarm \nsystem. The 12-gauge shotgun used in the murder belonged to the \nShermans. Timothy Sherman's fingerprints were on the shotgun's trigger \nmechanism. A box holding five 12-gauge shotgun shells was found under \nhis mattress, with two of the shells missing. The police found two \nmatching expended shells that experts concluded were fired from the \nshotgun. Police found the murder weapon in the branches of a large \ntree, where the younger Sherman had hidden objects before, and which is \nlocated between his own house and the house of his grandparents to \nwhich he ran to report the killings.\n  Sherman's conviction was upheld by Maryland courts and the U.S. \nSupreme Court denied certiorari. Sherman then sought to have his \nconviction overturned through a habeas corpus petition. Why? Because a \ntrial juror had visited the crime scene, particularly the tree where \nthe murder weapon was found. This was indeed improper. But criminal \ndefendants are guaranteed a fair trial, not a perfect one. The trial \njudge found that the error was harmless and not prejudicial. The \nFederal district judge, William M. Nickerson, who heard the habeas \nclaim, also found the error to be harmless, thereby upholding the \nconviction in a well reasoned opinion. Judge Nickerson is a Republican-\nappointed judge, appointed by President Bush. The prisoner appealed the \ndenial of the writ of habeas corpus to the fourth circuit. A Carter \njudge, Francis Murnaghan, and a Clinton district court judge sitting by \ndesignation, James Beaty, reversed the \n\n[[Page S1162]]\nFederal district court judge in a per curiam opinion. These two judges \nbelieved that the juror's visit had so prejudiced the proceedings as to \ninvalidate the conviction and they granted Sherman the right to a new \ntrial.\n  Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson dissented: ``In light of all the evidence \npresented at trial, [the juror's] unauthorized excursion to the crime \nscene was harmless.'' Judge Wilkinson was appointed to the fourth \ncircuit by President Reagan, over vigorous opposition by the other side \nof the aisle. Indeed, the other side of the aisle conducted a \nfilibuster against this nominee at the time.\n  The two Republican appointed judges, then, would have rejected this \nconvicted murderer's effort to overturn his conviction. The two \nDemocratic-appointed judges have given him a new trial, which, if not \nundertaken within 6 months, will result in the prisoner's release.\n  Not to worry, say Judges Murnaghan and Beaty: ``If the State of \nMaryland elects promptly to retry him, a jury, acting properly, may \nwell again convict. It also may not, however, [convict him again] * * \n*,'' but, at least the second trial will meet their standard of \njustice, and at the taxpayers' expense.\n  Fortunately, the entire fourth circuit will rehear this case. Mr. \nPresident, who do you think the American people would prefer to rehear \nthis criminal case: a majority of judges appointed by Presidents Carter \nand Clinton, or judges appointed by Presidents Reagan and Bush? I \nshould point out that President Clinton wishes to promote Judge Beaty \nto the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Let me turn to another recent, disturbing case. The New York Times of \nJanuary 25, 1996, tells the story of Carol Bayless, who confessed to \ncharges of possession of 75 pounds of cocaine and 4.4 pounds of heroin. \nShe faced a minimum sentence of 10-years in jail and as much as life \nimprisonment.\n  According to the police officer's testimony, on April 21, 1995, he \nwas patrolling in an unmarked car in plain clothes with his partner, \nboth 10-year police veterans, in Washington Heights, an area he said \nwas known as a hub for the drug trade. At about 5 a.m., he noticed Ms. \nBayless' car, which had an out-of-State license plate, moving slowly \ndown the street. She then double parked her car.\n  Four unidentified males then emerged from between parked cars and \ncrossed the street in single file. Ms. Bayless popped open the car's \ntrunk, and the men placed two large duffel bags in the trunk and closed \nit. The police officer did not observe any conversation between the \nmales and the car's driver, and the entire episode took mere seconds. \nMs. Bayless drove off and the police officer and his partner pulled up \nbehind her at a stop light. As the two officers stared at the four men, \ntwo of the men noticed the police officers, spoke briefly to each \nother, and split up, rapidly moving in different directions, with at \nleast one of the men running from the area.\n  Do my colleagues find these circumstances suspicious? The police \nofficer did. He pulled Ms. Bayless over, searched the car, and found \nthe nearly 80 pounds of illegal drugs.\n  But according to Judge Harold Baer, Jr., appointed by President \nClinton, the police officer is out of step and out of line. Judge Baer \nruled that the police officer violated the Constitution's ban on \nunreasonable searches. Why? According to Judge Baer, the police officer \ndid not have reason to be suspicious of the four men and Ms. Bayless. \nOh no. Instead, according to this bleeding heart judge, the four men \nhad reason to be suspicious of the police officer.\n  Here is what the Judge said: ``Even before this prosecution * * * \nresidents in this neighborhood tended to regard police officers as \ncorrupt, abusive and violent * * * had the men not run when the cops \nbegan to stare at them, it would have been unusual.''\n  Whose side is this judge on?\n  Understandably, ``Ms. Bayless reacted with glee * * * over the ruling \n* * *'' according to the New York Times. I am absolutely sure she did. \nAs a practical matter, the judge's ruling, if it stands, lets her off \nthe hook--free to run more dope into the veins of our people. Her \nlawyer called Judge Baer courageous. I would say he lacks common sense \nand judgment.\n  By the way, Ms. Bayless' 40-minute videotaped confession was also \nthrown out by Judge Baer because it resulted from the stopping of the \ncar. In that confession, Ms. Bayless said she had made over 20 trips \nfrom Michigan to New York City to buy cocaine for her son and others \nbeginning in 1991. Judge Baer found this drug runner's statement about \nwhat happened the morning of her arrest to be credible, and he rejected \nthe police officer's testimony.\n\n  The President speaks about cops on the beat. This police officer was \non the beat. He was risking his life on behalf of decent, law abiding \ncitizens in Washington Heights and for all of us. He made a good \narrest. He took nearly 80 pounds of deadly dope off the street, worth--\nwell, it is incalculable how much that 80 pounds is worth.\n  But what is the use of cops on the beat if the President appoints \nsoft-headed judges who let the criminals they catch back on the \nstreet? It just seems a waste of taxpayers' money. We might as well \njust let them do whatever they want to do. At least that is the \nconclusion one would draw from what Judge Baer did in this case.\n\n  I, for one, hope the U.S. attorney in this area appeals this \ndecision, and I am going to be burned up if he does not.\n  In 1994, by a vote of 61 to 37, the Senate confirmed a Florida State \njudge, Rosemary Barkett, for the eleventh circuit, that no Republican \nwould have appointed to the Federal bench.\n  Time and again, Judge Barkett, as a State judge, erroneously came \ndown on the side of lawbreakers and against police officers and law \nenforcement. The full record of my concerns is set forth in the March \n22, 1994, Congressional Record. But I cannot refrain from reminding my \ncolleagues of one shocking and outrageous dissent she joined in a \nbrutal murder case, in which she would have reduced a vicious killer's \ndeath penalty to life imprisonment, with eligibility for parole in 25 \nyears.\n  Dougan versus Florida involved a terrible, racially motivated murder. \nThe killer bragged about the murder in tape recordings which he mailed \nto the victim's mother. The dissent which Judge Barkett joined had the \ngall to say, in part:\n\n       This case is not simply a homicide case, it is also a \n     social awareness case. Wrongly, but rightly in the eyes of \n     Dougan, this killing was effectuated to focus attention on a \n     chronic and pervasive illness of racial discrimination and of \n     hurt, sorrow, and rejection. Throughout Dougan's life his \n     resentment to bias and prejudice festered. His impatience for \n     change, for understanding, for reconciliation matured to \n     taking the illogical and drastic action of murder. His \n     frustration, his anger, and his obsession of injustice \n     overcame reason. The victim was a symbolic representation of \n     the class causing the perceived injustices.\n\n  This opinion reeks of moral relativism and excuse making that is \ntotally unacceptable in a judge. And this opinion, which she joined, is \njust the tip of the iceberg regarding Judge Barkett's very liberal \nrecord as a State judge. Yet, President Clinton found her record to be \nwithin his mainstream and promoted her to an important judgeship.\n  Why is this so important? Why am I raising cain here today? As a \npractical matter, the Senate gives--and certainly I give--every \nPresident deference in confirming judicial candidates nominated by the \nPresident. A Republican President would not nominate the same judges \nthat a Democrat would, and vice versa. Although the Senate has a \nconstitutional duty to advise and consent to the nominees, the Senate, \nas a practical matter, gives the President leeway. The President has \nbeen elected by the whole country and, while this President has been \nunable to put all of his choices on the bench, he has filled many \njudgeships, as have his predecessors. We on the Judiciary Committee \nhave gone along with him because we want to give this President \ndeference. He did win the election. But let us not miss the point of \nthis. We have to be concerned about what kind of judges this President \nis going to appoint.\n\n  I respectfully submit, therefore, that the American people must bear \nin mind that when they elect a President, they get his judges too--and \nnot just for 4 years, but for life.\n  And, while the Senate has served as a check on the President, there \nis no substitute for holding, and exercising, the power to nominate \nFederal judges.\n  Indicia of judicial activism or a soft-on-crime outlook are not \nalways \n\n[[Page S1163]]\npresent in a nominee's record. Not every nominee who turns out to be a \njudicial activist or soft on crime can be ferreted out in the \nconfirmation process. Indeed, as I mentioned earlier, every President \nis able to obtain confirmation of most of his nominees.\n  The general judicial philosophy of nominees to the Federal bench \nreflects the general judicial philosophy of the person occupying the \nWhite House--the Oval office, if you will. And differences in judicial \nphilosophy have real consequences for the safety of Americans in their \nstreets, homes, and workplaces.\n  I want to say that I believe the next President of the United States, \nwhether it be President Clinton or whoever, is probably going to have \nthe opportunity to nominate at least two Supreme Court Justices, maybe \nthree. If President Clinton is reelected, he will have appointed better \nthan 50 percent of the total Federal judiciary. It is something we all \nhave to think about. I decry these kind of decisions made by the \nClinton judges that I have named so far, and Carter judges--one.\n  I believe you could probably point out deficiencies in judges of \nevery President. But I am really concerned, in this day of rampant \ncriminal activity, with the flood of drugs into our society, that we \nhave judges who are being appointed on a daily basis who have a \nphilosophy like Judge Barkett's, who do not blame the acts of these \ncriminals on themselves but blame them on society, blame them on their \nenvironment, on anything but their own volition and their own desire to \ndo wrong.\n  I believe there are wrongs in our society. I believe that there are \ninjustices. I believe that there is still discrimination in our society \nagainst certain people. I believe these things are wrong.\n  On the other hand, when people who are not insane commit heinous \nmurders and heinous crimes and are spreading drugs among our young \npeople and are destroying the youth of this Nation and doing it with \nfull intent to do so and to profit from their decisions, or because \nthey are murderers, then I think we ought to come down pretty doggone \nhard on them; that is, if we want to have a civil, humane, free, and \nfair society.\n  I will have more to say about these judges in the future, but I have \nbecome so alarmed about some of these decisions that I just felt I had \nto come to the floor today and make this point, since we on the \nJudiciary Committee have this very important honor of working with \nthese judges. I do not think anybody can say that I have not done my \nvery best to try to accommodate this administration, to try to help \nthem in the appointment of judges. I am going to continue to do that as \nlong as I can. I want to be fair to this President.\n  On the other hand, these type of judges are giving me the chills, and \nI think they are giving the American people the chills as well. We have \nto consider just who we want appointing these judges in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/09/senate-section/article/S1161-5", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1163-S1166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FINISH WORK BEFORE WE RECESS\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I am glad to see there are a few of us left \nin Washington this morning: The Presiding Officer, Senator Hatch from \nUtah, myself--maybe there are a few other Senators around Capitol Hill, \nbut there are not very many. It is that situation I wish to address \nbriefly this morning.\n  I do not come to the floor very often and give lengthy speeches. This \nwill not be a very lengthy speech this morning either, but sometimes I \nthink a sense of responsibility on how the Senate conducts its business \nor does not conduct its business is in order. It is that issue I want \nto address this morning.\n  Mr. President, the Senate conducted rollcall votes on Wednesday. And \nalthough we are not technically in recess, there are no plans to have \nvotes until February 27. No vote of the Senate was taken to decide \nwhether we would recess. It was just decided we would go through the \ncharade of pro forma sessions, of looking like we are doing something \nwhen actually we are not. I think it is important for the American \npeople to know about what is going on here, because we have not passed \nall the appropriations bills for the fiscal year that started last \nOctober.\n  We are 5 months into this fiscal year without having dealt with the \nunfinished business of the Senate.\n  Currently the following departments are operating without regular \nappropriations bills. The Department of Veterans Affairs; the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development; the Environmental \nProtection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Department of State, \nthe Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior, the \nDepartment of Labor, and the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  We passed a continuing resolution. That is what we call it. A \ncontinuing resolution means you are supposed to go ahead and continue \nyour operations as they were in the previous year if we have not passed \nan appropriations bill. But this year there is a new angle to this \nbecause in order to get a continuing resolution passed on most of these \ndepartments, most of what we would normally have had as a continuing \nresolution is not there because we have reduced most of them by 25 \npercent over what their expenditure limits would have been. In other \nwords, most of them are having to limp along and make reductions in \ntheir activities.\n  I want to spell some of these out in a few minutes. But let me just \nsay that five appropriations bills remain unfinished, and funding for \nthe District of Columbia is not complete. We have yet to agree on a \nplan to balance the budget over the next 7 years.\n  We do not have a welfare reform bill, nor Medicare reform, nor \nMedicaid reform, nor health insurance reform, nor product liability \nreform, nor Superfund reform, nor an Endangered Species Act, nor a Safe \nDrinking Water Act, nor a Clean Water Act, and we even face defaulting \non the debt endangering the full faith and credit of the United States \ncome March 15 if we have not acted. And, incidentally, all of these \nCR's also run out. So there would be no funding for these agencies or \ndepartments come March 15 unless we take action of the full Congress to \ncorrect it.\n  All of the above is what we were supposed to be doing back in the \n1995 calendar year that would apply to fiscal 1996 which we are in \nright now and have been since last October. We have not even started \nyet on the 1996 agenda that will be for next year's budget. So we are \ncompletely behind.\n  This lack of achievement will not stand in the way, however, of a 20-\nday break in the Senate schedule. I know that recesses are scheduled \nduring a legislative session. But I want to call the attention of the \nSenate and the attention of the people of this country to the fact that \nthis election year the Senate schedule is already curtailed, and we are \nwell behind even on this year's activity.\n  Mr. President, by my count, if we assume an Easter recess, a Memorial \nDay recess, a Fourth of July recess, an August recess for the party \nnominating conventions, and an October 4 sine die adjournment--and a \nnot unusual Senate 4-day workweek. The norm here is that nothing of \nsubstance usually happens Monday morning and there is nothing of \nsubstance normally on Friday afternoon. There are only about 88 \nlegislative days left in this 104th Congress this year to accomplish \nthe business of last year as well as the business of this year.\n  It is probably more like 70 to 75 days when we know the actual number \nof days when Members are here in numbers to conduct business. Sometimes \nwe put things off from one day to another because certain people are \nnot here, or their schedule has been accommodated by leadership on both \nsides of the aisle. But I think even an optimistic count, if you look \nat the calendar, is that we will have about 88 days left this year. \nThat may come as a shock to a lot of people because they think we are \nhere in mid-February and we have all the rest of this year to get our \njob done. We do not. Of the legislative days here, we have about 88 \ndays left for this year right now. I do not see how we accommodate our \nbusiness that has to be done in that time period.\n  Let me point out some of the problems that the Nation faces and we \navoid by not being here doing our work. I requested that some of the \naffected agencies tell me how they are \n\n[[Page S1164]]\ndealing with these cutbacks right now. This is not something \nspeculative out there into the future. We can surmise as to what may be \nout there in the future. But here are a few things that are being \ncurtailed right now, services that the people of this country thought \nthey were getting and are beginning to be cut back on. Why? Because we \nhave not passed the appropriations bills, and because we accommodated \nthe demands of mainly the people over in the House that said that if \nthey were going to even make a continuing resolution it had to be with \nmajor cutbacks in fundings now. In other words, they are doing what \nshould be legislative cutbacks by just saying we will not provide the \nmoney, and we just refuse. So for most of these agencies or departments \nsome of them are going along on about a 25-percent reduction.\n  Let us look at the Environmental Protection Agency. According to the \nEPA, 40 percent of its planned inspections of industrial facilities \nwere missed during this period--40 percent. EPA typically conducts \n9,000 inspections a year and takes 3,700 enforcement actions. These \ninspections help protect our drinking water and our air quality. \nContinued funding shortfalls will not allow EPA to catch up with its \nbacklog. The work necessary to develop tap water standards for \npollutants like cryptosporidium will be delayed. A couple of years ago, \nin 1993, 100 people died and many more were sickened by \ncryptosporidium. Even though this is a priority issue, these standards \ntake time. And this is a complex issue requiring extensive data \ncollection which is being delayed right now.\n  Toxic waste cleanups are being slowed. Cleanups at hundreds of sites \nwere stopped during the shutdown, and half of those will not be able to \nresume quickly. Further funding shortages will only cause further \ndelay. Three new cleanups in Ohio, my home State, at Uniontown, Dayton, \nand Marietta may not begin this year. It looks as though they will not \nbegin this year as scheduled.\n  Further delays are expected in efforts to control industrial \ndischarge into rivers and streams. The public's right to know about \ntoxic chemical emissions in their area is jeopardized. Delays in \npesticide registration will affect crop protection. Standards for \ncontrolling toxic industrial air pollutants will be delayed.\n  A toxic sweep task force was established by Cleveland and the State \nof Ohio to rid the city of toxic problems that pose threats to the \npublic health and welfare, fire safety, and serve as barriers to \nproperty redevelopment. Twenty-seven properties have been cleaned up \nunder this program. EPA help was requested on three of the more \ndifficult sites. However, EPA cannot respond, and redevelopment is \ndelayed and may not occur at all.\n  Those are just a few of the things that are going on just with the \nEPA budget because of this failure of the Congress to act.\n  Under Health and Human Services, although many critical programs \nreceived full-year funding, the level of funding is not keeping up with \nthe increased need due to our growing elderly population, and \nespecially the old and frail elderly who need health and support \nservices in order to just stay in their homes and their communities.\n  The Health Resources and Services Administration supports programs \nsuch as community and migrant health centers, and maternal and child \nhealth block grants. The impact of interrupted and short-term funding \nis expected to result in reduced services to the poor, and will be \ndetrimental to the health services infrastructure and the quality of \nservices, including preventive services.\n  Because final action has not occurred, uncertainty exists as to the \navailability of funding for Ryan White CARE Act programs. This \ninability to predict the annual level of funding available to cities \nand States will impact planning and operating systems for HIV/AIDS \nvictims. The cities of Cleveland, Fort Worth, Hartford, Minneapolis, \nSacramento, and San Jose now qualify for title I--HIV Emergency Relief \nGrant Program to provide emergency assistance to localities \ndisproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic--funds under both \nexisting and proposed legislation because of the ever-growing need of \nHIV/AIDS services. Awards to all new cities must be delayed until there \nis permanent legislation.\n  Under education--Mr. President, the largest investment we make to \nboost low achievement in educational skills is title I which provides \nsome 50,000 schools and about two-thirds of our elementary schools \nacross this country, with funds for individualized instruction, smaller \nclasses, extra time to learn after school, use of computers, and more \nparental involvement. According to Secretary Riley, at continuing \nresolution levels title I will be cut by $1.1 billion, or 17 percent. \nThis will deny help to more than 1 million students and cost 40,000 to \n50,000 teaching and teaching aides' positions. As an example, Chicago \ncould lose some 600 teachers. In Beaver Local School District of Lisbon \nin northeastern Ohio, that means the elimination of the program for the \nmiddle school, losing three teachers, and ending remedial reading and \nmath for 120 children. Ohio could lose over $50 million.\n  That is just an example in my home State. But the same thing is going \non all over this country--cutbacks in education and helping kids get a \ndecent start in school, giving them remedial help that they need is \nbeing cut back right now.\n  The Department of Labor is operating at funding levels provided in \nthe House-passed bill. Should this continue, summer jobs for youth will \nbe eliminated wiping out Federal support for summer jobs for 600,000 \nyoung people--600,000 young people, if we continue to do nothing the \nway we have been doing, will not have summer jobs.\n  Employment and training programs would be reduced by $1.6 billion, \nmeaning 800,000 other people would be deprived of much needed services. \nBack to Ohio again. Ohio would receive $35 million less for job \ntraining and assistance with 30,000 people unserved that normally would \nhave been helped during that period.\n  Veterans. Congress' failure to deliver an acceptable VA-HUD \nappropriations bill is having a devastating effect on veterans \nprograms. Veterans medical care is compromised by the requirement to \neliminate 5,100 full-time medical employees at VA facilities. This will \nresult in treatment of 36,000 fewer inpatients and 800,000 outpatients. \nThis is the equivalent of closing three medical clinics with an average \nof 300 beds each. How can we possibly justify that? In addition, \nfunding levels under the current CR preclude construction of two \nhospitals that are needed at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, CA, \nand Brevard County in Florida. It also eliminates funding for five \nprojects required to renovate and correct major deficiencies in older \nVA hospitals.\n  How can we possibly look any veterans that are in those hospitals, \nwho sacrificed in combat or wherever, however they came to be in the \nhospital, in the eye and say, ``Well, you are not in a war so we are \ngoing to cut you fellows out; we are going to cut the funding back, \nshut the facilities down.'' I find that very hard to accept.\n  The Justice Department. Under the current continuing resolution, the \nCommunity Oriented Policing Services, so-called COPS Program, is funded \nat 75 percent of its 1995 levels. At this level, 1,674 additional \npolice officers could be hired. Under the President's request, 3,166 \ncould be added. This means there are 1,492 fewer cops out there on the \nbeat.\n  Mr. President, I went up and visited one of the COPS programs in \nToledo, OH, not too long ago. It is working very well. They have the \nadditional police out in the community organizing the people to have \ncommunity watch programs and cooperative programs. It is working very, \nvery well. But those programs are now going to be reduced or eliminated \nor new ones will certainly not be started.\n  The Department of Commerce. In the Department of Commerce, a variety \nof programs have been affected by delays which have impacted fishing \ncommunities, delayed NOAA's satellite procurement program, threatened \nfunding of National Weather Service contractors and suppliers, \ndisrupted orderly trade relations which hinders exporters, threatened \nEconomic Development Administration assistance to local governments and \nbusinesses following military base closures. Review and processing of \napplications for new State coastal zone management programs in Ohio and \nTexas and Georgia \n\n[[Page S1165]]\nhave delayed eligibility for Federal funding of $2 million a year.\n  Mr. President, these are just a few examples of the consequences of \nour inaction. Beyond the terrific impact of these shortfalls is the \nquestion of how can we expect to operate a system of government in the \nmost efficient way possible while supporting it in only bits and \npieces--starts and stops. No organization can operate effectively when \nrun on that kind of an interim basis. Planning is hindered when you are \nfunded for the next 6 weeks and uncertain about another, and whether or \nnot there will be a 10th continuing resolution. We do not even know \nthat. We do not know what the conditions of acceptance of another CR \nwill be. The CR permitting the action I am talking about here this \nmorning expires on March 15 along with the debt limit.\n  You can be certain that efficiency of Government services will be \nquestioned when it comes to next year's funding but Congress will not \nlikely blame itself. Federal workers become an all-too-easy target.\n  Mr. President, yesterday's Washington Post says, and I quote, \n``Congress has gone home to campaign. Given the little they have \naccomplished to date, you wonder what the members will campaign on, but \nresourceful troopers that they are, they will no doubt find \nsomething.''\n  After a discussion of the farm bill, the Post suggests that Congress, \n``Can go on to the rest of their unfinished business, like raising the \ndebt ceiling so the Treasury doesn't have to default, finishing this \nyear's budget so they can get on to the next and figuring out what if \nanything they want to do about Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, the Clean \nWater Act and a couple of other trifles like that.''\n  ``Trifles'' I am sure they meant tongue in cheek.\n  Another clip out of the newspaper, Kevin Phillips noted in his column \nof February 7 in the Los Angeles Times, ``The 104th Congress may be the \nworst in 50 years.''\n  The forces of an ideological jihad have failed to find workable \ncompromise on their agenda and have forgotten that democracy depends on \ncompromise. Failing to move a radical agenda to turn back America's \nclock, an effort to shut down the executive branch of the Government \nalso failed. Now it appears we are applying the same tactics to the \nlegislative branch of Government.\n  Mr. President, not doing business is no way for the Congress to do \nbusiness. One of the few successes of last year was requiring Congress \nto abide by the same laws as everyone else. I believe we are violating \nat least the spirit of that law when we hold Government employees \nhostage, when we borrow from the pension funds to keep the Government \nafloat, when we drive the Government to the brink of default, when we \ndo not complete the job we were hired to do in the time we were \nsupposed to do it, when we force the agencies and departments of \nGovernment to operate on an interim basis facing imminent cutoffs of \nfunds and in a final note of folly when all else fails the Congress \nleaves town with very limited legislative time left in this calendar \nyear of 1996.\n  Mr. President, maybe we should require that Congress abide by another \nlaw that people in all of our communities have to work with also, and \nthat is no work, no pay. We had votes on that. They did not pass. Maybe \nwe ought to reconsider that when we get back in here.\n  Meanwhile, Mr. President, everyone is out campaigning, doing whatever \nthey are doing while the work of the Government sits here and is not \nbeing accomplished. We were elected to come here and deal with the \nproblems and the programs of this country. We have not even dealt with \nthe work we were supposed to do last year, and we certainly have not \ngotten around to completing that or even beginning the work we are \nsupposed to do this year and time is very, very short.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial out of \nyesterday's Washington Post and also the column by Kevin Phillips out \nof the Los Angeles Times of Wednesday, February 7 be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 8, 1996]\n\n                                 Recess\n\n       Congress has gone home to campaign. Given the little they \n     have accomplished to date, you wonder what the members will \n     campaign on, but resourceful troopers that they are, they'll \n     no doubt find something. The Senate was the last to leave; \n     first it passed a farm bill. That would be fine; it's not a \n     bad bill. But the House hasn't acted yet and isn't scheduled \n     to return until the end of the month, the administration \n     claims to have serious reservations about the bill in its \n     present form, and farmers and their bankers would like to \n     know before planting season starts what the rules are going \n     to be for the year ahead.\n       That's one of the factors that impelled the Senate to act. \n     Next week's Iowa caucuses may have been the other, Iowa being \n     a leading farm state. Neither Majority Leader Bob Dole nor \n     Agriculture Committee Chairman Richard Lugar wanted to enter \n     the caucuses empty-handed. Now they have at least a \n     provisional bill to discuss.\n       The farm programs are outmoded. Mr. Lugar was one who \n     pointed that out early on last year, an unusual act for a \n     farm state Republican and presidential candidate who had just \n     assumed the chairmanship. The programs are both costly and \n     inefficient. Most of the money goes to the largest producers \n     least in need, and to the extent that farmers produce for the \n     government rather than the market, the system induces an \n     inefficient use of resources. There does need to be a safety \n     net to protect consumers and producers alike against huge \n     swings in the markets. But the guarantees are set too high. \n     To protect itself, the government then seeks to prop up \n     market prices in part by limiting production and in the \n     process costs the country sales and market share abroad. The \n     payments are also geared too much to production and not \n     enough to conservation.\n       The Republicans proposed a reform--to break the tie between \n     production and payments, ratchet the payments down over the \n     next seven years to save money while leaving farmers free to \n     produce what they choose and appoint a commission to help \n     determine what kind of successor programs the country should \n     have. Ranking Agriculture Committee Democrat Patrick Leahy \n     insisted on adding amendments reauthorizing the food stamp \n     and other feeding programs, in part to give them some \n     parliamentary protection, and broadening the principal \n     conservation program to cover more than soil erosion in the \n     Plains states. More money could be used to prevent \n     agricultural runoff and improve water quality elsewhere in \n     the country, for example.\n       All that's to the good. In the House, however, Republicans \n     who could otherwise pass a similar bill over Democratic \n     objections are divided. Some rightly want a chance to amend \n     the sugar and peanut programs, both of which jack up prices \n     unnecessarily at the checkout counter but which were \n     preserved to buy committee votes for the broader bill. The \n     administration meanwhile wants to change the broader bill, \n     which the president has already vetoed once; it was a \n     relatively minor part of the GOP proposal to balance the \n     budget that the rejected last year. Mr. Clinton's basic, \n     unhelpful position is that the farm programs don't need to be \n     changed much at all.\n       And then, when they get the farm problem settled, they can \n     go on to the rest of their unfinished business, like raising \n     the debt ceiling so the Treasury doesn't have to default, \n     finishing this year's budget so they can get on to the next \n     and figuring out what if anything they want to do about \n     Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, the Clean Water Act and a couple \n     of other trifles like that.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                   [From the LA Times, Feb. 7, 1996]\n\n           Consider This Congress the Worst in a Half-Century\n\n                          (By Kevin Phillips)\n\n       Washington.--The 104th Congress may be the worst in 50 \n     years.\n       It has another 10 months before it nails down top (bottom?) \n     honors. And it will, of course, face tough competition from \n     four other eminently second-rate Congresses--the 80th, 89th, \n     101st and 103rd. Even so, it's time for the national debate \n     to start, because what Americans decide to do about Congress \n     will color what kind of president they'll want to pick--or \n     settle for--in November.\n       Believers in the Washington system--once described as \n     dropping coins into the elephants' and donkeys' mouths and \n     getting laws and regulations out the other end--were cheered \n     in early 1995 by the apparent renewal of tired political \n     parties and government mechanisms represented by \n     ultrapowerful new House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and his \n     bold agenda of national change.\n       A year later, two-thirds of the ``contract with America'' \n     is sitting in the Senate's dumpster or crumbled in the \n     president's veto basket; Congress' ratings are back to autumn \n     1994 contempt levels, and Gingrich has set records for first-\n     year credibility loss by a new speaker. The notion of a \n     ``reform'' GOP Congress is now right up there with Tinkerbell \n     and the Tooth Fairy; and Washington lobbyists are wondering \n     how they will ever collect on the regulatory breaks and tax \n     loopholes they thought they'd bought at the Grand Old Auction \n     Party last winter.\n       Recent national surveys have shown voters saying President \n     Bill Clinton should be reelected to block the unpopular \n     Congress. But other new polls show the electorate is starting \n     to tilt Democratic for the House, as well. So November is \n     emerging as a dilemma-cum-\n\n[[Page S1166]]\n     challenge: Would dumping the House GOP and eliminating Gingrich as \n     speaker make it safe to also oust Clinton as president--\n     especially if his family and staff start setting records for \n     time spent before grand juries? Clinton's great success with \n     his State of the Union speech isn't likely to repeat itself \n     if he has to make a State of Family Integrity follow-up.\n       But Clinton's foibles have already been debated in two \n     elections--1992 and 1994. It is the failures of the GOP \n     Congress that might well be the focus of 1996.\n       Take the ``contract with America.'' This started out as a \n     smart campaign ploy, but GOP strategists let its dozen or so \n     promises--from budget balance to a line-item veto--become the \n     be-all and end-all of Republican congressional achievement. A \n     few good ideas--congressional accountability and prohibition \n     of unfunded federal mandates being imposed on the states, for \n     example--made it across Clinton's desk and into the statute \n     books; but other popular themes (term limits) bogged down, \n     and some ideas, such as tort reform and environmental \n     overhaul, lost favor as the involvement of lobbyists became \n     all too evident.\n       The collapse of public support was stunning. Polls by the \n     Times-Mirror Center found that, in winter 1994-95, voters \n     approved congressional GOP policies by 52%-28%; but, by \n     January 1996, they disapproved, 54%-36%. The NBC News poll \n     found virtually the same shift. Respondents had agreed with \n     the GOP policies, 49%-22%, in January 1995; by January 1996, \n     disagreement prevailed, 48%-34%. This is the sharpest slump \n     in policy-approval ever measured for a new Congress.\n       The crown jewel of the contract--huge tax cuts tilted \n     toward business and the wealthy combined with the seven-year \n     zero budget-deficit blueprint--was especially flawed and, \n     worse still, a practical contradiction. The tax cuts proved a \n     zero-deficit program over seven years wasn't even a good \n     idea. In 1994, all the European Union nations, except \n     Luxembourg, had larger deficits than the United States. Ours \n     was 2% of gross domestic product, theirs ranged from 2.1% of \n     GDP in Ireland and 2.6% in Germany to a whopping 11.4% in \n     Greece. These countries, too, face high health and pension \n     costs, as well as job weakness; and the requirement that EU \n     members get deficits down to 3% is feared in much of Western \n     Europe as a recession prescription. The GOP's zero-deficit \n     prescription for America would have been even more \n     Hooveresque.\n       Meanwhile, the 104th Congress has emerged as a beacon light \n     of hypocrisy when it comes to institutional reform and money \n     in politics. The promise of term limits was quickly scuttled, \n     and new GOP leaders, especially in the House, have used the \n     same kind of closed-door legislative tactics they attacked \n     under the Democrats. The vaunted lobbying ``reforms'' passed \n     this winter turn out to have something else--a downshift from \n     criminal penalties to civil penalties to civil penalties with \n     the usual game of widening as many escape hatches as are \n     closed. Discussing the loopholes in the new gift ban, the \n     president of the American League of Lobbyists remarked, ``I \n     would prefer to call them pathways or, in some cases, \n     interstates.''\n       As for campaign finance, serious reform has already been \n     mocked and foreclosed. Congress' new GOP leaders have \n     collected bigger campaign contributions, from more special \n     interests, than any previous set of first-termers.\n       The final mega-problem is the ``extreming'' of Congress \n     since the 1994 election. Not only has the ideology been \n     radical, but, on the House side, Gingrich and the 74 House \n     GOP freshmen are becoming twin symbols of political excess. \n     Recent polls on Gingrich give him only a 26%-34% approval \n     rating, while 55%-58% disapprove. No new speaker has ever \n     dropped so far so fast.\n       The right-leaning freshmen are in just as much trouble. One \n     January poll found 70% of Americans disapproved of the \n     freshmen's willingness to shut down government in the budget \n     debate, with 45% calling the freshmen ``ideological \n     extremists who are holding the federal government hostage.''\n       The ``extreming'' of Congress has even spread to the \n     hitherto centrist Senate. The rightward lurch of Senate \n     Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) signaled this shift, and \n     the retirement announcements of five GOP moderates make a \n     sharper swing to the right inevitable after they're gone. The \n     new Senate GOP of 1997 will be far more like the current \n     House GOP--not exactly an endorsement for keeping the \n     Republicans in control.\n       Other Congresses that compete for the ``worst in 50 years'' \n     title are the 80th (1947-48), the 89th (1965-66), the 101st \n     (1989-90) and the 103rd (1993-94). The 103rd was the \n     Democratic Congress that voters voted out in 1994, angry at \n     its mix of petty scandals and ineffectiveness. Its biggest \n     failure was that the Democrats were stale and deserved the \n     boot after 40 years of unbroken control in the House.\n       The 101st Congress featured the forced resignations of \n     Democratic Speaker Jim Wright and Majority Whip Tony Coelho. \n     The 89th was the lopsidedly Democratic Congress that ran amok \n     with the liberal legislation and overambition of the 1960s. \n     The 80th was the last GOP Congress to face a Democratic \n     president. It also went too far on economic, education and \n     social welfare issues.\n       However, because the 104th has ideological radicalism, yet \n     another speaker facing an ethics investigation and a record \n     collapse of public esteem, it could turn out to be the \n     wustest that got there the fastest--to paraphrase the famous \n     confederate cavalry leader.\n       Is there a remedy? Not necessarily. Though defeating enough \n     Republicans in the House to depose Gingrich as speaker could \n     be a start. Giving the Democrats a narrow majority back won't \n     empower them to do much more than squelch GOP excess. But in \n     the long haul, it will probably be necessary to find some way \n     of promoting a mix of third parties, campaign reform aimed at \n     helping independent congressional candidates (just proposed \n     by retiring Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.)) and other changes \n     designed to break the nexus between money and politics.\n       After all, if Americans do start deciding that the 104th \n     Congress is the worst in memory--or even first runner-up--\n     then it could be time for voters to demand a far different \n     set of arrangements and reforms. In Congress, as well as in \n     presidential elections, the two-party system, with its false \n     promises and special-interest masters, has arguably become \n     part of the problem, not part of the solution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/09/senate-section/article/S1163-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, we took an important step in the last \nCongress to preserve law enforcement's wiretapping tool and increase \nprivacy protection for our telephone and computer communications by \npassing the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act. This law \nexpanded privacy protection to cordless telephones, restricted the \nability of law enforcement to obtain transactional information from e-\nmail messages, and improved the privacy of mobile phones by expanding \ncriminal penalties for stealing the service from legitimate users.\n  This new law also imposed new requirements to ensure that court \norders for electronic surveillance can be carried out, rather than \nstymied by new technologies used on our telephone networks.\n  Significantly, these new requirements for our Nation's telephone \nnetworks were accompanied by guidelines designed to bring public \noversight and accountability to the process of implementing them. For \nthe first time, decisions on how new and existing telecommunications \nsystems will remain accessible to government surveillance must be made \nin the sunshine of public scrutiny.\n  Thus, the new law requires for the first time that law enforcement's \ndemands regarding the number of wiretap, pen register, and other \nsurveillance orders that telephone companies must be able to service \nsimultaneously, are published in the Federal Register and scrutinized \nin a public procedure.\n  In compliance with this new requirement, the FBI published in the \nFederal Register on October 16, 1995, a proposed notice setting forth \nits capacity demands. According to the proposed notice, these capacity \ndemands were predicated upon a historical baseline of electronic \nsurveillance activity and an analysis of that activity. Yet, the \nFederal Register notice did not include publication of this underlying \ninformation.\n  Shortly after the notice was issued, I wrote to the FBI Director \nrequesting copies of this information, and urging him to release the \ninformation to the public to ensure the fullest dissemination of the \ninformation.\n  I am aware that the comments filed by the deadline on January 16, \n1996, in response to the proposed notice on behalf of civil liberties \ngroups, telephone companies, and cellular companies have criticized the \nproposed notice for failing to disclose the supporting data for the \ncapacity demands. As one set of comments filed by the Center for \nDemocracy and Technology and the Center for National Security Studies \nnoted, ``it is impossible to say whether or not the capacity \nrequirements proposed in the notice are justified'' without the \nsupporting data. \n\n[[Page S1167]]\n\n  The FBI has now provided me with a 13-page report explaining how they \ncollected information about past law enforcement surveillance activity \nfrom Federal and State court offices, State attorneys general offices, \nand over a thousand telecommunications carriers. This report also \ndescribes the method the FBI used to analyze this information and \nfigure out how much wiretap capacity law enforcement would need for the \nforeseeable future and up to 10 years from now in three broad \ncategories of geographic areas.\n  I fully appreciate the amount of hard work that went into collecting \nthis critical data and doing the analysis. Indeed, this is the first \ntime that law enforcement has ever been required to estimate its future \nsurveillance activity and the demands that will be made on \ntelecommunications carriers. This is also the first time that this \ninformation has ever been required to be made public.\n  I am pleased to make this report available for public dissemination. \nIt does not identify which geographic areas fall into which of the \nthree different categories with differing capacity requirements. Thus, \nit does not tell us whether Vermont is in category I, where the \ngreatest level of interception activity has occurred and is likely to \noccur in the future, or in category III, where the number of law \nenforcement wiretaps have been low or nonexistent. Telecommunications \ncarriers doing business in Vermont and Vermonters will want to know \nwhich category we fall into.\n  The FBI has assured me that they are in the process of preparing two \nadditional documents that will explain the proposed capacity notice in \ngreater depth. I look forward to examining those two additional \ndocuments upon their release by the FBI.\n  The public process set up in the new law is working. I commend the \nFBI Director for his efforts to fulfill the public accountability \nprovisions of the law by making available this report and future \nreports on the capacity requirements.\n  Since these reports were not available prior to the deadline for \ncomments on the original proposed notice, however, I would urge the FBI \nto consider issuing a revised or supplemental proposed notice to give \ninterested parties an opportunity to comment on the proposed capacity \ndemands with the benefit of this new information.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the report be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\nInformation Concerning Implementation of the Communications Assistance \n                    for Law Enforcement Act [CALEA]\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       CALEA was enacted to preserve law enforcement's ability, \n     pursuant to court order or other lawful authorization, to \n     access communications (content) and associated call-\n     identifying information in an ever-changing \n     telecommunications environment. Because many interceptions \n     \\1\\ in the future will be initiated through equipment \n     controlled by carriers, CALEA obligates the Attorney General \n     to provide telecommunications carriers with information they \n     will need (a) to adequately size and design their networks to \n     accommodate the maximum number of simultaneous interceptions \n     that law enforcement potentially might conduct after October \n     25, 1998, and (b) to be capable of accommodating the actual \n     number of simultaneous interceptions law enforcement \n     potentially might conduct as of October 25, 1998. The CALEA \n     specifically refers to two levels of capacity, maximum and \n     actual.\n     Footnotes at end of article\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       CALEA requires the Attorney General to provide a notice of \n     the maximum capacity required to accommodate all of the \n     communication interceptions, pen registers, and trap trace \n     devices that the Attorney General estimates that government \n     agencies authorized to conduct electronic surveillance may \n     conduct and use simultaneously after the date that is 4 years \n     after enactment (i.e., after October 25, 1998). The Attorney \n     General must also provide a notice of the actual number of \n     communication interceptions, pen registers, and trap trace \n     devices, representing a portion of the maximum capacity, that \n     the Attorney General estimates that government agencies \n     authorized to conduct electronic surveillance may conduct and \n     use simultaneously as of October 1998.\\2\\\n\n\n                            Maximum Capacity\n\n       Unlike actual capacity, CALEA indicates that the maximum \n     capacity applies to a time, not specified, after the date \n     that is 4 years after the date of CALEA's enactment. The \n     maximum capacity has been interpreted as chiefly a design \n     requirement for telecommunications carriers that will be \n     utilized to size and define an upper bound capacity ceiling \n     for the mid-term to intermediate future (i.e., 1998-2004), as \n     discussed in more detail below. This ceiling is intended to \n     provide carriers with certainty and stability, as well as \n     with a framework for cost effectively designing and \n     engineering future capacity requirements into their networks.\n       As CALEA makes clear, the maximum capacity is in no way \n     synonymous with actual capacity (i.e., the interception \n     capacity that law enforcement may actually use as of October \n     25, 1998). Rather, maximum capacity is viewed as relating to \n     a longer term, more enduring design requirement that would \n     serve as a defined technological bound to interception \n     activity, but yet would provide room for expeditiously \n     accommodating certain future interception-related ``worst \n     case scenarios.'' For example, it would be impossible for \n     law enforcement to predict unusual, anomalous, but \n     nonetheless very serious or violent events such as those \n     associated with certain acts of terrorism or extreme \n     instances of drug-trafficking or organized crime activity. \n     Maximum capacity provides a safety-net that would enable \n     telecommunications carriers to expeditiously respond to \n     serious, unpredictable, emergencies that require very \n     unusual levels of interception capacity.\n\n\n                            Actual Capacity\n\n       Under CALEA, estimates of actual capacity are to apply to \n     all simultaneous interception activity that may be conducted \n     by the date that is 4 years after the date of enactment of \n     CALEA. CALEA makes clear that actual capacity represents only \n     a portion of the maximum capacity. Actual capacity thus \n     pertains to the amount of interception activity that \n     potentially may be needed when many of CALEA's requirements \n     are scheduled to take effect in October 1998. Consequently, \n     when viewing the maximum and actual capacity levels set forth \n     in the Initial Capacity Notice, realistically only the actual \n     capacity estimates should be construed as in any way \n     reflecting the amount of simultaneous interception activity \n     that potentially may be conducted by law enforcement in any \n     geographic area as of October 1998.\n\n\n                          Methodology Overview\n\n       The CALEA mandate which obligates the Attorney General to \n     estimate future capacity marks the first time (a) that \n     information has been required to be provided to carriers in \n     order for them to properly design and size future networks \n     with reference to interception activity; and (b) that the \n     entire law enforcement community has been required to project \n     its collective potential future interception needs, thereby \n     in effect placing possible technological limitations on its \n     lawful authority to conduct electronic surveillance. This \n     circumstance, as viewed by the law enforcement community, \n     obviously generates great and legitimate concern, because \n     historically telephone technology placed no constraints on \n     law enforcement's court ordered electronic surveillance \n     authority. If not implemented with care, CALEA could have the \n     unintended effect of potentially placing restrictions on the \n     lawful use of electronic surveillance authority. Thus, if law \n     enforcement errs by underscoping its potential, legitimate, \n     and lawful interception needs, effective law enforcement will \n     be hampered and, more importantly, the public safety will be \n     jeopardized.\n       The FBI, which is implementing many of the responsibilities \n     conferred upon the Attorney General by CALEA, was required to \n     issue the capacity notice. In order to meet this obligation, \n     we proceeded by employing a rigorous, comprehensive \n     methodology to acquire critically needed information and to \n     establish analytic tools for determining the simultaneous \n     interception activity of the recent past and for estimating \n     future maximum and actual capacity.\n       The methodology used was intended to take into \n     consideration the concerns of the parties principally \n     affected by CALEA. On the one hand, CALEA provides law \n     enforcement with an opportunity and means to ensure that its \n     future electronic surveillance needs can be met. On the \n     other hand, CALEA presents an opportunity and means for \n     telecommunications carriers to understand the nature and \n     extent of their obligations to accommodate law \n     enforcement's electronic surveillance needs and to do so \n     in a way that will not be unduly burdensome or excessive. \n     Law enforcement's approach and perspective regarding its \n     electronic surveillance needs relate to its mission to \n     combat serious crime, acts of terrorism, and acts of \n     violence. Traditionally, this mission has been tied to law \n     enforcement agencies' geographically-based jurisdiction \n     and associated jurisdictional legal authority. \n     Telecommunications carriers' approach and perspective \n     regarding law enforcement's electronic surveillance needs, \n     however, chiefly relate to the effect such needs may have \n     on particular components within their systems that are \n     used to serve subscribers within a given market (i.e., \n     switches and other network components).\n       As a goal, law enforcement sought to harmonize the \n     different approaches and perspectives of these parties in its \n     methodology. The methodology sought to produce a result that \n     acknowledged and factored in the interrelationship between \n     the geographic, jurisdictional contours of law enforcement \n     interception activity and the geographic service areas \n     covered by the carrier switching facilities that will be \n     likely used to provide interception access. By identifying \n     key pieces of \n\n[[Page S1168]]\n     data associated with these approaches and perspectives, we were able to \n     formulate and then analyze past interception activity in \n     terms that enabled us to establish one of the key components \n     (one pertaining to past peak levels of interception activity \n     in localities of various sizes) in an equation leading to an \n     estimate of future interception capacity. The other key \n     component (one pertaining to projected growth) was derived \n     from a statistical model that included a number of variables \n     reasonably believed to predict potential future capacity \n     bounds and potential future interception needs. Once the \n     projections were made to estimate future capacity needs, the \n     results were reviewed and adjusted to ensure reasonableness \n     before publishing the results in the Initial Capacity Notice.\n       By presenting capacity levels in the Initial Capacity \n     Notice with reference to engineered capacity (discussed \n     below), the FBI intended to express interception capacity in \n     an understandable fashion as a percentage of a carrier's \n     switch or other network component capacity. This approach was \n     intended to enable carriers to tailor their technological \n     responses to law enforcement's potential interception needs \n     within specific types of geographic areas. The following \n     discussion highlights the methodological steps used to arrive \n     at the actual and maximum capacity figures published in the \n     Initial Capacity Notice.\n\n\n      part one: deriving key data from past interception activity\n\n       As a first step, we sought to establish a baseline of past \n     simultaneous interception activity. Information concerning \n     the actual number of all types of simultaneous interceptions \n     occurring throughout the United States in the recent past was \n     collected. Such information, needed to establish the \n     baseline, had never before been collected and did not exist \n     in a single repository. Amassing this detailed and extremely \n     sensitive information required an unprecedented and time-\n     consuming effort on the part of law enforcement. It involved \n     identifying sources from which accurate information could be \n     retrieved in an efficient and effective manner. \n     Specifically, we sought to identify sources that could \n     provide the exact number of all types of interceptions (to \n     include call content, pen register, and trap and trace) \n     performed by all federal, State, and local law enforcement \n     agencies, in terms of the actual number of telephone lines \n     \\3\\ intercepted at each locality.\n       To obtain specific line-related information regarding past \n     simultaneous electronic surveillance activity, records of \n     interception activity were acquired from telecommunications \n     carriers, law enforcement officials, and most importantly, \n     from the Federal and State Clerks of Court's offices--the \n     official repository for all interceptions conducted \n     simultaneously between January 1, 1993 and March 1, 1995, for \n     all geographic locations. Specifically, highly sensitive \n     interception information pertaining to each interception \n     start/end dates, and to area code and exchange was collected. \n     The period January 1, 1993 to March 1, 1995 was chosen in \n     order to obtain recent interception information that was \n     reasonably retrievable given the time constraint of one year \n     imposed by the CALEA with regard to publishing a capacity \n     notice.\n       Approximately 1500 telecommunications carriers (those \n     serving the majority of subscribers in the U.S., and \n     representing the largest of the wireline and cellular \n     telephone companies (as of March 1995)) were requested to \n     provide information that would identify where and how many \n     interceptions had occurred within their networks during the \n     period of study. Acquisition and examination of sensitive \n     electronic surveillance records maintained pursuant to \n     statute under seal with the Clerks of Court offices was \n     pursued through two separate efforts. All Federal court order \n     information was collected pursuant to special court orders \n     directing the unsealing of interception court orders for the \n     limited purpose of enabling the Attorney General/FBI to \n     comply with the capacity notice obligation. State and local \n     law enforcement information was obtained through the State \n     Attorneys General (AG) offices. Each State AG was requested \n     to coordinate the collection of interception information \n     within the AG's respective State.\n       By reviewing the data collected, the number of simultaneous \n     interceptions that had occurred within switching facilities \n     was identified throughout the country during the study \n     period. One of the key pieces of relevant information was the \n     highest number of interceptions that had ever occurred \n     simultaneously within any telecommunications carrier's \n     switch.\\5\\\n       For the years studied, the highest number of simultaneous \n     interceptions occurring within any one switch in the United \n     States was 220; that is, 220 pen register, trap and trace \n     and/or call content interceptions were active at the same \n     time within a particular switch. Further analysis revealed \n     that the 220 interception number far exceeded the number of \n     simultaneous interceptions conducted in other high activity \n     switches and was due to a single unusual occurrence. The \n     switch that had the second highest level of simultaneous \n     activity supported 120 pen register, trap and trace and/or \n     call content interceptions.\n       The distribution of baseline simultaneous interception \n     activity by switch was varied. Among switches which had \n     supported interceptions during the period studied, there was \n     a broad and varied distribution of simultaneous interceptions \n     ranging from 1 to 120. Switches with the greatest levels of \n     interception activity frequently existed in urban areas. \n     Switches with lower levels of interception activity existed \n     across a variety of geographic areas, encompassing urban, \n     suburban, and rural areas.\n       The review of the baseline of interception activity yielded \n     certain key data on simultaneous interceptions for specific \n     switching systems, but law enforcement usually approaches \n     crime within the context of geographic or jurisdictional \n     areas. The next analysis challenge was to associate the \n     baseline simultaneous interception data on specific switches \n     with law enforcement's need to express requirements relative \n     to geographic areas. To do this, law enforcement sought to \n     identify geographic boundaries that could provide common \n     reference points between law enforcement and \n     telecommunications carriers.\n       A number of geographic boundaries which define service \n     areas of telecommunications carriers were considered (e.g., \n     State lines, local access transport areas (LATA), \n     metropolitan statistical areas (MSA), rural service areas \n     (RSA), and major and basic trading areas (MTA, BTA)). \n     However, in each case, these boundaries did not provide a \n     good match with defined law enforcement areas. Law \n     enforcement jurisdictional legal authority in a great number \n     of cases is defined by county boundaries (i.e., for local law \n     enforcement agencies). County boundaries rarely change and \n     are not disputable. In most cases, a group of counties are \n     encompassed by the boundaries that define a \n     telecommunications carrier's service area. Consequently, \n     county boundaries were used as the common reference tool in \n     formulating an analysis for future capacity.\n       From the baseline of interception activity, interception \n     data was aggregated for a group of specific switches by \n     county. Switches were assigned to counties based on their \n     geographic location. The data can be divided into their \n     different levels (or categories) or interception activity: \n     high, moderate, and low.\n       As part of the consultative process with the \n     telecommunications carriers, law enforcement understood that \n     one of the primary carrier concerns with regard to capacity \n     was that each switch in a carrier's network should not be \n     held to the same requirement for capacity levels. The \n     carriers had indicated generally that although CALEA requires \n     the Attorney General to estimate future capacity sizings and \n     to estimate future potential interception activity that may \n     occur in their network, every attempt should be made by law \n     enforcement to express its needs in accordance with the \n     variability of interceptions that had occurred in the past. \n     Recognizing this, we chose to define law enforcement's \n     potential future interception needs using categories and not \n     just one absolute number that would apply without regard to \n     the often varied nature of interceptions in a carrier's \n     geographic service area.\n       As a result of considering the relative relationships \n     between law enforcement and telecommunications carriers \n     geographic areas, it was determined that three separate \n     categories for stating capacity requirements should be \n     created. The use of categories permitted capacity \n     requirements to be stated in a way that reasonably reflected, \n     and was responsive to, law enforcement interception needs \n     without unduly burdening all carriers with the same level of \n     capacity or requiring a particular carrier to provide the \n     same capacity level everywhere in its network. As alluded to \n     in the Initial Capacity Notice, Category I represents a small \n     number of geographic areas where the greatest level of \n     interception activity typically has occurred and is likely to \n     occur. Category II also represents a relatively small number \n     of geographic areas, which consist of some urban and suburban \n     areas. Category III represents the vast majority of areas \n     where electronic surveillance activity has historically been \n     low or nonexistent, principally in rural and many suburban \n     areas.\n       With regard to Category III, as the nation moves toward the \n     future, law enforcement must have the capability to conduct a \n     minimum level of electronic surveillance in any locality, \n     regardless of previous levels of criminal activity or prior \n     levels of electronic surveillance activity. Terrorism, drug \n     trafficking, and violent crimes are constant and \n     unpredictable threats to the public in all localities, as \n     evidenced by the Oklahoma City bombing in April 1995. \n     Consequently, unlike Categories I and II, which are defined \n     principally with reference to past levels of electronic \n     surveillance activity, Category III constitutes a minimum \n     interception capacity for any location in which law \n     enforcement may need an interception capability in order to \n     protect the public and effectively enforce the law.\n       Once the geographic areas could be generally (but only \n     tentatively) associated with each category, the historic \n     baseline of interception activity for these areas could be \n     used as a way of defining the distinct levels of past \n     electronic surveillance activity. For the Category I level, \n     as noted above, the highest number of simultaneous \n     interceptions from a switch was 120. Our analysis also \n     determined that within the Category II level the highest \n     number of simultaneous interceptions from a switch was 42.\n\n\n             the use of percentages and engineered capacity\n\n       Law enforcement considered it appropriate and prudent to \n     express capacity requirements in the Initial Capacity Notice \n     in \n\n[[Page S1169]]\n     terms of a percentage rather than as a fixed number for several \n     reasons. First, percentages are very appropriate, if not \n     essential, with regard to new service providers, new \n     switches, new services, and new technologies. If absolute \n     numbers were set forth, the introduction of new basic \n     service, as well as more advanced services and features, \n     could be impeded--a prospect that is unacceptable to either \n     the Congress, law enforcement, or the telecommunications \n     industry. Second, percentages allow capacity requirements to \n     adjust slightly to a changing subscriber base as it increases \n     or decreases over time.\n       To enable carriers to apply the percentages to the affected \n     systems in their networks properly, capacity level \n     percentages were tied to engineered capacity. Engineered \n     capacity was referred to in the Initial Capacity Notice as \n     the maximum number of subscribers that can be served by a \n     carrier's equipment, facilities, or service. In the main, a \n     carrier's switching facility was the key network component \n     associated with this foregoing terminology. With regard to \n     the highest level of simultaneous interception activity in \n     the baseline data with regard to Category I (120), the switch \n     associated with that interception activity was one that \n     typically served an average of 35,000 subscribers. This led \n     to the historical electronic surveillance activity being \n     expressed as a percentage of engineered capacity of 0.34%. \n     This percentage was derived by dividing the 120 simultaneous \n     interceptions by 35,000 subscribers. With regard to the \n     highest level of simultaneous interception activity noted in \n     the baseline data occurring with regard to Category II (42), \n     the switch associated with that interception activity was one \n     that typically served an average of 27,000 subscribers. This \n     led to the historical electronic surveillance activity being \n     expressed as a percentage of engineered capacity of 0.16%. \n     This percentage was derived by dividing the 42 simultaneous \n     interceptions by 27,000 subscribers.\n       As discussed above, the interception activity which was now \n     being associated with Category III reflected little or no \n     activity in the past. Hence the capacity level associated \n     with Category III was dervived in a different manner. To \n     establish a percentage regarding areas where there had been \n     little or no past interception activity, for purposes of \n     future analyses, we examined the distribution of historical \n     interception activity for those switches with very little or \n     not interception activity. The majority of these switches had \n     electronic surveillance activity of less than 0.1% of the \n     capacity associated with such switches. This led law \n     enforcement to assign 0.1% as the level of historical \n     electronic surveillance activity for Category III, expressed \n     as a percentage of engineered capacity. This figure, \n     therefore, was selected essentially to ensure a bare minimum \n     capacity to support law enforcement interceptions.\n\n\npart two: estimating and using growth rates to project future capacity \n                       and interception activity\n\n       CALEA's mandate that law enforcement identify capacity \n     requirements marked the first time future carrier capacity \n     sizings and future potential interception activity were \n     required to be estimated. Although CALEA provided no specific \n     date as an outer bound for the projection for maximum \n     capacity, the year 2004 was used for its projection of \n     maximum capacity. We used the year 2004 because it \n     reflects a ten year period from the last date for which \n     historical data was available (1994). A ten year period is \n     commonly used as a period of time within which to analyze \n     and prepare projections. An analysis of a period of this \n     length also provides the affected telecommunications \n     carriers with the information that would produce the \n     greatest level of stability for the mid-term to \n     intermediate future. By comparison, CALEA specifies \n     October 1998 as the date for projecting potential future \n     interception activity (actual capacity).\n       Four steps were followed to determine the maximum and \n     actual capacity percentages which were published in the \n     Initial Capacity Notice. These four steps are as follows:\n\n\n step 1: establishing a statistical model; projecting title iii court \n Order trends as a predicate for projecting future design capacity and \n                 potential future interception activity\n\n       Projections regarding future design capacity that may be \n     required to accommodate unusual future interception activity, \n     as well as the amount of potential future interception \n     activity itself (call content interceptions, as well as the \n     much more prevalent pen register and trap and trace \n     interceptions), in terms of the number of lines that possibly \n     could be implicated, are not readily and easily derived. For \n     example, when one considers just one of the relevant groups \n     of information (past Title III court order authorizations) it \n     becomes apparent that a simple straight line trend does not \n     exist. In reviewing the number of such authorizations on a \n     yearly basis over the last 15 years (1980-1994), there is \n     over a 100% increase (from 566 to 1154). However, the year to \n     year increases are anything but consistent, with variations \n     from -12% to +19% occurring by way of yearly changes.\n       Although it may be impossible to discern precisely why \n     increases (or decreases) occur on a yearly basis with regard \n     to all of the types of interception activity, a number of \n     factors were considered (discussed further below) which over \n     time presumably would logically influence such activity. In \n     brief, these factors relate to population, telecommunications \n     technology, law enforcement resources, and relevant crime \n     statistics.\n       Notwithstanding the difficulty in making long range \n     estimations about a design capacity level capable of \n     accommodating reasonable growth over the intermediate future \n     (1998-2004) and which, more importantly, could also address \n     totally unexpected worst case scenarios (maximum capacity) \n     and future potential, interception activity (actual \n     capacity), in terms of the number of lines implicated, we \n     were obligated to respond to CALEA's mandate to produce \n     capacity estimates.\n       Law enforcement determined that it was imperative to \n     construct and utilize an analytical statistical model in \n     order to address the variability related to relevant \n     historical data that could be associated with interception \n     activity. The model selected was a widely-used model referred \n     to as a multi-variable linear regression statistical model. \n     With such a model, future trends central to predicting \n     capacity could be projected.\n       In broad terms, this model sought to project potential \n     future behavior based upon an analysis of the relationships \n     between two data groups for which historical data was \n     available over the last 15 years. One data group was the \n     number of criminal Title III court orders authorized between \n     1980 and 1994. The other data group was composed of a suite \n     of relevant factors (multi-variables) related to population, \n     telecommunications technology, law enforcement resources, and \n     relevant crime statistics. Once trend relationships were \n     noted between the second group and the first, an equation was \n     produced from which projections as to the future level of the \n     first group (Title III court orders) could be established \n     based on growth projections of the second group. The \n     projection for the criminal Title III court order \n     authorizations was an important analytic first step in \n     projecting the design capacity and future potential \n     interception activity in terms of the number of lines \n     (interceptions) that may be involved.\n       The first data group consisted of the number of Title III \n     court order authorizations recorded per year in the Wiretap \n     Report, compiled each year by the Administrative Office of \n     the United States Courts. In an attempt to establish a trend, \n     we examined the criminal Title III court order authorizations \n     granted per year over the last 15 years (1980-1994). As noted \n     above, however, an examination of this data showed \n     significant yearly fluctuations thereby precluding a simple, \n     straight line trend for approximating future authorizations. \n     Also, as noted above, the Wiretap Report only documents the \n     number of criminal Title III court orders; it does not \n     specify the actual number of call content interceptions \n     associated with each order, nor does it address at all the \n     vastly greater number of interceptions associated with pen \n     registers and traps and traces. Nonetheless, because it was \n     the only longstanding electronic surveillance data source in \n     existence, it was concluded that it necessarily should play \n     an important role in the model because it did document past, \n     relevant interception-related information from which \n     projections of design capacity and future potential \n     interception activity could later be made.\n       The second data group consisted of factors or multi-\n     variables deemed relevant with regard to the conduct of all \n     types of interception activity. These factors, as noted \n     above, were population, telecommunications technology, law \n     enforcement resources, and relevant crime statistics. \n     Historical and projected future data on population totals was \n     collected from the United States Census Bureau. Historical \n     and projected future data for wireline telecommunications \n     subscribers was collected from the Federal Communications \n     Commission. Historical data on wireless subscribers was \n     acquired from reviewing publications issued by the Cellular \n     Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA). Projected \n     future data for wireless subscribers was derived based upon \n     an analysis of information found in trade journals concerning \n     future projections of the number of wireless subscribers and \n     attributed to the CTIA, the Personal Communications Industry \n     Association, and other industry sources. Historical data on \n     total number of law enforcement officers and reported \n     incidents of violent crime was collected from the FBI's \n     Uniform Crime Report. Projected future data on the total \n     number of law enforcement officers and crime was derived \n     based on an assumed linear growth rate of the historical \n     data. For each of the above factors, projections for future \n     data were made out to the year 2004.\n\n\n                     step 2: computing growth rates\n\n       Using the projected future data produced by the equation, \n     the statistics indicated a growth rate of 130% in the first \n     group between 1994 and 2004, a factor which was included in \n     the subsequent analysis used to project maximum (design) \n     capacity. By comparison, a projection for potential future \n     interception activity (actual capacity) was arrived at by \n     noting the statistics in the first group, that had applied \n     the same trends projected by the statistical model, \n     suggesting a growth rate between 1994 and 1998 of 54 percent. \n     As noted above, when one reviews the number of criminal Title \n     III court order authorizations on a yearly basis during the \n     last 15 years (1980-1994), there is more than a 100% increase \n     (from 566 to 1154). Also, when one reviews available official \n     reports regarding the vastly more prevalent pen register and \n     trap and trace court orders granted during the last 8 years, \n     one observes an increase \n\n[[Page S1170]]\n     of 219%. Finally, for the same period, with regard to such pen register \n     and trap and trace court orders ``the number of persons whose \n     telephone facilities were affected'' increased by 345%.\\6\\ \n     Consequently, the model's results are considered to be \n     reasonable and consistent with past interception-related \n     activity and appropriate for use as part of the analysis.\n\n\n     step 3: projections for design capacity and potential future \n                         interception activity\n\n       As noted above, the historical interception activity \n     expressed as a percentage of engineered capacity for Category \n     I was 0.34% (120 simultaneous interceptions out of a switch \n     serving a possible 35,000 subscribers); and the historical \n     interception activity expressed as a percentage of engineered \n     capacity for Category II was 0.16% (42 simultaneous \n     interceptions out of a switch serving a possible 27,000 \n     subscribers). For Category III, the minimum level of \n     interception activity expressed as a percentage of engineered \n     capacity was 0.1%. The computed growth rates of 130% and 54% \n     were converted into growth multipliers of 2.3 and 1.54, for \n     maximum and actual capacity, respectively. By multiplying the \n     historical interception activity figures for Category I, \n     Category II, and Category III by the growth multipliers, we \n     calculated numbers for a ``raw'' maximum and actual capacity, \n     as illustrated in the table below.\n\n     RAW MAXIMUM AND ACTUAL CAPACITY PREDICTED BY THE GROWTH FACTORS    \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        Maximum             Actual      \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCategory I......................  0.34%2.3=0.78%....  0.34%1.54=0.52%   \nCategory II.....................  0.16%2.3=0.37%....  0.16%1.54=0.25%   \nCategory III....................  0.10%2.3=0.23%....  0.10%1.54=0.15%   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    step 4: applying reasonableness criteria to the raw calculations\n\n       In projecting future design capacity (maximum capacity) and \n     capacity for potential future interception activity (actual \n     capacity) that may be needed by all law enforcement agencies, \n     for publication in the Federal Register, the FBI made \n     downward adjustments to the numbers that were set forth with \n     regard to the raw actual capacity in both Categories I and \n     III. A substantial downward adjustment was made in Category \n     III. These downward adjustments were made because law \n     environment recognized that a majority of the affected \n     telecommunications carriers fall in Category III, and that \n     our historical interception activity was minimal in this \n     category. Therefore, we chose to lessen the burden on the \n     telecommunications industry and minimize the costs of \n     installing solutions, consistent with assuring an essential \n     minimum level of interception capacity.\n       The numbers set forth for the raw maximum capacity in \n     Categories I, II, and III were adjusted upward for a number \n     of reasons. First, as noted above, the interception activity \n     associated with pen registers and traps and traces by far \n     represents the most frequently used type of interception. The \n     growth rate in the number of pen register and trap and trace \n     court orders far exceeds that projected in the statistical \n     analysis. As noted above, the percentage of increase in such \n     court orders during the past 8 years was 219% and the number \n     of persons whose telephone facilities were affected increased \n     345%.\n       Second, although the peak number of simultaneous \n     interceptions identified in the baseline data was 220, we \n     elected not to use it in the statistical analysis because it \n     was deemed to be an anomaly. However, this level of \n     interception activity, although anomalous, is indicative of \n     the type of worst-case scenarios that law enforcement should \n     not easily ignore or completely discount. Hence some \n     provision needs to be made for such situations.\n       Third, although every effort was made to capture as \n     accurately as possible the actual levels of past interception \n     activity in compiling our baseline of historical intercept \n     information, there may be some instances where data was not \n     fully collected or reported. Also, there is an amount of \n     interception activity associate with national security that \n     must be accounted for in the final capacity projections.\n       Fourth, during the study period (1980-1994), the number of \n     States granting State and local law enforcement interception \n     authority by statute increased and a number of \n     States expanded interception authority to cover additional \n     types of crimes and/or additional types of communications \n     devices (e.g., cellular telephones and pagers). There is a \n     reasonable likelihood that in the future other States may \n     grant similar interception authority and/or increase the \n     scope of existing interception authority.\n       Finally, law enforcement believed that judgment needed to \n     be brought to bear on the numbers for raw actual and maximum \n     capacity, in terms of making appropriate upward or downward \n     adjustments. In particular, the FBI, acting on behalf of the \n     entire law enforcement community, had a responsibility to be \n     careful not to overstate or understate capacity needs. \n     Importantly, however, if capacity needs were understated it \n     could pose direct harm to the public safety and effective law \n     enforcement.\n\n\n                        initial capacity notice\n\n       On October 16, 1995, the FBI published in the Federal \n     Register its Initial Capacity Notice. The estimates of actual \n     and maximum capacity, expressed as a percentage of engineered \n     capacity, were stated as follows in the Initial Capacity \n     Notice:\n\n ESTIMATES FOR PROJECTED MAXIMUM AND ACTUAL CAPACITY AS PUBLISHED IN THE\n                            FEDERAL REGISTER                            \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    Maximum     Actual  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCategory I......................................      1.00%       0.50% \nCategory II.....................................      0.50%       0.25% \nCategory III....................................      0.25%       0.05% \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       After the FBI's publication of the Initial Capacity Notice \n     in the Federal Register, you requested two documents in your \n     correspondence: (1) the historical baseline of electronic \n     surveillance activity, and (2) an analysis of that activity. \n     By way of response and clarification, although we examined \n     past electronic surveillance activity and utilized certain \n     key pieces of information derived therefrom as discussed in \n     this letter, no ``document'', as such, was ever created. \n     Similarly, the factors utilized in our analysis were never \n     compiled into a document.\n       Nonetheless, because of the interest and the \n     misunderstandings that have been associated with this matter, \n     we currently are in the process of preparing two methodology \n     documents which will explain our capacity notice efforts in \n     greater depth. The first document will describe the process \n     used to collect historical electronic surveillance \n     information. The second document will describe the analysis \n     used in developing the Initial Capacity Notice, as well as \n     the Final Capacity Notice. Regarding the latter, it will take \n     into account the written comments we have received and the \n     input from our ongoing meetings with the telecommunications \n     industry and other interest groups. The FBI will provide \n     copies of these two documents to you upon their completion.\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       As you are aware, in 1968 when Congress statutorily \n     authorized court ordered electronic surveillance, telephone \n     technology permitted law enforcement to execute, without \n     impairment, essentially all court orders--a 100 percent \n     capability/capacity to accommodate law enforcement's court \n     ordered electronic surveillance needs. However, the onset of \n     new and advanced technologies has begun to erode the capacity \n     and capability of the telecommunications industry to support \n     law enforcement's interception needs. For the first time, \n     technological limitations will potentially be set on law \n     enforcement's ability to lawfully conduct electronic \n     surveillance. In view of these potential limitations, an \n     attempt was made to estimate law enforcement's capacity needs \n     in an accurate and reasonable manner with the goal of \n     striking a balance of meeting law enforcement's interception \n     needs without introducing unduly burdensome or excessive \n     requirements on telecommunications carriers. This in no way \n     changes law enforcement's fundamental statutory \n     responsibility to obtain proper legal authority to conduct \n     electronic surveillance. CALEA's capacity requirements simply \n     ensure that, after law enforcement obtains proper legal \n     authority, telecommunications carriers will have sufficient \n     capacity to accommodate lawfully authorized electronic \n     surveillance activity.\n       To project capacity needs, the previously described \n     national methodology was employed in order to prepare an \n     Initial Capacity Notice for publication in the Federal \n     Register. Since release of the Notice, law enforcement has \n     met with privacy advocates, the telecommunications industry, \n     and other interested parties to clarify and further describe \n     how best to apply capacity needs within a given carrier's \n     network, and it is reviewing and considering the formal \n     written comments provided in response to the Initial Capacity \n     Notice.\n       In closing, CALEA is important to the public safety and \n     national security of this nation and its full and timely \n     implementation is critically important to the American \n     public. On behalf of the law enforcement community, we would \n     again like to express our appreciation for your support and \n     leadership regarding this significant and complex issue. With \n     the continued support of the Congress, we are confident that \n     CALEA will be fully implemented in an effective and efficient \n     manner.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ For purposes of this discussion, the word \n     ``interception'' refers to all types of interceptions: (1) \n     interceptions of communication content (e.g., Title III); and \n     (2) interceptions of dialing-related information (call \n     identifying information) derived from pen registers and traps \n     and traces.\n     \\2\\ 47 U.S.C. 1003 (1994).\n     \\3\\ For purposes of this discussion, the word ``lines'' \n     refers to the transmission path from a subscriber's terminal \n     to the network via a wireline or wireless medium.\n     \\4\\ Although a valuable source for historical information on \n     criminal Title III (call content) court orders, The Wiretap \n     Report, published annually by the Administrative Office of \n     the United States Courts, does not identify the actual number \n     of interception lines associated with each court order or, \n     more importantly, with the vastly greater number of lines \n     associated with pen register and trap and trace interceptions \n     that have been performed by all law enforcement agencies. \n     Even though the FBI used information pertaining to the number \n     of court orders reported in The Wiretap Report as an \n     essential element for forecasting purposes, the Report does \n     not contain the line-related information that was needed to \n     identify the actual level of past interception activity \n     related to specific switches.\n     \\5\\ For purposes of this discussion, the term ``switch'' also \n     represents a licensed cellular service area.\n     \\6\\ 18 U.S.C. 3126 (1986).

This report includes information concerning the \n     number of original orders, extensions, the number of \n     investigations, the number of persons whose telephone \n     facilities were affected, and the number of overall dialings.\n     \n[[Page S1171]]\n\n\n           TRANSFER OF NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY TO THIRD COUNTRIES\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today as the Chairman of the \nSubcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs to express my grave \nconcern at recent reports regarding the sale or transfer by the \nPeople's Republic of China of nuclear technology to third countries.\n  It has been widely reported in the domestic press that the U.S. \nintelligence agencies have thoroughly credible evidence that these \nsales have occurred; I have seen some of this evidence myself, as have \nmany of my colleagues, and find it to be overwhelming.\n  In the past, we have seen evidence of missile sales to Pakistan, and \nthe transfer of certain nuclear technology to Iran, in violation of \nUnited States law and international nuclear agreements. The most recent \nreports involved the sale of over 5,000 ring magnets to Pakistan. These \nmagnets are component parts of centrifuges used to enrich uranium to \nmake it weapons-grade. The magnets are made of a highly advanced alloy, \nand according to experts will significantly enhance Pakistan's nuclear \nprogram by allowing its laboratory at Kahuta to upgrade its centrifuges \nat the rate of between 1,000 and 2,000 per year.\n  The People's Republic of China has not denied that the sale took \nplace. Somewhat inconsistently, Pakistan categorically denies these \nreports. Mr. President, Karachi's denials ring completely hollow. How \nmany times did the Pakistani Government deny that it was pursuing the \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons, only to have the United States produce \nirrefutable evidence to the contrary? How many times did they assure us \nthat they had no such intentions, only to be caught sneaking behind our \nbacks doing the precise things they denied? Mr. President, one hates to \nuse the word ``lie,'' but as the saying goes--if the shoe fits.\n  Almost more troubling than the sales themselves, Mr. President, is \nwhat is shaping up to be the Clinton administration's completely \ninadequate response to the sales. Under U.S. law, we are required to \nimpose a variety of sanctions on any nation selling nuclear weapons \ntechnology in violation of nonproliferation commitments. Only if the \nPresident states that requirement because of the national interest are \nthe sanctions waived.\n  Here, we have solid evidence that the People's Republic of China has \nviolated its agreements in this regard. The failure to impose the \nsanctions required by our laws, I believe, is a mistake of the greatest \nmagnitude. I can think of no worse signal to send the Chinese \nGovernment than for us to draw a line in the sand, have them cross it, \nand for us to shrug it off and say ``now don't do that again.'' The \nChinese are quick to pick up on occasions when we fail to stick to our \nguns, and only see it as encouragement. This is why I have been so \nsupportive of U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. He has told the \nChinese in the trade arena that if they do not abide by their \nagreements, there will be a price to pay. And, when necessary, he has \nmoved steadfastly to impose that price in the form of sanctions. The \nChinese, recognizing the strength of such a position, have subsequently \nbacked down and honored their agreements.\n  For us to back down from our principles in this matter is to \ncompletely call into question our determination in a host of other \nareas, the security of Taiwan comes immediately to mind, and as Senator \nSpecter has noted ``make[s] our national policy a laughing stock and \nencourage[s] a proliferation of nuclear weapons.'' Yet the Clinton \nadministration is showing every sign of being willing to shrug off the \nPeople's Republic of China actions, rap them on the nose, and ask them \nto please not do it again.\n  During the 1992 presidential campaign, candidate Clinton took \nPresident Bush to task for ``coddling dictators''--especially the \nChinese. Well Mr. President, like he has on so many other issues that \nwere central to his campaign President Clinton has flip-flopped on this \none, saying one thing but doing some thing completely different. I ask \nmy colleagues, who is doing the coddling now? The White House appears \nclose to waiving sanctions because it is worried about offending China \nand because it is kowtowing to United States business interests in an \nelection year afraid of the effects on their bottom-line that sanctions \nmight have.\n  Can you imagine that, Mr. President? As the Washington Post pointed \nout this morning, ``The Chinese are the accused violators, and the \nAmericans--as the complaining and injured party--are backing off.'' \nThis administration is backing off in the shortsighted hope that \nBeijing has learned its lesson and won't do it again. It's like telling \na child not to take a cookie, watching him take it, but not telling him \nhe's a bad boy in the hopes that maybe he won't want to take another \ncookie. And this is not the only area in which the Clinton \nadministration is coddling Beijing. USTR Kantor, who has on several \noccasions urged the White House to impose sanctions on the PRC because \nit is still in violation of several of the key provisions of the Sino-\nAmerican intellectual property rights agreement, has been prevented by \nthis administration from setting a deadline for Chinese compliance for \nfear of upsetting the violators of that agreement.\n  Mr. President, I join my colleagues in both Houses in calling for the \nimposition of the sanctions required by U.S. law in this case. We need \nto say what me mean, and then do what we say. Any failure or hesitation \nto do so can only be interpreted in Beijing as a sign of weakness, and \nsets a very dangerous precedent that we will regret down the road.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to speak briefly this morning on two \nsubjects. The first concerns an announcement that the Senator from \nMinnesota, who is presiding as of this moment, and I and Senator Bob \nSmith made yesterday relating to a constitutional amendment proposal \nwhich we are soon going to be introducing in the Senate, which has \nalready been introduced in the House with about 150 cosponsors, which \nwe hope will be quickly adopted by both the House and Senate and sent \nto the States for ratification, in reference to a constitutional \namendment to require a supermajority of two-thirds voting to approve \nany tax increase at the Federal Government level.\n  We want to do this because of the possibility, and I hope the \nprobability, that some form of simple, single-rate tax reform could be \nadopted sometime after next January. Some proponents call it a flat \ntax. But a tax proposal of the kind that I support would include \nexemptions and certain deductions, so it cannot be properly \ncharacterized as a pure flat tax, but a simpler tax rate system with a \nlimited number of deductions and exemptions is the kind of tax reform \nthat most Americans seem very supportive of at this time, and which I \nhope the Congress will adopt.\n  If that occurs, it will be doubly important for us to ensure that tax \nrates cannot easily be increased. Because without the deductions, \ncredits, and exemptions that taxpayers can take advantage of today to \nshelter their income, if tax rates are increased, once those exemptions \nand deductions and credits have been eliminated from the Tax Code, \nwhich is what we propose to do, there will be nowhere to go if Congress \nthen begins to raise the single tax rate. That is why we think we need \na constitutional requirement of a two-thirds support for such a tax \nincrease in order to protect the taxpayers of America.\n  Let me quote from the Kemp report. The Kemp Commission was a \ncommission appointed by Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole and House \nSpeaker Newt Gingrich to look into the question of fundamental tax \nreform and to make recommendations. It was chaired by former HUD \nSecretary Jack \n\n[[Page S1172]]\nKemp. Here is what the Kemp report says with regard to this proposal.\n\n       The roller-coaster ride of tax policy in the past few \n     decades has fed citizens' cynicism about the possibility of \n     real, long-term reform, while fueling frustration with \n     Washington. The initial optimism inspired by the low rates of \n     the 1986 Tax Reform Act soured into disillusionment and anger \n     when taxes subsequently were hiked two times in less than \n     seven years. The commission concludes that a two-thirds \n     super-majority vote of Congress will earn Americans' \n     confidence in the longevity, predictability, and stability of \n     any new tax system.\n\n  That is what we hope to achieve by a simpler, fairer, single-rate tax \nsystem: stability, predictability and longevity. But if Congress can \nquickly raise the rate after we have put such a system into effect, \nthen that stability and longevity and predictability will have been \neroded. That is why we think it is important to make it a little bit \nmore difficult for Congress to raise taxes by requiring a two-thirds \nvote.\n  Let me note a couple of things about some history here. Since the \nlast attempt at comprehensive reform in 1986, when the number of tax \nbrackets were reduced from 14 down to 2, there have been 4,000 \namendments to the Tax Code in less than 10 years. The number of tax \nrates, of course, is back up to five. But 4,000 amendments? It is too \neasy to change the Tax Code. Many of those amendments, of course, \nresulted in taxpayers paying more money. Not only have the rules \nchanged in the middle of the game for many taxpayers, but for many it \nwas after the game was over. The 1993 Clinton tax increase \nretroactively raised taxes, even on the dead.\n  The frequency of changes not only makes people more vulnerable to tax \nincreases but also makes it virtually impossible to make financial \nplans for the future, whether to save for a child's education or invest \nin your business or set money aside in a pension fund--or hold it to \npay taxes. If you have to have that possibility, then you cannot \npredict with certainty that you can invest in these more important \nthings. So the tax limitation amendment puts an end to that volatility \nby requiring there be sufficient consensus and partisan support around \nthe country before taxes will be raised again.\n  One final point. To the extent we are interested in reducing the \npower of the special interests, of the lobbyists who come to change the \nTax Code to get special benefits for their particular interest, to \nreduce their tax burden, to create a loophole, as it were--this two-\nthirds majority requirement would really put an end to that kind of \npractice because, if we assume that we want to continue to collect a \nroughly equal amount of revenue and that therefore any proposal would \nhave to be revenue neutral, any proposal to create a loophole for a \nspecial interest and therefore result in less money to the Treasury \nwould necessarily require that tax revenues be raised in some other \narea. But to do that would require a two-thirds vote. So I think \nMembers of the House and Senate would look much more skeptically at \nproposals to reduce taxes for certain taxpayers if we knew that, in \norder to make up that revenue, we would have to have a two-thirds vote. \nTherefore, I think the influence of special interests would be very \nmuch reduced.\n\n  The tax limitation amendment represents an important reform whether \nwe stay with the existing Tax Code or we go to a new system. But it \nwill be particularly important if the American people conclude that a \nsingle-rate kind of reform is the one that we should adopt, because, \nagain, once all of the deductions and exemptions and credits are \neliminated, taxpayers will be particularly vulnerable to tax rate \nincreases. I think we should ensure it is not too easy for Congress to \nraise their taxes again.\n  Again, I compliment Senator Bob Smith from New Hampshire and the \nSenator from Minnesota, who is presiding at the moment, for their \nsupport as original cosponsors of this important constitutional \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/09/senate-section/article/S1171-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1172-S1174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE SENATE SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to clarify the record somewhat \nand respond to some of the comments that have been made today and \nearlier this week by the distinguished Senator from Ohio, Senator \nGlenn, about our schedule.\n  First, I think it should be noted that the first month of the \ncalendar year 1996 has been a very productive month legislatively for \nthe Senate. We have had some extraordinary activity. We may not have \nbeen in session as many days as has been the case in some years gone \nby, but in terms of actual production, we have produced some of the \nbiggest, most important pieces of legislation in history during the \nlast month. I would like to just read off the list. Certainly not all \nSenators agreed with how these pieces of legislation were dealt with, \nbut they were very important pieces of legislation and in most cases \npassed overwhelmingly.\n  For instance, we have already passed S. 1260, which is a fair housing \nbill, out of the Banking Committee. A lot of work went into it. It did \npass by unanimous consent, but that was because it was an important \nbill with broad, bipartisan support.\n  We passed, in January, the Defense authorization conference report \nfor this fiscal year. That was brought about by the fact that the \nPresident had vetoed the first Defense authorization bill. Some \nmodifications were made. I did not agree with all of them. I know the \nSenator in the chair did not agree with all of them. But we did come to \nan agreement on a second conference report, and it passed \noverwhelmingly and has gone to the President for his signature.\n  The START II Treaty was passed after discussion by the Senate. We \npassed a continuing resolution that kept the Government operating while \nthe President and the Congress can continue to work on trying to come \nto some agreement on appropriations bills that have not yet been \npassed. We took action on legislation raising the debt limit so that \nthere would be no question that Social Security checks would go out to \nour senior citizens the 1st of March. We passed the Telecommunications \nAct of 1996, probably the biggest jobs creation bill that has passed \nthis decade, legislation that took months--in fact years--to come to \nfruition. There have been 10 years of effort to get telecommunications \nreform legislation passed by the Congress. We had not changed the \ntelecommunications laws substantially since 1934. So we deregulated, we \nopened up all of the various areas of telecommunications for \ncompetition. It will mean lower prices, and more services and \ninformation for people. There is going to be a tremendous revolution \nbecause the Government is taking down the barriers it put up. This is a \nnew era of competition, a new time of choice of services and products \nfor people. The bill passed 91 to 5. Forty-eight hours before it passed \nmost people would have bet you that we would not get it passed at all. \nWell, it was signed into law just yesterday by the President of the \nUnited States.\n  Through tremendous efforts by the distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Dole, we were able to come to an agreement this week on a farm \nbill, a farm bill that passed the Senate with 64 votes; a bipartisan \nvote. I think we had 49 Members of the majority and 15 or so Members of \nthe minority that voted for this bill, a bill that had been tangled up \nfor months. It was included in the budget reconciliation package that \nthe President vetoed. So we had to take action on a farm bill before \nour farmers actually went into the fields to start plantings.\n  In the South, in my State of Mississippi the farmers are getting \nclose--within the next 2 weeks--to start to plant. And they had no idea \nwhat they could expect for the farm legislation and what they could \nexpect for this year.\n  So we got that bill through the Senate. So there has been a lot of \naction by the Senate this year. And to answer those who come to the \nfloor and say, ``What is the Congress doing?''--I have just given a \nvery impressive list. I would put that list up against any list from \njust about any January over the past 20 years in which I have been in \nthe Congress. \n\n[[Page S1173]]\n\n  Just today we are at work. We are having major speeches here on the \nfloor of the Senate. And there is an effort underway right now to get \nagreement on two important bills out of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. We are trying to get an agreement on the District of \nColumbia appropriations conference report. In fact, we will take action \nto make sure that we have cloture, if it is necessary, so that we can \ntake up that District of Columbia conference report as soon as we come \nback. In fact, we will have a vote on February 27 at 2:15 on that \nconference report. And committee meetings are working.\n  You cannot just pop legislation out to the floor. There have to be \nsubcommittee hearings, full committee hearings, there needs to be \nmarkup, we need to have investigations, and we need to have oversight. \nThis is the time of the year when in fact the committees should be the \nmost active. The Budget Committee is getting ready to try to see how we \ncan deal with the next fiscal year budget. The Banking Committee is \nhaving hearings. The Judiciary Committee is having hearings. This is \nwhen you do the preparation for the legislative process that will \nreally start moving forward in March and April. So there is a lot that \nis going on legislatively in the Senate.\n\n  Now, it has been suggested that we should not be out, that the \nschedule for the remainder of February is a charade, that there was not \na recorded vote on whether we should be in pro forma session.\n  I have to remind my colleagues in the minority that there was an \nagreement reached between the leaders on the schedule. The majority \nleader, Senator Dole, and the minority leader, Senator Daschle, after a \nlot of conversation, worked out a schedule that was agreed to. On \nspecific days there would be only pro forma sessions, on other days \nthere would be opportunity for agreements to be entered into, for \nspeeches to be made on important issues by the Senators. This was \nagreed to. It was not a charade. It was not snuck through. A lot of \npeople were consulted.\n  So we are going to be in session. We are going to be having \nactivities. We are going to be trying to reach agreements.\n  Then it was suggested by the Senator from Ohio that we have \nappropriations bills that have not passed the Congress for the present \nfiscal year when we should have done them last year. That is true. But \nlet us look at why they have not been passed.\n  First of all, everybody around here complains that we have not \nfinished legislation on health and human services and education. They \nare right. We have not. Do you know why? Because the Democrats in the \nSenate have refused to allow us to even bring it up for debate. They \nhave threatened to filibuster the motion to proceed. In common \nlanguage, this means they will not even let us bring it up without \ntalking it to death.\n  Why has that been done? They object to a provision with regard to \nstriker replacement. That was brought about by the fact that the \nPresident, unconstitutionally in my opinion, by Executive order tried \nto accomplish what the courts and the Congress have refused to do. He \nsays that when there are protracted strikes, employers cannot replace \nstrikers to keep their business alive. It has been taken to court, and \na Federal court has already ruled that was an improper action by the \nPresident. Now it is going to go on appeal probably all the way to the \nSupreme Court. But I feel pretty confident that the President's action \nis going to be stricken down as unconstitutional.\n  Yet the Democrats have refused to allow us to bring this bill up to \nprovide appropriations for the important Departments of Health and \nHuman Services and Education because we have a provision in there that \nsays basically what the President did was wrong. Now, the Federal \ncourts agree with us.\n  That is the truth of why this legislation has not been brought up. \nExcept for the objections on the minority side of the aisle, the \nDemocrats, we would have passed that legislation through and got it \ninto conference and sent it to the President weeks--in fact, months--\nago. So how we can hear whining from the Democratic side of the aisle \nabout why these departments have not been funded is pretty astounding \nto me when you look at the facts.\n  Now, with regard to these other departments that have not been \nfunded: State, Justice, Interior, Commerce, EPA, we have passed the \nlegislation. The President vetoed those bills. And when you look at why \nhe vetoed them, there is the real charade. He vetoed the interior bill \nbecause of some policy decisions that are very debatable to begin with \nand are minor as compared to the overall Interior Department \nappropriations bill.\n  Also, I think it is very clear that the distinguished chairman of the \nInterior Subcommittee of Appropriations, the Senator from Washington, \nSenator Gorton, and the Congressman from the House, Ralph Regula from \nOhio, have worked very hard with the Secretary of the Interior, \nSecretary Babbitt, to get an agreement to move this bill. In fact, they \nalmost had an agreement. And then the word came back that the White \nHouse had said, ``Do not negotiate any more with these congressional \nMembers. We are not going to agree to what they want.''\n  Well, you know, there are three coequal branches of Government. We \nhave to get legislation passed through the Congress and then the \nPresident, yes, has to sign it for it to be enacted. But when he says \ndo not talk to them anymore, what are we to do? And then they have the \ntemerity to complain that these departments are not funded.\n  Let me tell you this. There a lot of Americans who really have \nquestions about just how much or if some of these departments should be \nfunded. There are a lot of us who think that the Energy Department \ncould probably be eliminated. Most people are not aware that a majority \nof the budget for the Energy Department is defense related. It is not \neven separate, not even applicable to the Energy Department. It is \ndefense related. And the Commerce Department. The various agencies and \ndivisions of the Commerce Department could be carried out as \nindependent agencies or in other departments. We could save millions, \nmillions of dollars. We might even cut down on some of the travel that \nwe have seen from the Secretaries of Commerce and Energy.\n  I must also point out that historically the tradition has been in \nFebruary around the Presidents Day recess Congresses have always taken \na few days to be with their constituents. I think it is a good idea for \nCongressmen and Senators to get out of this city, go home, listen to \ntheir constituents. That is an important part of the legislative \nprocess to hear what your constituents have to say, to listen to the \nfarmers, to listen to the fishermen, to listen to the business men and \nwomen, to listen to the parents express their concern about crime and \ndrugs and the poor quality of education in America, to hear from \nAmerican people who even though we continue to spend more and more \nbillions of dollars for Federal aid to education the quality of \neducation continues to slide. Why is that? I bet we could find some \nanswers if we listened to the people at home. So for us to be off a few \ndays around Presidents Day, the Lincoln Day recess period, is very \ntraditional. Everybody in the House and Senate understands that. And so \nhopefully the Senators and the Congressmen are going to be back home. I \nam going to my State. I am going to meet with my constituents. I am \ngoing to talk to civic clubs, going to speak to the State Grand Masters \nBanquet; I am going to speak to industrial groups. That is a very, very \nimportant part of our job.\n  So I just wanted to respond to some of the allegations about how \nthere has been some secret agreement to have just pro forma sessions \nand morning business days. It was worked out very carefully between the \njoint leadership. I would like to see us pass all those appropriations \nbills, but the problem begins here, and it begins in the minority \nbecause they will not let us even bring up the Labor, HHS and Education \nbill.\n  I would like to also say, though, that I do agree with Senator Glenn \nand others that we still need to try to get an agreement on the budget \nbetween the President and the Congress. I am one of those incurable \noptimists who still believes it will be done, and it should be done. I \nthink we were helped this week by the bipartisan agreement from the \nGovernors with regard to Medicare and welfare. I do not like all of \nwhat they came up with, but I think they gave us \n\n[[Page S1174]]\na roadmap of how we can deal with the welfare issue and the need for \nwelfare reform and changes in Medicaid, hopefully, that would save us \nsome money.\n  That is one of the problems that worries me about what they \nsuggested. I do not think you get welfare reform if you end up with a \nbill that costs more than the present welfare system. What kind of \nwelfare reform is that? But they came up with some helpful suggestions. \nI think the budget negotiators have made real progress. I believe that \nwe could get a budget agreement that would lead us to a balanced budget \nin 7 years using honest numbers that would significantly cut back on \nthe amount of increase in spending in nondefense discretionary, that \nwould give us some Medicaid, welfare, Medicare reform, and that would \ngive some tax relief to the American people. I think we are going to \nmake a mistake if we do not take some action soon to give a little \nboost to the economy, a little incentive for growth in the economy. The \neconomy is showing tattered edges. We may not have a growth this year \nin the economy of even as much as 1.5 percent, which is very low and \nvery weak. If we would cut the capital gains rate, it would have a \ntremendous impact on the economy. There would be growth and the \ncreation of jobs. We need that legislation.\n  So I hope that when we come back February 26, Congress will give \nserious effort once again, our negotiators will give serious efforts to \nmeeting with administration officials and see if we can come to an \nagreement. But an important part of that is going to be Medicare. Other \nthan Social Security in the 1970's, I have never seen an issue that has \nbeen more demagoged than Medicare in the year 1995. Misinformation, \nmisleading information, accusations that are absolutely not true about \nwhat the Republicans have tried to do to save, preserve, and protect \nMedicare.\n  We have warned that there is a solvency problem. We must take action \nnow to make sure that Medicare is not only there for my 82-year-old \nmother but it will be there for us and for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/09/senate-section/article/S1172-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1174-S1175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEDICARE SHORTFALL\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the headline in Monday's New York Times, \nFebruary 5, was even more chilling than Washington's weather. It read, \n``Shortfall Posted by Medicare Fund Two Years Early. A Surplus Was \nExpected.''\n  The chief actuary of the Health Care Finance Administration observed, \n``Things turned out a little worse than we expected.'' I will say they \ndid. The administration had projected a $4.5 billion increase in the \nMedicare fund balance for fiscal year 1995. Instead, the balance fell \nby $35.7 million. The reason for the shortfall was twofold. First, \nincome from payroll taxes was less than expected. Second, and more \nimportant, outlays were higher because of more hospital admissions than \nwere expected.\n  Whatever the reasons, the day of reckoning is coming sooner than \nanyone had expected. Throughout last year, the Republicans in the House \nand the Senate have urged a solution for Medicare's fiscal ills. We \nhave hammered home the estimates by the Medicare trustees that the \nprogram would slip into the red ink by 1997, and would go bankrupt by \n2002.\n\n  Now it turns out even that dire forecast was on the optimistic side. \nMedicare has already started paying out more than it takes in. I cannot \nhelp but wonder how the White House will respond to this news. The \nadministration spin experts must be wracking their brains on this one. \nIn the face of all the facts, they have to come up with some way to \nportray President Clinton as the champion and savior of Medicare.\n  The fact is that instead of cooperating with the Congress, who wanted \nto preserve and protect Medicare last year, President Clinton launched \nhis Medicare campaign and played Medicare politics ruthlessly, and I \nregret to say, somewhat successfully. He convinced or he scared many \nAmericans into believing that our proposal to strengthen Medicare was \ninstead a cut in its funding when, in fact, it would allow over the \nnext 7 years for over a 60-percent increase. Only in Washington is a \n60-percent increase in the level of spending over 7 years considered a \ncut.\n  They were somewhat successful in scaring the people into believing \nthat. When he vetoed that proposal last December, he posed as the \ndefender of Medicare against extremists in the Congress.\n  Now, the fiscal chickens are coming home to roost and they are headed \nfor the roof of the west wing of the White House. Mr. President, \nClinton's game plan for Medicare--to stonewall about the problem's \nfinancial peril in hope of getting safely reelected in another term \nafter this year have been overtaken by the events that have occurred \nrecently. He is trapped in a maze of his own mapping.\n  Here is the dilemma: To make it through this year, I guess he will \nhave to come up with a Medicare salvage package of his own, but in \norder to do that he will have to call for a massive job crippling and \nprobably recessionary hike in payroll taxes, or he will have to adopt \nmost of the Republican plan to preserve Medicare. That would be the \nsame plan he vetoed just last year with such gusto, and with Lyndon \nJohnson's pen, no less.\n  Of course, he will want to do neither. So, he will look for another \nway out for an escape, make an evasion. My guess is he will call for a \nnational commission or a similar proposal to postpone the decisions \nthat have to be made now. I hope I am wrong. I hope the President will \ntake another look at the legislation of congressional Republicans, the \nwork we have drafted, the year we spent developing this plan to save \nand protect and preserve Medicare for the future. I hope he will \nreconsider his bias against health care choices for seniors. That is a \nmajor part of what we tried to do.\n  I hope he will renounce his animus against the medical savings \naccounts. When I suggest to my senior citizens and even my mother about \nthe idea of a medical savings account of your own, where you have it to \nuse, or you do not have to use it, a novel idea, it is yours. It would \nhelp cut out some of the unnecessary use of the system. It is the \nAmerican way. Let you choose, let you use your own money, let you save \nand get a little interest.\n  I do not know why the President was so opposed. Maybe he will \nreconsider. That could be the final catalyst that brings together a \nreal budget agreement--not a deal, an agreement--that is good for \nAmerica.\n  Well, maybe I should prepare for the worst, which would be yet \nanother abdication of sensibly dealing with the problems of Medicare. \nWe demonstrated that last year that we really could not, as a \ngovernment, face up to it. This is not an issue we can walk away from. \nIt is there. It is not good. It is going to get worse soon. There is \ntoo much at stake for 35 million Americans, the elderly, and the \ndisabled, for whom Medicare is, quite literally, a lifeline.\n  It is time we put partisanship and politics aside and address the \nreal problems for the future of Medicare, for our parents, and for our \nchildren.\n  I ask unanimous consent the New York Times article by Robert Pear be \nprinted in the Record, entitled ``Shortfall Posted by Medicare Fund Two \nYears Early.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 5, 1996]\n\n           Shortfall Posted by Medicare Fund Two Years Early\n\n                            (By Robert Pear)\n\n       Washington, Feb. 4.--New Government data show that \n     Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund lost money last year \n     for the first time since 1972, suggesting that the financial \n     condition of the Medicare program was worse than assumed by \n     either Congress or the Clinton Administration.\n       In a report to Congress in April, the Administration \n     estimated that the amount of money in the trust fund would \n     increase by $4.7 billion in the 1995 fiscal year, which ended \n     on Sept. 30. In fact, officials said in interviews, the \n     balance in the trust fund fell by $35.7 million, to $129.5 \n     billion.\n       ``Things turned out a little worse than we expected,'' said \n     Richard S. Foster, chief actuary of the Federal Health Care \n     Financing Administration, which runs Medicare for 37 million \n     people who are elderly or disabled. ``We had projected that \n     1997 would be the first fiscal year with a deficit.''\n       Income to the trust fund, primarily from payroll taxes, was \n     slightly less than expected, Mr. Foster said, and outlays \n     were somewhat higher. There were more hospital admissions \n     than anticipated, patients were \n\n[[Page S1175]]\n     somewhat sicker and hospitals filed claims faster than expected, he \n     said.\n       The deficit, while relatively small, is significant because \n     once the trust fund starts to lose money, the losses are \n     expected to grow from year to year. No tax increases are \n     scheduled under current law, and Federal officials do not \n     expect a reduction in the rate of growth in Medicare spending \n     unless there is a budget deal between President Clinton and \n     Congress.\n       No such deal is in sight. The two sides have not held \n     serious negotiations in three weeks, and they evidently \n     intend to fight out their philosophical differences in the \n     November elections.\n       Moreover, neither party's proposals go far enough to \n     guarantee the solvency of Medicare for the baby boom \n     generation, whose members start to reach the age of 65 in \n     2011.\n       In general, health policy experts say, the changes needed \n     to shore up Medicare can be relatively small and gradual if \n     they are made in the near future, but they will have to be \n     larger and more abrupt if they are deferred.\n       Bruce C. Vladeck, administrator of the Health Care \n     Financing Administration, said: ``We are still analyzing the \n     Medicare data to see what last year's experience might say \n     about changing patterns of care or need among the elderly. \n     In-patient hospital volume went up a bit more than we had \n     projected. We are trying to figure out why.''\n       Officials at the American Hospital Association said the \n     increase was puzzling because it followed more than a decade \n     of decline in Medicare hospital admissions.\n       Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services, and three other Administration officials serve as \n     trustees of Medicare. In the report in April, they said the \n     hospital trust fund would run out of money late in the year \n     2002.\n       Republicans seized on that prediction to justify their \n     proposals for vast changes in the structure of Medicare. They \n     said they were cutting the growth of Medicare not to balance \n     the budget, but to ``preserve, protect and strengthen'' the \n     program. Mr. Clinton vetoed the proposals, saying they would \n     hurt beneficiaries and ``dismantle Medicare as we know it.''\n       In view of the financial shortfall in 1995, the Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund could go bankrupt earlier than \n     anticipated, perhaps a year sooner, but that is not certain.\n       ``It's hard to say what the implications are for future \n     estimates,'' Mr. Foster said. ``It's possible this could \n     advance the depletion date, or the trust fund might be \n     depleted earlier in the same year, 2002. In any event, it \n     doesn't help. That's a safe conclusion.''\n       The trustees and the actuary will make new forecasts in \n     their next annual report, which under Federal law is to be \n     submitted to Congress by April 1. The report may be a month \n     late because of time lost while the Government was shut down \n     in November and again in December.\n       The actuary and his staff write much of the trustees' \n     report. Medicare actuaries have a tradition of independence \n     and a history of providing objective information to Federal \n     officials and Congress. This year's report will be closely \n     scrutinized since it comes in an election year, when Medicare \n     is an important campaign issue. Under Federal law, the chief \n     actuary must certify whether the Administration's conclusions \n     are based on reasonable assumptions and cost estimates.\n       Private employers have slowed the growth of health costs in \n     recent years by prodding employees to join health maintenance \n     organizations and other forms of managed care. While the \n     number of Medicare beneficiaries in H.M.O.'s is growing \n     rapidly, only about four million people, representing 11 \n     percent of the beneficiaries, are in H.M.O's.\n       Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund pays for hospital \n     care, skilled nursing homes, home health agencies and \n     hospices. The trustees' report in April predicted that \n     outlays would grow an average of 8 percent a year from 1995 \n     to 2002, while income to the trust fund would grow 4 percent \n     a year.\n       Referring to the disparity between income and outlays, Mr. \n     Foster said: ``This gap, which barely showed up in 1995, will \n     grow in future years. In the absence of legislation, it will \n     keep getting worse. Obviously, you can't continue very long \n     with a situation in which the expenditures of the program are \n     significantly greater than the income. We have enough assets \n     to cover the shortfall in each of the next few years. But \n     once the assets of the trust fund are depleted, there is no \n     way to pay all the benefits that are due.''\n       While Congress and the Administration recognize that \n     Medicare is unsustainable in its current form, they disagree \n     on the urgency of the problem. In 1993, President Clinton \n     described a health care crisis, demanding transformation of \n     the entire health care system. But last year, when the debate \n     focused on Medicare, he expressed less alarm and resisted \n     many Republican proposals, saying they would have ``Draconian \n     consequence for the elderly.''\n       Doctor and laboratory bills are paid by a separate Medicare \n     trust fund under Part B of the program. It is much smaller \n     than the hospital trust fund and is financed in a different \n     way, with beneficiary premiums and general revenues.\n       This separate Medical Insurance Trust Fund ended the fiscal \n     year 1995 with a balanced of $13.9 billion,which was $1.7 \n     billion more than predicted it is virtually impossible for \n     this trust fund to run out of money because it has a sizable \n     cushion and the premiums and matching Government \n     contributions are adjusted each year to cover the expected \n     costs.\n       Medicare outlays for doctors' services are rising faster \n     than those for hospital care, in part because complex \n     services once performed in hospitals are now often done in \n     out-patient clinics and doctors' offices.\n       Mr. Clinton and the Republicans agree on many proposals to \n     curb Medicare payments to hospitals, doctors and other \n     health-care providers. But it appears unlikely that such \n     cutbacks will be approved this in the absence of a general \n     agreement on how to balance the Federal budget.\n       ``No deal is preferable to a bad deal,'' said Mr. \n     Vladeck,the head of the health care financing agency, who \n     expresses the Administration's views. ``Everybody agrees on \n     many things that could be done to save money and to make the \n     Medicare program better. But we can't do them because members \n     of the Congressional majority are unwilling to separate those \n     items from their ideological agenda.''\n       Repblicans, by contrast, say Mr. Clinton has thwarted their \n     efforts to save the program from bankruptcy. Under their \n     proposal, elderly people would have a range of health \n     insurance options like those available to people under 65, \n     and the Republicans assume that many would choose H.M.O.'s, \n     which try to control costs by providing comprehensive care in \n     return for flat monthly premiums.\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I will take a couple minutes to compliment \nthe Senator from Mississippi, the distinguished majority whip presiding \nin the chair at the moment, for the comments just made, both to clear \nthe record with respect to what we have been doing in January and \nFebruary and to make a very important point with regard to Medicare. I \nwould rather be home now in Arizona where it is over 80 degrees, than \nback here in Washington, DC, but this morning we are working on very \nimportant immigration reform legislation, which is very important in my \nState, and important to the entire country. Under the leadership of the \nSenator from Wyoming, Senator Simpson, and Senator Hatch, and others I \nthink we will be able to get that legislation. It is taking a lot of \ntime to put it together in the way we can get it adopted. As a result, \nwe have to be here working.\n  The other point I want to make relates to a recent trip that I took \nto Bosnia, visiting with NATO officials in Munich, Germany, after that \ntrip. As a result of this, I have come to a rather disturbing \nconclusion, and that is, I do not think the NATO forces, the United \nStates included, have our act together in anything other than a \nmilitary sense.\n  As one would expect, our troops are performing magnificently. We \ndefined the mission narrowly: Stop the fighting parties from fighting \nwith each other. Once the U.S. military moved in, nobody wanted to mess \nwith them. Our troops, well trained, well equipped, well motivated, are \nperforming just like all of us would expect them to. It really makes \nyou proud to see them performing there, in addition, in a rainy, muddy, \nsnowy, icy climate far away from home, where there is no clear-cut idea \nwhy they are there, but they are doing their mission and doing it well.\n  They have the fighting forces separated, and I do not think the \nBosnians or Serbs or Croats are going to mess with either our forces or \nthe British or the French forces and the other nations under their \ncommand.\n  What is not happening is that the European countries are not coming \ntogether to solve the political problems, the economic problems, the \nrebuilding of the infrastructure, the ensuring that the Bosnian Army is \nwell enough equipped and armed to defend itself--all of the things that \nneed to occur to make this peace treaty really work are being ignored \nby the Europeans. I know that is a harsh statement to make, but in the \n2 days following our trip to Bosnia, a group of six members of the \nUnited States Senate, as well as Defense Secretary Perry and other \nUnited States officials, visited with our European allies and \nrepeatedly asked the question: Are you going to help fund the economic \nreconstruction of the country, the infrastructure that needs to be \nrebuilt, if are you going to help \n\n[[Page S1176]]\nget the government back on its feet? Will you lend a hand to us in \narming the Bosnian Government so it can defend itself when we leave?\n  Essentially, we got the cold shoulder. They do not want to talk about \nit. It requires money and requires a commitment.\n  They want to pat themselves on the back for the military operation \nwhich is succeeding well and not get to the hard business of making the \npeace work in Bosnia. My concern with going into Bosnia is not that we \nwould not be able to succeed militarily, but this is an insufficient \ncommitment on the part of the Europeans to follow through and make \npeace work. That is what we have seen.\n  This morning's wire, Mr. President, contains a very disturbing story. \nIn an ominous sign from the AP wire story, ``Bosnian Serbs followed \nthrough today on their threat to sever with the NATO-led peace force \nties because of the government's arrest of two Serb officers at \nsuspected war criminals.''\n  They lost all top level contact with the Bosnian Serb Army and the \nground commander said it was the worst crisis in Bosnia since the peace \ntook hold 2 months ago.\n  ``The commander, Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Walker, characterized the \ndevelopment as an ominous sign and direct breach of the Bosnian peace \naccord.''\n  At the same time, I note that the Chairman of the United States Joint \nChiefs of Staff, John Shalikashvili, urged the Bosnian Government to \nimmediately release Serbs against whom there is no evidence of \nparticipating in war crimes.\n  Does that mean the two people arrested are being held? Very unclear. \nThere is a total lack of cohesion because there has not been an \nagreement by the NATO allied forces of exactly what we are supposed to \nbe doing over there, except keeping the warring sides from fighting \nwith each other.\n  There is an absolute commitment to leave in the year. The Europeans \nsay they will leave when we leave. When we are out of Bosnia next \nOctober, I can only hope that the Europeans have gotten together and \nhave made a stronger commitment than they have so far to help rebuild \nthat economy and that government and to deal with the war crimes issue \nand the arming of the Bosnian Government so that when we leave all we \naccomplished will not have been for nothing. I especially have \nreference to one U.S. death and other U.S. casualties.\n  I want to be able to say, when this is over with, that they did not \ndie in vain. I am afraid if we do not get more cooperation from our \nEuropean allies, that we will not be able to say that, and that will be \na very, very big shame and a blot on the United States as well as our \nEuropean allies.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/09/senate-section/article/S1175-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/09/senate-section/article/S1176-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/09/senate-section/article/S1176-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1176-S1178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO IRAQ--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                           PRESIDENT--PM 118\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I hereby report to the Congress on the developments since my last \nreport on August 1, 1995, concerning the national emergency with \nrespect to Iraq that was declared in Executive Order No. 12722 of \nAugust 2, 1990. This report is submitted pursuant to section 401(c) of \nthe National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of \nthe International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n  Executive Order No. 12722 ordered the immediate blocking of all \nproperty and interests in property of the Government of Iraq (including \nthe Central Bank of Iraq) then or thereafter located in the United \nStates or within the possession or control of a U.S. person. That order \nalso prohibited the importation into the United States of goods and \nservices of Iraqi origin, as well as the exportation of goods, \nservices, and technology from the United States to Iraq. The order \nprohibited travel-related transactions to or from Iraq and the \nperformance of any contract in support of any industrial, commercial, \nor governmental project in Iraq. U.S. persons were also prohibited from \ngranting or extending credit or loans to the Government of Iraq.\n  The foregoing prohibitions (as well as the blocking of Government of \nIraq property) were continued and augmented on August 9, 1990, by \nExecutive Order No. 12724, which was issued in order to align the \nsanctions imposed by the United States with United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolution 661 of August 6, 1990.\n  Executive Order No. 12817 was issued on October 21, 1992, to \nimplement in the United States measures adopted in United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolution 778 of October 2, 1992. Resolution 778 \nrequires U.N. Member States to transfer to a U.N. escrow account any \nfunds (up to $200 million apiece) representing Iraqi oil sale proceeds \npaid by purchasers after the imposition of U.N. sanctions on Iraq, to \nfinance Iraq's obligations for U.N. activities with respect to Iraq, \nsuch as expenses to verify Iraqi weapons destruction, and to provide \nhumanitarian assistance in Iraq on a nonpartisan basis. A portion of \nthe escrowed funds also funds the activities of the U.N. Compensation \nCommission in Geneva, which handles claims from victims of the Iraqi \ninvasion and occupation of Kuwait. Member States also may make \nvoluntary contributions to the account. The funds placed in the escrow \naccount are to be returned, with interest, to the Member States that \ntransferred them to the United Nations, as funds are received from \nfuture sales of Iraqi oil authorized by the U.N. Security Council. No \nMember State is required to fund more than half of the total transfers \nor contributions to the escrow account.\n  This report discusses only matters concerning the national emergency \nwith respect to Iraq that was declared in Executive Order No. 12722 and \nmatters relating to Executive Orders No. 12724 and 12817 (the \n``Executive orders''). The report covers events from August 2, 1995, \nthrough February 1, 1996.\n  1. During the reporting period, there were no amendments to the Iraqi \nSanctions Regulations.\n  2. The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control \n(FAC) continues its involvement in lawsuits seeking to prevent the \nunauthorized transfer of blocked Iraqi assets. In Consarc Corporation \nv. Iraqi Ministry of Industry and Minerals, No. 94-5390 (D.C. Cir. Dec. \n15, 1995), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued its \nsecond opinion in this case, finding in FAC's favor on all issues \npresented to the court. The court ordered the district court judge to \ndirect Consarc Corporation to restore the status quo by returning $6.4 \nmillion plus interest to the blocked Iraqi government account from \nwhich it was withdrawn after the district court erroneously held that \nthese funds were not blocked Iraqi government property. The court also \nfound that the unsold furnace manufactured for the Iraqi government and \nsales proceeds of a second furnace were blocked property. Finally, the \ncourt reversed the district court's ruling that Consarc held a specific \nclaim against a blocked Iraqi government account for $6.4 million, \nholding that any claim Consarc had against the Government of Iraq was \nas a general creditor only.\n  Investigations of possible violations of the Iraqi sanctions continue \nto be pursued and appropriate enforcement actions taken. Several cases \nfrom prior \n\n[[Page S1177]]\nreporting periods are continuing and recent additional allegations have \nbeen referred by FAC to the U.S. Customs Service for investigation. \nAdditional FAC civil penalty notices were prepared during the reporting \nperiod for violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers \nAct and Iraqi Sanctions Regulations with respect to transactions \ninvolving Iraq. On de minimis penalty has been collected from an \norganization for unlicensed exports in violation of the prohibitions \nagainst transactions involving Iraq. Several other penalty proceedings \nare pending completion.\n  3. Investigation also continues into the roles played by various \nindividuals and firms outside Iraq in the Iraqi government procurement \nnetwork. These investigations may lead to additions to FAC's listing of \nindividuals and organizations determined to be Specially Designated \nNationals (SDNs) of the Government of Iraq.\n  4. Pursuant to Executive Order No. 12817 implementing United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolution 778, on October 26, 1992, FAC directed the \nFederal Reserve Bank of New York to establish a blocked account for \nreceipt of certain post-August 6, 1990, Iraqi oil sales proceeds, and \nto hold, invest, and transfer these funds as required by the order. On \nSeptember 5, 1995, following payments by the Governments of Australia \n($216,350.00), Denmark ($168,985.00), Japan ($4,075,000.00), The \nNetherlands ($4,168,745.47), New Zealand ($67,050.00), Switzerland \n($265,108.20), and by the European Union ($647,463.31), respectively, \nto the special United Nations-controlled account, entitled, ``United \nNations Security Council Resolution 778 Escrow Account,'' the Federal \nReserve Bank of New York was directed to transfer a corresponding \namount of $9,606,711.98 from the blocked account it holds to the United \nNations-controlled account. Similarly, on October 30, 1995, following \nthe payment of $1,504,000.00 by the European Community, and payments by \nthe Governments of Germany ($355,871.89), The Netherlands \n($2,698,348.13), Norway ($199,983.00), and the United Kingdom \n($2,188,992.67), the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was directed to \ntransfer a corresponding amount of $6,947,195.69 to the United Nations-\ncontrolled account. Finally, on December 21, 1995, following the \npayment of $3,062,197.28 by the European Union, and payments by the \nGovernments of the Netherlands ($1,922,719.00), Sweden ($4,223,178.20), \nand the United Kingdom ($208,600.44), the Federal Reserve Bank of New \nYork was directed to transfer the amount of $8,313,066.13 to the United \nNations-controlled account. Cumulative transfers from the blocked \nFederal Reserve Bank of New York account since issuance of Executive \nOrder No. 12817 now have amounted to $200 million, fully satisfying the \nU.S. commitment to match the payments of other Member States from \nblocked Iraqi oil payments, and its obligations pursuant to United \nNations Security Council Resolution 778.\n\n  5. The Office of Foreign Assets Control has issued a total of 618 \nspecific licenses regarding transactions pertaining to Iraq or Iraqi \nassets since August 1990. Licenses have been issued for transactions \nsuch as the filing of legal actions against Iraqi governmental \nentities, legal representation of Iraq, and the exportation to Iraq of \ndonated medicine, medical supplies, food intended for humanitarian \nrelief purposes, the execution of powers of attorney relating to the \nadministration of personal assets and decedents' estates in Iraq and \nthe protection of preexistent intellectual property rights in Iraq. \nSince my last report, 28 specific licenses have been issued.\n  6. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from August 2, 1995, through February 1, 1996, that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of a national emergency with respect to Iraq are reported \nto be about $1.6 million, most of which represents wage and salary \ncosts for Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in \nthe Department of the Treasury (particularly in the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, the U.S. Customs Service, the Office of the Under \nSecretary for Enforcement, and the Office of the General Counsel), the \nDepartment of State (particularly the Bureau of Economic and Business \nAffairs, the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, the Bureau of \nInternational Organization Affairs, the Bureau of Political-Military \nAffairs, the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, and the Office of the \nLegal Adviser), and the Department of Transportation (particularly the \nU.S. Coast Guard).\n  7. The United States imposed economic sanctions on Iraq in response \nto Iraq's illegal invasion and occupation of Kuwait, a clear act of \nbrutal aggression. The United States, together with the international \ncommunity, is maintaining economic sanctions against Iraq because the \nIraqi regime has failed to comply fully with the United Nations \nSecurity Council resolutions. Security Council resolutions on Iraq call \nfor the elimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, Iraqi \nrecognition of Kuwait, and the inviolability of the Iraq-Kuwait \nboundary, the release of Kuwaiti and other third-country nationals, \ncompensation for victims of Iraqi aggression, long-term monitoring of \nweapons of mass destruction capabilities, the return of Kuwaiti assets \nstolen during Iraq's illegal occupation of Kuwait, renunciation of \nterrorism, an end to internal Iraqi repression of its own Iraqi \ncivilian population, and the facilitation of access of international \nrelief organizations to all those in need in all parts of Iraq. More \nthan 5 years after the invasion, a pattern of defiance persists: a \nrefusal to account for missing Kuwaiti detainees; failure to return \nKuwaiti property worth millions of dollars, including military \nequipment that was used by Iraq in its movement of troops to the \nKuwaiti border in October 1994; sponsorship of assassinations in \nLebanon and in northern Iraq; incomplete declarations to weapons \ninspectors; and ongoing widespread human rights violations. As a \nresult, the U.N. sanctions remain in place; the United States will \ncontinue to enforce those sanctions under domestic authority.\n  The Baghdad government continues to violate basic human rights of its \nown citizens through systematic repression of minorities and denial of \nhumanitarian assistance. The Government of Iraq has repeatedly said it \nwill not be bound by United Nations Security Council Resolution 688. \nFor more than 4 years, Baghdad has maintained a blockade of food, \nmedicine, and other humanitarian supplies against northern Iraq. The \nIraqi military routinely harasses residents of the north, and has \nattempted to ``Arabize'' the Kurdish, Turcomen, and Assyrian areas in \nthe north. Iraq has not relented in its artillery attacks against \ncivilian population centers in the south, or in its burning and \ndraining operations in the southern marshes, which have forced \nthousands to flee to neighboring States.\n  In April 1995, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 986 \nauthorizing Iraq to export limited quantities of oil (up to $1 billion \nper quarter) under U.N. supervision in order to finance the purchase of \nfood, medicine, and other humanitarian supplies. The resolution \nincludes arrangements to ensure equitable distribution of such \nassistance to all the people of Iraq. The resolution also provides for \nthe payment of compensation to victims of Iraqi aggression and for the \nfunding of other U.N. activities with respect to Iraq. Resolution 986 \nwas carefully crafted to address the issues raised by Iraq to justify \nits refusal to implement similar humanitarian resolutions adopted in \n1991 (Resolutions 706 and 712), such as oil export routes and questions \nof national sovereignty. Nevertheless, Iraq refused to implement this \nhumanitarian measure. This only reinforces our view that Saddam Hussein \nis unconcerned about the hardships suffered by the Iraqi people.\n\n  The policies and actions of the Saddam Hussein regime continue to \npose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and \nforeign policy of the United States, as well as to regional peace and \nsecurity. The U.N. resolutions affirm that the Security Council be \nassured of Iraq's peaceful intentions in judging its compliance with \nsanctions. Because of Iraq's failure to comply fully with these \nresolutions, the United States will continue to apply economic \nsanctions to deter it from threatening peace and stability in the \nregion.\n                                                   William J. Clinton. \n  The White House, February 9, 1996.\n  \n[[Page S1178]]\n\n\nREPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE \n              PROCESS--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 119\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I hereby report to the Congress on the developments concerning the \nnational emergency with respect to organizations that threaten to \ndisrupt the Middle East peace process that was declared in Executive \nOrder No. 12947 of January 23, 1995. This report is submitted pursuant \nto section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), \nand section 204(c) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act \n(IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n  1. On January 23, 1995, I signed Executive Order 12947, ``Prohibiting \nTransactions with Terrorists Who Threaten to Disrupt the Middle East \nPeace Process'' (the ``order'') (60 Fed. Reg. 5079, January 25, 1995). \nThe order blocks all property subject to U.S. jurisdiction in which \nthere is any interest of 12 terrorist organizations that threaten the \nMiddle East peace process as identified in an Annex to the order. The \norder also blocks the property and interests in property subject to \nU.S. jurisdiction of persons designated by the Secretary of State, in \ncoordination with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney \nGeneral, who are found (1) to have committed, or to pose a significant \nrisk of committing, acts of violence that have the purpose or effect of \ndisrupting the Middle East peace process, or (2) to assist in, sponsor \nor provide financial, material, or technological support for, or \nservices in support of, such acts of violence. In addition, the order \nblocks all property and interests in property subject to U.S. \njurisdiction in which there is any interest of persons determined by \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, in coordination with the Secretary of \nState and the Attorney General, to be owned or controlled by, or to act \nfor or on behalf of, any other person designated pursuant to the order \n(collectively ``Specially Designated Terrorists'' or ``SDTs'').\n  The order further prohibits any transaction or dealing by a United \nStates person or within the United States in property or interests in \nproperty of SDTs, including the making or receiving of any contribution \nof funds, goods, or services to or for the benefit of such persons. \nThis prohibition includes donations that are intended to relieve human \nsuffering.\n  Designations of persons blocked pursuant to the order are effective \nupon the date of determination by the Secretary of State or his \ndelegate, or the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (FAC) \nacting under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Treasury. \nPublic notice of blocking is effective upon the date of filing with the \nFederal Register, or upon prior actual notice.\n  2. On January 25, 1995, the Department of the Treasury issued a \nnotice listing persons blocked pursuant to Executive Order No. 12947 \nwho have been designated by the President as terrorist organizations \nthreatening the Middle East peace process or who have been found to be \nowned or controlled by, or to be acting for or on behalf of, these \nterrorist organizations (60 Fed. Reg. 5084, January 25, 1995). The \nnotice identified 31 entities that act for or on behalf of the 12 \nMiddle East terrorist organizations listed in the Annex to Executive \nOrder No. 12947, as well as 18 individuals who are leaders or \nrepresentatives of these groups. In addition the notice provides 9 name \nvariations or pseudonyms used by the 18 individuals identified. The \nlist identifies blocked persons who have been found to have committed, \nor to pose a risk of committing, acts of violence that have the purpose \nof disrupting the Middle East peace process or to have assisted in, \nsponsored, or provided financial, material or technological support \nfor, or service in support of, such acts of violence, or are owned or \ncontrolled by, or to act for or on behalf of other blocked persons. The \nDepartment of the Treasury issued three additional notices adding the \nnames of three individuals, as well as their pseudonyms, to the List of \nSDTs (60 Fed. Reg. 41152-53, August 11, 1995; 60 Fed. Reg. 44932-33, \nAugust 29, 1995; and 60 Fed. Reg. 58435-36, November 27, 1995). Copies \nof the notices are attached to this report. The FAC, in coordination \nwith the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, is continuing to \nexpand the list of Specially Designated Terrorists, including both \norganizations and individuals, as additional information is developed.\n\n  3. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from July 23, 1995, through January 22, 1996, that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of the national emergency with respect to organizations \nthat disrupt the Middle East peace process are estimated at \napproximately $2.6 million. (The expenses for the previous period, \nincorrectly stated in the report of July 27, 1995, to be approximately \n$55,000, were about $2.5 million.) Personnel costs were largely \ncentered in the Department of the Treasury (particularly in the Office \nof Foreign Assets Control, the Office of the General Counsel, and the \nU.S. Customs Service), the Department of State, and the Department of \nJustice.\n  4. Executive Order No. 12947 provides this Administration with a new \ntool for combating fundraising in this country on behalf of \norganizations that use terror to undermine the Middle East peace \nprocess. The order makes it harder for such groups to finance these \ncriminal activities by cutting off their access to sources of support \nin the United States and to U.S. financial facilities. It is also \nintended to reach charitable contributions to designated organizations \nand individuals to preclude diversion of such donations to terrorist \nactivities.\n  In addition, the Congress has pending before it comprehensive \ncounterterrorism legislation proposed by the Administration that would \nstrengthen our ability to prevent terrorist acts, identify those who \ncarry them out, and bring them to justice. The combination of Executive \nOrder No. 12947 and the proposed legislation demonstrate the U.S. \ndetermination to confront and combat those who would seek to destroy \nthe Middle East peace process, and our commitment to the global fight \nagainst terrorism.\n  I shall continue to exercise the powers at my disposal to apply \neconomic sanctions against extremists seeking to destroy the hopes of \npeaceful coexistence between Arabs and Israelis as long as these \nmeasures are appropriate, and will continue to report periodically to \nthe Congress on significant developments pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n                                                  William J.

This \nmessage constitutes my report to the Congress pursuant to subsection \n(b) of the Pelly Amendment.\n  The certification of the Secretary of Commerce was based on Japanese \nresearch whaling activities in both the North Pacific and the Southern \nOcean Whale Sanctuary. In 1994, Japan expanded its research whaling \nactivities into the North Pacific by permitting the taking of 100 minke \nwhales, 21 of which were taken. The IWC found that this North Pacific \nwhaling failed to satisfy applicable criteria for lethal research and \nwas therefore inconsistent with the IWC's conservation program. \nNevertheless, Japan continued its whaling activities in the North \nPacific, taking 100 minke whales in 1995. In addition, during 1995, \nJapan increased the number of minke whales to be harvested in the \nSouthern Ocean Whale Sanctuary by 33 percent, despite a 1994 finding by \nthe IWC that this lethal research program did not meet all applicable \ncriteria.\n  In his letter to me of December 11, 1995, Secretary Brown conveyed \nhis concerns not only over the whales that have been killed in this \nprogram to date but also over any further expansion of lethal research. \nWhile noting that the Japanese have informed us they have no plans for \na further expansion of lethal research in the Southern Ocean Whale \nSanctuary, he expressed particular concern over whaling activity in \nthat area. I share these concerns.\n  At this stage, I do not believe that the use of trade sanctions is \nthe most constructive approach to resolving our differences over \nresearch whaling activities with the Government of Japan. However, I \nhave instructed the Department of State to convey my very strong \nconcerns to the Government of Japan. We will also vigorously pursue \nhigh-level efforts to persuade Japan to reduce the number of whales \nkilled in its research program and act consistently with the IWC \nconservation program. We hope to achieve significant progress on these \nissues by the beginning of the next Antarctic whaling season and will \nkeep these issues under review. I have instructed the Department of \nCommerce to continue to monitor closely Japan's research whaling and to \nreport promptly on any further inconsistencies between Japanese whaling \nactivities and the guidelines of the IWC conservation program.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to repeal the \namendments relating to obscene and harassing use of telecommunications \nfacilities made by the Communications Decency Act of 1995; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                     telecommunication legislation\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week, the Congress passed \ntelecommunications legislation. The President signed it into law this \nweek. For a number of reasons, and I stated them in the Chamber at the \ntime, I voted against the legislation. There were a number of things in \nthat legislation I liked and I am glad to see them in law. There were, \nhowever, some parts I did not like, one of them especially. Today I am \nintroducing a bill to repeal parts of the new law, parts I feel would \nhave far-reaching implications and would impose far-reaching new \nFederal crimes on Americans for exercising their free speech rights on-\nline and on the Internet.\n  The parts of the telecommunications bill called the Communications \nDecency Act are fatally flawed and unconstitutional. Indeed, such \nserious questions about the constitutionality of this legislation have \nbeen raised that a new section was added to speed up judicial review to \nsee if the legislation would pass constitutional muster. The \nlegislation is not going to pass that test.\n  The first amendment to our Constitution expressly states that \n``Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.'' The new \nlaw flouts that prohibition for the sake of political posturing. We \nshould not wait to let the courts fix this mistake. Even on an \nexpedited basis, the judicial review of the new law would take months \nand possibly years of litigation. During those years of litigation \nunsuspecting Americans who are using the Internet in unprecedented \nnumbers and more every day, are going to risk criminal liability every \ntime they go on-line.\n  Let us be emphatically clear that the people at risk of committing a \nfelony under this new law are not child pornographers, purveyors of \nobscene materials, or child sex molesters. These people can already be \nprosecuted and should be prosecuted under longstanding Federal criminal \nlaws that prevent the distribution over computer networks of obscene \nand other pornographic materials harmful to minors, under 18 U.S.C. \nsections 1465, 2252 and 2423(a); that prohibit the illegal solicitation \nof a minor by way of a computer network, under 18 U.S.C. section 2252; \nand that bar the illegal luring of a minor into sexual activity through \ncomputer conversations, under 18 U.S.C. section 2423(b). In fact, just \nlast year, we passed unanimously a new law that sharply increases \npenalties for people who commit these crimes.\n  There is absolutely no disagreement in the Senate, no disagreement \ncertainly among the 100 Senators about wanting to protect children from \nharm. All 100 Senators, no matter where they are from, would agree that \nobscenity and child pornography should be kept out of the hands of \nchildren. All Senators agree that we should punish those who sexually \nexploit children or abuse children. I am a former prosecutor. I have \nprosecuted people for abusing children. This is something where there \nare no political or ideological differences among us.\n\n  I believe there was a terribly misguided effort to protect children \nfrom what some prosecutors somewhere in this country might consider \noffensive or indecent online material, and in doing that, the \nCommunications Decency Act tramples on the free speech rights of all \nAmericans who want to enjoy this medium.\n  This legislation sweeps more broadly than just stopping obscenity \nfrom being sent to children. It will impose felony penalties for using \nindecent four-letter words, or discussing material deemed to be \nindecent, on electronic bulletin boards or Internet chat areas and news \ngroups accessible to children.\n  Let me give a couple of examples: You send e-mail back and forth, and \nyou want to annoy somebody whom you talked with many times before--it \nmay be your best buddy--and you use a four-letter word. Well, you could \nbe prosecuted for that, although you could pick up the phone, say the \nsame thing to him, and you commit no crime; or send a letter and say \nthe same word and commit no crime; or talk to him walking down the \nstreet and commit no crime.\n  To avoid liability under this legislation, users of e-mail will have \nto ban curse words and other expressions that might be characterized as \nindecent from their online vocabulary.\n  The new law will punish with 2-year jail terms someone using one of \nthe seven dirty words in a message to a minor or for sharing with a \nminor material containing indecent passages. In some areas of the \ncountry, a copy of Seventeen magazine would be considered indecent, \neven though kids buy it. The magazine is among the 10 most frequently \nchallenged school library materials in the country. Somebody sends an \nexcerpt from it, and bang, they could be prosecuted.\n  The new law will make it a crime ``to display in a manner available \nto'' a child any message or material ``that, in context, depicts or \ndescribes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary \ncommunity standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs* * *'' \nThat covers any of the over 13,000 Usenet discussion groups, as well as \nelectronic bulletin boards, online service provider chat rooms, and Web \nsites, that are all accessible to children. \n\n[[Page S1181]]\n\n  This display prohibition, according to the drafters, ``applies to \ncontent providers who post indecent material for online display without \ntaking precautions that shield that material from minors.''\n  What precautions will Internet users have to take to avoid criminal \nliability? These users, after all, are the ones who provide the \n``content'' read in news groups and on electronic bulletin boards. The \nlegislation gives the FCC authority to describe the precautions that \ncan be taken to avoid criminal liability. All Internet users will have \nto wait and look to the FCC for what they must do to protect themselves \nfrom criminal liability.\n  Internet users will have to limit all language used and topics \ndiscussed in online discussions accessible to minors to that \nappropriate for kindergartners, just in case a child clicks onto the \ndiscussion. No literary quotes from racy parts of ``Catcher in the \nRye'' or ``Ulysses'' will be allowed. Certainly, online discussions of \nsafe sex practices, or birth control methods, and of AIDS prevention \nmethods will be suspect. Any user who crosses the vague and undefined \nline of ``indecency'' will be subject to 2 years in jail and fines.\n  This worries me considerably. I will give you an idea of what \nhappens. People look at this, and because it is so vague and so broad \nand so sweeping, attempts to protect one's self from breaking the law \nbecome even broader and even more sweeping.\n  A few weeks ago, America Online took the online profile of a \nVermonter off the service. Why? Because the Vermonter used what AOL \ndeemed a vulgar, forbidden word. The word--and I do not want to shock \nmy colleagues--but the word was ``breast.'' And the reason this \nVermonter was using the word ``breast\"? She was a survivor of breast \ncancer. She used the service to exchange the latest information on \ndetection of breast cancer or engage in support to those who are \nsurvivors of breast cancer. Of course, eventually, America Online \napologized and indicated they would allow the use of the word where \nappropriate.\n  We are already seeing premonitions of the chilling effect this \nlegislation will have on online service providers. Far better we use \nthe laws on the books today to go after child pornographers, to go \nafter child abusers.\n  What strikes some people as indecent or patently offensive may look \nvery different to other people in another part of the country. Given \nthese differences, a vague ban on patently offensive and indecent \ncommunications may make us feel good but threatens to drive off the \nInternet and computer networks an unimaginable amount of valuable \npolitical, artistic, scientific, health and other speech.\n  For example, many museums in this country and abroad are going high-\ntechnology and starting Web pages to provide the public with greater \naccess to the cultural riches they offer. What if museums, like the \nWhitney Museum, which currently operates a Web page, had to censor what \nit made available online out of fear of being dragged into court? Only \nadults and kids who can make it in person to the museum will be able to \nsee the paintings or sculpture censored for online viewing under this \nlaw.\n  What about the university health service that posts information \nonline about birth control and protections against the spread of AIDS? \nWith many students in college under 18, this information would likely \ndisappear under threat of prosecution.\n  What happens if they are selling online versions of James Joyce's \n``Ulysses'' or of ``Catcher in the Rye''? Can they advertise this? Can \nexcerpts be put online? In all likelihood not. The Internet is breaking \nnew ground important for the economic health of this country. \nBusinesses, like the Golden Quill Book Shop in Manchester Center, VT, \ncan advertise and sell their books around the country or the world via \nthe Internet. But now, advertisers will have to censor their ads.\n  For example, some people consider the Victoria's Secret catalogue \nindecent. Under this new law, advertisements that would be legal in \nprint could subject the advertiser to criminal liability if circulated \nonline. You could put them in your local newspaper, but you cannot put \nit online.\n  In bookstores and on library shelves, the protections of the first \namendment are clear. The courts are unwavering in the protection of \nindecent speech. In altering the protections of the first amendment for \nonline communications, I believe you could cripple this new mode of \ncommunication.\n  At some point you have to start asking, where do we censor? What \nspeech do we keep off? Is it speech we may find politically disturbing? \nIf somebody wants to be critical of any one Member of Congress, are we \nable to keep that off? Should we be able to keep that off? I think not. \nThere is a lot of reprehensible speech and usually it becomes more \nnoted when attempts are made to censor it rather than let it out in the \ndaylight where people can respond to it.\n  The Internet is an American technology that has swept around the \nworld. As its popularity has grown, so have efforts to censor it. For \nexample, complaints by German prosecutors prompted an online service \nprovider to cut off subscriber access to over 200 Internet news groups \nwith the words ``sex,'' ``gay,'' or ``erotica'' in the name. They \ncensored such groups as ``clarinet.news.gays,'' which is an online \nnewspaper focused on gay issues, and ``gay-net.coming-out,'' which is a \nsupport group for gay men and women dealing with going public with \ntheir sexual orientation.\n\n  German prosecutors have also tried to get AOL to stop providing \naccess to neo-Nazi propaganda accessible on the Internet. No doubt such \nmaterial is offensive and abhorrent, but nonetheless just as protected \nby our first amendment as indecent material.\n  In China, look what they are trying to do. They are trying to create \nan intranet that would heavily censor outside access to the worldwide \nInternet. We ought to make sure it is open, not censored. We ought to \nsend that out as an example to China.\n  Americans should be taking the high ground to protect the future of \nour home-grown Internet, and to fight these censorship efforts that are \nspringing up around the globe. Instead of championing the first \namendment, however, the Communications Decency Act tramples on the \nprinciples of free speech and free flow of information that has fueled \nthe growth of this medium.\n  We have to be vigilant in enforcing the laws we have on the books to \nprotect our children from obscenity, child pornography, and sexual \nexploitation. Those laws are being enforced. Just last September, using \ncurrent laws, the FBI seized computers and computer files from about \n125 homes and offices across the country as part of an operation to \nshut down an online child pornography ring.\n  I well understand the motivation for the Communications Decency Act. \nWe want to protect our children from offensive or indecent online \nmaterials. This Senator--and I am confident every other Senator--agrees \nwith that. But we must be careful that the means we use to protect our \nchildren does not do more harm than good. We can already control the \naccess our children have to indecent material with blocking \ntechnologies available for free from some online service providers and \nfor a relatively low cost from software manufacturers.\n  Frankly, and I will close with this, Mr. President, at some point we \nought to stop saying the Government is going to make a determination of \nwhat we read and see, the Government will determine what our children \nhave or do not have.\n  I grew up in a family where my parents thought it was their \nresponsibility to guide what I read or would not read. They probably \nhad their hands full. I was reading at the age of 4. I was a voracious \nreader, and all the time I was growing up I read several books a week \nand went through our local library in the small town I grew up in very \nquickly. That love of reading has stood me in very good stead. I am \nsure I read some things that were a total waste of time, but very \nquickly I began to determine what were the good things to read and what \nwere the bad things. I had read all of Dickens by the end of the third \ngrade and much of Robert Louis Stevenson. I am sure some can argue \nthere are parts of those that maybe were not suitable for somebody in \nthird grade. I do not think I was severely damaged by it at all. That \nsame love of reading helped me get through law school and become a \nprosecutor \n\n[[Page S1182]]\nwhere I did put child abusers behind bars.\n  Should we not say that the parents ought to make this decision, not \nus in the Congress? We should put some responsibility back on families, \non parents. They have the software available that they can determine \nwhat their children are looking at. That is what we should do. Banning \nindecent material from the Internet is like using a meat cleaver to \ndeal with the problems better addressed with a scalpel.\n  We should not wait for the courts. Let us get this new \nunconstitutional law off the books as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n\n      My Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Simpson, and Mr. \n        D'Amato):\n  S. 1568. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the extension of certain expiring provisions; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n            extension of expired tax provisions legislation\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my friends \nand colleagues, Senator Baucus, Senator Simpson, and Senator D'Amato, \nin introducing legislation that would extend certain expired tax \nprovisions that have been delayed by the recent budget impasse. If no \naction is taken, the current tax treatment for individuals who accept \neducational benefits from their employer or donate stock to a \ncharitable foundation will disappear as well as the tax incentives for \ncompanies who hire disadvantaged employees and invest heavily in \nresearch and development, orphan drug research, and alternative fuel \nresearch. These items are noncontroversial and have consistently \nenjoyed bipartisan support. However, because President Clinton vetoed \nthe balanced budget of 1995, which included these extensions, these \nmuch-needed provisions need immediate attention inasmuch as April 15 is \nquickly approaching. Both individuals and businesses are anxiously \nawaiting the extension of these expired provisions so they will be able \nto pay their anticipated tax bill.\n   Mr. President, this bill would ensure continued opportunity for \nAmericans. The termination of one of these provisions--the employer-\nprovided educational assistance program--would end the hopes of \nthousands to attend college in order to enhance their job \nopportunities. This program has been well-established as an alternative \nway for individuals to meet their long-range educational goals. Without \nthis extension, an estimated 800,000 Americans would be required to pay \ntaxes on the education expenses paid by employers who did not withhold \nfor the 1995 tax year because they counted on Congress to extend this \nprogram. Companies have already reported a significant drop in program \nparticipation because employees would be unable to pay the anticipated \nadditional taxes. Without this exclusion, education becomes too \nexpensive for many and the future promise embodied by it often slips \naway.\n  Not only will educational goals be defeated if these expired \nprovisions are not extended, but programs that contribute to economic \ngrowth and long-term job creation will also be eliminated as research \nincentives dissipate. Many high-technology industries rely on the \nresearch and experimentation tax credit to make the development of new \nproducts economically feasible. Without this credit, they would be \nforced to either reduce the amount of their research or relocate to a \ncountry with research-friendly tax policies. In the end, the people of \nthe United States would pay the price for our negligence in not \nextending this tax credit. They would be the ones without the high-\ntechnology, high paying jobs. They would be the ones who would suffer \nfrom a research deficit. And they would be the ones who had to live in \na country with a less than robust economy.\n  As this extender package focuses on job creation for the high-\ntechnology industries, it also creates incentives for businesses to \nhire high-risk employees through the work opportunities tax credit \n[WOTC]. This program helps remove individuals from the more costly \ngovernment assistant programs and provides them with jobs that allow \nthem to both learn and earn.\n\n  Mr. President, some of my colleagues will correctly note that this \nbill includes no offset to pay for the lost revenue of extending these \nexpired tax provisions. However, when these items were introduced as a \nsmall portion of the balanced budget of 1995, they were an important \npart of a complete package that placed this Nation on a path to fiscal \nresponsibility. Thus, in the context of a complete balanced budget \ndeal, the cost of these provisions are offset by the necessary spending \ncuts. This bill has been carved out of the larger piece of legislation \nbecause time constraints require that we must now focus attention on \nthe immediacy of this issue. While all of the tax provisions in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995 are important and need to be addressed in \ncomprehensive legislation, the items singled out in this bill are those \nthat will have a direct impact on tax returns that are due this spring. \nAs the sponsor of the balanced budget amendment, I certainly recognize \nthe need to enact these provisions in a way that will not increase the \ndeficit. And, I remain hopeful that Congress will pass an effective and \nresponsible budget bill, including these and other vital tax \nprovisions, that the President will sign. We look forward to working \nwith Chairman Roth of the Finance Committee and Senator Domenici of the \nBudget Committee in crafting a revenue neutral package that would \ninclude these provisions.\n  Mr. President, these programs are specifically designed to target \nindividuals and businesses in a way that will produce benefits for the \nAmerican economy. History has proven that high employment rates, \neducational opportunities, and intensive research are goals that we can \nagree on. It is important that we see this bill enacted in a timely \nmatter so that our Nation will feel the effects of this legislation. \nIndividuals and businesses alike have anticipated the renewal of these \nprovisions. Congress has extended them in the past, and should have \nextended them in the 1995 budget agreement. Failure to do so now could \nhave serious repercussions. I note that similar legislation will be \nintroduced in the House by Representatives Nancy Johnson and Robert \nMatsui. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a summary of \nits provisions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1568\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Work Opportunities Tax Credit [WOTC], formerly TJTC:\n       This program is not as flexible as the original TJTC. \n     However, this bill expands it from the limited version that \n     was included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, as follows:\n       The categories have been expanded to include qualified \n     summer youth who live with families dependent on food stamps \n     and 18-25 year olds who live with families dependent on food \n     stamps.\n       The hour requirement for the minimum employment period was \n     reduced from the 500 hours included in the Balanced Budget \n     Act of 1995 to 250 hours.\n       2. Employer-Provided Educational Assistance Program:\n       This program remains the same as the version included in \n     the Balanced Budget Act, but this legislation does not limit \n     the provision to undergraduate education.\n       3. Research and Experimentation Tax Credit:\n       This bill extends the research and experimentation credit \n     as included in the Balanced Budget Act by incorporating an \n     Alternative Increment Research Credit as well as an \n     adjustment for start-up companies (the notch baby issue).\n       4. Orphan Drug Tax Credit:\n       This bill extends the research credit for rare diseases and \n     allows the carryforward or carryback of unused credit, as \n     included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. \n     \n[[Page S1185]]\n\n       5. Contributions of Stock to Private Foundation:\n       Extends existing law to December 31, 1997.\n       6. Extension of Binding Contract Date for the Section 29 \n     Credit:\n       Extends the placed-in-service date to January 1, 1999, and \n     the binding contract date to July 1, 1997.\n       7. Publicly Traded Partnerships:\n       Extends grandfathered PTPs as regular partnerships until \n     December 31, 1997.\n       8. Group Legal Services:\n       This bill extends the program included in the Senate \n     version of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 until December 31, \n     1997.\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senators Hatch, Baucus, and Simpson, in \nintroducing legislation to extend certain expiring tax provisions. Over \nthe years, all of the provisions in this bill have received support \nfrom most Members of Congress. In the first session of this Congress, I \njoined Senator Hatch in cosponsoring legislation to extend the tax \nbenefits on a number of these provisions. In addition, on June 29, \n1995, I introduced S. 997 to permanently reinstate the tax exclusion \nfor employer-provided group legal services. I am very pleased that that \nprovision has been included in this bill.\n  Mr. President, this bill is an important and necessary piece of \nlegislation. As such, I urge my colleagues to join us in the effort to \nextend these important benefits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Con. Res. 42\n\n       Whereas in 1982, 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, and 1994 the \n     Congress, by concurrent resolution, declared that it holds \n     the Government of Iran responsible for upholding the rights \n     of all its nationals, including members of the Baha'i Faith, \n     Iran's largest religious minority;\n       Whereas the Congress has deplored the Government of Iran's \n     religious persecution of the Baha'i community in such \n     resolutions and in numerous other appeals, and has condemned \n     Iran's execution of more than 200 Baha'is and the \n     imprisonment of thousands of others solely on account of \n     their religious beliefs;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran continues to deny individual \n     Baha'is access to higher education and government employment \n     and denies recognition and religious rights to the Baha'i \n     community, according to the policy set forth in a \n     confidential Iranian Government document which was revealed \n     by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 1993;\n       Whereas all Baha'i community properties in Iran have been \n     confiscated by the government and Iranian Baha'is are not \n     permitted to elect their leaders, organize as a community, \n     operate religious schools or conduct other religious \n     community activities guaranteed by the Universal Declaration \n     of Human Rights; and\n       Whereas on February 22, 1993, the United Nations Commission \n     on Human Rights published a formerly confidential Iranian \n     Government document that constitutes a blueprint for the \n     destruction of the Baha'i community and reveals that these \n     repressive actions are the result of a deliberate policy \n     designed and approved by the highest officials of the \n     Government of Iran: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) continues to hold the Government of Iran responsible \n     for upholding the rights of all its nationals, including \n     members of the Baha'i community, in a manner consistent with \n     Iran's obligations under the Universal Declaration of Human \n     Rights and other international agreements guaranteeing the \n     civil and political rights of its citizens;\n       (2) condemns the repressive anti-Baha'i policies and \n     actions of the Government of Iran, including the denial of \n     legal recognition to the Baha'i community and the basic \n     rights to organize, elect it leaders, educate its youth, and \n     conduct the normal activities of a law-abiding religious \n     community;\n       (3) expresses concern that individual Baha'is continue to \n     suffer from severely repressive and discriminatory government \n     actions, solely on account of their religion;\n       (4) urges the Government of Iran to extend to the Baha'i \n     community the rights guaranteed by the Universal Declaration \n     of Human Rights and the international covenants of \n\n[[Page S1186]]\n     human rights, including the freedom of thought, conscience, and \n     religion, and equal protection of the law; and\n       (5) calls upon the President to continue--\n       (A) to assert the United States Government's concern \n     regarding Iran's violations of the rights of its citizens, \n     including members of the Baha'i community, along with \n     expressions of its concern regarding the Iranian Government's \n     support for international terrorism and its efforts to \n     acquire weapons of mass destruction;\n       (B) to emphasize that the United States regards the human \n     rights practices of the Government of Iran, particularly its \n     treatment of the Baha'i community and other religious \n     minorities, as a significant factor in the development of the \n     United States Government's relations with the Government of \n     Iran;\n       (C) to urge the Government of Iran to emancipate the Baha'i \n     community by granting those rights guaranteed by the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international \n     covenants on human rights; and\n       (D) to encourage other governments to continue to appeal to \n     the Government of Iran, and to cooperate with other \n     governments and international organizations, including the \n     United Nations and its agencies, in efforts to protect the \n     religious rights of the Baha'is and other minorities through \n     joint appeals to the Government of Iran and through other \n     appropriate actions.\n\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, today I am submitting a \nconcurrent resolution condemning the persecution of the Baha'i \ncommunity that has been carried out systematically by the Government of \nIran over the past two decades. I am joined in this effort by Senator \nDodd, Senator Lieberman, Senator McCain, and 23 other cosponsors.\n  Six times in the past, Congress has passed similar legislation, most \nrecently in 1994. While Iran's repression of Baha'is appears less \nbloody today than during the 1980's, that persecution nevertheless \ncontinues. None of us has forgotten the confidential documents from \n1991, drafted and signed by Iran's highest government and clerical \nauthorities, which revealed a deliberate policy to destroy the Baha'is.\n  We believe it is important that Congress again raise its voice in \nprotest of the Iranian Government's persecution of Baha'is. While \nAmerican Baha'is reside in every State and are deeply concerned about \nthe fate of more than 300,000 Baha'is in Iran, our legislation is not \nmotivated by constituent pressure. Rather, it rests on broader \nprinciples. Ours is a Nation founded in an unwavering belief in the \nimportance of religious freedom, and all Americans--whatever their \nreligious convictions may be--believe strongly that no government \nshould condemn and persecute a people because of their faith.\n  Yet, this is what the Government of Iran has done to the Baha'is for \nmany years. Iran's constitution does not recognize Baha'is as a \nreligious group but as unprotected infidels whose civil rights can be \nignored at will. The Baha'i cannot legally marry or divorce in Iran, \nnor can they travel freely outside Iran. They cannot inherit property. \nThey are not free to assemble and cannot elect community leaders or \nmaintain their community institutions.\n  Since 1979, 201 Baha'is have been killed and 15 others have \ndisappeared and are presumed dead. Arbitrary arrests of Baha'is \ncontinue. From January 1990 to June 1993, 43 Baha'is were arrested and \ndetained for varying periods of time, and as of January this year 5 \nBaha'is were being held in prison because of their religious beliefs.\n  Baha'i cemeteries, holy places, historical sites, administrative \ncenters, and other assets, most of which were seized in 1979, remain \nconfiscated or have been destroyed. Baha'i property rights generally \nare disregarded, and many homes and businesses have been arbitrarily \nconfiscated. More than 10,000 Baha'is were dismissed from positions in \ngovernment and education in the early 1980's because of their religious \nbeliefs, and many remain unemployed without benefits or pensions. \nBaha'i youth are systematically barred from institutions of higher \nlearning.\n  Perhaps we cannot, from the U.S. Congress, end the terrible \noppression of the Baha'is in Iran. But by submitting this concurrent \nresolution, we can send a clear message to all who will listen: We have \nnot forgotten.\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, on a number of occasions over \nthe past several years, many of my colleagues and I have condemned the \ngovernment of Iran for its repressive policies and actions toward its \nBaha'i community. Today, I join with Senator Kassebaum, Senator Dodd, \nSenator McCain, and others in submitting another concurrent resolution \ncalling on Iran to change its repressive anti-Baha'i policies and to \nprotect the rights of all its people including minorities such as the \nBaha'is.\n  Since the Senate passed its first concurrent resolution on the \nIranian Baha'is in 1982, we have seen some improvement in the \nsituation. Persecution of individual Baha'is seems to be less severe \nthan in past years. Expressions of international outrage and the \napplication of diplomatic pressure have had some effect, even on the \nisolated and close-minded regime in Iran.\n  But the progress we have seen is not enough. It is not enough to say \nthat the government is not persecuting these people as much as they \nused to. It is not enough to say that only a few Baha'is are being held \nin Iran's prisons because of their religious beliefs. It is not enough \nto say that the Government of Iran is willing, in the words of a 1991 \npolicy document, to ``permit them a modest livelihood.'' It is not \nenough that the Government of Iran is willing to allow Baha'is to ``be \nenrolled in schools.'' It is not enough when all of these rights are \ndependent on citizens NOT identifying themselves as Baha'is.\n  The real thrust of Iranian policy is seen in the provisions of the \n1991 policy document that say Baha'is ``must be expelled from \nuniversities * * * once it becomes known that they are Baha'is'' or \nthat the Government will ``deny them employment if they identify \nthemselves as Baha'is.'' A policy which calls for a plan to ``be \ndevised to confront and destroy their cultural roots outside the \ncountry'' and to ``deny them any position of influence, such as in the \neducational sector, etc'' is a policy of repression and denial of \nfundamental human rights. Such a policy violates the obligations of \nsovereign states to uphold the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \nand other international agreements guaranteeing the civil and political \nrights of citizens. Such a policy must change if Iran is ever to rejoin \nthe community of nations.\n  Our action today in passing this resolution is consistent with the \nactions of the U.S. Government and responsible international bodies for \nmany years. The Reagan and Bush administrations worked to gain \ninternational support for the Baha'i community. President Clinton has \ncited ``the abusive treatment of the Baha'i in Iran'' as a critical \nhuman rights concern and his administration has remained attentive to \nthe fate of this community. The State Department has worked diligently \nto secure passage of U.N. resolutions condemning Iran for its \npersecution of the Baha'is and to raise the issue at all relevant \ninternational fora. The U.N. General Assembly has adopted numerous \nresolutions condemning Iran's human rights abuses with specific \nreference to the Baha'is. The German Bundestag and the European \nParliament have also adopted resolutions condemning Iran's treatment of \nits Baha'i community.\n  And so we come before the Senate once again with a concurrent \nresolution which will keep this critical issue in the public eye and \nwill maintain international pressure on Iran to change its ways. The \nAmerican people understand very well that if the rights of all members \nof a society are not protected, then the rights of no one in the \nsociety are secure. We do not expect Iran to become a Jeffersonian \ndemocracy. But we and the entire world community have a right to expect \nand to demand that it not persecute any of its peoples solely for their \nreligious preferences. How can a society consider itself to be just and \nbased on the law of God when it persecutes in a broad and systematic \nfashion 300,000 of its citizens who constitute the largest religious \nminority in Iran? Iran must end its hypocrisy and extend to the Baha'i \ncommunity the rights guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights and international covenants on human rights.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this concurrent resolution and our \ncontinuing effort to bring about change in Iran.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is an honor once again to join \nmy colleagues, Senators Kassebaum, Dodd, and Lieberman in submitting \nthe seventh concurrent resolution since 1982 condemning the abuses \nendured by the Baha'i faithful in Iran. It is, however, an honor which \nI would prefer to be relieved of by an Iranian Government \n\n[[Page S1187]]\nthat respects the rights of religious minorities.\n  There has been some limited progress since 1982, but the situation \nfor the Baha'is remains far from tolerable. Since 1979, 201 Baha'is \nhave been killed and thousands have been jailed. Tens of thousands have \nbeen dismissed from jobs and denied the means to provide for themselves \nand their families. Baha'is, severely persecuted in life, are not even \nafforded peace in death. Fifteen thousand graves in the Baha'i cemetery \nin Tehran were recently desecrated as a result of an excavation to make \nway for a city cultural project.\n  The scope of this persecution would seem ample proof of systematic \npersecution. But if there were any doubt in the international community \nthat the suffering of the Baha'is is a result of deliberate government \npolicy, the United Nations dispelled it in 1993 by publishing a secret \nIranian Government document. The secret code of oppression which came \nto light that year outlined Iran's design for the destruction of the \nBaha'i faith.\n  It ordered the expulsion of known Baha'is from universities. A common \nstrategy of tyrannies--this process has succeeded in depriving higher \neducation to an entire generation.\n  The document emphasizes that Baha'is should be punished for false \nallegations of ``political espionage.''\n  It calls for a multifaceted effort to stop the growth of the Baha'i \nreligion.\n  And most frighteningly, it urges the destruction of the Baha'is \n``cultural roots outside their country.''\n  The Baha'is suffer oppression not because they pose a threat to the \npower of the Iranian Government or the order of Iranian society, but \nbecause they refuse to recant their religious beliefs and accept the \nIslam of the mullahs.\n  There is perhaps no nation in the world with which we have as many \ndifferences as we do with Iran. Its quest for weapons of mass \ndestruction and its support for international subversion pose direct \nthreats to its neighbors, U.S. interests, and the interests of our \nallies.\n  If Iran is ever to enjoy normal relations with the free world, it \nmust demonstrate a commitment to abide by the basic rules of relations \namong civilized nations. This must be made clear to Iran. But we must \nalso communicate to the Government of Iran that Americans and, indeed, \nall the ever expanding free world, consider religious tolerance to be a \nminimal requirement for entry into the community of nations. A Baha'i, \nno less than any other human being, is entitled to the right to life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n  For Baha'is, as for many people, happiness is pursued through \nreligious devotion. If the theocracy that rules Iran cannot accept that \nenduring truth, it has no right to consider itself a worthy member of \nthe civilized world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/09/senate-section/article/S1185-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to offer a few quick \nremarks regarding the Senate's recent passage of a comprehensive farm \nbill, especially how it relates to the Nation's dairy industry, from \nthe dairy farmer, to the processor, to the consumer.\n  Mr. President, beginning in 1995, American fluid milk processors \ninitiated what is essentially a self-funded program which aims to \ncounteract a slow decline in the consumption levels of fluid milk. \nStrangely enough, fluid milk consumption in the United States has been \ndeclining over the past several years, due mainly to a misconception \nthat milk is not good for you. The program's intent is simple: To \nchange those misconceptions and thus increase the consumption of fluid \nmilk. Thus far the program has been very successful.\n  This trial program exists under the authority of the Fluid Milk \nProcessor Promotion Act of 1990, which is set to expire at the end of \n1996. Later this month, processors will vote on whether to continue the \nprogram, which they are expected to do, but they will need the \nunderlying authority to do so. Fortunately, Senator Lugar's amendment \nincluded just such authority by removing the sunset date in the \noriginal legislation. I commend Senator Lugar for his inclusion of the \nextended authority for the program.\n  Mr. President, promotion is the one area where milk processors and \ndairy farmers are working closely together and are in full agreement as \nto its benefits. This program, along with promotion efforts funded by \ndairy farmers, works to increase milk sales and help the entire dairy \nindustry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/09/senate-section/article/S1187-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1187-S1190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE RISING TIDE MUST LIFT MORE BOATS\n\n Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, yesterday our distinguished \ncolleague Senator Kennedy delivered to the Center for National Policy \nan important address challenging us to confront a number of issues \ncritical to our economy and our society. I commend the address, ``The \nRising Tide Must Lift More Boats,'' to the attention of Senators and \nthe public, and ask that it be printed in the Record.\n\n         Address of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, February 8, 1996\n\n       I'm grateful to your president, Mo Steinbruner, for that \n     generous introduction, and I also want to acknowledge your \n     Chairman, my former outstanding colleague in Congress, Mike \n     Barnes. I'm honored to address the Center for National \n     Policy. The Center has made impressive and innovative \n     contributions to the national debate. It truly is a national \n     policy center. I hope to speak with you today in that \n     spirit--about the future of the American economy, the clear \n     and present threat to the American standard of life, and a \n     strategy for a prosperity that lifts not only the numbers and \n     statistics, but the wages and hopes of hardworking people.\n       By most indicators, the economy is doing very well. The \n     stock market is hitting record highs. Inflation has been low \n     and consistently so. Unemployment is down. And after years of \n     slow growth, productivity is finally on the rise.\n       But those appearances are deceiving. The prosperity is less \n     than it seems--because it is uneven, uncertain, and \n     inequitable. All is not well in the American economic house, \n     because all is not well in the homes of too many American \n     workers and their families.\n       Americans are working more and earning less. Their standard \n     of living is stagnant or sinking. They have been forced \n     deeper into debt and they have less to spend. They worry--\n     about losing their jobs, losing their health insurance, \n     affording their children's education, caring for their \n     parents in old age, and somehow still saving for some \n     semblance of security in their own retirement.\n       President Kennedy said that a rising tide lifts all boats. \n     And for the golden decades after World War II, that was true. \n     But today's rising tide is lifting only some of the boats--\n     primarily the yachts.\n       The vast majority of economic gains are being channeled to \n     the wealthy few, while the working men and women who are the \n     strength and soul of this country and its economy are being \n     shortchanged.\n       From World War II until 1973, national economic growth \n     benefited the vast majority of Americans. We were all growing \n     together; but now we are growing apart--and the result is a \n     tip-of-the-iceberg economy. Since 1973, the lower 60 percent \n     of American wage earners--three fifths of our entire \n     workforce--have actually lost ground. Real family income has \n     fallen for 60 percent of all Americans, even as the income of \n     the wealthiest 5 percent increased by nearly a third, and \n     income for the top 1 percent almost doubled. As we approach \n     the 21st century, we confront an economically unjustified, \n     socially dangerous, historically unprecedented, and morally \n     unacceptable income gap between the wealthy and the rest of \n     our people.\n       Twenty years ago, the typical CEO of a large corporation \n     earned 40 times the salary of the average worker. Today that \n     CEO earns 190 times more. Can this be called fair? Can this \n     be the basis of a good or even a stable society?\n       Productivity gains used to guarantee wage gains. But not \n     anymore. In 1994 and 1995, productivity rose by 3 percent. \n     Yet wages fell by more than 2 percent--the biggest drop in \n     eight years. So the average worker did more, and yet the \n     income gap grew worse.\n       Flat or falling wages are compounded by the ever present \n     specter of layoffs. Once, corporations reduced their \n     workforces only when they were in trouble. But now profitable \n     companies are laying off good workers, at a time of \n     increasing sales, in an endless quest for ever fatter profits \n     and ever higher stock prices.\n       The recent merger between Chase Manhattan Bank and Chemical \n     Bank earned rave reviews on Wall Street--but brought anguish \n     and loss to so many homes. Stock prices soared, but 12,000 \n     jobs will be lost. Can this be called fair? Can this be the \n     basis of a good or even a stable society?\n       And as economic insecurity multiplies, other values suffer. \n     Community and family feel the pressure. Parents work longer \n     hours or take second jobs, and every extra hour on the job is \n     taking from their children--time not spent at Little League, \n     or PTA, or simply reading a bedtime story.\n       Every loss of health insurance; every cut in support for \n     child care, schools, colleges, and job training makes it \n     harder for families to earn a better future. There are those, \n     even in my own party, who see a separation between economics \n     and values--a theoretical \n\n[[Page S1188]]\n     opposition which they use and misuse as an excuse for evading \n     fundamental economic questions. But we cannot solve great \n     social problems by instructing people to be good while their \n     financial situation is going from bad to worse. The V Chip \n     makes sense, but it is no substitute for college loans. It \n     will not buy clothing or food. It will not give working \n     families a sense of hope. We have no chance of restoring \n     values if we don't improve the lives of working Americans. \n     When the economy is wrong, nothing else is right.\n       A storm is coming, and the effects are already being felt \n     by most families. Only the short-sighted, who look only to \n     the next quarterly report, can be content to live with the \n     clouds that now also shadow corporate horizons. Soon the \n     winds will be blowing through the boardrooms too. America's \n     workers are also America's consumers. We can only lay off so \n     many workers, cut wages and benefits by so much, and tear \n     down government support programs for so long, before we \n     downsize the consumer sector as well. In a winner-take-all \n     economy, eventually there will be fewer buyers, and fewer \n     winners, and ultimately even many corporate losers.\n       The Republican program, from the Contract with America, to \n     the flat tax, exploits the income gap--but does nothing real \n     to solve it. The silence on this fundamental issue from the \n     Republican Presidential candidates on the campaign trail is \n     deafening.\n       By bashing Medicare, slashing education, and trashing the \n     environment, Republican budget plans only widen the \n     disparity. In fact, half of all spending cuts in the \n     Republican budget that President Clinton vetoed came from \n     programs benefiting the bottom 20 percent of families; less \n     than a tenth of the cuts come from the top 20 percent.\n       Two-thirds of the tax breaks in the Republican plan would \n     flow to the top 20 percent--and the bottom 20 percent would \n     actually face a tax increase. The middle 60 percent would \n     suffer a net loss too, once the spending cuts are factored \n     in.\n       It makes no sense for Republicans to preach hope, growth, \n     and opportunity--while touting policies that bring growth \n     only to the richest, deny hope to the poorest, and restrict \n     opportunity for the vast majority.\n       We need to set a different course. Early in this century, \n     as Henry Ford pioneered one of America's great new companies, \n     he raised the wages of his workers to twice the average in \n     other industries. It made little apparent sense in terms of \n     short-term profits. But he knew that in the long run, he \n     would sell more Model T's if his own workers could afford to \n     buy them. In the truest sense, he created his own consumers.\n       There are still some Henry Fords left, like Aaron \n     Feuerstein, the Massachusetts mill owner, who decided to keep \n     paying his employees instead of laying them off while he was \n     rebuilding a factory that burned down last December.\n       The issue is not rich against poor, management against \n     labor, or individuals against government. Sadly, the Party of \n     Lincoln is now dividing America against itself. We cannot \n     permanently sustain a prosperity that permits us to be \n     divided between the wealthy few and the worried many.\n       We are committed to a free economy. But in times of testing \n     in the past, we have had to act together as a nation to \n     maintain the economy's freedom. A century ago, when economic \n     power was concentrating in monopolies, we enacted the \n     antitrust laws. In the midst of the Great Depression, we \n     created a New Deal of employment programs and a social safety \n     net.\n       Our day is different and our answers must be matched to it. \n     But one basic principle remains the same: Government does \n     have a role to play as the agent of our common concerns, and \n     the expression of our shared values. The era of big \n     government may be over, but a return to the era of no \n     government is no answer.\n       President Clinton has spoken eloquently about this issue. \n     So has Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, and so has the Center \n     for National Policy. This is a defining moment for our \n     nation--and a defining test for our party. We say we are the \n     party of the people. Then how can we say little, and offer \n     even less, while the very people who are the very reason for \n     our being watch their livelihoods and lives become \n     diminished?\n       Other great tests of conscience and purpose, like civil \n     rights and the Vietnam War, may have been more visible and \n     more immediate. The income gap has been opening slowly, over \n     a period of years. Perhaps it could have been diagnosed \n     earlier and treated sooner. Instead, it has festered quietly, \n     and caused a long, slow-motion depression of wages and job \n     security.\n       If we do not respond to this Quiet Depression, if we do not \n     stand up now for the people we are supposed to represent, \n     then as Democrats we will not deserve our name, our history, \n     or their continuing confidence. It is our urgent task to \n     fight for an economy where working families and the middle \n     class can begin anew to make gains.\n       So today, I am proposing a strategy to end the income gap--\n     to put the American dream back in the dreams of all \n     Americans. Each part of society has its role to play--the \n     business sector, the individual, and government. The \n     strategy I advocate combines incentives for good corporate \n     citizenship--improved protections for workers' rights--\n     increased investment in education, training, technology \n     and research--and greater wage and benefit security for \n     all workers.\n       I realize that any strategy that requires legislative \n     action has little chance in the present Congress. But the \n     temporary ascendancy of reaction is no reason to be silent \n     about what's right for America. Let us fight out the 1996 \n     election on the fundamental issue of the income gap. And when \n     President Clinton is re-elected, and Democrats retake \n     Congress, let it be our pledge and our priority to right this \n     lopsided economy.\n       Nothing less will do. The economic insecurity of millions \n     of American families breeds distrust among our citizens and \n     disrespect for our government. It tears us apart as a nation, \n     and erodes law and order. It undermines family and community \n     life--and threatens the character of America as a society of \n     opportunity and justice for all.\n       First, as a basic precondition of all else, we must assure \n     reliable, substantial and sustainable economic growth. Growth \n     alone does not guarantee better incomes; but without it, we \n     have no chance of closing the income gap. We cannot solve the \n     problem of stagnant wages by redistributing rewards within a \n     stagnant economy. Inflation has been lower for longer than at \n     any time in decades; the Federal Reserve Board must become \n     more aggressive in permitting and encouraging economic \n     growth.\n       The Federal Reserve's charter requires it to pay attention \n     to two goals--reducing unemployment and fighting inflation. \n     Both goals are critical, but the Board too often seems to \n     attend to only one of them. We need greater growth. We cannot \n     right the nation's economic imbalance, or reverse the income \n     gap facing working families, if 2.5% is the fastest which the \n     Federal Reserve will let the economy grow.\n       America is historically a growth nation--and any policy \n     that long defies that history will put this society at risk. \n     We are stable, free people in part because we are also a \n     people of plenty.\n       Second, we should create a two tier corporate tax rate that \n     rewards those corporations which create higher quality and \n     better paying jobs here at home. Let's accept the profit \n     motive, and make it work for our workers as well as our \n     corporations. I am not proposing tax penalties for bad \n     corporate conduct, but tax incentives for good corporate \n     citizenship.\n       We reward other countries with tariff benefits if they \n     qualify as ``Most Favored Nations.'' Now we should establish \n     a category of ``Most Favored Companies'' and reward them if \n     they share profits with workers, maintain or add good jobs, \n     and treat their employees well.\n       Businesses will qualify for Most Favored Company status on \n     the basis of their quantifiable track record over a rolling \n     four-year period in creating jobs--avoiding layoffs designed \n     simply to maximize profits--paying adequate wages--sharing \n     gains--training and upgrading skills--and providing decent \n     health care and retirements benefits.\n       Most Favored Companies will be taxed at a reduced rate--for \n     example, 30% rather than 34%--or a 10% reduction for \n     companies taxed at lower rates. To take advantage of the \n     reduced rate, the company would agree to allocate half of the \n     tax benefit to its workers.\n       Third, we should supplement the two tier corporate tax with \n     other incentives to close the income gap.\n       We should provide comparable incentives to encourage fair \n     treatment of employees in the non-profit sector, and in \n     start-up firms and other enterprises that pay no tax or \n     little tax.\n       We should adopt a tax incentive to encourage employers and \n     workers to place retirement savings in pension funds, IRAs, \n     and 401(k) plans that invest in Most Favored Companies.\n       We should reduce the capital gains tax on new equity \n     investments in Most Favored Companies.\n       We should give preference to Most Favored Companies in \n     awarding government contracts and grants.\n       We should provide tax credits to businesses that convert \n     full or part-time workers without benefits to employees with \n     adequate benefits. We should encourage companies that award \n     dividends to their stockholders to contribute a similar \n     benefit to their employees. Shareholders in companies that do \n     so should have their dividends taxed at a reduced rate.\n       We can pay for all these changes by eliminating costly tax \n     loopholes that encourage layoffs, discourage job creation, \n     and reward companies for moving American jobs overseas. Over \n     the next seven years, corporate welfare, tax loopholes and \n     tax preferences will cost the federal government over four \n     trillion dollars. In 2002, these tax entitlements will \n     represent a larger share of the federal budget than Social \n     Security, Medicare, or Medicaid.\n       The loopholes are gaping. In 1991, 73% of foreign-based \n     corporations doing business in the United States paid no \n     federal income taxes--I repeat, not a single dollar. And more \n     than 60% of U.S.-based companies paid no U.S. income taxes.\n       We should eliminate the transfer-pricing loophole, under \n     which multinational companies avoid U.S. taxes by shifting \n     income through rigged transactions to overseas subsidiaries.\n       We should eliminate the runaway plant loophole, which lets \n     foreign subsidiaries of American companies defer taxes on \n     income earned abroad. These companies never pay taxes on \n     their profits if they reinvest them overseas. The painful, \n     preposterous result is that our tax laws generate new jobs \n     and investments in foreign countries rather than here at home \n     in America.\n       We should close down the foreign sales corporation \n     loophole, a paper shell that lets \n\n[[Page S1189]]\n     companies shield thirty percent of their income from U.S. taxes.\n       We should eliminate the title passage loophole, which \n     encourages U.S. companies to move profitable transactions \n     onto the high seas to avoid U.S. taxes. In fact, this \n     loophole was closed in both the House and the Senate versions \n     of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, only to have it reappear \n     behind closed doors in the final bill.\n       We can and must close the Benedict Arnold loophole, which \n     allows billionaires to renounce their citizenship and move to \n     a foreign tax haven in order to avoid taxes on the wealth \n     they have accumulated in America. In 1995, the Senate voted \n     overwhelmingly to end this disgrace. Yet the Republican \n     budget quietly restores it.\n       Fourth, we should act to put new trust in antitrust, by \n     amending the laws to restrain mergers and acquisitions in \n     cases where combinations and spinoffs will cause layoffs so \n     large that they are contrary to the public interest. Our goal \n     is not to penalize the efficiency and productivity needed to \n     compete in the new international economy. But the antitrust \n     laws now bar monopolies harmful to communities, to \n     geographical regions and markets, and to consumers. The same \n     prohibition should apply to mergers that can affect \n     communities, regions, and workers even more adversely than \n     any monopoly ever would.\n       We should eliminate tax deductions for expenses for mergers \n     and acquisitions that result in substantial layoffs, and \n     strengthen existing provisions in current law that limit the \n     deductibility of interest on massive debt utilized in these \n     acquisitions. We should re-examine accounting rules that \n     invite the corporate restructurings that encourage massive \n     layoffs, downsizing, and reduced wages.\n       The fifth step in this new economy strategy is to expand \n     opportunities for workers who want union representation. \n     Today, employers who interfere with free choice and \n     intimidate union advocates get away with only a slap on the \n     wrist for their lawless conduct. Penalties for such \n     violations should be strengthened. And the federal government \n     should deny contracts and business to companies that \n     repeatedly, flagrantly, or willfully violate their employees' \n     rights and dignity.\n       We should also re-tool labor law itself to fit the growing \n     number of temporary workers who move from one employer to \n     another on short-term assignment, as we did in the \n     construction industry. It is almost impossible under current \n     rules for them to be represented by unions in negotiating for \n     better wages, benefits, and working conditions. Federal law \n     here has to be changed. A flexible workforce must not mean an \n     exploited workforce.\n       Sixth, government at every level--federal, state, and \n     local--must invest in education and training. In an \n     increasingly global economy, uneducated workers in America \n     will find their wages increasingly pressured downward by \n     unskilled and underpaid workers overseas.\n       We need to work with states and local school districts to \n     demand and to help all schools meet high standards of \n     achievement and to expand early childhood education. We need \n     to change the way we train teachers and offer them the \n     recognition and support they deserve on the basis of their \n     performance. As President Clinton has pledged, we should \n     install computer technology in every school by the year 2000, \n     in cooperation with businesses across the nation. We cannot \n     prepare children for the 21st century in 1950's classrooms.\n       The doors to college must be re-opened to more Americans. \n     Tuition costs should be deductible, and every qualified high \n     school graduate should be guaranteed economic access to \n     higher education.\n       We must provide training for real jobs to high school \n     students not going on to college. We must provide retraining \n     for workers who lose or change their jobs. We must reward \n     companies that invest in upgrading the skills of their \n     workforce.\n       Seventh, since small business is the real job creator in \n     the new economy, it must be encouraged to do what it does \n     best--create new products, enter new markets, increase \n     productivity, and thereby put more people to work.\n       We must reduce the red tap associated with government \n     assistance and regulation. Small businesses employ 50% of our \n     workers, yet bear more than 60% of the regulatory burden. The \n     average annual cost of regulation, paperwork, and tax \n     compliance for small business far surpasses what large \n     companies have to spend as a percentage of revenues. A recent \n     Small Business Administration study found that 19 cents of \n     every revenue dollar in small companies of less than 50 \n     employees was spent on regulation. Genuine regulatory \n     reform can ease these burdens. It could have been enacted \n     by Congress long ago, if so many on the other side were \n     not so intent on misusing regulatory reform as an excuse \n     and a cover to protect polluters, undermine the \n     environment, and jeopardize health and safety in the \n     workplace.\n       Eighth, we should make research a priority--in terms of \n     both direct federal funds and new incentives for business. \n     Despite its far smaller economy, Japan will spend more \n     dollars on non-defense R than we do next year. Yet, the \n     Republican budget plan would cut R spending by 30% by the \n     year 2002. Nothing could be more short-sighted than this \n     policy of financing an unneeded tax cut by retreating from \n     the scientific frontiers of future prosperity. Both the laser \n     and the transistor resulted from government financed R \n     Computers, integrated circuits, medical breakthroughs like \n     MRIs, and even the revolution of the Internet were federal \n     R initiatives.\n       Ninth, we should do more to defend American workers against \n     low-wage labor and sweatshop practices from overseas. It is \n     not protectionist to refuse to compete on the basis of who \n     can exploit their workers the most. We should declare a pause \n     before entering into new free trade agreements, so our \n     economy and our companies can adjust to NAFTA and GATT. And \n     we should condition any and all new trade benefits on \n     compliance by other countries with international labor \n     standards. We favor free trade. But it must not mean that \n     more and more of our workers have to work more and more of \n     their days for free to match sweatshops overseas.\n       We should strengthen our immigration laws to prevent the \n     importation of foreign wages and working conditions. We \n     should make it illegal for employers to lay off Americans and \n     then fill their jobs by bringing in workers from overseas. \n     Any U.S. employer who wishes to hire from abroad--even for \n     temporary jobs--should have to recruit U.S. workers first. \n     And we should end the unskilled immigration that competes \n     with young Americans just entering the job market.\n       Tenth, Congress should take long overdue direct action to \n     improve incomes and benefits.\n       We can and must raise the minimum wage. The present level \n     of four dollars and twenty-five cents an hour is a national \n     scandal--not even enough to lift a family out of poverty. We \n     should start now by raising the minimum wage to $5.15 an \n     hour, and restore as much as possible of the purchasing power \n     it has disgracefully lost in recent years. No American who \n     works for a living should have to live in poverty.\n       We can and must strengthen the Earned Income Tax Credit, \n     not reduce it. President Reagan called it the ``best anti-\n     poverty, the best pro-family, the best job creation measure \n     to come out of Congress.'' Ronald Reagan was right, and the \n     Republican Congress should heed his words.\n       Health care, too, can and must be a priority again. I for \n     one will not permit health care to become the forgotten \n     issue. It is all too present for Americans who have to pay \n     the bills and face the fears every day. My abiding goal is \n     still health security for every citizen. The reform I have \n     introduced with Senator Kassebaum is a significant step with \n     broad bi-partisan support. It could be enacted quickly--if we \n     can overcome the obstruction of a handful of Republican \n     Senators doing the bidding of insurance industry profiteers. \n     Our reform is simply justice: workers who change their job or \n     lose their job should not lose their health insurance too.\n       Finally, we must secure the safety and sanctity of \n     pensions. They must never become a corporate slush fund or a \n     piggy bank for risky investments. Here again, the \n     Republicans, instead of building more protections, seek to \n     undermine those that already exist. The Republican Congress \n     proposes to let unscrupulous corporations raid workers' \n     pension funds, and they even make the preposterous claim that \n     they're closing a tax loophole. This is odd, coming from \n     those who previously never seem to have met a tax loophole \n     they didn't like. In fact, it will cost the government \n     nothing to protect pension funds against corporate raiders \n     and unscrupulous investment managers.\n       We should create new incentives to extend pension coverage \n     to all workers, not just the 48% who are currently covered, \n     by establishing a new class of multi-employer, portable \n     pension accounts.\n       We can also put workers' pension funds to work to close the \n     income gap. We should maintain and strengthen the incentives \n     which the Republicans seek to eliminate that can direct the \n     $4.5 trillion currently in pension funds to investments that \n     will mean more and better jobs here in America. The AFL-CIO \n     Investment Trust is now committing half a billion dollars a \n     year to housing and economic development projects. Their rate \n     of return is highly competitive, and there are similar \n     examples across the country. The issue here is as plain as \n     the investment opportunity. The pension funds of American \n     workers should be financing economic growth at home, not the \n     export of American jobs overseas.\n       Of course, no economic program, no matter how far-reaching, \n     can resolve all the hurts or fulfill all the hopes of a \n     nation. But all to often we forget the link between values \n     and economics. We lament the loss of traditional ``family \n     values,'' yet we forget that the golden age we look back to \n     was also a time when family incomes were steadily rising. We \n     berate Hollywood for glorifying sex and violence, yet we \n     worship the profit motives that generate the very films we \n     condemn. We hear voices calling for the end of affirmative \n     action, or worrying that our society has become too diverse \n     to survive, but we ignore at our peril the fact that those \n     voices are driven by fear of economic loss. We worry about \n     the loss of patriotism, yet our tax policies encourage \n     corporate decisions that are plainly anti-American.\n       If we really believe in family values, then let's do a \n     better job of valuing families. Let's change policies that \n     threaten their jobs, their health care, and their pensions. \n     Let's help people educate their children and care for their \n     parents. If we really want to put the \n\n[[Page S1190]]\n     ``United'' back in the United States, then let's do all we can to \n     expand the pie and provide economic opportunity for all, \n     instead of letting the nation fragment into two separate and \n     unequal factions of haves and have-nots.\n       We will only make things worse by pursuing nostrums and \n     illusions--whether they take the form of social reaction, or \n     the new deception of the flat tax. The flat tax is a cynical \n     response to the income gap--offering but perhaps not even \n     delivering a small tax cut as the only raise most workers \n     will get--while surely providing a shameful windfall for \n     those who already have the most. The Forbes flat tax gives \n     new meaning to Franklin Roosevelt's indictment of the \n     Republicans as the party of the privileged. The only family \n     value the Forbes flat tax would enhance is the net worth of \n     the Forbes 400.\n       We are coming to the close of what has been called the \n     ``American Century.'' It has been an extraordinary era in \n     which we have conquered imperialism, fascism, and communism \n     abroad. We have wrestled with racism, sexism, poverty, \n     depression, crime and other enemies within. We have \n     struggled, often imperfectly, yet with great success, to \n     build a fairer and freer society. And we have wisely used \n     some of our resources to help other nations achieve and \n     protect their own democratic ideals. The danger is that the \n     achievements and the vision that made this possible are \n     fading too quickly into the forgetfulness of history, and \n     that we are becoming a nation fragmented between rich and \n     poor, its values diminishing as its standard of living is \n     devalued.\n       We can and must end the income gap in America. It will \n     require a new Progressive Era which will come, just as the \n     first one did, just after the forces of reaction think they \n     have achieved their dominance. We can and must restore true \n     progress in America. That is our duty as progressives. That \n     is the defining mission of the Democratic Party. And in my \n     view, that is the only way we can win--and the only way we \n     will deserve to win--in 1996.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/09/senate-section/article/S1187-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRATULATING THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF RETIRED FEDERAL EMPLOYEES ON \n                  THE OCCASION OF ITS 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nNational Association of Retired Federal Employees on its 75 years of \nservice to our public servants and our communities.\n  NARFE has protected the rights and retirement benefits of Federal \nemployees and their widows now for three quarters of a century. In that \ncause they have grown from 14 members to an organization of half a \nmillion members with 53 State federations and more than 1,740 active \nlocal chapters in the United States, Puerto Rico, Panama, the \nPhilippines, and Guam.\n  In my own State of Michigan, the city of Dearborn is home to area \nchapter 1515, with 975 members of NARFE.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Joseph \nand Eileen Coatar, two long-time constituents of mine, who celebrated \nthe truly momentous event on February 2, 1996--their golden wedding \nanniversary. Their 50 years of marriage, a demonstration of their \nstrong commitment to each other and their seven children, can serve as \nan example to us all.\n  Joe Coatar and Eileen Prendergast grew up in warm, close-knit \nfamilies, who lived in adjoining parishes on the South Side of Chicago. \nThey began dating in high school: Eileen attended Mercy High School, \nwhile Joe went to Tilden Technical High School, where he is a member of \nthe alumni hall of fame. His athletic prowess earned him all-city \nhonors for football in 1937. He then attended Notre Dame on football \nand baseball scholarships, well before the Bo Jackson era. Eileen was \nhis No. 1 fan. Joe left school in 1940 to play left field for the \nChicago White Sox. He was then called to serve our country in the U.S. \nArmy from 1943 to 1945, then returned to Chicago to marry Eileen, the \ngirl next door, on February 2, 1946, in St. Martin's Church in Chicago. \nThey have seven loving children: Mary Jane, Bernadette, Joan, Joseph, \nEileen, Dennis, and Genevieve. They also have 15 treasured \ngrandchildren.\n  Joe served his city as a Chicago police officer immediately after his \nmilitary service. He then did management consulting work for a number \nof firms, and finished his career with a 12-year stint at Blue Cross/\nBlue Shield. He was also civic-minded, somehow finding time to serve \ntwo terms as Park Forest South Village trustee, one term as a Monee \nTownship trustee, and 20 years as a Democratic precinct committeeman \nfor Will County.\n  In 1972, after raising seven children, Eileen continued her motherly \nrole working with students at Marian Catholic High School in Chicago \nHeights. She continues to work there, at the age of 78, and will soon \nbe inducted into their alumni hall of fame in recognition of her long-\ntime dedication to Marian's students. She served as president of the \nMothers' Club twice, and volunteered in the library, before becoming a \nwell-loved member of the cafeteria staff almost 25 years ago.\n  Joe and Eileen renewed their vows at their parish church in \nFlossmoor, Infant Jesus of Prague, this Saturday, surrounded by friends \nand family. We talk a lot about family values here in Washington. Joe \nand Eileen don't just talk the talk, they walk the walk. Their lives \nepitomize the values that make this country such a special place. I \ncongratulate the Coatars on their 50th anniversary, and I wish them \nmany more years of happiness together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/09/senate-section/article/S1190-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO PETER WOJCIECHOWSKI\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nrecognize Peter Wojciechowski, from Anoka, MN for his dedication and \nservice as president of the Minnesota Rural Electric Association over \nthe past 10 years.\n  Peter has been a pillar of the community. As the long-time owner of \nThurston's Furniture in Anoka, to his service on a variety of civic \nboards, including the Anoka County library board and the Ham Lake \nPlanning Commission, Peter has been a model Minnesota citizen. However, \nit is his work on behalf of Minnesota's electric cooperatives which I \nwould like to recognize today.\n  This month, Peter completes his term as president of the Minnesota \nRural Electric Association, which represents 54 member-owned electric \ncooperatives in Minnesota. During his tenure, Minnesota's electric \ncooperatives led the Nation in creating jobs in rural areas. Under \nPeter's stewardship, electric co-ops have met the unserved needs of its \nrural members in telecommunications, water and waste water \ninfrastructure and other services not readily available in the far \nreaches of greater Minnesota.\n  Peter also represents Minnesota as a national director on the \nNational Rural Electric Cooperative Association and serves on the \nInternational Foundation Board which assists developing countries in \nestablishing electric cooperatives.\n  I want to commend Peter for his efforts and for the leadership he \nprovided over the past 10 years on behalf of Minnesota's electric \ncooperatives. His contributions toward ensuring that the lights of \nrural Minnesota, rural America, and rural areas throughout the world \nburn bright are truly commendable and worthy of recognition.\n  Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to insert Peter's \naccomplishments here on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/09/senate-section/article/S1190-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1190-S1191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          UPPER GREAT PLAINS TRANSPORTATION INSTITUTE AT NDSU\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I rise to commend the work of \nNorth Dakota State University's Upper Great Plains Transportation \nInstitute. The institute is a great asset to North Dakota and other \nStates in the surrounding region and an invaluable resource and leader \nin transportation research.\n  In early January the Transportation Research Board of the National \nResearch Council held its 75th annual meeting in Washington. This \nmeeting brought together more than 3,000 participants from Federal and \nState Governments, universities, and the private sector. The \nparticipants discussed scientific, engineering, and technological \n\n[[Page S1191]]\nquestions related to highways and bridges. The 5-day conference was a \nsuccess, in part because of a telecommunications system operated by \nNorth Dakota State University.\n  Eleven conference sessions with almost 150 panelists were delivered \nby videoconference to the State departments of transportation in 6 \nStates: Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and \nWyoming. The teleconference was accomplished through the use of the \nTEL8 Center at North Dakota State University, in cooperation with the \nWest Virginia Teleconferencing Network.\n  TEL8 is a digital, 2-way, interactive, satellite-based \ntelecommunications system. It links 10 sites in 6 States, and is \ndedicated to meeting transportation needs in the region. The system is \noperated by the Upper Great Plains Transportation Institute at North \nDakota State University. The system was made possible as a result of \nthe University Transportation Centers Program sponsored by the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation.\n  More than 300 people located more than 1,000 miles from Washington \nwere able to participate in the conference through the \ntelecommunications system. Not only were they able to hear the \npresentations, but they had the opportunity to make comments and engage \nin question-and-answer periods.\n  Robert E. Skinner, Executive Director of the Transportation Research \nBoard, said recently:\n\n       Because of busy schedules and limited travel funds, many \n     transportation professionals are unable to participate at \n     TRB's annual meeting. TEL8 showed that technology can help \n     overcome these barriers and provide a means for real-time \n     participation at remote locations.\n\n  We hear much these days about the promise of telecommunications and \nhow technology is changing our lives. We hear discussions about the \nspeed of transmissions, interactions, savings of time and travel costs, \nand convenience. North Dakota State University is doing more than \ntalking about the promise of telecommunications, Mr. President. Through \nthe TEL8 system, NDSU is making the promise of telecommunications a \nreality today.\n  Telecommunications activities are increasingly important throughout \nour Nation, particularly in rural States such as mine. The TEL8 system \nis also used for professional training and support and for the delivery \nof courses relevant to transportation. NDSU is exploring additional \nways to use the system for distance learning and service-related \nactivities.\n  I am proud of North Dakota State University's involvement and \nforesight in this important field. I appreciate this opportunity to \nbring it to the attention of my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/09/senate-section/article/S1190-4", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1191-S1262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  S. 1541, the Agricultural Market Transition Act of 1996, passed the \nSenate on Wednesday, February 7.

CONSERVATION OF PRIVATE GRAZING LAND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) privately owned grazing land constitutes nearly \\1/2\\ \n     of the non-Federal land of the United States and is basic to \n     the environmental, social, and economic stability of rural \n     communities;\n       (2) privately owned grazing land contains a complex set of \n     interactions among soil, water, air, plants, and animals;\n       (3) grazing land constitutes the single largest watershed \n     cover type in the United States and contributes significantly \n     to the quality and quantity of water available for all of the \n     many uses of the land;\n       (4) private grazing land constitutes the most extensive \n     wildlife habitat in the United States;\n       (5) private grazing land can provide opportunities for \n     improved nutrient management from land application of animal \n     manures and other by-product nutrient resources;\n       (6) owners and managers of private grazing land need to \n     continue to recognize conservation problems when the problems \n     arise and receive sound technical assistance to improve or \n     conserve grazing land resources to meet ecological and \n     economic demands;\n       (7) new science and technology must continually be made \n     available in a practical manner so owners and managers of \n     private grazing land may make informed decisions concerning \n     vital grazing land resources;\n       (8) agencies of the Department of Agriculture with private \n     grazing land responsibilities are the agencies that have the \n     expertise and experience to provide technical assistance, \n     education, and research to owners and managers of private \n     grazing land for the long-term productivity and ecological \n     health of grazing land;\n       (9) although competing demands on private grazing land \n     resources are greater than ever before, assistance to private \n     owners and managers of private grazing land is currently \n     limited and does not meet the demand and basic need for \n     adequately sustaining or enhancing the private grazing lands \n     resources; and\n       (10) privately owned grazing land can be enhanced to \n     provide many benefits to all Americans through voluntary \n     cooperation among owners and managers of the land, local \n     conservation districts, and the agencies of the Department of \n     Agriculture responsible for providing assistance to owners \n     and managers of land and to conservation districts.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to \n     authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to provide a \n     coordinated technical, educational, and related assistance \n     program to conserve and enhance private grazing land \n     resources and provide related benefits to all citizens of the \n     United States by--\n       (1) establishing a coordinated and cooperative Federal, \n     State, and local grazing conservation program for management \n     of private grazing land;\n       (2) strengthening technical, educational, and related \n     assistance programs that provide assistance to owners and \n     managers of private grazing land;\n       (3) conserving and improving wildlife habitat on private \n     grazing land;\n       (4) conserving and improving fish habitat and aquatic \n     systems through grazing land conservation treatment;\n       (5) protecting and improving water quality;\n       (6) improving the dependability and consistency of water \n     supplies;\n       (7) identifying and managing weed, noxious weed, and brush \n     encroachment problems on private grazing land; and\n       (8) integrating conservation planning and management \n     decisions by owners and managers of private grazing land, on \n     a voluntary basis.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Private grazing land.--The term ``private grazing \n     land'' means privately owned, State-owned, tribally-owned, \n     and any other non-federally owned rangeland, pastureland, \n     grazed forest land, and hay land.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Agriculture, acting through the Natural Resources \n     Conservation Service.\n       (d) Private Grazing Land Conservation Assistance.--\n       (1) Assistance to grazing landowners and others.--Subject \n     to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary shall \n     establish a voluntary program to provide technical, \n     educational, and related assistance to owners and managers of \n     private grazing land and public agencies, through local \n     conservation districts, to enable the landowners, managers, \n     and public agencies to voluntarily carry out activities that \n     are consistent with this section, including--\n       (A) maintaining and improving private grazing land and the \n     multiple values and uses that depend on private grazing land;\n       (B) implementing grazing land management technologies;\n       (C) managing resources on private grazing land, including--\n       (i) planning, managing, and treating private grazing land \n     resources;\n       (ii) ensuring the long-term sustainability of private \n     grazing land resources;\n       (iii) harvesting, processing, and marketing private grazing \n     land resources;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Popcorn Promotion, \n     Research, and Consumer Information Act''.\n\n     SEC. 902. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) popcorn is an important food that is a valuable part of \n     the human diet;\n       (2) the production and processing of popcorn plays a \n     significant role in the economy of the United States in that \n     popcorn is processed by several popcorn processors, \n     distributed through wholesale and retail outlets, and \n     consumed by millions of people throughout the United States \n     and foreign countries;\n       (3) popcorn must be of high quality, readily available, \n     handled properly, and marketed efficiently to ensure that the \n     benefits of popcorn are available to the people of the United \n     States;\n       (4) the maintenance and expansion of existing markets and \n     uses and the development of new markets and uses for popcorn \n     are vital to the welfare of processors and persons concerned \n     with marketing, using, and producing popcorn for the market, \n     as well as to the agricultural economy of the United States;\n       (5) the cooperative development, financing, and \n     implementation of a coordinated program of popcorn promotion, \n     research, consumer information, and industry information is \n     necessary to maintain and expand markets for popcorn; and\n       (6) popcorn moves in interstate and foreign commerce, and \n     popcorn that does not move in those channels of commerce \n     directly burdens or affects interstate commerce in popcorn.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of Congress that it is in the \n     public interest to authorize the establishment, through the \n     exercise of the powers provided in this subtitle, of an \n     orderly procedure for developing, financing (through adequate \n     assessments on unpopped popcorn processed domestically), and \n     carrying out an effective, continuous, and coordinated \n     program of promotion, research, consumer information, and \n     industry information designed to--\n       (1) strengthen the position of the popcorn industry in the \n     marketplace; and\n       (2) maintain and expand domestic and foreign markets and \n     uses for popcorn.\n       (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are to--\n       (1) maintain and expand the markets for all popcorn \n     products in a manner that--\n       (A) is not designed to maintain or expand any individual \n     share of a producer or processor of the market;\n       (B) does not compete with or replace individual advertising \n     or promotion efforts designed to promote individual brand \n     name or trade name popcorn products; and\n       (C) authorizes and funds programs that result in government \n     speech promoting government objectives; and\n       (2) establish a nationally coordinated program for popcorn \n     promotion, research, consumer information, and industry \n     information.\n       (d) Statutory Construction.--This subtitle treats \n     processors equitably. Nothing in this subtitle--\n       (1) provides for the imposition of a trade barrier to the \n     entry into the United States of imported popcorn for the \n     domestic market; or \n     \n[[Page S1253]]\n\n       (2) provides for the control of production or otherwise \n     limits the right of any individual processor to produce \n     popcorn.\n\n     SEC. 903.

COMMODITY PROMOTION AND EVALUATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is in the national public interest and vital to the \n     welfare of the agricultural economy of the United States to \n     expand and develop markets for agricultural commodities \n     through generic, industry-funded promotion programs;\n       (2) the programs play a unique role in advancing the demand \n     for agricultural commodities, since the programs increase the \n     total market for a product to the benefit of consumers and \n     all producers;\n       (3) the programs complement branded advertising \n     initiatives, which are aimed at increasing the market share \n     of individual competitors;\n       (4) the programs are of particular benefit to small \n     producers, who may lack the resources or market power to \n     advertise on their own;\n       (5) the programs do not impede the branded advertising \n     efforts of individual firms but instead increase market \n     demand by methods that each individual entity would not have \n     the incentive to employ;\n       (6) the programs, paid for by the producers who directly \n     reap the benefits of the programs, provide a unique \n     opportunity for agricultural producers to inform consumers \n     about their products;\n       (7) it is important to ensure that the programs be carried \n     out in an effective and coordinated manner that is designed \n     to strengthen the position of the commodities in the \n     marketplace and to maintain and expand the markets and uses \n     of the commodities; and\n       (8) independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the \n     programs will assist Congress and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture in ensuring that the objectives of the programs \n     are met.\n       (b) Independent Evaluations.--Except as otherwise provided \n     by law, and at such intervals as the Secretary of Agriculture \n     may determine, but not more frequently than every 3 years or \n     3 years after the establishment of a program, the Secretary \n     shall require that each industry-funded generic promotion \n     program authorized by Federal law for an agricultural \n     commodity shall provide for an independent evaluation of the \n     program and the effectiveness of the program. The evaluation \n     may include an analysis of benefits, costs, and the efficacy \n     of promotional and research efforts under the program. The \n     evaluation shall be funded from industry assessments and made \n     available to the public.\n       (c) Administrative Costs.--The Secretary shall provide to \n     Congress annually information on administrative expenses on \n     programs referred to in subsection (b).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/09/senate-section/article/S1191-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  AUTHORITY FOR RECORD TO REMAIN OPEN\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
