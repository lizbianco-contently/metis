Mr. President, several months ago there was an \nexpression of interest in the subject of congressional pension reform \nraised by my good friend from Nevada, Senator Bryan. His concern about \nthe subject, which was raised here on the floor, was supported by the \nmajority leader, and there was concurrence that it would be appropriate \nto schedule hearings later in the year on this subject.\n  Mr. President, to address the concern raised by Senator Bryan and the \nmajority leader, I wish to announce that the Subcommittee on Post \nOffice and Civil Service, which I chair, has scheduled hearings on \nFederal pension plans for Monday, May 15, and Monday, May 22, at 2 p.m. \nThey will be held in room 342 of the Dirksen Building.\n  The May 15 hearing will be devoted to the mechanics of Federal \npension plans, including their application to Congress, and a review of \nproposals for modifying congressional pension coverage. The May 22 \nhearing will be a broad discussion of Federal plans, and will include a \ncomparison with private sector pension plans. GAO will review the \nconsiderable research which they have compiled in this area.\n  There are several goals to these hearings which include taking a \nclose look at congressional pension coverage; assessing the merits of \nthe differential between this coverage and standard Federal pension \ncoverage; and reviewing the Federal pension systems to determine if \nchanges need to be made which would enhance the current plans, and also \nprotect the financial soundness of these systems.\n  [[Page S6576]] I thank the Chair for the opportunity to announce \nthese hearings.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, many people have asked what is going to \nhappen for the remainder of the day. What we would very much like to do \nis get these amendments disposed of as quickly as possible. I know that \nmany people have plans. We would like to see how many amendments there \nare around here. I think most of the players are here. If people could \ntell us who has an amendment, then we could figure where we go from \nhere.\n  Now, who has an amendment? All right. Senator Coats. We are conscious \nof his. Senator Gorton. We are conscious of his. That is the same one \nas Senator Murray's, right?\n  Mr. GORTON. That is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Who else? Senator Dorgan has an amendment. I hope people \nwill speak up because we would like to close out the amendments, if \npossible, if we can get an agreement. Senator Boxer, I am sure, has \none. We are not seeking a big list. I know Senator Boxer has an \namendment. Senator D'Amato.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I may have some very comprehensive, exhaustive \namendments. I hope I do not have to offer them.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We hope you do not, too. If you can check with your \nCloakroom and see, we will do the same. We want to press this along and \nhopefully finish today. We know a lot of people have engagements.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I have a very brief statement with regard to the \nlegislation. If you are looking for a few moments of free time, I could \ndo that.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. If the Senator could withhold for a minute.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Sure.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Is Senator Dorgan ready to go?\n  This would involve a rollcall vote on Senator Dorgan's amendment, if \nhe proceeds with it.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. My statement is very short and is on the bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask if we could give 30 seconds or 1 \nminute to the Senator from Alaska to make a statement, and then if I \ncould have the floor again, we will return to Senator Dorgan's \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] is \nrecognized.\n                           amendment no. 861\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Chafee, and \nSenator Baucus, the floor managers; Senator Smith, the subcommittee \nchairman; and Senator Kempthorne for accepting my amendment last night \nwhich extends the efforts of Senator Kempthorne, who amended the \ninterstate waste disposal act to provide for practicable solid waste \nregulations that take into account the remote nature of Alaska Native \nvillages--that is, relief from covering landfills, controlling access \nto landfills by an operator, et cetera--to cover all Alaska villages.\n  This provision is not a blanket exemption from all landfill standards \nfor these facilities; rather, the governor of Alaska will have \nflexibility to set appropriate standards based on local conditions.\n  My amendment provides for workable solid waste regulations for all \nAlaska villages. The problems faced by Native village landfills are the \nsame as those faced by other small, remote villages; both need \nregulatory relief.\n  I have a list of Alaskan villages not classified as Native villages'' \nunder the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                           Non-ANSCA Villages\n\n       Paxson.\n       Seward.\n       Chicken.\n       Seward.\n       Skwentna.\n       Healy.\n       Kupreanof.\n       Tok.\n       Elfin Cove.\n       Siana.\n       Central.\n       Medfra.\n       Wiseman.\n       Houston.\n       Willow.\n       Tonsina.\n       Northway Junction.\n       Tenakee Springs.\n       Circle Hot Springs.\n       Gustavus.\n       Coffman Cove.\n       Ft. Glenn.\n       Talkeetna.\n       McCarth.\n       [[Page S6577]] Kenny Lake.\n       Livengood.\n       Pelican.\n\n\n                                problem\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Landfills in remote areas of Alaska do not have the \nresources to comply with Federal solid waste management regulations. \nMany communities have no local government at all, or operate all \ncommunity services on an annual budget of $25,000 to $80,000. If \nlandfills close, the result will be illegal dumping on the lands, or \ninto the rivers, because no other alternatives exist.\n  Unlike areas in the lower 48 States, if Alaska's village landfills \nare forced to close for economic reasons, the waste often cannot be \ndisposed of in regional facilities because the necessary transportation \ninfrastructure simply does not exist. Many villages are accessible only \nby aircraft, or in some cases, seasonal water transportation. Alaska is \ndifferent from the lower 48 where distances may be great, but \ncommunities are connected by road to regional landfills.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. If Senator Dorgan is ready to go, can we get a time \nagreement?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have no objection to a time agreement. \nIf I might offer the amendment, I will make some remarks, and then we \nwill talk about a time agreement.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. What about 20 minutes equally divided?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me offer the amendment first and make a few remarks. \nIt is not my intent to prolong it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Rhode Island yield for \nthat purpose?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 914\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the definition of ``municipal solid waste'' to \ninclude industrial waste regardless of whether the industrial waste is \n  physically and chemically identical to other municipal solid waste)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 914.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 49, line 16, insert the following after \n     ``thereof)'' and before the period: ``and any solid waste \n     generated by an industrial facility''\n       On page 50, strike line 22 and all that follows through \n     page 51, line 2.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. My \namendment is not particularly complicated, although it might be \ncontroversial. My amendment would change this legislation so that the \nbill includes all solid waste generated by an industrial facility with \nrespect to the definition of waste addressed in this legislation.\n  Currently, this legislation addresses municipal waste. That is, waste \nthat is generated by the general public or from a residential, \ncommercial, institutional, or industrial source consisting of certain \nkinds of materials. That is what constitutes the definition of \nmunicipal waste in the bill.\n  In my judgment, this legislation moves in the right direction in the \nsense that it gives the States the opportunity to control, to some \nextent, their own destiny. At the present time, the interstate commerce \nclause prevents States from having any say at all when somebody decides \nto load train loads of waste in one jurisdiction and move it to another \njurisdiction. The folks who live in the second jurisdiction have no \nright to say no. They have no right to say, ``You can't do that to our \nneighborhood. You can't bring this waste to our area, because we don't \nwant it.'' There is no right for them to do that under current law.\n  This legislation, under certain circumstances, gives the States the \nopportunity to say no, to decide when they do not want to have \nadditional kinds of municipal waste deposited in their landfills or \ntheir waste disposal areas.\n  The definition of municipal waste in the bill, unfortunately, limits \nthe opportunity for the States to make their views known on the subject \nof most waste that is moving around the country. Currently, there are \n15 million tons of municipal solid waste exported nationwide across \nborders; 47 States and the District of Columbia, the Canadian Provinces \nof Ontario and British Columbia, and Mexico exported some portion of \ntheir municipal solid waste for disposal in the contiguous United \nStates in 1992; 44 States import some municipal solid waste for \ndisposal; 4 States export more than 1 million tons of municipal solid \nwaste.\n  But S. 534 applies only to municipal solid waste and does not \nrestrict interstate transportation of industrial waste to the extent \nthat it can be restricted under this bill if the States decided they \nwanted to try to restrict it. I simply ask the question: Why not \ninclude industrial waste? Why would we limit this only to municipal \nwaste? It does not make any sense to me.\n  The bulk of the waste that is being transported between States is \nindustrial waste. For example, we have a landfill in North Dakota which \nreceives industrial waste. That landfill, Echo Mountain in Sawyer, ND, \nimports metal grindings, paint waste, water treatment sludge, building \ndemolition material, contaminated soil, liquid and solid waste \nassociated with car manufacturing. None of which would be covered under \nthis legislation in its present form.\n  The question is, if you are going to give the Governor or you are \ngoing to give the State the opportunity to say to those who would bring \na stream of waste into their area the right to say no, why would you \ngive them that right with only a small part of the waste? Why not all \nof the waste? Why not all of the waste including industrial waste?\n  That is the proposition I offer in this amendment. The amendment is \nvery simple. With only one line change, my amendment changes the \ndefinition of waste so that the bill's provisions would include \nindustrial waste. It is not difficult for anyone to understand. The \nimpact of it is very clear. The impact of it gives the States more \nrights, and, I think, moves in the direction that is intended in this \nlegislation.\n  So I start on this issue believing that a problem we have in this \ncountry with respect to waste disposal is the stream of waste moving \nback and forth across borders and the corporations in this country \nwhose business it is to try to find places to put waste. I happen to \nthink that smaller, less populous States who may not want to have an \nenormous amount of waste transported in for profit, ought to have the \nright to say, ``No, thank you, that is not what we want for our future. \nWe have the right to determine our own future, and this is not what we \nwant.''\n  The committee brings a bill to the floor that says that is the right \nof the States with respect to one category of waste--municipal. But \nthen they say by omission it is not the right of the States with \nrespect to the broad category of other waste, especially industrial. I \nsay why the inconsistency? If States' rights include the opportunity to \nsay no with respect to the import of municipal waste, why not the same \nright with respect to industrial waste?\n  Mr. President, I know that this is a controversial amendment. I know \nthat we will hear that this legislation is a carefully crafted balance \nand if anything should upset the balance, the whole thing falls. We \nhear that on every bill that comes to the floor. It is like a loose \nthread on a $20 suit, you pull the thread and the arm falls off. We \nhear that every time there is a bill on the floor of the Senate.\n  All I am interested in doing is to say that if the philosophy by \nwhich this bill is being brought to the floor makes any sense at all, \nnamely that is the States should have the right to say no to the waste \nflow coming into their States of municipal waste, then that philosophy \nholds true with respect to industrial waste as well.\n  I hope that both managers of this bill will stand up and immediately \naccept this amendment and thank me for offering it and say that it \nimproves this bill immensely, and I will leave the floor a very happy \nperson.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, can we get a time agreement? Will the \ndistinguished Senator agree to 20 minutes equally divided, and if we do \nnot use it, fine?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is fine with me, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I so ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n   [[Page S6578]] Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Senator was quite \nright when he said this was a carefully crafted bill. What it is, it is \na balance between the exporters and the importers, and the exporters \nand the importers have agreed--are very close to agreement now--on \ndealing with municipal solid waste. If you throw a new equation into \nit, a new element into the equation, such as how many different kinds \nof wastes are there--oh, there is hazardous waste and there is \nindustrial waste and there is construction and demolition debris--all \nof these things. We have become experts on waste around here. But we do \nnot know what the volumes are, for example, of this industrial waste \nthat the Senator is talking about. Suppose that added into the numbers \nthat were exported or imported and affected how much the quotas could \nbe that come into each State. This whole bill, clearly, would just drop \ndown. If we want a killer amendment, this is it, Mr. President.\n  I respect the earnestness of the Senator who offered it, and if he \nwants to come around sometime later in future years and say now we have \nworked it out with municipal solid waste, with the import and export \nrestrictions and the volumes and how much there can be in future years \nand so-called ratchets, that is fine, but not today. We have enough \nproblems with this legislation without adding this element into it.\n  So I very much hope that my colleagues will reject the amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota somewhat \nsarcastically says--it is not his intention, obviously--that his \namendment will not sink the bill as he suggests the managers of the \nbill will say. The fact is this amendment will sink this bill. The \nreason is because there is so much construction, demolition material, \nthere is so much sludge, there is so much wastewater treatment, there \nis so much of this in interstate commerce today.\n  Many States want to ship this material to another State to help, \nfrankly, with Superfund cleanup or to deal with their waste in a way \nthat makes good sense to their own State, and vice versa. It works both \nways. Every State in the Nation ships this material out of State. Every \nState does and every State receives some.\n  So if this amendment were to be adopted, the general commerce today \nof the interstate shipment of construction and demolition material \ngenerally, and the other material that is covered by the Senator's \namendment, would be severely disrupted and stopped. What then happens?\n  It is not going to happen because Senators are going to stand up and \nfilibuster this bill because they know that they represent interests in \ntheir States who want to be able to ship material through interstate \ncommerce.\n  It is true that we have to have a balance here. On the one hand, \npeople want to ship waste whenever they want to ship it. The free \nmarket system.\n  On the other hand, governments, particularly State governments and \nlocal municipalities, want to protect themselves. They want to enact \nlaws to protect themselves against the free market.\n  It is the tension that always exists. It is what we try to do around \nhere; namely, we try to find a balance between those two tensions. \nThere is also another tension here, another balance we have to try to \npursue. That is between States and the Federal Government.\n  Our national motto is ``e pluribus unum,'' one out of many. We are \nmany States. We are 50 States. We are not 50 nations. We are 50 States. \nWe are one nation, the Federal system. We are trying to figure out how \nto craft that balance.\n  Mr. President, it reminds me very much of something a very wise \nperson said not too many years ago. That is, all of American political \nthought can be summed up in two sentences. No. 1, get the government \noff my back; No. 2, there ought to be a law about that.\n  That is what we are facing here. That is what this question comes \ndown to. Get the government off my back, the opponents of the amendment \nsaid, because they want to be able to ship this material, different \nStates, and have interstate commerce. There ought to be a law about \nthat, is what Senators say.\n  Mr. President, we carefully considered this question in the \ncommittee, and we decided that with respect to municipal waste, which \nis more easily accounted for and which really bothers communities more \nthan industrial waste, that we should set up a system with certain \nrestrictions and certain guidelines. States, under certain \ncircumstances, can restrict the amount of municipal waste that comes \ninto their States. That is what we are doing.\n  Industrial waste is a whole different category. As I said, and the \nSenator from Rhode Island said, we really cannot account for it and do \nnot know how much it is. Frankly, I do not see why the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is getting so worked up about this, because industrial \nwaste is not really the problem that most States have. It is municipal \nwaste, and also, it is hazardous waste. Hazardous waste is accounted \nfor in an entirely different category and not the subject of this bill.\n  Mr. President, to sum up, I understand the concerns of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, but it is true that if this amendment passes, there \ncan be a lot of Senators going to come to the floor and say, wait a \nminute, we are not for this bill. We will vote against this whole bill.\n  Then what will happen? Then the citizens of North Dakota are not \ngoing to be able to limit the imports of out-of-State municipal garbage \notherwise coming into North Dakota. That is because the Supreme Court \nsaid North Dakota cannot do that unless this bill passes.\n  I think the Senator from North Dakota and all Senators want this bill \nto pass so that States are able to limit municipal trash coming into \ntheir own States.\n  For those reasons and the fundamental reason, just to make it crystal \nclear, if this amendment is adopted, Senators will come to the floor, \nand they will be against this bill because it restricts commerce way \ntoo much. No bill. And then nobody wins, everybody loses.\n  I therefore urge the Senate not to adopt this amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was right. It is not that I have a \ncrystal ball over here, but I guess the argument is that whether or not \nthis is a good idea if the Senate would adopt this, it will sink the \nbill. I do not know first hand of the flotation properties of this bill \nor who constructed it or how long it might float.\n  I do know that this is a pretty good idea to say if it is a good idea \nthat the Governors ought to have the right to say no on the importation \nof municipal waste, there is no reason to prevent them from doing the \nsame on industrial waste. If it is a good idea to give the States the \nopportunity to make their own judgment about some of these things, why \nis it a good idea to limit it to the smallest part of the waste that is \nmoving around?\n  Let me tell the Senators as an example, North Dakota imported 73,000 \ntons of municipal solid waste and 150,000 tons of industrial waste.\n  Now, if we are saying the Governor or the State ought to have the \nright to say, ``No,'' under certain circumstances, to a small part of \nthe waste that is moving in, but does not have a similar right with \nrespect to the larger part, I do not understand that. I do not think \nthat holds up philosophically.\n  The other part of the argument apparently is the claim that \nindustrial waste cannot be included in this bill because there is too \nmuch of it. The claim is that if the bill includes industrial waste, we \nwill get a lot of people upset. They will come over here and \nfilibuster, and we do not get a bill.\n  If industrial waste cannot be included because there is too much of \nit, I guess that makes my case. If there is too much industrial waste \nmoving between States, that is especially what we ought to be dealing \nwith here on the floor of the Senate.\n  My own sense is that the opposition to this is not consistent. I feel \nstrongly that if we are going to do this with respect to municipal \nwaste, we also ought to do it with respect to industrial waste, and be \nconsistent. We should decide that States ought to have the right.\n   [[Page S6579]] It was said a few minutes ago that the mood is ``get \ngovernment off our backs.'' I understand that mood. But there is \nanother mood out there by some people who say, ``I don't want garbage \nin my backyard. I don't want people to bring garbage into the areas \nwhere I have grown up.''\n  This bill gives them the right to reject that in limited \ncircumstances, but does not give them the similar right in the broader \ncircumstances with respect to industrial waste.\n  I appreciate being called earnest, at least, and I do hope that \nwhether it is on this piece of legislation or at some point in the \nfuture, the discussion about waste and its movement in our country that \nthere will be an opportunity for people in the States to make their own \njudgment about industrial waste as well. If not now, then at some point \nin the future.\n  Mr. President I shall not take further time. This is very clear.\n  I yield back my time, and I ask that we have the yeas and nays on my \nlegislation, or if the Senator from Rhode Island has different \nobjectives.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, what I really hope is that the Senator \nwill withdraw his amendment. As the Senator knows, we have had no \nhearings on this. We have arrived at the tonnage limitations that \naffect importing States and exporting limits.\n  We have had them agree to this very carefully, through a lot of \nlaborious negotiations. If we add all the tonnage that comes with so-\ncalled industrial waste, and nobody knows how to define ``industrial \nwaste,'' then we truly have upset the apple cart.\n  What can we promise the Senator? I think he has a legitimate request \nthat in the committee we would consider how to handle--I suppose we \ncould get into municipal waste, into construction, demolition debris, \nalso, and maybe that is something we ought to look at in the future.\n  I do not want to say we will do it immediately if we agree to it. We \nhave a pretty full agenda in that committee.\n  I say to the Senator that I would agree to having some hearings in \nthe future. I am not saying this calendar year, because this calendar \nyear is really just taken up with all kinds of challenges in the \ncommittee including endangered species, Superfund, clean water, plus \nthe other things we have on the agenda.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this amendment is not a surprise. We have \nbeen sending information over to the committee for a couple of years. I \nfiled a bill on this during the last session of Congress, and I have \ntalked to the committee about it.\n  I certainly respect the views of the two managers of the bill, the \nSenator from Rhode Island and the Senator from Montana, but I would \nvery much like a vote on my amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there is another point here which I think \nis quite relevant. Very little is known about industrial waste. Much \nmore is known about municipal waste. That is why we in the committee \ndecided the limits we came up with.\n  I think it is very, very dangerous to legislate in ignorance. Very \ndangerous. This body is, I might say, pretty much ignorant when it \ncomes to industrial waste. We do not know the numbers. We did not know \nthe volumes. We do not know enough about the practice, very little \nabout the practice. I think it would be very, very dangerous for this \nbody to legislate in ignorance. We may do that sometimes around here, \nand we may do it with some frequency around here, but it does not \njustify it.\n  For that reason, too, I think it is important that this amendment not \nbe adopted here. There is time to deal with this. There is no huge \noutcry. My office is not inundated. I daresay the offices of other \nSenators are not inundated with letters from people at home saying do \nsomething about industrial waste.\n  That is not the cry. What we hear is, ``Do something about municipal \nwaste. Do something about garbage.'' This is not garbage in the \ntraditional sense of the term. This is industrial waste.\n  In addition, I might underline an earlier point I made. That is, a \nlot of generators, waste generators around the country, want to avoid \nSuperfund sites, causing industrial waste to go to a site which will \nthen become a Superfund site, so they send the material to sites that \nhave the best environmental technology. Those sites are not always in \nthat same State. Often, they are in adjacent States. So generators want \nto send material to the site that has the best environmental technology \nto avoid that site being a Superfund site.\n  If we were, today, to put more restrictions in, that would make it \nmore difficult for generators of industrial waste to send that material \nto an environmentally safe site.\n  For example, I have a letter from the Associated General Contractors \nof America and a letter from the National Association of Manufacturers, \nwhich I would like to put in the Record. They basically make the same \npoint opposing this.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were order to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            The Associated General\n\n\n                                       Contractors of America,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 1994.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On Wednesday, September 28, the House \n     passed H.R. 4779, the State and Local Government Interstate \n     Waste Control Act of 1994 and it is now pending in the \n     Senate. We understand the Senate will soon consider this \n     legislation and may attempt to broaden the coverage beyond \n     municipal solid waste to include industrial wastes. The \n     Associated General Contractors of America opposes this \n     expansion.\n       Industrial wastes, particularly from construction projects, \n     are fundamentally different from municipal solid wastes. \n     There are specific regulatory programs requiring proper \n     treatment, storage and disposal of wastes generated by \n     industry using specialized methods at specialized facilities. \n     (The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 is one \n     such program.) Not all States have adequate capability to \n     manage industrial wastes. Given the potential of liability \n     under Superfund, generators of industrial waste have great \n     incentive to fully and properly dispose of these wastes. To \n     limit the transfer of industrial wastes may limit the \n     contractor from disposing of the waste at the most \n     environmentally protective facility available, regardless of \n     location. Restrictions on the interstate movement of \n     industrial wastes under this amendment would force \n     contractors to seek management of wastes at facilities that \n     may not meet the most stringent environmental standards.\n       For these reasons, AGC urges you to oppose any effort to \n     place restrictions on the interstate movement of industrial \n     waste. Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Heidi H. Stirrup,\n\n                                                         Director,\n     Congressional Relations, Environment.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Manufacturers,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 1994.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Baucus: The National Association of \n     Manufacturers (NAM) has learned that the Senate will soon \n     consider legislation addressing the interstate movement of \n     municipal solid waste (MSW). The NAM strongly opposes \n     broadening the bill to include industrial and other wastes.\n       The NAM believes manufacturers need the maximum flexibility \n     in determining the destination of wastes to disposal \n     facilities and that barriers--such as bans on interstate \n     shipment of waste--would prove detrimental to that \n     flexibility.\n       Many industrial and hazardous wastes require specialized \n     treatment for their proper management. Due to the high cost \n     of building these specialized treatment and disposal \n     facilities, adequate capability does not exist in all states. \n     Generators of industrial wastes must be allowed to safeguard \n     against Superfund liability by sending waste to the highest \n     technology, most environmentally protective facilities \n     available, regardless of their location. Industrial waste \n     generators often incur great cost to ship their waste to a \n     specialized facility so that they can isolate their waste, \n     and therefore their liability, at one location, rather than \n     multiple locations throughout the country. Restrictions on \n     the interstate movement of industrial waste under this bill \n     could cause artificially inflated waste management costs and \n     undue financial burden to manufacturing companies that are \n     implementing waste minimization and recycling programs. Such \n     restrictions also would have an adverse impact on the \n     environment if responsible waste generators are forced to \n     utilize facilities that are ill-equipped to handle their \n     particular types of waste. If companies generating waste are \n     to remain financially liable for the disposal of their waste, \n     then it is critical that the scope of the pending legislation \n     be limited to MSW.\n       For the above reasons, the NAM urges you and your \n     colleagues to oppose any effort to place restrictions on the \n     interstate movement of industrial waste. Thank you for your \n     consideration of our position. Please do not hesitate to \n     contact Theresa Knieriemen \n      [[Page S6580]] Larson of our staff at (202) 637-3175 if you \n     have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Richard Seibert, Jr.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, for that reason, and the basic one that if \nthis is adopted, I do not know what the prospects of the bill will be, \nI urge that this amendment be defeated.\n  If there is no Senator seeking time, I move to table the amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have one additional comment to make, but \nI prefer to close this debate, if I might. Are there other people on \nthe floor wishing to speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair observes the time has expired for \nthe Senator from Rhode Island. Would the Senator like to yield some of \nhis time to the Senator from New Hampshire? The Senator has 6 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wonder if we could agree to give the \nSenator from New Hampshire 2 minutes?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have no objection.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, would that add time to the \ndebate? There are some who cannot see a delay in time. I am sorry.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield to the Senator from New Hampshire 2 minutes of my \ntime. I have no interest in prolonging this.\n  Mr. SMITH. I appreciate that action of the Senator from North Dakota. \nI am speaking against his amendment, so I would say that is a very \ngenerous action.\n  I say with the greatest respect to the Senator from North Dakota, \nthis is really a killer amendment. We do not know how much industrial \nwaste is shipped nationwide. We have no idea. We have no idea how this \namendment is going to affect our national system of disposing of this \nmaterial. Every State, nationwide, ships industrial waste. There is the \npotential to adversely affect every single State in the Union. We had a \nvery careful agreement on export and import ratchets in this bill, very \ncarefully crafted. This is going to adversely affect the whole \namendment. We just have no idea what the impact would be.\n  So my concern is that it opens the door to other restrictions on \nexports, such as incinerator ash, sludges, hazardous waste, asbestos--\nwho knows? That is my main concern. We have not had any hearings. It is \njust a new issue that is suddenly injected into the debate here, so I \nstrongly urge the amendment be defeated.\n  I thank my colleague and yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me reiterate something, and then I \nwill be glad to go to a vote.\n  The real reason here is that there is too much industrial waste. That \nis, if you strip away all the arguments, the issue comes down to the \nclaim that there is too much of it so we should not include it. The \nmanagers claim that we can only get an agreement on the limited amount, \nnamely municipal waste. The big corporate interests do not want \nindustrial waste included. I understand that. But if you are in a \nneighborhood or region and folks are bringing industrial waste in by \nthe train car loads, unit train after unit train, it seems to me if \nCongress says on this little area called municipal waste, you have a \nright to say something about that, but upon the bigger area of \nindustrial waste, sorry, you do not have any rights, that does not make \nany sense to me. I think it is philosophically inconsistent.\n  I understand. I think highly of both managers of this bill. They have \ndone a lot of hard work on this. But this is not a surprise to anybody. \nWe had a hearing in Bismarck, ND, on this very issue under the \njurisdiction of the Commerce Committee a couple of years ago. I \nsubmitted legislation in the last session of Congress dealing with \nindustrial waste. I have been in touch with the committee on it over \ntime. So this is not a surprise. It is not that we are ignorant about \nindustrial waste. I know how much industrial waste goes into North \nDakota versus municipal waste; twice as much industrial as municipal. \nAnd if you say the State has a right to say no to municipal but you do \nnot have a right to say no to something twice as big, you have taken \naway the opportunity for the State to say no on the quantity. That is \nimportant to us.\n  That is the reason I offer my amendment. And I would like a record \nvote on it.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the amendment No. 914. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, earlier this week House and Senate \nRepublicans unveiled their respective 7-year budget resolutions. The \npromise of the House resolution--a balanced budget by the year 2002 and \ntax cuts for wealthy Americans--is being championed by several \nprominent Senate Republicans. Although the Senate budget resolution \ncontains a Boxer amendment that expresses the sense of Congress that 90 \npercent of the benefits of potential tax cuts go to the middle class, I \nhave every expectation that the Republican bill will be a windfall for \nthe wealthy. Moreover, the details on how the savings would be achieved \nare sketchy and are left for authorizing and appropriating committees.\n  The Senate Budget Committee resolution assumes a $256 billion cut in \nMedicare spending over 7 years, but provides no guidelines to the \nSenate Finance Committee on how these savings will be achieved. This \nproposed cut is by far the largest Medicare cut in history, and the \nadverse impact on beneficiaries and providers is clear.\n  If Medicare cuts of this magnitude are approved, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services estimates that senior citizens' out-of-pocket \nexpenses will increase by $900 a year or a total of $3,500 over the 7 \nyears. As 83 percent of Medicare benefits go to beneficiaries with \nincomes of $25,000 or less, it is obvious who will be hurt by these \ncuts, yet the budget remains silent on how it will be done.\n  In addition, cuts to providers would have serious ramifications on \noverall health care costs as cuts in provider reimbursement are often \npassed along to other payers. Provider cuts could also have a \npotentially devastating impact on urban safety-net hospitals which \nalready bear a disproportionate share of the Nation's growing burden of \nuncompensated care. These reductions in Medicare payments could also \nendanger access to care in rural areas. Nearly 10 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries--25 percent of the total--live in rural areas. There is \noften only a single hospital in their county. Significant cuts in \nMedicare have the potential of causing rural hospitals to close or \nincrease the number of providers that refuse to treat Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  I was appalled to hear that during markup of the resolution, the \nSenate Budget Committee, on a party-line vote, rejected two proposals \nto restore funding to Medicare in lieu of providing tax cuts. \nObviously, this massive cut in Medicare funding would be unnecessary if \nRepublicans did not have to pay for a tax cut for wealthy citizens.\n  We must work to ensure that any effort to extend the solvency of the \nMedicare trust fund does not put Medicare beneficiaries at risk. And we \nmust protect the program for future enrollees. I support President \nClinton's view that the Medicare trust fund must be resolved in the \ncontext of health care reform.\n  Mr. President, without comprehensive health care reform, significant \ncuts in Medicare and Medicaid will seriously harm beneficiaries and the \ntotal health care system as costs will be shifted onto families and \nbusinesses. Only by focusing on the entire health care delivery system \nwill be able to address issues within Medicare and preserve access for \nMedicare beneficiaries and underserved populations.\n  Let me close on this point. While we have heard Members on the other \nside of the aisle promise to protect Social Security, the GOP budget \nreaches balance by the year 2002, only by including the Social Security \ntrust funds in the budget calculations.\n  While I fully recognize the critical need to ensure long-term \nstability in the Medicare Program and support efforts to balance our \nbudget, I am opposed to using arbitrary cuts in the Medicare Program to \nfinance a tax break for wealthy Americans. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues on addressing these important issues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/12/senate-section/article/S6581-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6581-S6583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                       The Bottle Bill Amendment\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, as the Senate discusses the difficult \nissue of solid waste management, I would like to point out to my \ncolleagues that 10 States have achieved great success by implementing \nsome form of beverage container deposit system. My home State of \nOregon, for example, has had remarkable success with its own bottle \nbill for over 20 years. Consequently, I am offering the National \nBeverage Container Reuse and Recycling Act as an amendment to the \ninterstate waste bill.\n  So often, States serve as laboratories for what later emerges as \nsuccessful national policies. The State of Oregon and other bottle-bill \nStates have proven that deposit programs are an effective method to \ndeal with beverage containers, which make up the single largest \ncomponent of waste systems. According to the General Accounting Office, \ndeposit-law States, which account for only 18 percent of the \npopulation, recycle 65 percent of all glass and 98 percent of all PET \nplastic nationwide. That means 82 percent of the population is \nrecycling less than 25 percent of our Nation's beverage container \nwaste.\n  The amendment I have placed before the Senate today will accomplish \nnational objectives to meet our Nation's massive waste management \ndifficulties. A national deposit system will reduce solid waste and \nlitter, save natural resources and energy, and create a much needed \npartnership between consumers, industry, and local governments for the \nbetterment of our communities.\n  As someone who grew up during the Great Depression, I am constantly \nreminded of the throw-away ethic that has emerged so prominently in \nthis country. In this regard, Oregon's deposit system serves as a much \ngreater role than merely cleaning up littered highways, saving energy \nand resources, or reducing the waste flowing into our teeming \nlandfills. The bottle bill acts as a tutor. It is a constant reminder \nof the conservation ethic that is an essential component of any plan to \nsee this country out of its various crises. Each time a consumer \nreturns a can for deposit, the conservation ethic is reaffirmed, and \nhopefully the consumer will then reapply this ethic in other areas.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have a 20-year history on this issue \nand have been greatly enthused by developments in recent years in \npromoting the establishment of a national bottle bill. The amendment I \nfiled today is identical to the legislation I introduced last Congress. \nAlthough this bill has historically been referred to the Senate \nCommerce Committee, in recent years significant actions on this measure \nhave come in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  Senator Jeffords offered the bill as an amendment to the Resource \nConservation and Recovery Act [RCRA] in the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee during the 102d Congress. Even though this attempt \nfailed by a vote of 6 to 10 it was a monumental step forward. \nAdditionally, during that same Congress a hearing was held in the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on the energy \nconservation implications of beverage container recycling as outlined \nin that session's bottle bill, S. 2335.\n  I regret that I continually have come to the Senate floor to force \nthe Senate to take action on this matter, but that seems to be the only \neffective procedure for moving forward on this bill. For example, \nduring the 1992 Presidential campaign, candidate Bill Clinton declared \nhis support for a national bottle bill. However, once he took office he \nand a Democratic-controlled Congress were surprisingly silent on the \nissue in the 103d Congress. Consequently, here I am again offering the \nBeverage Container Reuse and Recycling Act as an amendment on the \nSenate floor.\n   [[Page S6582]] Mr. President, this is an active approach to dealing \nwith solid waste before it becomes waste. It is widely acknowledged \nthat recycling is the wave of the future and this amendment will \nfacilitate the recycling of beverage containers. I firmly believe the \ntime has come for Congress to follow the wise lead of these States and \nencourage deposit systems on a national level. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to fully examine the benefits of a national beverage \ncontainer deposit system and to adopt this amendment.\n                              bottle bill\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, a national deposit law is a commonsense, \nproven method to increase recycling, to save energy, to create jobs, \nand to decrease waste generation. The experience of 10 States, \nincluding Oregon and Vermont, attest to the success of a deposit law or \na bottle bill as it is commonly called.\n  Bottle bills work. These laws have been successful in every State \nthat has one. Recycling rates of over 70 percent have been achieved for \nbeverage containers in the bottle bill States. The rate is over 90 \npercent in Vermont. Furthermore, jobs have been created by this \nlegislation, not lost, and a majority of Americans support a national \ndeposit law.\n  There is a misconception in some people's minds that deposit \nlegislation is not compatible with curbside recycling programs. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. Nine of the 10 States with deposit \nlaws have vibrant curbside recycling programs.\n  Mr. President, both Senator Hatfield and I have been working on this \nissue for more than 20 years. In both of our States, curbside recycling \nprograms are working in tandem with beverage container deposit systems. \nIn today's world, we must make every effort to conserve precious \nnatural resources and reduce our use of energy. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this measure and thank the managers for considering our \namendment.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk I would \nlike to make a few remarks about. For over two decades, my State of \nOregon, and about the same period of time the State of Vermont, have \nhad on the books and in practice what we call the bottle bill. When you \nbuy soft drinks and beer in my State, whether they are in the can or \nthe bottle, you pay a deposit. That deposit becomes an incentive for \npeople to return those bottles and cans rather than dumping them in the \ngarbage and adding to the problem of trash and refuse in this country.\n  We have found it to be highly successful. At first there was a great \ndeal of concern expressed by merchants about the additional costs of \nadministering this program. There was a great deal of discussion about \nthe possibility of labor being impacted. We have demonstrated, along \nwith a modification or variation on a theme in a few other States, an \neffective measure to reduce litter and to recycle the glass from the \nbottles and the metal from the cans.\n  I have offered this at a national level for over 20 years and it is \nvery interesting that the beer industry opposes it very strongly. My \ngood friend, the former Senator from Wisconsin, Gaylord Nelson, was the \nfounder of Earth Day. However, every time I introduced the bottle bill, \nthis great environmentalist would be the first to stand and oppose it \nbecause it was the beer industry that opposed it in his State. We had \nthe same thing from the soft drink industry; they opposed it.\n  Now we find there is no longer solid opposition. Joe Coors, of the \nCoors Breweries, has swung around. I think Hamm's beer--of course \nBlitz-Weinhard, in our State--is supportive of the proposal. Now one of \nthe largest growing beer producers in the State of Oregon are \nmicrobreweries. There is no longer the solid phalanx of opposition.\n  I have asked, I suppose 100 times, for a hearing. And I have not been \nable to get a hearing on this bill.\n  We had a sponsor at one time many years ago, not the Senator from \nMassachusetts but a Congressman from Massachusetts, and he was urged \nand persuaded to get off the bill because of the opposition of \norganized labor in his State. That has been true across this country. \nThere is a lot of misunderstanding on the part of organized labor and \nothers, that this is somehow going to add to their costs or, that it is \na beautification issue, not a recycling, refuse, or trash issue. It is \nall of them.\n  I had intended to raise the bottle bill as an amendment to this bill \nfrom the floor. I rarely raise amendments that have not had hearings. I \nam a traditionalist, and believe that issues of this kind should go \nthrough a hearing process through the committees of jurisdiction. \nHowever, I have had private conversation with the chairman of this \ncommittee, Senator Chafee. I wanted to say to Senator Chafee I am not \ntrying to hold up this bill. I support it and I would like to see it \nenacted into law. Nevertheless, I feel just as strongly about trying to \nget some kind of a hearing to move the bottle bill through the Congress \nat some point during my lifetime.\n  So I would yield to the chairman of the committee at this moment, if \nhe would like to make any comment or give me some assurance of a \nhearing?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to the senior \nSenator from Oregon. He has been persistent in this measure. I do not \nrecall that we ever had a hearing in the committee. But I do recall we \nhad a vote in the committee. As I recall, Senator Jeffords, then a \nmember of the committee, raised it so we did have a vote in the \ncommittee on it.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Right.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The vote failed. However, the Senator has been very \ngracious in his handling of this subject. I would be glad to arrange a \nhearing for his legislation in our committee.\n  I just say this, if he could give us a little time? We are chock-a-\nblock in that committee right now. But in due course I certainly will \nwork in a hearing.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I appreciate the Senator's commitment and that \nsatisfies my request.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Let me say briefly, this. In my State I have always been \na supporter of the bottle bill.\n  But then it turns out that in our recycling efforts, the thing that \nmakes the recycling effort go is the fact that the recycling center is \nable to earn money from the aluminum cans. It is the big money earner \nfor the recycling center and helps carry everything else.\n  So in our State, we will not want a bottle bill where you would make \na deposit and bring it back to the central place and get your refund \nbecause that would deprive our recycling centers of this constant flow \nof very valuable income. But that may be a unique situation.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, this was a \nvalid issue, as the Senator described it in his State. However, \nconcerns expressed by other States that there is competition between \ndeposits and other recycling programs have been shown to be overstated. \nWe have had studies, and I will be very happy to produce the records of \nthose studies, indicating that this is not a valid concern, and that \ninstead of being a possible deterrent to the ongoing efforts of \nrecycling, it has become an incentive.\n  So there should not be this sense of competition between a bill of \nthis kind, in which an individual can return a beverage container to \nthe grocery store and get a refund, or other programs where container \nare returned to recycling centers. We have recycling centers in our \nState, as well as this deposit law. I would be happy to refer to those \nstudies in more detail at a hearing.\n  Mr. President, with that assurance, I see the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I do not know if he wants to get the floor on this \nissue. If not, Mr. President, I will not call up my amendment on the \ndesk. I thank the Senator for his assurance and look forward to a \nhearing on this subject.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, unless somebody is about to propose an \namendment or wants to proceed, I would like to proceed as if in morning \nbusiness for a few minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will withhold. We \nhave a couple of amendments we can accept. We can dispose of them. They \nwill take very little time.\n                    [[Page S6583]] Amendment No. 1070\n\n  (Purpose: To include in the definition of ``out-of-State municipal \n       waste'' waste that is generated outside the United States)\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Levin and Senator \nAbraham, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], for Mr. Levin, \n     for himself, and Mr. Abraham, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1070.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 49, strike lines 1 through 8 and insert:\n       (3) The term ``out-of-State municipal solid waste'' means, \n     with respect to any State, municipal solid waste generated \n     outside of the State.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     generators of municipal solid waste outside the United States \n     shall possess no greater right of access to disposal \n     facilities in a State than United States generators of \n     municipal solid waste outside of that State.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, our side has reviewed this amendment and \nwe find it acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1070) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1071\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, last night the Budget Committee, in the wee \nhours, passed the budget resolution for the U.S. Senate on which we \nwill shortly go to work. There are many, many questionable choices \nwithin that resolution. There will be a time, a very fixed time \nobviously, a minimum number of hours that we have to debate it here on \nthe floor, with a finality for that debate, and it is predetermined. \nBut I would like to just talk for a moment, if I can, about a couple of \naspects of that budget as we frame the debate about where we are going \nin this country.\n  First, I would like to call the attention of my colleagues to one \nprovision that is in this budget that this Senator finds profoundly \ndisturbing, and that I hope other colleagues will think hard about \nbefore we ratify it in the course of the budget process.\n  A lot of things are being proposed in America today under the banner \nof deficit reduction. I think there is a unanimity here that we \nobviously have to reduce the deficit. We are going to be bankrupt if we \ndo not. We cannot continue down the road that we are going on. But \nthere also ought to be an application of common sense to the choices \nthat we make as we do that. Reducing the deficit does not predicate \nthat we simply come in with a machete or a pickax and chop away at \nthings that make sense, while simultaneously leaving out there the \nthings that do not make sense.\n  One of the items that has fallen under the budget committee's \nideological approach to this issue is the Presidential campaign fund. \nFor whatever reasons--I can give you the descriptions that are given, \nbut I think the agenda is considerably different--the committee has \nchosen to eliminate the mechanism by which Americans for the years \nsince Watergate have funded Presidential elections. That method is to \nhave a checkoff on your tax form with which you decide to give money to \nthe Presidential election fund. It is a voluntary mechanism in America. \nBut it has been a most important mechanism by which we have freed \nPresidential politics from the demeaning process of requiring our \ncandidates to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from special \ninterests all across this country.\n  It has worked, Mr. President. The system has worked. President Ronald \nReagan used it. President George Bush used it. I believe President Bush \nin the course of his career as a Vice President and as a President, \nused something in the order of $200 million in order to run for the \nhighest Federal office in this land.\n  The majority leader, Robert Dole, has used it in the past. Other \nPresidential candidates in this Senate have used it, Republican and \nDemocrat alike. No one has suggested that system is wrong, corrupt, not \nworking, or not freeing the Presidential process from the rather \nterrifying money chase that we in the U.S. Senate have to go through. \nYet, this Budget Committee, in an effort to try to whack away at the \ndeficit, is going to do away with this campaign financing mechanism.\n  Mr. President, for the life of me I don't understand why--but I \nunderstand the argument that will be made. The argument will be the \nsoft, easy, political sloganeering arguments that, ``Gee, politicians \nshould not be getting welfare.'' It sounds really catchy.\n And the American taxpayer should not necessarily be paying. That is \nthe argument you are going to hear. But I will bet you that four \nmembers of the Republican caucus who are running for President are \nprepared, in a matter of weeks, to ask for that money and will take it \nand will use it.\n\n  Now, it seems to me, Mr. President, if we cannot remember the lessons \nof Watergate and remember the degree to which this country felt a \nrevulsion at what happened during that period of time, when stacks of \ncash and enormous sums of money were changing hands in an effort to try \nto curry favor and votes in America, if we do not remember that lesson, \nthen we have not learned much about what was wrong with American \npolitics in the course of the last years.\n  So I hope that before we just accept what the Budget Committee has \ndone, Members will think hard about what is really good for this \ncountry in the context of political campaign finance reform. This \nSenate has twice passed campaign finance reform in the last years. We \npassed it in 1992, and the House passed it, but President Bush vetoed \nit. We then passed it again in 1994, but it died mostly because the \nHouse of Representatives did not want to take it up.\n  The bottom line, I think all colleagues will agree, is that we saw a \nperiod of scandal in America that brought reform, and it would be \nirrational now in the face of the extraordinary impact of money in \nAmerican \n [[Page S6584]] politics to suddenly take away our capacity to free \nboth of our candidates, or any major party candidate, from having to go \nout and raise these extraordinary sums of money which most Americans \nhave come to agree distort the American political process.\n  That is not the only issue raised in this budget, and we will have \nample time in the days ahead to discuss it.\n  Mr. President, I see that the majority leader is in the Chamber. I do \nnot know if he had an announcement or a procedure.\n  Mr. DOLE. Announcement. I would like to get back on the bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me just say to the majority leader, I \nhad asked if there were any amendments. There were no amendments, and I \nallowed whatever amendments were there to be done before speaking. If \nthere is an amendment that is ready to go forward, I am not trying to \ndelay the process or hold up the Senate, but I thought I would call \nattention to this issue in the absence of that.\n  Mr. DOLE. I do not have any problem with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. KERRY. I would like to retain the right to the floor, but I will \nyield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/12/senate-section/article/S6583-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n   Mr. DOLE.

I did \nnot notice that Americans were coming up to any of us and saying to us, \nSenator, we have too much drug treatment in America; we ought to cut it \nso fewer addicts can get treatment.\n  I did not notice that a lot of people were coming up and saying, it \nis already easy enough for me to send my kid to school, so why not cut \nthe tax deduction to send our kids to college and make it harder for us \nto send our kids to school.\n  I did not notice people were suggesting that our train system is \ncomparable to the Japanese or the Germans or the French, and therefore \nwe ought to be reducing the investment in our railroads.\n  I did not notice that our colleges and universities were so fat with \nmoney that their laboratories, which are 20 and 30 years old in many \ncases, are state of the art and so they do not need additional Federal \nfunding to increase the science capacity or research of America.\n  I could run down a long list of things that I do not think Americans \nare asking us to cut, but, Mr. President, we are cutting them. We are \ncutting them. And I respectfully suggest we are cutting out of this \ncountry the guts of our ability to be able to remain a great country \nand guarantee that our kids, who are increasingly growing up in a \nvacuum, are going to have the best education system in the world, the \nkind of opportunity that we have promised through these years.\n  We had a period of know-nothingism in America once before, and I am \nnot sure that we are venturing close to a new period of sort of put \nyour head in the sand and pretend--pretend that a 15-year-old kid who \nhas an abusive parent or a drug addict parent and whose other parent is \nabsent, pretend that that kid, who is already at risk and dropped out \nof school, is somehow suddenly going to be saved by cutting access to \nthe YMCA, YWCA, the Boys and Girls Clubs, Youth Build, the City Years, \nthe AmeriCorps of this country.\n  That is what we are doing. The one part of the budget that is \nincreasing is entitlements. It is the only part of the Federal budget \nthat is really increasing in real dollars. And the truth is that you \nare not going to solve that problem just by whacking away at a fixed \namount of money when more and more Americans are turning 65, more and \nmore Americans are living longer, and more and more Americans have a \nright to expect that they are going to get quality medical care.\n  What will happen if we just lop off several hundred billion out of \nMedicare? Sure, we will cut out some waste. And, yes, some good \nentrepreneurs will respond and there will be an increase in managed \ncare and HMO's, and so forth. But you will take the guts out of \nteaching hospitals. You will take the guts out of research and \ndevelopment. And those things that have provided the United States with \nthe most extraordinary advanced technology and medical care in the \nworld will suddenly begin to diminish, just like deferred maintenance \non a building. Sure, we can cut the maintenance today, and we have been \ndoing that, I might add, in many different sectors. But 5 and 10 years \nfrom now, after 10 years of cuts and deferred maintenance, the \nbuildings begin to crumble, the bridges begin to fall down, the sewer \nsystems fall apart, the water treatment facilities are not there.\n  Mr. President, we have to stop and recognize that there are three \ndeficits in this country. There is a fiscal deficit, but there is also \nan investment deficit, and there is a spiritual deficit. And we are not \ngoing to address the investment deficit, which is critical to dealing \nwith the spiritual deficit, unless we treat all three of them \nsimultaneously. And all this budget that we will be presented does is \ndeal with the fiscal deficit.\n  What do I mean when I say an investment deficit? Well, Mr. President, \nlet me give you one example: railroads. The United States is ranked \n34th in the world in our investment in our railroads. We are just \nbehind Ecuador and Bolivia and just ahead of Bangladesh. And there are \nonly seven countries I think with railroads that are behind us--34th in \nthe world.\n  Now, I can tell you that in Boston, in New England, along most of the \neastern seaboard and much of the west coast now, and in other parts of \nthis country, rail transportation is essential to moving millions of \npeople to their jobs, taking the burden off of our highways,\n and yet, we are disinvesting in those railroads, Mr. President.\n\n  France has its TGF, Japan has a bullet train. And instead of thinking \nabout how we are going to provide millions of jobs for Americans \nbuilding an adequate transportation system, we are disinvesting.\n  No country on this planet has a railroad system that does not have a \nsubsidy. There is not a country in the world that does not subsidize \nits railroad system. And yet the House of Representatives has zeroed \nout--zeroed out--money for support of railroads.\n  Now I can give you dozens of other examples like that. Global climate \nchange. We do not know all the answers. We know that there is a \nphenomenon taking place. We do not have a complete understanding of it. \nWe need to have an understanding of it, because the consequences could \nbe cataclysmic. And yet we are cutting that research.\n  The Coast Guard, the admiral in charge of the Coast Guard told me \nthey \n [[Page S6585]] have a $600 million capital expenditure requirement \njust to keep their ships running properly to stay current with the \ndemand--Cuba, Haiti, fishing enforcement, drug trafficking. But, Mr. \nPresident, we are not providing that money. We have cut significantly \nthe amount that they need.\n  Science and research. There is not a public university in this \ncountry that is not struggling to have the capacity to be able to raise \nthe standards of learning for our children. And yet, we are going to \nhave a harder time than ever before in providing the wherewithal for \nthose universities and for those entities to carry on to meet that high \nstandard.\n  Mr. President, there are so many examples like this that it defies \nthe imagination.\n  The last time I looked, this was a very rich country. And not only is \nit a very rich country, but it is a country that is increasingly seeing \na huge division growing between those who have and those who do not.\n  From 1940 to 1950 to 1960 to 1970, Americans all grew simultaneously, \nat every sector of American society. If you were at the lowest quintile \nof earnings in America, your income grew in 10 years by 138 percent. If \nyou were in the next two quintiles from 1940 to 1980, for 40 years, if \nyou were in those middle two quintiles, you grew at 98, 99 percent over \na 10-year period. And if you were in the top quintile, Mr. President, \nyou grew at about 98 percent.\n  In the last 12 years in America, the bottom quintile went down 18 \npercent, the next quintile went down 4 percent, and the top quintile \nwent up 105 percent.\n  Now, while income has become tougher and tougher for the average \nAmerican to earn, they have been witnessing the phenomenon of \nglobalization and technology, where more and more the labor of human \nhands and hearts is not applied to work. You have automation, robotics, \nartificial intelligence, and technology advancements which are what \nprovide most of the productivity increases of this country.\n  It is very clear that America is not going to compete, by and large, \nexcept for niches here and there with low-wage, low-scale jobs. \nIncreasingly, Americans are being forced into low-wage, low-scale \nservice sector jobs. And we are not increasing the manufacturing base \nof this country in a way that creates the high value-added jobs that \nallows an American to earn more money and be able to move up the \nladder.\n  That, Mr. President, accounts for most of the anger that we feel in \nAmerica today; that, coupled with the accompanying disintegration of \nfamilies and communities.\n  Now that gets you to the spiritual deficit.\n  Mr. President, in 1965, our colleague, Pat Moynihan, warned us about \nwhat happens in America when children are having children out of \nwedlock--children born into a single-person family. In 1965, Senator \nMoynihan told us of a 27-percent-out-of-wedlock birth rate in the inner \ncity. He was accused of being a racist. Most of America put its head in \nthe sand and did not pay much attention.\n  Today that 27 percent is 80 percent. Thirty-six percent of all \nAmerican children are born out of wedlock.\n  And I ask my colleagues how they think they are going to deal with a \n15- or 16-year-old kid who has already dropped out of high school, who \ndoes not relate to their home, who has no organized religion, who does \nnot have in his or her life any of the normal ingredients of teaching \nvalues--family, church, synagogue, school--how are you going to reach \nthat 15-year-old in order to prevent that 15-year-old from becoming the \nnext inhabitant of a $50,000-a-year jail cell?\n  I am not proposing to my colleagues that Government ought to do it or \nthat Government is the solution. But I do know that Government can make \na difference in helping to create a framework which will allow those \nkids to have a shot. And that framework can be the support that we give \nto nonprofit entities, the support that we give to a boys club, a girls \nclub, support we give to the YouthBuilds, the Americorps and other \nefforts that try to intervene where there has been such a total failure \notherwise.\n  As I listen to my colleagues in the House and elsewhere, they say, \n``Well, it is the family's responsibility. Cut it off and people are \ngoing to have to take care of themselves.''\n  The problem is, Mr. President, that this country already has a track \nrecord of doing that. In the 1920's, 1930's, 1860's, 1870's and 1880's, \nwe saw what happened when everybody was left to their own devices. That \nis when we had sweatshops. That is when we had slums and squalor. That \nis when we had no ability to cure half of these things.\n  The truth is, Mr. President, that over the course of the last years, \nin the last 40 years, particularly, in America, we have learned that \nsome of these interventions truly make a difference in the lives of our \ncommunities and of our kids.\n  I respectfully suggest that the U.S. Senate, the House, the Congress, \nthe country, are on their way to creating a clash unlike any we have \never known before in this country.\n  The summer job money has been cut. Let me ask you: What are those \nkids going to do this summer in the heat of New York City or Los \nAngeles or Detroit or Chicago or Boston when they have no job? The \nGovernment said, ``We don't care. We're taking the money away. Go fend \nfor yourself.''\n  But we all know that the economy, historically, carries 6 percent \nunemployment or more. So even though we, the leadership, know that \nAmerica is going to have at least 6 percent of its country unemployed, \nare we still going to say, ``Go take care of yourself,'' and cut them \noff? What are they going to do?\n  So I think, Mr. President, we are heading for a cropper. I remember \nthe 1960's, when I came back from Vietnam. I can remember people out in \nthe streets with guns. I remember cars being overturned. I remember \nbombs. I remember firestorms of automobiles burning. I respectfully \nsuggest that we better stop and think carefully about the consequences \nof the steps we take and the choices we make.\n  Those children that Pat Moynihan talked about in 1965 turned 15 and \n16 in 1980. All you have to do is go and look at the increase of \njuvenile violence in America in 1980, and you can begin to project what \nthose children born today in the 80-percent category are going to do in \nthe year 2010 when they turn 15 and 16.\n  The increase of murder among juveniles is up 250, 260 percent. There \nwere 29,000 juveniles murdered in America in the last 10 years, and \n4,000 juveniles are currently under arrest charged with murder. The \nhighest level of murders in America today are juveniles between the \nages of 14 and 25 who are murdering other juveniles between the ages of \n14 and 25.\n  I absolutely guarantee you, it is inescapable, unavoidable, \nincontrovertible that if you have a kid born today in a country that is \nproviding less work, in a country where information and education are \nmore important to your ability to work than ever before, in a country \nwhere it will be harder for these kids to get that education, not \neasier, there is an absolute predictability to what those kids will be \nlike 15 and 16 years from today.\n  Mr. President, I used to prosecute some of those kids. I used to be a \nprosecutor, and I talked to some of them back then. It was OK, you \ncould have a conversation and you could learn something about what they \nfelt and about their anger. In the last 2 years, I have spent time \ngoing to some of the at-risk programs that we are now running, which \nare the last link between these kids and total loss. I have never, ever \nin my life heard such a level of anger that is without explanation. \nThey cannot explain it to you. They do not know where it is coming \nfrom. But you can hear those kids talk about being runaways in Florida \nor New York, about how they left their families at age 10, 11, 12.\n  Mr. President, do you know that the median age of handgun ownership, \nor gun ownership, in America today, the median age of first-time gun \nownership is 12\\1/2\\ years old?\n  So as we think about the budget choices that we are going to face \nover the course of this next 1\\1/2\\ or 2 weeks, it is my prayer that we \nare not going to put our heads in the sand and ignore the other two \ndeficits this country faces: The investment deficit and the spiritual \ndeficit.\n   [[Page S6586]] In the end, I have no question that Government is not \neven the right entity to ``deal with the spiritual'' or attempt to. But \nGovernment needs to understand the connection with those entities that \nshould be doing it, or can be doing it, and their capacity to do it, in \nthe world that we are creating.\n  Government needs to be an empowerer of the local community to reach \nthese children. For example, in Brockton, MA, there is a Boys and Girls \nClub, but only 10 percent of the kids in that community get access to \nthat club. Simple question: What happens to the other 90 percent of \nthose kids? They are out on the streets, nobody is there, there is no \nconnection.\n  That is our responsibility, it seems to me, to try to empower the \ncommunities to be able to help create the civic reaction that will \nbegin to deal with these children. And the ultimate response will come \nfrom churches and synagogues, spiritual organizations, nonprofit \nagencies, schools, and parents, but you have to have a place to begin. \nYou have to start somewhere. It seems to me, that if you have a kid \nsitting in front of you who is 12 or 13 years old and they are already \ndabbling in drugs, and they are already in trouble at home, and they \nare already disconnected to the school, we have a fundamental choice: \nAre we going to turn our back on that kid and cut that kid off, or are \nwe going to try to channel that child toward some group or organization \nthat will bring the child in, embrace the child with a notion that the \nchild has a stake in the community and the community cares? I think \nthis budget is draconian with respect to those efforts. I am not sure \nhow in the next days, given the choices we have, we are going to fix \nit.\n  Mr. President, none of what I am saying should be interpreted to mask \nover the deficit that we do face on the fiscal side. I am prepared to \nmake tough choices about cuts that we ought to make and even reordering \npriorities to try to balance the budget, which I think we ought to do. \nBut nobody has ever convinced me of why we absolutely have to do that \nin 6 years versus 8 or versus 10 years. Nobody has convinced me that \nthere is some economic virtue in picking a target date that is so \narbitrary that may wind up cutting capacity to meet other needs that we \nhave.\n  One other point, Mr. President. Increasingly in America, we are \nseeing the cash economy of this country grow. It is now, I am told, \nabout a $600 billion economy. That means that we are losing annually \nabout $100 billion of revenue because people just choose not to pay \ntaxes. In fact, as a nation, we have gone from voluntary compliance in \nour income tax of 96 percent down to 81 percent. Each loss of a point \nof voluntary compliance is the loss of $5 billion of revenue. So your \ngood taxpaying, hard-working family that is earning $25,000, $30,000 a \nyear and paying their taxes is slugging it out to make ends meet, to \npay for fire, police, schools, roads, everything we do, while an \nincreasing number of American citizens are getting away with not paying \ntheir taxes.\n  We have a choice. I read in the newspaper the other day that we are \ngoing to have a new thing called a lifestyle audit, and people in \nAmerica are now going to be able to anticipate the IRS jumping into \ntheir driveways and asking them why there is a certain kind of car in \ntheir driveway, how they manage to go ski somewhere, what their \nvacation style is, why they eat at certain restaurants, and that is the \nway we are going to supposedly enforce the Tax Code. I do not think \nAmericans are going to tolerate an IRS gestapo-like entity of people \nintrusively moving into their lives.\n  So, Mr. President, if we are really going to make this system work \nand recapture that cash economy, we have to talk about changing the tax \nstructure of this country and moving away from a dependency on income \nand into consumption where it is the only place that you can begin to \nshift to a reflection of what the cash transaction is while \nsimultaneously, I think, increasing people's savings and moving in a \nnew direction.\n  Mr. President, I see that the manager of the bill is on his feet. If \nhe has an amendment, I am prepared to conclude.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes, Mr. President, we have a couple of amendments we \nwould like to have accepted, then the Senator is free to continue.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, what I would like to do--the Senator from \nWisconsin has been waiting patiently. I talked longer than I told him I \nintended to--I will just conclude my comments. I will have more to say \non this in the course of the next weeks. But I believe we are at a \ncrossroads, and I think that the choices that I have outlined are only \na few of the choices. But we cannot look at the needs of this country \nexclusively in terms of an arbitrary approach to the deficit reduction. \nWe have to look at the other two deficits that the Nation faces.\n  There is such a thing as investment, and there is such a thing as a \nreturn on investment, and there is such a thing as multiples of return \non investment. I think that most people in the Senate understand that. \nThe question is whether or not we are going to make those wise \njudgments.\n  I thank my colleague from Wisconsin for his patience, and I thank the \ndistinguished managers for their courtesy. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/12/senate-section/article/S6584-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6586-S6587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the junior \nSenator from Massachusetts with regard to the question of including the \nPresidential checkoff for campaigns in the budget resolution. It is an \nimportant program for our elections being free and fair in this \ncountry, and it does not belong in the budget resolution. I intend to \ncomment on that more as we get into the budget resolution itself. I am \ngrateful to the junior Senator from Massachusetts for those remarks and \nfor his constant dedication to try to do something about this really \nawful system of financing campaigns that we have in this country.\n  Mr. President, I rise at this time to offer a few comments on the \ndebate that really does belong as part of the budget resolution, and \nthat is the debate that has been taking place about Medicare. I would \nlike to share my own perspective on the direction we ought to pursue.\n  As we consider the budget resolution, presumably starting next week, \nthis will be one of the two or three most central issues that we \ndebate. As the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] noted on the floor \nlast week, the Medicare debate has been obviously politicized in quick \norder. That should not surprise us given the nature of the program and \nespecially how it is viewed by millions of Americans. It is a valued \nprogram. The presence of the White House Conference on Aging last week \ncertainly had an impact on what was said, and said by Members of both \nparties.\n  Mr. President, the White House conference also gave me an \nopportunity--a great opportunity--to talk to many of the leading aging \nactivists from Wisconsin on the issue. I found their thoughts \ninteresting. I think Wisconsin has one of the best groups of advocates \nfor sound and compassionate policies for the elderly in the country. \nThey always give the straight view. They tell me not only what is good \nfor the elderly but what is good for society as a whole, including \ntheir children and grandchildren.\n  In a meeting I had with most of the Wisconsin delegates to the White \nHouse Conference on Aging, there was a clear consensus that some \nchanges do need to be made to Medicare. But there was also agreement, \nMr. President, that those changes to Medicare have to be done in a \ncertain way. We need to ``cut smart,'' not ``cut mean,'' as we look to \nkeep the Medicare hospital insurance fund solvent and reduce the \npressure on the Federal deficit.\n  It bears emphasizing that there are these two features with respect \nto the Medicare problem--both the solvency of Medicare and the impact \nof Medicare on the Federal budget deficit.\n  As every Medicare beneficiary knows, there are two parts to Medicare \ncalled part A and part B. Part A is what is formally known as hospital \ninsurance. It pays some of the costs of hospitalization, certain \nrelated inpatient care, as well as skilled nursing facility care and \nhome health care. I should add--and I have always been somewhat \ndistressed by this--it does not cover chronic or long-term care in that \npart of the program. Other than copayments and deductibles, part A \nservices are paid from the hospital insurance trust fund, which itself \nis funded from payroll taxes.\n  Mr. President, it is this hospital insurance trust fund that is in \njeopardy, and it is expected to be insolvent by the year 2002. The \nother part of the program, part B, is the supplementary medical \ninsurance program that covers doctors' fees, most outpatient and some \nother related services. Part B is partially funded by the monthly \npremiums that beneficiaries pay, but most of the part B program is \nfunded from the Federal budget.\n  Mr. President, some are characterizing the cuts they expect to \npropose to Medicare as being needed to keep Medicare solvent. That \nportrayal is entirely misleading, as, of course, it is meant to be; for \nthough some changes are needed to keep the hospital insurance fund \nsolvent, that trust fund is not the whole story. Medicare is also \nslated for cuts as part of the broader effort to reduce the deficit, \npossibly leading to a balanced budget.\n  So let us be clear within this body and to all Americans, the goal \nhere of those who want to cut Medicare drastically is not just to make \nthe fund solvent, they want to use a lot of those billions of dollars \nto deal with our national deficit problem.\n  Mr. President, I make this point because I fear that the political \nspin doctors who have chosen to depict Medicare cuts as being apart and \nseparate from the rest of the budget are really doing a great \ndisservice to the cause of deficit reduction itself. And there is no \nother issue I care more about or work harder on than reducing the \nFederal deficit.\n  In an effort to minimize the political fallout that surely will come \nfrom cuts to Medicare, I fear they may undermine any chance for a real \nbudget package that will achieve the consensus it must have if we are \ngoing to make the politically tough decisions needed to actually \nbalance the Federal budget.\n  Mr. President, my message is that we have to be honest with the \nAmerican people on what is really going on with Medicare. Medicare \nclearly does have an impact on the budget. Part of the reason cuts are \nbeing proposed in that area does stem from our Federal budget deficit, \nand rightly so. Medicare does have to be on the table as we look at the \nbudget. I will say, Mr. President, Medicare is not Social Security. It \nhas to be considered along with other areas of Federal spending. In \nfact, I have sponsored legislation that has included some specific, \ntargeted Medicare cuts.\n  Medicare cuts were part of the 82-point plan to reduce the Federal \ndeficit that I used and created during my campaign for the U.S. Senate \nin 1992.\n  More importantly, I have voted for legislation that contained \nsignificant, but specific, targeted cuts to Medicare twice during the \n103d Congress. The reconciliation legislation we passed as part of the \nPresident's deficit reduction package included nearly $60 billion in \nMedicare cuts. This is not some new idea. It is not as if Medicare has \nnot already, in effect, given at the office. It has already been hit to \nthe tune of $60 billion just 2 years ago.\n  Mr. President, I also voted for, and was pleased to be a cosponsor \nof, the bipartisan Kerrey-Brown deficit reduction package. It also \nincluded significant, specific Medicare cuts on top of the $60 billion \nthat was included in the President's deficit reduction package.\n  Yes, Mr. President, I am willing again to vote for certain Medicare \ncuts if they are appropriate and do not cut at the heart of the health \ncare of the people who need Medicare.\n   [[Page S6588]] But while Medicare needs to be on the table as we \nsearch for ways to reduce the deficit, we have to ensure that any \nchanges make sense both within the context of the Medicare program \nitself and in the broader context of our entire Federal budget. For \njust as Medicare clearly has an impact on the Federal deficit, Medicare \nbeneficiaries and Medicare providers should not be asked to fund other \npolitical or policy priorities apart from the goal of reducing the \nFederal deficit.\n  So I am concerned, Mr. President, that those who argue the loudest \nfor a balanced budget tend to be the people who are the first to demand \nmassive tax cuts and not decreases but increases in Federal spending. I \ndo not think the use of Medicare cuts to do those two things is \nappropriate in the context of this budget resolution.\n  Mr. President, I want to be one of the people on this floor to say \nthat neither political party is blameless in this regard. Both \nRepublicans and Democrats have argued for increased defense spending \nand for tax cuts at the same time they are out here promising a \nbalanced budget and saying that their top priority is a balanced budget \namendment.\n  We cannot argue that changes to Medicare are needed to lower the \ndeficit and then devote our very scarce resources to tax cuts and \ndefense increases.\n  Again, Mr. President, I am willing to support certain further cuts to \nMedicare to bring the Medicare trust fund into balance, and even, where \nappropriate, to help reduce the Federal budget deficit.\n  That is not something I would say about Social Security. I will say \nit about Medicare. I am not willing to support cuts to Medicare, \nhowever, to fund an irresponsible tax cut and increase our bloated \ndefense budget.\n  Looking to the Medicare Program for cuts will be hard enough. It \nwould be far better to be making changes to Medicare as part of \ncomprehensive health care reform. In my view, Mr. President, that would \nbe my first choice as the health care reform debate illustrated \npowerfully last year.\n  The cost-shifting takes place because of Medicare, and Medicare \nmushrooms health care costs. Making changes to Medicare unilaterally as \nwe apparently will do in this budget this year, outside of \ncomprehensive reforms to the entire health care system, I am afraid \ninvites even more of the cost-shifting.\n  I am afraid, though, Mr. President, to be realistic, there is no sign \nthat comprehensive health care reform will be before the Senate in the \n104th Congress. That complicates the job of finding savings in Medicare \nand limits what to expect in the way of potential savings.\n  Nevertheless, Mr. President, I want to say today and be specific that \nthere are changes in Medicare that can and should be made. For example, \nwe could consider making some changes to the Medicare home health care \nbenefit.\n  For example, I am willing to consider requiring a modest copayment on \nthose home health services as long as adequate provision is made for \nthose with lower incomes. Proposals I have seen for 20 percent \ncopayment may be too high. Maybe they are looking at a 5-or-10-percent \ncopayment, making sure that those who cannot afford it are taken care \nof. It could at least be on the table.\n  Moreover, Mr. President--again to be specific, not just talking in \nthe abstract about Medicare cuts--let me acknowledge that some have \nsuggested that we might move to have a prospective payment system for \nhome health care providers under which Medicare would reimburse \nservices on a per episode basis. Some say that would not harm people \nand would be more efficient and save money. Given the dramatic rise in \nthe number of visits per person served on the Medicare home health \nbenefit in recent years, such a change might make sense. It certainly \nis something we should examine.\n  Mr. President, I want to also remind my colleagues that a great deal \nof the increase in the utilization we see in the Medicare home health \ncare benefit has been the direct result of previous policy changes to \nMedicare that were also supposed to create savings. It did not work \nthat way, in part, because of changes to Medicare patients who are \nbeing discharged from hospitals quicker and sicker than they used to \nbe. In many cases, Medicare policies have just moved the site of care \nfrom the hospital to the home, with the resulting increase in home \nhealth care benefit utilization.\n  I am pleased that much of the care can be given in the home, but we \nhave to be realistic about the cause and effect resulting from Medicare \nchanges. It should serve as a caution to all as we seek to find savings \nin Medicare, we should not just make a cut here and find out we are \npaying the same or more through Medicare at another location. That does \nnot accomplish anything either for Medicare, the people who benefit \nfrom it, or for the goal of reducing the Federal deficit.\n  Mr. President, in other areas there may again be more room for \nmodifications, to the way, for example, we make payments to hospitals \nfor capital-related costs of inpatient service. Some have argued that \nthose capital-related rates reflect erroneous inflation forecasts, and \nadjustments ought to be made to account for the errors.\n  This sounds like the kind of specific cut in Medicare that does not \ngo to the heart of Medicare, does not harm the individual's ability to \nget the care they need, but the inefficiency and excesses of the way \nthe system is set up. These should be at the top of our list, not at \nthe bottom.\n  During last year's health care reform debate, this kind of \nmodification was considered. I think it deserves review again.\n  Mr. President, one change that must be a high priority also, is to \nask wealthier beneficiaries to shoulder more of the cost of part B \nservices, relieving taxpayers of some of the subsidy they are now \nproviding, which amounts to about 75 percent of the full value of the \nMedicare part B premium.\n  I proposed that in 1992 as part of my deficit reduction proposal, and \nI recall the comments made by the majority leader that those with \nhigher incomes ought to be asked to pay a little more for part B \nservices. So that should be on the table.\n  We should also consider making changes to eliminate so-called \nformula-driven overpayments for hospital outpatient services. The \nMedicare part B copayment of 20 percent is intended to lower the cost \nof Medicare to taxpayers on a dollar-for-dollar basis. For every dollar \nof copayment made by a beneficiary, Medicare's own liability is \nsupposed to drop by $1. It is my understanding there are anomalies in \nthe Medicare reimbursement formula for certain outpatient hospital \nservice. The result, Mr. President, is that the liability to Medicare \nis just greater than it should be.\n  So we are talking here about real ways to save dollars to achieve our \ndeficit reduction goals without scaring the people in this country who \nneed the basic Medicare services, like the possible changes to \ninpatient capital-related payment rates. This matter was debated during \nthe health care reform debate last session. We did not get it done. We \ndid not get these cuts implemented. We could be getting the benefit and \nsavings of those today if we had acted then instead of waiting until \nnow.\n  Some suggested we change the formula-driven overpayments. Again, I \nwant the specific ideas on the table for the people of this Congress \nand for the whole country to examine.\n  Mr. President, I am willing to consider proposals that provide \nincentives to seniors to select managed care alternatives. There are \nother changes that I would certainly be willing to consider.\n  Mr. President, I do want to say a few other things about changes that \ndo not make sense. Some we should not be doing. For example, shifting \nMedicare costs on the backs of those with very low income not only \nunfairly burdens those least able to bear additional costs, but, again, \nto the extent it swells Medicaid costs, all it will do is transfer the \ntax burden from the Federal taxpayers to the State taxpayers.\n  Of course, that is a convenient result for our Federal budget \nwriters, but not an improvement for the taxpayers back home in \nWisconsin or Minnesota.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned the Kerrey-Brown package as legislation \nwhich I supported and which also contains specific and significant \nMedicare cuts. As I have noted before on this floor, the process, Mr. \nPresident, the \n [[Page S6589]] process by which Senator Kerrey of Nebraska and Senator \nBrown of Colorado and others put together this package was, to me, a \nmodel of bipartisan cooperation.\n  We did not hear much about it during the 1994 campaign. People \nassumed that everything that happens out here is partisan. But that is \nnot what I have found. There are people in this body who do want to get \ntogether on a bipartisan basis to solve the deficit problem. They have \ndone it. They have put a lot of time into it. They are willing to do it \nagain.\n  For my part, I came away from that process greatly encouraged that \nthere were Senators on both sides of the aisle who were willing to band \ntogether to find some common ground in reducing the deficit, even if it \nmeant bucking the partisan political rhetoric of their respective \nparties.\n  Mr. President, I believe that in this 104th Congress we can achieve \nthat kind of bipartisanship again, and I want to signal today as we \nmove into next week of the budget resolution, that I am not only ready \nbut very eager to participate in that bipartisan effort. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to spend just a moment \ntalking about a courageous young girl in my hometown of Boise, ID.\n  Nine-year-old Susie Hamilton, a bright, vivacious, and loving girl \nsuffers from a rare and deadly form of leukemia. She has been in and \nout of hospitals in Boise, Salt Lake City, and Seattle for the past 8 \nmonths. A bone marrow transplant is her last hope for life.\n  Mr. President, Susie is blessed with two outstanding parents who are \nleaders in the community. Her father, Steve, is a Boise Fire Department \nbattalion chief, dedicated to saving lives. I have worked with him \npersonally on a variety of projects. Her mother, Becky, works at Boise \nCascade Corp. Both have spent many long hours away from their jobs to \ntend to Susie's needs.\n  There have been some rough times for Susie, Steve, and Becky. I would \nlike to read from a newspaper column by Tim Woodward in the Idaho \nStatesman, who wrote about this family:\n\n       Leukemia along is bad enough, but there were other \n     heartbreaks. When a match was found for a donor after \n     hundreds of tests, the donor turned out to have hepatitis. \n     Susie got it through a transfusion. Last month, she had to \n     have a lung removed. When a doctor praised her courage, she \n     whispered, ``What choice, do I have? I want to live.''\n\n  The community has responded, raising over $12,000 to offset medical \nbills. Today there is a silent auction at Susie's school to raise \nmoney. Boise firefighters have switched shifts so Steve can spend time \nwith Susie. Boise Cascade has given Becky as much time off as she \nneeds, and has even given the family use of the corporate jet to fly to \nSeattle.\n  This ribbon I am wearing, Mr. President, is just one more sign of the \ncommunity's willingness to rally around their neighbor. Members of the \npolice and fire departments, sheriff's department, workers at Boise \nCascade, Susie's classmates and teachers, employees at city hall, and \nothers in Boise are wearing these ribbons to show their support for the \nfamily.\n  I would like to read this letter I just received from Susie's \ngrandmother, Barbara Dennett:\n\n       My Granddaughter, Susie, was diagnosed with adult leukemia \n     in October of 1994 and since then has endured prolonged \n     hospitalization for chemotherapy and several surgery's in \n     Salt Lake. Susie is now in Seattle undergoing preparations \n     for a bone-marrow transplant. This is her only chance to \n     overcome the leukemia--her only hope for survival.\n       After searching for 8 months for a bone marrow match, isn't \n     it ironic that on this 50th anniversary of World War II's \n     death and horror, a German soldier will be the donor to save \n     the life of a little 9 year old girl in America. I believe \n     this to be a noteworthy occasion.\n       This soldier was scheduled to go out on maneuvers, which \n     would delay the bone marrow transplant 15 more days, but \n     chose to make himself available for the draw instead stating \n     he did not wish for her to suffer a minute longer than \n     necessary. His bone marrow will be hand delivered from \n     Germany to Seattle. Hand carried, the transplant will begin \n     the minute it arrives.\n       Thank you for your time and consideration in seeing that \n     President Clinton receives this information. When I told \n     Susie, that every one was praying for her all over the world, \n     she ask ``even the President of the United States?'' How \n     could I answer with anything other than ``yes, even the \n     President''. A card or call from him would go a long way in \n     helping her believe that we are all telling her the truth \n     when we say that there is always hope that she will be well \n     again and a bright future lies ahead.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter this letter into the \nRecord. I also ask unanimous consent that the newspaper article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Special 9-Year-Old Touches a City's Heart\n\n                           (By Tim Woodward)\n\n       If you've seen a Boise firefighter lately, you may have \n     noticed he was wearing a purple ribbon on his uniform.\n       They're wearing purple at City Hall, too. The mayor, city \n     council members and other office workers all have purple \n     ribbons pinned to their clothing.\n       Purple ribbons dot lapels at the Boise Cascade Corp., the \n     Ada County Sheriff's Department, Life Care Center, hospitals, \n     doctors' offices, Highlands School.\n       The ribbons are symbols of support for a kid who has had \n     more bad luck than any 9-year-old deserves. Susie Hamilton \n     has a rare and deadly form of leukemia. She has been out of \n     hospitals nine days in the past eight months. A bone marrow \n     transplant is her last hope for life.\n       Steve Hamilton, Susie's father, is a battalion chief with \n     the Boise Fire Department. Hamilton has dedicated his life to \n     saving lives. Now his fellow firefighters are helping him in \n     the fight to save his daughter's life.\n       When Susie got sick, the firefighters donated shifts so her \n     father could be with her. When she needed a marrow donor, the \n     firefighters raised $4,000 and added 527 names to the donor \n     registry.\n       Susie's mother, Becky Hamilton, works at Boise Cascade. The \n     company not only extended her leave time, it flew the family \n     to Seattle in a corporate jet when Susie needed to see a \n     specialist there.\n       On May 12, the fire department, Boise Cascade employees, \n     the sheriff's department, Highlands School and civic groups \n     will sponsor a silent auction to raise money for medical \n     expenses. Businesses\n      have donated raft trips, airplane rides, bicycles and other \n     prizes. The auction will be at Highlands, Susie's school.\n       ``Everywhere we go, whether it's the hospital in Salt Lake \n     or the one in Seattle, the people we work with are just \n     amazed at the support network we have in Boise,'' Steve \n     Hamilton said. ``They say it's unheard of in this day and age \n     to have that kind of community involvement.''\n       So far, Boiseans have donated more than $12,000 to the \n     Susie Hamilton Leukemia Account (200 N. 4th St, Boise, ID \n     83702). Velma Morrison dropped by last week with a check for \n     $2,500.\n       One of Susie's grandmothers helped her write a children's \n     book. ``Lillie the Laughing Giraffe Loses Her Spots and \n     That's No Laughing Matter'' will go on sale May 12. Boise's \n     Legendary Publishing Co. donated its services. All of the \n     proceeds will be used for Susie's medical expenses.\n       ``Boise is known as the City of Trees, but to me it's the \n     city of love,'' Susie said. ``. . . I've learned a lot about \n     love and friendship and caring since I got sick. I want to \n     thank everyone who has helped me--my friends, my family and \n     people I'll never get a chance to meet.''\n       Leukemia alone is bad enough, but there were other \n     heartbreaks. When a match was found for a donor after \n     hundreds of tests, the donor turned out to have hepatitis. \n     Susie got it through a transfusion.\n       Last month, she had to have a lung removed. When a doctor \n     praised her courage, she whispered, ``What choice do I have? \n     I want to live.''\n       The search for a donor was worldwide. The winner: a soldier \n     in the German army. The transplant will be May 10, in \n     Seattle.\n       Hundreds of people will be thinking about a brave little \n     girl that day.\n       They'll be saying prayers, wearing purple ribbons, hoping a \n     miracle will save a life that has touched a city's heart.\n\n[[Page S6590]]\n\n     \n                                                                    ____\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I have good news today, Mr. President. Susie Hamilton \nunderwent 15 hours of surgery yesterday at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer \nCenter in Seattle, receiving the bone marrow from that German soldier. \nI am pleased to say early reports are positive, and the prognosis is \ngood.\n  Mr. President, I will be sending a ribbon just like this to the White \nHouse today so that President Clinton can affirm to Susie through \ncorrespondence that everyone is praying for her speedy and thorough \nrecovery so that we can all affirm that there is always hope where \nthere is prayer, and that truly people all over the world are praying \nfor Susie, and to acknowledge the support of the community of Boise and \nall of Susie's friends as they rally around a neighbor, which I think \nis the spirit that does bring about not only hope but the positive \nresults that we want.\n  Mr. President, I thank you.

Mr. President, today, I want to continue my discussion on \nthe crime bill that I intend to introduce in the Senate next week.\n  As I have pointed out in previous speeches on this issue, there are \nreally two fundamental issues that we always need to address when we \nlook at the question of a crime bill, when we look at whether it is a \ngood crime bill or whether it is not, when we look at whether it gets \nthe job done or not. The first question is: What is the proper role of \nthe Federal Government in fighting crime in this country, understanding \nthat 90 to 95 percent of all criminal prosecution is not done at the \nFederal level, but rather done at the local level, the State level, the \ncounty level? What is the role of the Federal Government?\n  The second question we always have to ask is, despite all the \nrhetoric: What really works in the area of law enforcement? What really \nmatters? And, conversely, what does not matter?\n  On Wednesday of this week, I discussed these issues with specific \nreference to crimefighting technology. The conclusion I reached was \nthat we have an outstanding technological base in this country that \nwill do a great deal to help us catch criminals.\n  Mr. President, technology does, in fact, matter.\n  However, we do need the Federal Government to be more proactive in \nthis area, more proactive in getting the States on line with this \ntechnology and giving the States the assets they need to get that job \ndone.\n  Having a terrific national criminal records system or huge DNA data \nbase for convicted sex offenders in Washington, DC, is great--but it \nwill not do much good for the police officer in Lucas County, Hamilton \nCounty, and Franklin County, OH, or if other jurisdictions across this \ncountry cannot tap into it, cannot get the information out or, \nconversely, cannot put the information in.\n  Mr. President, crime occurs locally. So we have to make sure the \ncrimefighting resources--such as high-tech data bases--are, in fact, \navailable to local law enforcement. And one of the principal provisions \nof the bill that I will introduce next week does just that, drives that \nhome to the thousands, tens of thousands of local law enforcement \nagencies scattered throughout our 50 States.\n  Mr. President, on Thursday of this week, I discussed a second issue--\nwhat we have to do to get armed career criminals off our streets. At \nthat time, I talked specifically about a program called Project \nTriggerlock that targeted gun criminals for Federal prosecution.\n  Mr. President, Project Triggerlock worked. It got 15,000--15,000--\narmed career criminals off the streets in just 18 months. But, \nincredibly, the Clinton administration abolished this program. My \nlegislation, Mr. President, would bring back Project Triggerlock, and \ntoughen the laws on gun crimes in many other significant ways. It is \nclear, if we are going to be tough on crime and do things that really \nmatter, we have to get armed career criminals off our streets.\n  Today, I would like to turn to a third provision of my crime bill, a \nthird issue, and it is an issue that is near and dear to my heart as a \nformer county prosecuting attorney, and that is the people that we many \ntimes forget in our criminal justice system, the victims of crime.\n  Today, I would like to talk about that component of my crime \nlegislation. I would like to discuss some of the measures I think we \nought to take in the area of victims' rights.\n  The late Hubert Humphrey said, in a much admired and much quoted \ncomment:\n\n       The moral test of Government is how that Government treats \n     those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who \n     are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are \n     in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy, and the \n     handicapped.\n\n  What the former Vice President and former U.S. Senator said, what he \nwas talking about was the fundamental role of Government to protect the \nweak, to protect those citizens who could not protect themselves. That \nis why, I submit, Mr. President, I think victims of crime belong on \nthat list, as well.\n  For too long, victims have been forgotten by our judicial system. \nFrom start to finish, the legal system can be a terrible ordeal for the \nvictims--a bureaucratic nightmare that seems to and, in fact, does many \ntimes, go on and on and on.\n  In our Constitution, we have all kinds of protections for the rights \nof defendants, as well we should. We try to make sure that they have \nevery possible chance--and that is good--because we do not know if the \ndefendants are guilty. We want to know if they have justice. That is \nwhy we bend over backwards to be fair to anyone accused of crime.\n  Mr. President, in the process, I believe that many times we have \nforgotten the victims of crime.\n  Over the last few decades, we have made some progress in this area. \nWe have made some progress in recognizing the rights of victims. When I \nwas a county prosecutor in the 1970's, I saw too many crime victims, \npeople who had already been hurt, hurt a second time by a callous legal \nsystem. That is why I did everything that I could to protect the rights \nof those victims.\n  Today, the legal process, in spite of changes, in spite of reforms, \nin spite of progress that we have made, is still too brutal on the \nvictims. Our bottom line has to be this: To be victimized once by a \ncrime is already once too often. To be victimized yet again by an \nuncaring judicial system is totally, totally unacceptable.\n  There are some measures we should take as part of this year's crime \nlegislation to continue the process of making the legal system treat \ncrime victims with greater fairness and with greater consideration. Let \nme talk about a few of these.\n  No. 1, let us make sure that crime does not pay. Today, a Federal \ntrial court may--may--order restitution for crimes. I think that in \nevery case they should order restitution for crimes. I think we should \nmandate full restitution in all Federal criminal cases.\n  No. 2, let us stop the brutalization of victims in our courts. Under \ncurrent law, lawyers are not allowed to present evidence that they know \nis false. That is a basic tenet of judicial ethics for lawyers. Every \nlaw student learns that early on. But what defense lawyers can do under \nour current system is this: If they have a crime victim on the stand, a \ncrime victim whom they know is telling the truth, defense lawyers are \nstill allowed to make it look like that witness is lying. Defense \nlawyers can do this even though they know the witness is telling the \ntruth. My legislation would prohibit this practice.\n  No. 3, let us make the trial process more fair to the victims. Under \nthe Constitution, a defendant has the right, if he so chooses, not to \ntestify in his own defense. This is a very important constitutional \nright. It is imperative that we always protect this. This \n [[Page S6591]] right has a consequence, a consequence that is both \nunintended and, I submit, undesirable.\n  There are cases in which the defense team decides not to put the \ndefendant on the stand, which is fine, and then, though, attacks the \nvictim's character and the victim when that victim, himself or herself, \ntakes the stand and testifies. In effect, the defense lawyers put the \nvictim on trial while at the same time being able to shield the \ndefendant from questions about that defendant's own character.\n  I think it is time to end the free ride for these defendants. Let us \nsimply say to the defendants and let us say to the defendants' lawyers \nthis: If you, the accused or a lawyer, want to attack the character of \na victim, then you can expect the prosecutor to call your character \ninto question. It is only fair. It is only right. It is only just.\n  No. 4, let us make people who are accused of sexual assault be tested \nfor HIV. If you, or one of your loved ones, was the victim of a sexual \nassault today, it is very difficult to find out if the attacker has \nHIV, and in today's society, is that not something that the victim \nshould know? Is that not something that the court system should help \nthe victim to determine?\n  Last year, the Senate version of the crime bill did have a provision \nmandating HIV testing of persons arrested for sexual assault. The \nClinton administration supported this provision. But in the other body, \nfor some reason, it was dropped.\n  My legislation would change that. My legislation would put that back \nin. My legislation would force the HIV testing of these defendants and \nthe disclosure of the testing results to the victims of crime.\n  No. 5, a fifth way to make our system more fair and more just to the \nvictims of crime, let us make the jury, the whole jury system, a level \nplaying field. The O.J. Simpson trial has focused America's attention \non the process of the selection of a jury. How do we make sure that the \njury is a fair panel?\n  Mr. President, under today's Federal laws, prosecutors can challenge \nsix potential jurors without giving cause, what in the courtroom they \ncall ``cause.'' Six jurors can be knocked off without giving any \nreason. Defense lawyers, however, can challenge 10 without giving a \nreason. These are called generally peremptory challenges where each \nside can excuse a juror without giving a reason.\n  I think that we should give victims an impartial trial, jury, and a \nfair shake. To do that, I think we need to give both the prosecution \nand the defense simply the same number of peremptory challenges. It \nonly seems right, and it only seems fair.\n  Mr. President, all the provisions I have discussed today to protect \nvictims have a common theme. In our judicial system, we cannot condone \nthe revictimization of crime victims. Our system is and must be \nimpartial. It must be impartial between the prosecution and the \ndefense, all the while recognizing the presumption of innocence on \nbehalf of the defendant.\n  There is no reason that the presumption of the defendant's innocence \nshould be construed in such a way that it condones heartless treatment \nof crime victims. The criminal law embodies some of the truly \nfundamental values of our society. One of these values is that we \nshould console those who have been hurt. We should not victimize them \nfurther.\n  A number of years ago when I was a county prosecuting attorney, I \nwould see the victims of murder and other violent crimes. I would \ninterview people who had been abused, assaulted, and raped. I learned a \nlot from talking to these innocent people. I learned that we have to \nmake the crime victim a full participant, not a forgotten person, in \nthe criminal justice system.\n  The proposals I have just outlined would help us make some progress \nin turning the criminal justice system into a more victim-friendly \nenterprise. It is long past time that we stop treating the victims like \nthey are criminals and the criminals like they are victims.\n  My legislation is an attempt to move the concerns of crime victims \ntoward center stage in our Federal criminal justice policy.\n  Next week, I will continue my series of speeches on the crime bill \nthat I intend to introduce next week. On Monday, I will explain what I \nthink we ought to do to get more police officers on the streets, \nparticularly to get more police officers on the streets where the crime \nis the highest, because if there is one thing that we know, it is this: \nLaw enforcement officers who are well trained and who are deployed \ncorrectly on our streets will, in fact, reduce crime. That is a fact. \nThat is the truth. I will talk more about this next week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/12/senate-section/article/S6590-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6591-S6593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MORATORIUM ON REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, in March of this year, just 2 months ago, \nthis Senate considered a bill that would have imposed an across-the-\nboard moratorium on the issuance of new major regulations. That across-\nthe-board moratorium would have extended from last November's election \nup until the end of this year, the end of 1995. It would have \nencompassed all of 1995 and the last several months of 1994.\n  That bill came up before the Senate, and it was overwhelmingly \nrejected by this Senate. Instead, on this across-the-board moratorium, \nthe Senate adopted a substitute amendment which was offered by the \nSenator from Oklahoma and the Senator from Nevada.\n And that provided for a 45-day review of major new rules coming up \nbefore the new rules by the Congress. This 45-day review was agreed to \nby this Senate 100-0. Any time you can get a vote of 100-0, it is \nconsidered favorable; overwhelming is an understatement.\n\n  Before that bill was sent over to the House and to the conference of \nHouse and Senate Members, many of us here in the Senate made clear that \nif the conference report came back with an across-the-board moratorium, \nwe would oppose it. We do not want these across the board moratoriums. \nWe wanted the situation that was proposed by the Senator from Oklahoma \nwhich, principally, was for a 45-day review.\n  I want the Senate to know, as I indicated during the earlier debate, \nthat I will oppose the conference report if it includes provisions of \nthe type that I outlined, namely the restoration of these broad \nmoratoriums that this bill had.\n  Now, yesterday, a Member of the House released a list of the rules \nthat they have targeted in the House. They are not satisfied with a 45-\nday review. They have targeted some 30 rules--12 of them are EPA rules; \n4 of them are worker safety rules to be issued by OSHA; 10 of the rules \nrelate to food and drug safety. Almost all of the rules on the list \nthat are targeted by the House are there to protect public health, \nworker safety, and the environment.\n  I notice that the occupant of the chair is the distinguished Senator \nfrom Minnesota. One of the rules that is targeted deals with the Great \nLakes clean water quality guidance. I do not know the position of the \noccupant of the Chair on this. I suspect that most of the Senators from \nthose States--Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, \nPennsylvania, and Wisconsin--are interested in the quality of the water \nin those Great Lakes.\n  The EPA has proposed an initiative dealing with that situation. The \nEPA has estimated a proposal that could cost from $80 to $500 million \nannually. This has to do with the cleanliness of those lakes. This is \none of the rules that has been targeted by the House Members, one that \nwould be subject to an extensive moratorium.\n  There are a host of others, Mr. President. One of them I will \ndescribe. It is a rule promulgated under the Safe Drinking Water Act. \nIt would reduce the levels of so-called disinfection byproducts in \ndrinking water. These are the chemicals that form when water is \nchlorinated, as is done in most communities. It is chlorinated to kill \nbacteria and other organisms. The chlorine, in some instances, combines \nwith other substances in the water to form new chemicals, such as \nchloroform, that may cause significant cancer risks for those using the \nwater.\n  A recent article in the American Journal of Public Health indicated \nthat up to 10,000--not 1,000, but 10,000--cases of cancer per year may \nbe attributable to these chemicals in our water. EPA has been working \non a rule to reduce this health risk.\n   [[Page S6592]] Did EPA just conceive this rule as a bunch of \nbureaucrats sitting down at EPA headquarters? This is what they did. \nThey convened a regulatory negotiation involving all of the parties \nthat had an interest. The drinking water suppliers, the States, the \ncities, public health organizations--a very broad group worked for 2 \nyears on this rule. With one exception, this broad range of interests \nall signed an agreement at the end of the process supporting the \nproposed rule. The proposed rule reflects a significant consensus \nacross virtually the entire community of interests involved in drinking \nwater. Now, under the House proposal this would be targeted; it would \nbe suspended, you could not have the rule. You could not have the rule \nuntil some indefinite period--until certainly perhaps the end of this \ncalendar year, and probably into the future likewise. Why should they \ndo that? I am opposed to that type of action by the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  A second item on the list is a petition that EPA approved last \nDecember. It was a petition submitted by 13 States from the northeast--\nmy State involved likewise--asking that cars with pollution controls \nsuch as those used in California also be sold in the Northeast to \nreduce our air pollution problems. This was not an EPA proposal. In \nfact, EPA was reluctant to approve this petition. It was required by \nthe Clean Air Act because 13 States had made the request.\n  I was under the impression that many of those who support these \nregulatory reform efforts want to return more responsibility to the \nStates. They say, ``We believe in the States and States rights.'' Here \nwe have a proposal that was made by the States that is targeted on this \nHouse list as being suspended.\n  Now, a third item on this list is the Federal implementation plan for \nCalifornia that was promulgated in February. EPA was ordered by the \ncourts to produce this plan when California failed to come up with its \nown program. The EPA program has been controversial in California and \nGovernor Wilson has asked that it be suspended. And this list would \ntarget it for suspension.\n  But this EPA clean air plan for California has already been \noverturned. The supplemental appropriation for the Defense Department \nenacted earlier this year already repealed the California plan, \nincluding this item on this list of 30 rules to be killed must be an \nerror, because Congress has already acted to repeal this rule. I bring \nthis item to the attention of the Senate to make that point. Where \nspecific measures, including rules that are required by the courts \nbecause of laws enacted by the Congress, go too far, we should take \naction to correct the excess. We have done that in several cases. We do \nnot need an across-the-board moratorium, as mandated by the House in \nthe legislation it passed and suggested for this conference.\n  Another item on this list is also from the Clean Air Act. It is the \nemployee trip reduction program that requires large employers in most \nsevere nonattainment areas to work with their employees to reduce the \nnumber of vehicle trips each day. In other words, this is a way, in \nnonattainment areas of the country where they have not attained the \nclean air requirements, goals, that large employers would work with \ntheir employees to reduce the number of vehicle trips. Six hundred \nemployees, six hundred cars--is that necessary, or is there another way \nof doing it? EPA has not issued, nor is it about to, any rule \nimplementing this requirement of the act. So there is no rule to \nsuspend.\n  This is a requirement of the Clean Air Act that guides States in the \ndevelopment of their own implementation plans. It is carried out by the \nStates without Federal regulation. This is an example where a mechanism \ncalled a regulatory moratorium, such as the House is suggesting, is \nbeing used to reach into the Clean Air Act and knock out a specific \npolicy that some in the House apparently do not like.\n  I am not here to defend the employee trip reduction program. In fact, \nearlier this year I asked EPA Administrator Carol Browner to look for \nother approaches to the problem of the increasing number of vehicle \ntrips and miles that are traveled that we might substitute for this \nmeasure in the Clean Air Act. I am not arguing policy grounds one way \nor the other. My point is that in the guise of regulatory moratorium, \nsome in the House are seeking to repeal the provision of the Clean Air \nAct that is not even implemented through Federal rulemaking. This \nproposal is not to freeze a rule. There is no rule to freeze. This is a \nproposal to change the law.\n  This list reflects an attack on 30 specific policies that some \nMembers of the House would like to see reversed. These policies are \nintended to protect public health, worker safety, and the environment. \nI am familiar with the rules on the list that would come from EPA. They \ncannot be characterized as rules written by out-of-control bureaucrats \nwithout regard for cost or risk reduction. To the extent that \nrulemakings are actually involved, they have all been subject to cost-\nbenefit analysis under existing regulatory review requirements. In some \ncases the rules have either been painstakingly developed in \nconsultation with State or local governments are actually written by \nthe States themselves.\n  Mr. President, the House is no longer proposing a regulatory \nmoratorium. What we have here is a fishing expedition. They have thrown \nout a long list of policies they want killed to see how many the Senate \nwill take in the name of compromise to get a bill. I hope our Senate \nconferees will not engage the House in this discussion.\n  Mr. President, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to reject an across-\nthe-board moratorium on new rules. I trust the Senate conferees will \nnot allow the conference to produce a bill that makes 30 specific \nchanges in law without hearings, without debate in either body on the \nspecific policies, and without the opportunity for Members to exercise \ntheir rights to offer amendments and have votes on the substantive \nquestions at stake. That would be an extraordinary abuse of the \nstandards that are to be observed by a conference committee between the \nHouse and the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me state to my colleagues who are \nwondering about votes today, we believe we may have a unanimous-consent \nagreement. If it is approved, there will be no additional votes today. \nWe should have word on that, hopefully, in the next few minutes.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nhelp States get a handle on their local waste flows and to ensure that \nStates are not precluded from establishing regional solid waste \nreduction plans. Next year, the subtitle D regulations affecting \nlandfills will go into effect. These new regulations will force States \nto closely reevaluate their disposal needs and develop their own \ncomprehensive plans on how they might implement the more stringent \nregulations.\n  Kentucky has already taken the initiative in establishing one of the \nmost comprehensive solid waste reduction plans of any State. The \nKentucky plan mandates that regional and local authorities establish a \nwaste collection and disposal plan as well as regional waste reduction \nstrategies. These efforts have proven effective in stopping illegal \ndumping, increasing recycling, and reducing the overall need for \nlandfill space.\n  Unfortunately, without Federal legislation these plans are open to \nconstitutional challenge. Mr. President, where does that leave us? How \ncan States effectively meet the goals of reducing waste flows, \nincreasing recycling, and improving landfill standards if they are \nprohibited from establishing an effective waste management plan?\n  Those of us who have been involved in the interstate waste issue \nknow, this legislation is necessitated by the commerce clause of the \nConstitution. A number of State and local initiatives that attempted to \ndeal with solid waste issues have wound up in court, and eventually \nbeen struck down based on this provision of the Constitution. \nConsequently, it is virtually impossible for a State to effectively \ndeal with their own waste flows without a specific delegation of \nCongress' plenary commerce power.\n  In every Congress since 1990 there has been an attempt to provide \nStates the authority to keep the interstate flow of solid waste in \ncheck. Over the past 6 years, I have fought hard with Senator Coats to \nensure that States like Kentucky and Indiana do not become dumping \ngrounds for those States that have refused to control their own waste \nflows.\n  Mr. President, my amendment will correct this by authorizing States \nto establish a comprehensive plan for waste reduction. This is \nessential if communities are to get a handle on their own waste flows \nthrough plans that promote local planning and are consistent with the \nobjectives of subtitle D, of the Solid Waste Disposal Act passed by \nCongress in 1991.\n  Gone will be the days of open dumps and multitudes of cheap landfills \nwhen the new standards are implemented in 1996. These standards will \nmandate liners, leachate collection and treatment, groundwater and gas \nmonitoring, and new corrective action. The EPA has estimated that \nnearly half of the Nation's 6,000 landfills will close. In Kentucky, \nnew landfill standards have already gone into effect and the number of \nlandfills has declined dramatically from 29 to just 6. Mr. President, \nthese new regulations will compel many States to rethink their disposal \nneeds and how they should plan for the future.\n  Many States may find they do not have an effective plan for disposing \nof their waste. States will need to establish a plan for consolidation, \nreduction, and recycling programs mandated by the Resource Conservation \nand Recovery Act. Again, my amendment will help States plan for the \ninevitable and protect already established plans from legal challenge.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will not eliminate existing host \ncommunity agreements, nor will it ban the interstate flow of waste. In \nfact, in Kentucky a special landfill was recently authorized to accept \nwaste from out-of-state. A number of Kentucky counties continue to ship \nand accept nominal amounts of waste from our neighboring States of West \nVirginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. My amendment will not disturb \nthese arrangements.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is entirely consistent with the export \nreduction strategies contained in this bill.\n  I have worked with the officials of the Kentucky Department of \nNatural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet and officials in \nMagoffin County to ensure that State and regional waste plans are \nprotected in this legislation. I am appreciative of their assistance.\n  Today, Congress will clarify whether States have the authority to \nestablish their own plan for the disposal of waste. Only with the \nexplicit delegation of this authority can States be certain that they \nare acting within a constitutional framework.\n  I would like to thank the managers of this bill for accepting this \namendment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator McConnell for the \nwork he has done in connection with solid waste. It is a subject he has \nbeen interested in for a good number of years.\n  Kentucky is a State that has established one of the most \ncomprehensive solid waste reduction plans of any State and the Senator \nwas very conscious of that in his dealing with the legislation before \nus.\n  Mr. President, I again congratulate the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky, Senator McConnell, for the work he has done.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we have reviewed the amendment on our side \nand urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1074) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week, the Senate Environment and \nPublic Works Committee reported out a bill to designate the National \nHighway System or NHS. I want to congratulate the chairman of the \ncommittee on his leadership.\n  While some provisions in the bill cause me some concern, there is one \nfeature that I would like to highlight today.\n  The National Highway System authorization bill repeals the national \nmaximum speed limit. This is a commonsense feature. Repeal removes the \nthreat of Federal highway dollar sanctions if a State does not post its \nroads at a 55- or 65-mile-per-hour speed limit.\n  The current standard of 55 or 65 miles per hour may make sense in \nsome States--especially in urban, congested areas. However, for big, \nsparsely populated States like Montana, it may make sense to change \nthat standard. And there is no need for Washington to decide for us.\n  Mr. President, the point is that the States should have the ability \nto set their own speed limits. The citizens in each State should have a \nsay in these decisions without the threat of a Federal highway fund \nsanction.\n  I spend a lot of time walking the roads in Montana. I have walked \nfrom Livingston to Bozeman along I-90; down Route 93 from Missoula to \nHamilton; up from Butte along the road to Missoula; and this summer I \nhope to spend a lot of time on the Hi-Line.\n  And I can tell you first-hand, those are easy roads to walk and they \nare easy roads to drive. They do not get a lot of traffic. People stop \nand talk. I can wave to every other driver as he or she goes by. And we \nshould not treat these roads as if they have bumper-to-bumper New York \ntraffic.\n  We made at least a start by letting States raise the limit to 65 on \nrural roads. But a Montana driver could drive very safely on many of \nour roads at a higher speed. Montana should be able to set its own \nspeed limit without threatening our highway money.\n  So, Mr. President, among all the things the NHS bill does--tucked in \namongst the big construction projects, new technology, increased \ncompetitiveness, and new jobs--is something that is pretty small, but \nwhich does a lot to make life easier and Government more sensible.\n  It is just plain, simple common sense. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/12/senate-section/article/S6594-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6594-S6595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1075\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, this managers' amendment that I have sent \nto the desk is the result of laborious and lengthy negotiations \ninvolving the distinguished Senator from Indiana, who spent so much \ntime in connection with this legislation, and the distinguished Senator \nfrom New York, and many other Senators who have an interest in this \nlegislation.\n  So I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we have examined the amendment. It is my \nunderstanding that various Senators, particularly the Senator from \nPennsylvania, as well as the delegation from Illinois, who had some \nquestions in the last final moments, have now found their objections \nare no longer such as to prevent the Senate from passing this bill. \nThey no longer have those objections.\n  With those assurances, Mr. President, I urge the passage of the bill.\n  I want to particularly thank the Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats. \nSenator Coats labored in the vineyards in this issue for years and \nyears, and I highly commend him for his efforts to limit out-of-State \ngarbage from coming into his State of Indiana. I also want to \ncompliment the chairman of the committee.\n  Last year, we almost passed this bill--within an eyelash of passing \nit. I compliment the chairman of the committee for helping make passage \na virtual reality here today.\n  Many other Senators worked very hard trying to get the right balance, \nbasically, between those States who want to limit trash coming into \ntheir States and those States that still do export a lot of trash.\n  Now, the exporting States, particularly New York and New Jersey, I \nthink are to be commended for taking significant action to reduce the \namount of exports to those States to put less pressure on importing \nStates.\n  Nevertheless, I think it is very important that the importing \nStates--including my State of Montana--have the ability to say no to \nout-of-State trash. It is very important we have that.\n  I compliment, again, the Senator from Indiana as well as the Senator \nfrom New York [Mr. D'Amato]. I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the Senator from Montana commended me for \nlaboring in the vineyards for so many years. It did not seem like I was \nin the vineyards--more like the town dump.\n  I want to thank the chairman, Senator Chafee, for his work this year \nwith me and with the coalition in fashioning this legislation, in \nparticular this amendment that is being sent to the desk. It is the \nculmination of a lot of years, of a lot of work, by a lot of people.\n  As the Senator from Montana said, it is critical that States that are \nunwilling recipients of out-of-State waste have a say as to whether or \nnot they receive this waste.\n  The Senator from Montana has worked tirelessly to help Members \naccomplish this effort. I would say to the Senator from Rhode Island, \nwhat a difference a year makes. We are here, together, working together \non fashioning what I think is very appropriate legislation. I want to \nthank him, along with Senator Smith, Senator D'Amato, and others, for \nhelping to put this amendment together. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, again I would like to say that the reason \nwe have this legislation is really because of the steady, persistent \ntenacity of the Senator from Indiana.\n   [[Page S6595]] I can assure the world that everybody in Indiana \nshould feel very, very grateful for the work that Senator Coats has \ndone in connection with this legislation. I can also assert that when \nthe definition of ``bulldog'' is given, there is no one the tenacity \nshown by a bulldog more appropriately fits than Senator Coats. He has \npressed this issue to its fullest. I congratulate him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  So, the amendment (No. 1075) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COATS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank the distinguished Senator from Montana for his patience and help \nin all these measures; not only this one we are dealing with right now, \nbut the whole series of them. His suggestions have been excellent. I \nwant to express my personal appreciation, but I know that everyone in \nthe Senate is indebted to him for his hard work in seeing we get these \nagreements.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1076\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, in my judgment, there have been a number \nof premature pronouncements about the outcome of the President's trips \nto Moscow and Kiev that I believe are one-sided and unfair. Many \nimportant achievements have been overlooked and ignored, and important \nfoundations have been laid for success on more contentious issues in \nthe future.\n  It is far too early to know what the ultimate outcome will be on the \nvery contentious issue of the proposed Russian sale of nuclear reactors \nto Iran. The President began the process of engaging the Russians \nseriously on the serious global security implications of such a sale by \nsharing information with the Russians which they will not assess and \ndebate. The Russians have not closed the door to reconsideration of \nthis issue; the President kept it open through persuasive argument \nwhich we hope, when fully evaluated by the Russian side, will lead to \nthe Russians decided to cancel this sale.\n  Lost in the coverage of the reactor sale was an important victory in \nthe resolution of a number of outstanding issues regarding Russia's \nclosing down arms sales to Iran. The Vice President and Chernomyrdnin \nwill draw up the final agreement on this very important issue, which \nwill permit Russia to join in with other States as a founding member of \nthe post-COCOM regime. Key sticking points on biological weapons \ncooperation, notably the Russian agreement to begin visits to \nbiological weapons factories on August 1, 1995, were resolved and the \nUnited States and Russia also issued a joint statement on principles on \ntheater missile defense systems and their relationship to the ABM \nTreaty. Yeltsin also reaffirmed strong support for START II \nratification.\n  In large part because of the President's personal effort, Russia \nrecommitted herself to being part of the evolving European security \nlandscape. Yeltsin agreed to drop his opposition to moving forward with \nRussia's Partnership for Peace Membership and agreed to proceed with \nimplementation of its program before the end of this month.\n Yeltsin also indicated agreement with plans to launch an expanded \nRussia-NATO dialog at the May NAC.\n\n  These are all significant developments, developments which will give \nus a more secure and more peaceful world.\n  My own view is that the President's decision not just to visit Moscow \nbut \n [[Page S6596]] to travel on to Kiev was also very important and \nunderscores the policy of the United States of supporting all the newly \nindependent States, not just Russia.\n  Fortunately, we have excellent relations with Ukraine now, and \nbecause of the groundwork that President Clinton and his delegation \nlaid we can expect to see expanded trade, investment, and commercial \nrelations in the future. None of these changes happen overnight, and \nthey will never occur unless a strong and positive foundation is \ncarefully laid. President Clinton's visit laid just such a foundation.\n  In addition, President Clinton and President Kuchma entered into an \nexcellent exchange of views on how the United States and Ukraine can \ncooperate to shape a stable, undivided Europe in the future. As many \nhave reflected on the events in Europe 50 years ago, I believe we all \nknow and understand how critically important this is to world peace and \nto a peaceful future for the United States.\n  I applaud President Clinton for undertaking this trip at this time. \nHe has reached out to the people of Russia and to the people of Ukraine \nat a critical time in the evolution of their political systems, and I \nbelieve through his visits with political leaders from throughout the \nRussian political spectrum and with students at Moscow University spoke \nup clearly, firmly, and loudly for democracy, free elections, and \nreform.\n  Fifty years ago, it would have been unthinkable for an American \nPresident to travel to Moscow, speak to students about democracy, free \nelections, economic and political reform, and have that message \nbroadcast throughout Russia by Russian radio. This unthinkable event \nhappened earlier this week. I am confident that this message was not \nlost on the Russian people, and I hope it will not be lost here, for I \nbelieve this shows concretely how far our relationship has evolved and \nhow much each step we have taken has meant in the long run toward real \nand meaningful change.\n  I believe the steps President Clinton took in Moscow and Kiev will \nresult in more permanent, lasting changes in the future, and I \ncongratulate him for tackling the many difficult and daunting problems \nwhich he took on straightforwardly. Ultimately, I believe the record \nwill reflect that significant progress was achieved in many areas \nbecause of the foundation which President Clinton laid this week.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has turned \nto this critical environmental issue and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation, the Interstate Transportation of Municipal \nSolid Waste Act of 1995. Congress came very close to enacting similar \nlegislation in 1994, and I am hopeful that we will achieve closure on \nthe interstate waste and flow control issues shortly. I commend my \ncolleagues John Chafee, Bob Smith, and Dan Coats for their dedicated \neffort in bringing this bill to the floor at this early date.\n  It is high time that the largest trash exporting States bite the \nbullet and take substantial steps towards self-sufficiency for waste \ndisposal. This legislation would provide much-needed relief to \nPennsylvania, which is by far the largest importer of out-of-State \nwaste in the Nation. According to the Pennsylvania Department of \nEnvironmental Resources, 3.9 million tons of out-of-State municipal \nsolid waste entered Pennsylvania in 1993, and 4.3 million tons of out-\nof-state municipal solid waste entered Pennsylvania during 1994. Most \nof this trash came from other States in the Northeast; in 1994, New \nYork and New Jersey were responsible for 3.8 million of the 4.3 million \ntons imported into Pennsylvania, representing 88 percent of the total. \nNew York alone sent 2.3 million tons of municipal solid waste into \nPennsylvania last year.\n  This legislation would go a long way toward resolving the landfill \nproblems facing Pennsylvania, Indiana, and similar waste importing \nStates. I am personally familiar with the anxiety that the landfill \ncrisis provokes in local communities. On several occasions, I have met \nwith county officials, environmental groups, and residents of \nnortheastern Pennsylvania to discuss the solid waste issue. I came away \nfrom those meetings impressed by the deep concerns expressed by the \narea's residents.\n  Recognizing the recurrent problem of landfill capacity in \nPennsylvania's 67 counties, since 1989 I have pushed to resolve the \ninterstate waste crisis. In 1989 and 1991, I joined my late colleague, \nSenator John Heinz, to introduce the Solid Waste Disposal Act \nAmendments Act, which would have provided incentives for States to \ndevise realistic long-term plans for handling solid waste disposal.\n  I also supported the Interstate Transportation of Municipal Waste Act \nof 1992, which passed the Senate by an 89-2 vote in July, 1992. That \nbill would have allowed a Governor, at the request of a local \ngovernment, to prohibit the disposal of out-of-State municipal waste in \nany landfill or incinerator within its jurisdiction. The House failed \nto take action on that bill, leaving it to this Congress to act on this \nissue.\n  At the beginning of the 103d Congress, I joined Senator Coats in \ntrying to build on our near success the previous year and joined 16 of \nour colleagues to introduce bipartisan interstate waste legislation (S. \n439). That bill, which was introduced on February 25, 1993, was modeled \non the waste legislation which had passed the Senate in July 1992 by an \noverwhelming margin. I was pleased that many of the concepts contained \nin the Coats-Specter bill were relied upon in S. 2345, the bill \nunanimously reported out by the Environment and Public Works Committee \nlast August and again in the bill being considered by the Senate today. \nLast year's bill provided legal authority to every State to restrict \nout-of-State municipal solid waste and was approved in the Senate by \nvoice vote on September 30, 1994. A modified version of that bill, \nwhich included both interstate and flow control provisions, was \nreceived by the Senate on the last day of the 103d Congress, but was \nnot considered on the floor.\n  On March 22, 1995, I joined Senator Coats and other colleagues in \nintroducing S. 589, which parallels the Coats-Specter bill from the \n103d Congress (S. 439). The legislation we are\n considering today builds upon the legislation that passed the Senate \nby voice vote in 1994 and the bills I have worked on with Senator Coats \nin 1993 and 1995. I am confident that S. 534 will empower States to \ndeal with their solid waste more effectively because it would provide \nevery State with significant new authority to restrict imports of out-\nof-State municipal solid waste.\n\n  Some may wonder why there is a need for Federal legislation to \nempower States to restrict cross-border flows of garbage. Simply put, \nPennsylvania and other States that were in the forefront of solid waste \nmanagement have ended up as the dumping ground for States that have \nbeen unwilling to enact and enforce realistic long-term waste \nmanagement plans. Although I am advised that these States are making \nsome progress, some continue to ship increasing amounts of waste to \nPennsylvania landfills.\n  This legislation will lead to significant reductions in the amounts \nof out-of-State waste imported into Pennsylvania and other States. Let \nme explain how this will be accomplished. First, the legislation allows \na Governor to unilaterally freeze out-of-State waste at 1993 levels at \nlandfills and incinerators that received waste in 1993. In addition, an \nimport State ratchet provides that a Governor may restrict waste \nimported from any one State in excess of 1.4 million tons in 1996, down \nto 550,000 tons in 2002 and thereafter. I was pleased that this \nprovision has been carried over from last year's bill and is even more \nrestrictive on out-of-State trash. This provision provides a concrete \nincentive for the largest exporting States to get a handle on their \nsolid waste management immediately.\n  It is important to note that title I of this legislation explicitly \nprotects State contract law and protects host community agreements. It \nalso authorizes restrictions on waste imported from Canada if doing so \nis found by the \n [[Page S6597]] President to be consistent with NAFTA and GATT.\n  Mr. President, I am also pleased to support S. 534 because it \ncontains provisions addressing the issue of waste flow control \nauthority, an issue of vital importance to Pennsylvania's counties.\n  During the 103d Congress, we encountered a new issue with respect to \nmunicipal solid waste--the issue of waste flow control authority. As a \nresult, today we are also considering legislation which would restore \nlocal authority to control the flow of municipal solid waste.\n  On May 16, 1994, the Supreme Court held--6-3--in Carbone versus \nClarkstown that a flow control ordinance, which requires all solid \nwaste to be processed at a designated waste management facility, \nviolates the commerce clause of the United States Constitution. In \nstriking down the Clarkstown ordinance, the Court stated that the \nordinance discriminated against interstate commerce by allowing only \nthe favored operator to process waste that is within the town's limits.\n  As a result of the Court's decision, flow control ordinances in \nPennsylvania and other States are considered unconsitiutional. \nTherefore, it is necessary for Congress to enact legislation providing \nclear authorization for local governments to utilize waste flow \ncontrol.\n  I have met with county commissioners who have made clear that this \nissue is vitally important to the local governments in Pennsylvania. As \nfurther evidence of the need for congressional action, I would note the \nnumerous phone calls and letters my office has received from individual \nPennsylvania counties and municipal solid waste authorities that \nsupport waste flow control legislation. The County Commissioners \nAssociation of Pennsylvania has pointed out that since 1988, flow \ncontrol has been the primary tool used by 65 of the 67 Pennsylvania \ncounties to enforce solid waste plans and meet waste reduction/\nrecycling goals or mandates. Many Pennsylvania jurisdictions have spent \na considerable amount of public funds on disposal facilities, including \nupgraded sanitary landfills, state-of-the-art resources recovery \nfacilities, and co-composting facilities. In the absence of flow \ncontrol authority, many of these worthwhile projects could be \njeopardized. There is also a very real concern that as a result of the \nCarbone decision, prompt congressional action is necessary to ensure \nthat local communities may meet their debt service obligations related \nto the issuance of revenue bonds for the construction of their solid \nwaste management facilities.\n  I believe that this bill will protect the ability of municipalities \nto plan effectively for the management of their municipal solid waste \nwhile also guaranteeing that market forces will still provide \nopportunities for enterprising companies in the waste management \nindustry.\n  In conclusion, this legislation makes sense because in the absence of \nFederal legislation to empower States to restrict cross-border flows of \nwaste, Pennsylvania and other States inevitably become dumping grounds \nfor States that haven't shown the fortitude to enact realistic long-\nterm waste management plans. Further, by restoring flow control \nauthority, this legislation protects Pennsylvania and its component \nlocal jurisdictions, which have promulgated comprehensive solid waste \nmanagement plans and established state-of-the-art facilities to handle \nwaste generated within the Commonwealth.\n  I yield the floor.\n                           amendment no. 869\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, possibly the most important provision of \nthis legislation for my State is in restoring the opportunity for small \ncommunity or county landfills to be exempt from the ground water \nmonitoring requirements of RCRA, if they meet certain conditions.\n  Under the bill a community landfill can be exempt from monitoring if \nit can demonstrate four things: that it takes in no more than 20 tons \nof waste per day, that there is no evidence of ground water \ncontamination, that it is in an area that receives less than 25 inches \nof precipitation, and that it has no practical landfill alternative.\n  The problem we have in Colorado and, I suspect, throughout the West, \nis that we have many landfills that pose zero threat to ground water \nbut they may be taking in more than the bill's limit of 20 tons of \ntrash per day.\n  My amendment does two things: First, it codifies an existing \nregulation under which a landfill operator may file a no-migration \npetition with the State; if the petition is approved, the landfill \noperator becomes exempt from the ground water monitoring requirements.\n  And second, my amendment directs the Administrator to publish within \n6 months an explanatory, or guidance, document by which small towns and \ncounties will be able to easily and directly take advantage of this \nopportunity.\n  Since the implementation of RCRA, about a third of the landfills in \nColorado have closed. Towns and counties have spent millions developing \nnew landfills that comply with the subtitle D requirements, in spite of \nthe fact that in most of Colorado there is practically zero threat of \nleaching dangerous substances from landfills into ground water.\n  Dozens of landfills in Colorado are situated more than 100 feet above \nthe water table; the intervening layers are often composed of shale and \nclay, making it impossible for materials to leach downward. Under the \nexisting subtitle D landfill rules these landfills must be lined with \nan impermeable liner; to then require that these communities spend an \nadditional $15,000 per year or so to test the ground water is an \nextreme form of overkill.\n  Mr. President, the EPA understands that these conditions exist and to \ntheir credit the agency conceived of and adopted this no migration \npetition process. All that my amendment does is to codify this \nopportunity, an opportunity that has already stood the full test of \nrulemaking, and to push EPA to make the program available in our rural \ncounties.\n  Mr. President, I want to particularly thank the distinguished \nchairman, Senator Chafee, and the distinguished ranking member, Senator \nBaucus, for working with me on this important amendment to our western \ncounties.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/12/senate-section/article/S6595-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    COMMENDING FORMER PRESIDENT BUSH\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, I want to congratulate the President for his \nsuccessful summit in Kiev. Under President Kuchma, Ukraine has become a \nmodel for the States of the former Soviet Union. Agreement to disband \nnuclear weapons; free market economic reforms; free and fair elections; \nopen investment climate. President Clinton's visit was a timely show of \nsupport to the deserving people of Ukraine. I expect the Congress to \nshow our support for Ukraine's political success.\n  There has been a lot said in the media about reaction to the Moscow \nsummit. I have expressed my disappointment at the results of the Moscow \nsummit. As I said yesterday, this is not partisan politics--it is a \njudgment based on the facts. I note that today's New York Times carries \na headline, ``Iran relieved on Yeltsin deal.'' If Iran is relieved at \nthe results of the summit, all of us have cause for concern. Secretary \nChristopher, in particular, has led the administration's efforts to \nprevent nuclear technology from reaching Iran. I hope to work with him \nover the coming months in support of that important goal.\n  The reality is, however, that there was great controversy over \nPresident Clinton's decision to attend V-E Day ceremonies in Moscow and \nnot in other capitals. The President made his decision, and the \nPresident decided to add to the V-E Day ceremonies with a substantive \nsummit. Now, in the aftermath of the summit, Judgments are being made \nabout what was achieved. I happen to share the view of Henry Kissinger, \nthat a tremendous opportunity was missed on this overseas trip. I also \nagree with Dr. Kissinger that ``NATO expansion requires a decision, not \na study.'' As he points out, the current drift in United States policy \ncould leave us with the worst of all worlds--the disintegration of \nWestern unity with a still-anxious Russia.\n  In the past few days, other distinguished writers have expressed \ntheir views on what was achieved at the Moscow summit, particularly by \nBill Safire and Charles Krauthammer. These articles deserve careful \nreading by my colleagues as we continue our assessment of the Moscow \nsummit.\n  I ask unanimous consent the articles by Safire, Krauthammer, and the \narticle by former Secretary Kissinger be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                [From the New York Times, May 11, 1995]\n\n                            Nadir of Summits\n\n                          (By William Safire)\n\n       Washington.--Bill Clinton represented American interests \n     poorly in Moscow.\n       On the sale of Russian nuclear plants to Iran, he was taken \n     in by--or participated in--a trick.\n       One month ago, to create a ``concession'' to the naive \n     American President, Boris Yeltsin's atomic energy chief upped \n     the ante, letting C.I.A. ears hear him consider adding \n     centrifuges to the deal with Teheran. That outrageous act \n     would be like selling mullahs the means to make a bomb right \n     away, instead of in a few years with nuclear plants alone.\n       It was a ploy. While brushing aside a Clinton plea to \n     withhold nuclear facilities from Iran, Mr. Yeltsin grandly \n     agreed not to add the centrifuges. Clinton said he was \n     ``deeply impressed'' by this marvelous restraint, then failed \n     to make a strong case against the plants on TV; Warren \n     Christopher spun the centrifuge ploy as ``great progress.''\n       Score a second victory for Yeltsin's generals on the 1990 \n     Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty. This was the agreement \n     to limit Russian troops, tanks and artillery near the West \n     from Norway to Turkey.\n       But the heroes of Chechnya want to put a new 58th Russian \n     Army in the Caucasus to dominate its freed republics, much as \n     Russia now runs Georgia, Moldova and Belarus. This would \n     menace Turkey as well, but apparently nobody told Tansu \n     Ciller during her recent visit to the White House that Mr. \n     Clinton would say ``We are supporting the Russian position'' \n     in blithely changing a treaty ratified by the U.S. Senate.\n       The third defeat suffered by our absorbent President in \n     this nadir of summits was about Chechnya. With the American \n     next to him, Yeltsin brazenly told the world press ``there is \n     no armed activity'' in that bloodied republic. ``The armed \n     forces are not involved there. Today the Ministry of the \n     Interior simply seizes the weapons still in the hands of some \n     small armed criminal gangs.''\n       As he was mouthing this baldfaced lie, the Russian Army was \n     intensifying its shelling of rebel positions southeast of \n     Grozny, following its Mylai-style massacre of unarmed \n     civilians in Samashki one month ago. The Clinton response was \n     to shut up. In his long, prepared speech later, he devoted \n     two quick sentences to ``this terrible tragedy'' that could \n     ``erode support for Russia.''\n       Americans could well feel humiliated by their President's \n     acquiescence in the lying in his presence,\n      and by his failure to respond to that personal insult by \n     broadcasting the truth. Many Russians were hoping he would \n     express the dismay felt by the rest of the world at the \n     brutality of the generals supporting the unpopular \n     Yeltsin. But he hardly went through the motions.\n       Watching on TV in his Duma office, reformer Grigory \n     Yavlinsky said ``not enough'' when Clinton touched ever-so-\n     lightly on the continuing Chechnyan slaughter. And when \n     Clinton praised Yeltsin for promising elections on time, as \n     if that were proof of his democratic spirit. Yavlinsky said: \n     ``But we always had elections on time. The question is what \n     kind of elections--how open, how fair, how financed, how \n     counted, how supervised.''\n       We do not yet know if Mr. Clinton gave away our right to \n     deploy regional defenses against ballistic missiles; if so, \n     that would score this summit Yelsin 4, Clinton 0. And the \n     individual meetings we hoped he would have with opposition \n     leaders degenerated into a breakfast group photo-op.\n       The White House spinmeisters will say: but we got Yeltsin \n     to join the Partnership for Peace, didn't we?\n       C'mon: the PfP will go pfft at noon on Jan. 20, 1997. If \n     the paper ``partnership'' is a fig leaf to cover the \n     necessary eastward expansion of NATO, it fools nobody; but if \n     Yeltsin's plucking of the fig leaf means Russia expects to be \n     invited to join NATO, there goes the neighborhood--NATO would \n     lose all meaning as a deterrent to future Russian empire-\n     rebuilding.\n       [[Page S6599]] Summits do not always yield mutual \n     concessions; conflicting political interests are rarely \n     ameliorated by displays of cordiality. But a sign of an \n     American President's seriousness and maturity in the conduct \n     of foreign policy is the willingness to admit intractability. \n     We saw that so clearly in Reagan's cold expression saying \n     goodbye to Gorbachev in Iceland.\n       Bill Clinton and his anxious aides are pretending this \n     summit was a success when they know it was a flop. They would \n     gain more respect by reporting reality.\n                [From the Washington Post, May 12, 1995]\n\n                        The Pushover Presidency\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       We will not be satisfied by anything other than the end of \n     the [Russia-Iran] nuclear program.--Secretary of State Warren \n     Christopher, May 4.\n       And what, pray tell, is the penalty for denying \n     satisfaction to this American secretary of state?\n       Christopher and his boss have said a dozen times how \n     important it is to the United States that Russia cancel its \n     deal to sell nuclear technology to Iran. This is an issue on \n     which the president has promised ``to be quite aggressive.'' \n     Evidently, he considers pleading and cajoling forms of \n     aggression. After weeks of both--and after rewarding the \n     Russians by celebrating V-E Day in Moscow--Clinton returns \n     home empty-handed. The Russians offered him a couple \n     laughable fig leaves (such as canceling a gas centrifuge sale \n     to Iran, the chief purpose of which was to give them \n     something to cancel), but never budged on the nuclear reactor \n     deal.\n       It is bad enough to have no clout in foreign policy. Why \n     make a point of advertising it?\n       The Russians have not just rejected American entreaties. \n     They have been contemptuous of them. On Feb. 6, for example, \n     a Russian foreign ministry official charged that ``Washington \n     is more concerned with removing its competitors than about \n     protecting international security''--not just rejecting the \n     U.S. position on Iran but implying that our motives are \n     entirely fraudulent as well.\n       The Japanese, as is their wont, have been more polite but \n     no less determined in brushing off the United States. On \n     Tuesday, having cut off our own trade with Iran, we asked \n     Japan to follow suit. The timing was curious: Asking the \n     Japanese to follow our lead at some economic sacrifice just \n     as we are declaring a trade war on them. The response was \n     predictable: The foreign ministry spokesman said Japan would \n     study the U.S. policy taking into consideration its own \n     ``policy of securing a stable supply of petroleum.'' \n     Translation: fat chance.\n       What did we expect? It is bad enough to have an ineffectual \n     foreign policy. It is worse to highlight that ineffectiveness \n     by inviting repeated public rebuff. Our Iranian diplomacy is \n     only the latest example. The tone was set with Christopher's \n     first trip to Europe in 1993, when he presented his ideas on \n     Bosnia as if he were at some Aspen conference. He insisted on \n     nothing and got nothing. The allies can tell when Big Brother \n     is serious and when he is not. They pointedly went their own \n     way.\n       A year later he traveled to China waving a human rights \n     agenda. He was treated scandalously. Dissidents were arrested \n     while he was in Beijing, just to rub it in. Two months later, \n     Clinton lifted the threat of sanctions against China. The \n     point was made for all to see: There is no penalty for \n     stiffing this administration.\n       Yet another demonstration of administration weakness was \n     offered this year by North Korea. Abjectly capitulating to \n     North Korean war threats, Clinton went from declaring that \n     North Korea would not be allowed to acquire any nuclear \n     weapons to heralding an agreement under which North Korea \n     might begin to dismantle its facilities for building more \n     bombs a decade from now--and is rewarded by the United States \n     with a nine-year supply of free oil, two free $2 billion \n     nuclear reactors (the same type, incidentally, that the \n     Russians are selling Tehran) and the opening of trade and \n     diplomatic relations.\n       Meanwhile, North Korea's bomb-building machinery is Scotch-\n     taped shut. It threatens weekly to remove the tape and \n     restart the program if we do not jump through yet more \n     diplomatic hoops. We jump.\n       Has there ever been a president who commanded less respect \n     abroad, less fear, less compliance than Bill Clinton? Jimmy \n     Carter, maybe. But, to be fair, he was leading a country in \n     full psychological retreat from Vietnam. He was holding no \n     cards.\n       Clinton, on the other hand, leads the sole remaining \n     superpower, fresh from victory in the Cold War, unchallenged \n     by any Great Power for the first time in 50 years, in command \n     of the world's dominant military force--and finds himself \n     unable to be taken seriously by even the most minor world \n     actors.\n       Why? Partly, presidential inattention to and lack of \n     interest in foreign affairs. Partly, Warren Christopher's \n     natural inclination to find consensus rather than assert \n     interests. His repeated trips to Syria, for example, begging \n     a terrorist state (by the State Department's own definition) \n     to accept the most generous territorial concessions it has \n     ever been offered, are an embarrassment. But for a secretary \n     of state who sees his job as splitting differences rather \n     than knocking heads, it seems perfectly natural.\n       The most important source of American diplomatic weakness, \n     however, is a president who so discounts the domestic \n     political impact of foreign policy that he will expend no \n     political capital--risk no popularity--on behalf of any of \n     his solemnly declared foreign policy goals. None on Bosnia. \n     None (at least intentionally) on Somalia. None on North \n     Korea. None on China. None on NATO expansion. None on Russia.\n       The only issue on which the president has shown himself \n     muscular is international economics: negotiating free trade \n     agreements, opening markets, winning foreign contracts. Not \n     since Calvin Coolidge have we had a president who so firmly \n     believes that the business of America--at least in foreign \n     policy--is business. Take away a narrow economic interest in \n     foreign affairs, and you have a president who would rather be \n     golfing.\n                [From the Washington Post, May 12, 1995]\n\n                  For U.S. Leadership, a Moment Missed\n\n                          (By Henry Kissinger)\n\n       President Clinton's attendance at the V-E Day celebration \n     in Moscow aroused ambivalent emotions. No doubt Soviet \n     sacrifices contributed decisively to victory over the Nazi \n     dictatorship. But it is also true that the Nazi-Soviet Pact \n     had made the war possible; that Stalin had divided Eastern \n     Europe with Hitler; that he then supplied the Nazi war \n     machine until the Soviet Union was attacked; and that upon \n     victory, he occupied Eastern Europe, launching four decades \n     of Cold War.\n       The Yeltsin-Clinton summit, moreover, took place at a \n     moment of extraordinary uncertainty in U.S.-Russian \n     relations. There are disagreements over Chechnya, nuclear \n     sales to Iran and NATO expansion--all issues deserving high-\n     level attention. The question remains whether V-E Day \n     celebrations, with the presence of so many other heads of \n     state, was the most auspicious occasion for addressing these \n     controversies. Even more fundamentally, the visit to Moscow \n     reveals the lack of balance in the priorities of the \n     administration's foreign policy.\n       If any European city deserved to be singled out by America \n     for an Allied remembrance, it was London. Capital of the \n     nation that steadfastly resisted Nazi aggression from the \n     beginning, it became America's most reliable ally, both in \n     the war and in the Cold War that followed. No better occasion \n     is likely to arise to celebrate Great Britain's unique \n     contribution to the cause of freedom or to express America's \n     appreciation for two generations of steadfast cooperation.\n       That the moment was not seized--even as a stop on the way \n     to Moscow--was no mere oversight. One of the curious \n     attributes of the leaders who grew up during the Vietnam \n     protest movements is that their obsession with transcending \n     the categories of the Cold War imprisons them in the debates \n     of the Cold War period. One of their articles of faith seems \n     to be that the Communist (or Soviet) menace was overdrawn, \n     indeed that the Cold War cold have been most effectively \n     ended--if it need ever have been waged--by reassuring Russia \n     rather than confronting it.\n       In that spirit, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, \n     the principal architect of Washington's European policy, \n     argued in Time magazine as late as 1990 that the doves had \n     never been the threat it had been cracked up to be. Western \n     policy had been at best irrelevant when it had not actually \n     delayed the Soviet collapse. Thus Cold War attitudes and \n     institutions, including the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization, needed to change their character.\n       This indeed has been the rationale behind the \n     administration's Partnership for Peace proposal, which, \n     whatever the rhetoric to the contrary, transforms NATO from \n     an alliance into an instrument of collective security akin to \n     the United Nations, thereby depriving North Atlantic \n     relations of their special character.\n       While these attitudes are not uniformly held throughout the \n     administration, they are sufficiently powerful to explain the \n     solicitude shown to Yeltsin's personality and Moscow's \n     sensitivities compared with the tone deafness exhibited \n     toward West European--and especially British--concerns. \n     Washington-Moscow relations are treated as the keystone of \n     America's European, if not global, policy.\n       A good illustration is the administration's attitude toward \n     NATO expansion. Senior officials have claimed that the issue \n     is when to expand NATO, not whether to. They have also \n     indicated that they would go along with Yeltsin's request \n     that NATO expansion proceed slowly and that Russia's eventual \n     membership in NATO not be foreclosed.\n       Briefings prior to Clinton's Moscow trip put the ``when'' \n     at five years and left open the possibility of a ``reformed'' \n     Russia joining the alliance. The long hiatus guarantees that \n     the issue of NATO expansion will continue to fester, while \n     Moscow will be encouraged to pressure the NATO allies and the \n     nations of Eastern Europe. At the same time, there is not one \n     of Russia's western neighbors seeking to join NATO that would \n     not regard offering Russia membership as the wolf's being \n     asked to guard the lambs.\n       So long as the cohesion of the Atlantic Alliance is not \n     given anything like the priority the administration attaches \n     to placating Moscow, Russia will find ways to avoid the key \n     challenge presented to it by the collapse of its empire: \n     whether it can be satisfied to live as a normal state within \n     non-imperial borders--even though it comprises 11 time zones \n     and huge resources. A country of such size and possessing \n     some 20,000 nuclear weapons should not need additional \n     territory to feel secure. A Russia that abandons imperial \n      [[Page S6600]] pretensions would soon deflect concerns from \n     the field of security to political and economic cooperation, \n     for example the European security conference or the G-7.\n       From this point of view, how much better it would have been \n     for Clinton to stop in London--even on the way to Moscow--and \n     use the occasion of its V-E Day celebration to outline a new \n     vision of the North Atlantic relationship, something his \n     administration has so far refused to do.\n       A new initiative is needed above all to restore a sense of \n     direction to American foreign policy. It has become axiomatic \n     that the next phase of international relations will be shaped \n     by a limited number of power centers: the United States, \n     Europe, Russia, Japan, China and possibly India and Brazil. \n     Theoretically it is possible for the United States to conduct \n     its policy purely on the basis of national interest, not \n     unlike what Great Britain in the 19th century termed the \n     policy of ``splendid isolation.'' This would require a \n     careful assessment of rewards and penalties for each region \n     of the world and a balancing of them to produce actions most \n     compatible with America's national interest. In the abstract, \n     such a policy should be tenable because, on the face of it, \n     all the major actors enumerated above have greater conflicts \n     with each other than with the United States.\n       But in fact the United States lacks a tradition of a \n     foreign policy based entirely on the national interest. There \n     is little bureaucratic skill in so cold-bloodedly \n     equilibrating rewards and penalties on a global basis. A \n     country founded by peoples who had turned their backs on \n     inherited tradition and who believed in the universal \n     application of the values of their society cannot simply \n     abandon the Wilsonianism that has dominated 20th-century \n     American foreign policy.\n       Though I believe the time has come for America to develop a \n     concept of the national interest and apply it in a balance-\n     of-power context, this will work only if we reduce the \n     regions for this kind of foreign policy as much as possible \n     and extend the areas where a more cooperative--even \n     Wilsonian--approach is feasible.\n       Russia is as yet too inchoate and unformed to function as \n     the anchor of American foreign policy. The two regions where \n     moral consensus can undergird cooperative relationship are \n     the Western Hemisphere and the North Atlantic or\n      area. In both, the key countries have, to all practical \n     purposes, forsworn the use of force in their relations \n     with each other. In each, institutions already exist \n     capable of serving as building blocks of a cooperative \n     world order: NAFTA and Mercosur in the Western Hemisphere, \n     NATO and the European Union in the Atlantic region. But \n     while the Clinton administration has put forward an \n     imaginative vision for the Western Hemisphere, it has \n     failed to do so for the North Atlantic area, in part \n     because of the intellectual legacy described earlier.\n       Unless America assumes a real leadership role, the nations \n     bordering the North Atlantic will gradually drift apart. \n     America will become increasingly marginalized; the two sides \n     of the Atlantic will grow more conscious of their rivalries \n     than of their common purposes.\n       I strongly favor NATO expansion. The current policy of \n     carrying water on both shoulders, of hinting at expansion to \n     Western and Central Europe while trying to placate Russia \n     with prospects of a protracted delay--of which the Moscow \n     summit is a prime example--is likely to accelerate the \n     disintegration of Western unity without reassuring Russia. \n     NATO expansion requires a decision, not a study.\n       Nevertheless, by itself it will not create a new sense of \n     Atlantic community. Security can no longer be the principal \n     unifying bond of the Atlantic nations because, fortunately, \n     there no longer exists a unifying threat. Common purposes, \n     not common fears, must provide the cohesion in the new era in \n     which economic and social issues are becoming dominant.\n       The time has come to put into effect a North Atlantic Free \n     Trade Area for manufactured goods and services, with \n     negotiations regarding agriculture to follow. Such a grouping \n     would accelerate the movement toward the principle of free \n     trade to which the members of the World Trade Organization \n     have committed themselves. In the meantime, it would foster \n     cooperation among the nations of the North Atlantic. In a \n     world with massive growth in Asia, with ethnic conflicts and \n     religious fundamentalism, the Western democracies cannot \n     afford their historical proclivities to national or regional \n     rivalries.\n       The conditions are propitious. Labor standards and wage \n     scales on the two sides of the Atlantic and environmental \n     concerns are comparable. Prime Minister John Major of Great \n     Britain and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel of Germany have \n     expressed their interest in such a project. A major American \n     initiative would be received as was Gen. George Marshall's \n     speech for European recovery and would almost surely produce \n     a creative response.\n       In time, NAFTA and the North Atlantic Free Trade Area could \n     be merged, and new consultative machinery in the political \n     and social fields could emerge between the Western Hemisphere \n     and the European Union. As Russia's economy develops and its \n     policy becomes more national, associate membership for it in \n     such a free trade area would be a distinct possibility--much \n     more so than in NATO.\n       America should return as quickly as possible to what it has \n     traditionally done best: to put forward its vision for how \n     the nations of the North Atlantic can create a new world \n     worthy of their democratic principles.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/12/senate-section/article/S6598-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         HONORING FREEWAY WATCH\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the exemplary service \nthe Freeway Watch Program provides to my home State in preventing \nfreeway tragedy, promoting public safety, and enhancing law enforcement \nefficiency.\n  Freeway Watch enhances highway safety by helping the Utah Highway \nPatrol and other law enforcement agencies identify and remove impaired \ndrivers from Utah's highways. This program trains private citizens who \nhave cellular telephones on how to identify possible drunk or drugged \ndrivers and how to report these drivers to law enforcement agencies. In \nthe 3 months that troopers have been giving classes, more than 1,400 \nUtahns have been trained in this program.\n  This program was organized after the tragic death of a Utah teenager. \nHighland High School student Sean Adkins was helping his friend change \na flat tire in the emergency lane of a Salt Lake Interstate on March 1, \n1994, when a man with nine prior DUI convictions hit and killed Sean.\n  The friends who were with Sean that night asked the investigating \ntrooper, Jeff Peterson, what they could do to help combat drunken \ndrivers. Jeff later discussed this conversation with his wife Suzanne. \nWanting passionately to make a difference in the war against drunken \ndrivers, Suzanne Peterson teamed up with her friend, Dr. Carol Clark \nwho is executive director of the Utah Science Center Authority, to \nimplement Freeway Watch.\n  Freeway Watch has brought together many aspects of the business \ncommunity, law enforcement agencies, and citizen organizations to \npromote public safety and help law enforcement function more \nefficiently at no additional taxpayer expense. KSL Radio and \nTelevision, US West Cellular, the Utah Highway Patrol, Middlekauff \nLincoln Mercury, Les Olson & Co., the Alcohol Policy Coalition, and the \nSalt Lake County Chapter of MADD have all helped sponsor this program \nand make it a success.\n  Mr. President, I bring this program to your attention because I \nbelieve that this is an excellent example of the private and public \nsector working together for the good of our community. It has always \nbeen my sincere belief that when a community bonds together, and works \nfor the welfare of all, great things will be accomplished. Many local \ncitizens have demonstrated hard work, initiative, and true community \nservice, and I want to publicly recognize them and sincerely thank them \nfor their exemplary efforts to make the roads in the great State of \nUtah a safer place for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/12/senate-section/article/S6600-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Angalena Rhue on \nwinning the 1995 President's Service Award, the Nation's highest honor \nfor volunteers. President Clinton presented Ms. Rhue this outstanding \naward on April 27 for her unselfish commitment to helping hundreds of \nCharleston area kids stay off drugs.\n  Angalena Rhue is special in her pursuit because she knows what drug \naddictions can do to a person. Just 6 years ago, this same woman was a \ncrack cocaine addict. Now, not only has she conquered her addiction, \nbut she has developed a program, ITEC--Infiltrate the Enemy Camp, to \nensure that today's youth don't fall prey to the same mistakes.\n  Angalena is quite a self-starter. What began as a small project in \nher own community in Summerville has now expanded into three counties \nto serve low-income children ages 4 through 19. \n [[Page S6601]] The program builds self-esteem and stresses the \nimportance of staying in school and staying off drugs. ITEC offers \nafterschool tutoring to children, assistance in job searches, and \nrequires parents to attend sessions to learn positive reinforcement \ntechniques.\n  Mr. President, I hear a lot of talk about what we, as citizens of the \nUnited States, can do to have a positive impact on the next generation, \nthe children of today. I offer Angalena Rhue as a shining example. She \nhas taken what could have been a negative experience, her drug \naddiction, and turned it into something positive for the children of \nSouth Carolina. She will have an immeasurable impact on our society. \nThrough her efforts more children will turn away from drugs and \ncontinue their education.\n  It gives me great pleasure to join the President of the United States \nin recognizing a fellow South Carolinian for being 1 of 18 volunteers \nawarded this prestigious honor for truly making a difference in this \ncountry.\n  Recently, the State in South Carolina's capital city, Columbia, \nrecognized Angalena Rhue for her award. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the State, Friday, Apr. 28, 1995]\n\n         Clinton Awards South Carolina Woman for Volunteer Work\n\n                           (By Charles Pope)\n\n       Washington.--Six years ago, Angalena Rhue of Summerville \n     was addicted to crack cocaine, caught in a spiral that was \n     dragging her downward.\n       Thursday, the 38-year-old Rhue was at the White House, \n     receiving an award from President Clinton for not only \n     turning her own life around, but the lives of hundreds of \n     low-income kids in the Charleston area.\n       Rhue was one of 18 Americans to be awarded the President's \n     Service Award, the nation's highest honor for those who \n     ``engage in voluntary community service addressing unmet \n     human needs.''\n       Rhue was selected from 3,000 nominees for founding ITEC--\n     Infiltrate the Enemy Camp. ITEC provides tutoring and \n     assistance to children and parents living in low-income \n     housing projects. What began as a small effort in the Haven \n     Oaks apartments in Summerville after Rhue kicked drugs, has \n     now expanded to four locations in three counties, serving \n     more than 400 children from age 4 through 19.\n       ``It's exciting, it's overwhelming. I thought I was going \n     to faint,'' said an effervescent Rhue after receiving her \n     silver medallion in a sunsplashed Rose Garden ceremony.\n       ``When we first see these kids, there's a sense of \n     helplessness, and apathy. But now these kids are soaring and \n     there's no holding them back.''\n       In the hourlong ceremony, Clinton praised the volunteers \n     whose work becomes even more important in a time of national \n     crisis.\n       ``Just over a week ago we were reminded that there are \n     those who want to see our nation torn apart,'' Clinton said. \n     ``But amid the grief and the destruction we have also seen \n     how quickly the overwhelming majority of Americans come \n     together to help each other to rebuild and to make this \n     country stronger.\n       ``Today we'll hear stories of ordinary Americans doing \n     extraordinary things.\n       ``They repair our parks and keep our young people out of \n     gangs. They come from all corners of the nation. They are \n     diverse in age and background. Yet they are united by \n     something larger than all of us--the simple desire to fulfill \n     the promise of American life,'' the President said before \n     awarding the 18 medals.\n       Rhue's home-grown program is based on restoring self-esteem \n     to children who have few role models and little parental \n     guidance. Her programs require the children to read each day, \n     help them with their homework, provide help finding jobs and \n     reinforce the need to stay in school and avoid drugs.\n       ``I want to save the whole would from drugs,'' said Rhue, \n     whose job is made easier by her natural affinity to children, \n     her endless energy and her personal experiences.\n       Rhue also requires parents to attend at least four sessions \n     a year so they can learn how to reinforce the gains their \n     children are making. She also combats verbal abuse that \n     parents direct to their children and instructs parents how to \n     work with teachers so that children get the most out of \n     school.\n       Rhue's crusade started when she realized she could help and \n     when children started showing up at her doorstep. The manager \n     of her apartment complex soon offered the club house and \n     before the first year ended, 37 kids were coming each day.\n       Relying on her own instincts, a talent for attracting \n     donations, volunteers and help from such quarters as Clemson \n     Extension Service and the College of Charleston, her programs \n     have spread to low-income housing projects in North \n     Charleston, the City of Charleston and Moncks Corner. Those \n     four centers serve more than 400 children. Officials in \n     Orangeburg, Columbia and other municipalities in South \n     Carolina have asked her about the program.\n       And on Thursday, Hillary Clinton told Rhue she would like \n     to come see the program in person.\n       When Rhue awakes today, she will be able to celebrate her \n     presidential award, and more importantly, an anniversary, Six \n     years ago today, she weaned herself from cocaine.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/12/senate-section/article/S6600-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   REPORT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA'S 1995 SUPPLEMENTAL BUDGET AND \n    RESCISSIONS OF AUTHORITY REQUEST ACT OF 1995--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 48\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with section 446 of the District of Columbia Self-\nGovernment and Governmental Reorganization Act, I am transmitting the \nDistrict of Columbia's 1995 Supplemental Budget and Rescissions of \nAuthority Request Act of 1995.

A bill to amend the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to exclude \ncertain bank products from the definition of a deposit; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n      the bank insurance fund and depositor protection act of 1995\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Bank \nInsurance \n [[Page S6602]] Fund and Depositor Protection Act of 1995 with my \ndistinguished colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd. This bill, \nwhich is substantially similar to S. 2548, the bill that Senator Dodd \nand I introduced last October, makes an essential change to the \ndefinition of a ``deposit'' contained in the Federal Deposit Insurance \nAct. Companion legislation was introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives last Wednesday. The House bill, H.R. 1574, was \nintroduced by Representative Roukema and received bipartisan \ncosponsorship from Representatives McCollum, Vento, and Kanjorski.\n  This amendment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act is necessary to \naddress a recent development in the banking industry--the so-called \nretirement CD. This product, which is essentially a deferred annuity, \nis offered and underwritten by banks. Senator Dodd and I, along with \nseveral other Banking Committee members, raised a number of concerns \nabout the retirement CD in a letter to the FDIC and the Comptroller of \nthe Currency last year. Nevertheless, the Comptroller of the Currency \nand the FDIC have permitted the offering of this investment vehicle, \nwith FDIC insurance protection. In light of this, Congress must act to \nclarify the law.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about banks, with little or no annuity \nunderwriting experience, guided simply by computer software, assuming \nthe underwriting risk that is attendant to this insured hybrid \ninvestment vehicle. This is not an empty concern--at least three \nfederally insured banks have taken advantage of this breach in the \nregulatory scheme and are offering this investment vehicle. Allegedly, \na number of other federally insured banks are getting ready to do so. \nAnd what will happen if these institutions cannot properly manage the \nunderwriting risk? If any of these banks mismanage this risk and fail, \nthe only guaranteed insurer will be the FDIC insurance fund, and \nultimately, perhaps, the American taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, the IRS recently issued a proposed regulation \npertaining to the retirement CD's tax-deferred status. Nevertheless, \nbanks may still offer this product, and the integrity of the bank \ninsurance fund must be protected. The fund must not be used as a safety \nnet for untested and uncertain investment vehicles. And that's exactly \nthe risk that this legislation will protect against. This bill \nprecludes the extension of FDIC insurance protection to this bank-\nunderwritten investment vehicle. Nothing more and nothing less. I have \ncarefully considered the arguments offered in support of this product \nand I remain extremely concerned about the threat this product could \npose to the bank insurance fund.\n  Mr. President, this bill will protect the bank insurance fund against \npotential losses that are attributable to any retirement CD that has \nbeen underwritten by any bank since last October. This bill retains the \neffective date employed last Congress in S. 2548--October 6, 1994. This \neffective date is justified, since both industry and the regulators \nwere put on notice of congressional concerns well before that time. \nFurther, this effective date has been retained in fairness to those \ninstitutions that deferred to congressional concerns and did not pursue \nthe marketing of this investment product.\n  Mr. President, this bill was drafted with the intention of avoiding \nany undesired effects on standard deposit products that banks commonly \noffer today. For instance, qualified plans and individual retirement \naccounts are not intended to be covered by this legislation, to the \nextent that they do not generate depository institution liabilities \nthat constitute annuity contracts. This is the case even if the \ndepository institution liability has tax-deferred status under section \n72 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  Mr. President, this bill is being introduced in order to provide \nfurther congressional guidance as to the appropriate scope and \noperation of Federal banking law and the proper use of Federal deposit \ninsurance. This bill makes sense in terms of bank insurance fund \nprotection, safe-and-sound banking practices, and ultimately, taxpayer \nprotection. The bank insurance fund exists to protect the ordinary \ndepositor--it should not be used to give bank-offered financial \nproducts a competitive marketing edge. Competitive innovations should \nalways be welcomed, but not the misuse of Federal deposit insurance. I \nhope my colleagues will support this legislation.\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my good \nfriend, Senator D'Amato to reintroduce important legislation we \nsponsored last year, the Bank Insurance Fund and Depositor Protection \nAct of 1995.\n  This short and simple piece of legislation would prohibit Federal \ndeposit insurance coverage for the so-called retirement CD--a financial \nproduct that emerged a little over a year ago from a small corner of \nthe retail banking world. This first of its kind product was cleverly \nconstructed to receive both the benefits of Federal deposit insurance \nand tax deferral.\n  Mr. President, as it is currently structured, the retirement should \nnot be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The \nretirement CD raises significant policy issues related to consumer \nprotection, safety and soundness, regulatory control, and competitive \nequity. I believe that if we continue to allow it to proliferate as it \nis currently structured, the retirement CD could have a tremendously \nnegative impact on consumer confidence in our financial institutions \nand on the stability of our deposit insurance system.\n  The policy rationale for eliminating Federal deposit insurance for \nthis product is just as compelling as it was when we last introduced \nthis legislation. There are now a handful of financial institutions \nactively offering the retirement CD. More are planning to start selling \nthe product in the near future.\n  I understand that in addition to the Blackfeet National Bank, which \nfirst offered the retirement CD, the First National Bank of Sante Fe, \nNM, and the National Bank of the Commonwealth in Pennsylvania are other \ninsured depository institutions offering the retirement CD. Other \ninstitutions have signed licensing agreements to sell the retirement CD \nor are carefully considering offering it soon.\n  One year ago, the banking regulators sanctioned the sale of the \nretirement CD. In separate letters dated May 12, 1994, the Office of \nthe Comptroller of the Currency [OCC] and the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation [FDIC], stated they had no objection to the sale of the CD \nby Blackfeet National Bank in Browning, MT.\n  However, on April 6, 1995, the Internal Revenue Service issued a \nproposed regulation which effectively eliminates the tax deferral \nfeature of the retirement CD. If this proposed rule becomes final, it \nwill substantially eliminate the most attractive feature of the \nretirement CD, leaving it essentially with only the characteristics of \na regular certificate of deposit. While I applaud the IRS action, their \nrule is not yet final, and the product may still be sold--although I \nwould hope only with full disclosure to consumers of the pending IRS \nrule.\n  Most of my concerns about the retirement CD are described in detail \nin a June 20, 1994 letter that I and several of my Banking Committee \ncolleagues sent to the OCC and the FDIC.\n  I will not reiterate all the concerns described in that letter, but \nwill briefly mention a couple of the more troubling issues that arise \nin connection with the retirement CD.\n  First, there is enormous potential for customer confusion about the \nretirement CD's terms and conditions. This product is not a plain \nvanilla certificate of deposit. It is not a simple annuity. It is a \ncomplex newfangled hybrid that has both CD and annuity features.\n  The retirement CD pays a fixed rate of interest up to 5 years, after \nwhich the rate is adjusted at the sole discretion of the bank. This \nrate is never supposed to fall below 3 percent. Interest ceases to be \nposted upon maturity. The customer may withdraw up to two-thirds of the \nbalance at maturity, and the remainder will be disbursed in fixed \nperiodic payments for life, incorporating the imputed interest rate.\n  Consumers must understand that the interest rate is set at the sole \ndiscretion of the bank. While there is a 3-percent floor during the \nperiod when interest accrues, there is no similar threshold during the \npayout phase. This raises the prospect that a customer may not know \nwhat the imputed rate is tied to, and that the bank could offer a fixed \npayout at an extremely unfavorable rate.\n\n[[Page S6603]]\n\n  Second, a consumer must understand that this retirement CD, unlike \ntraditional certificates of deposit, contains a component that is not \nFDIC insured. FDIC insurance only applies to the balance that is not \nwithdrawn at maturity, less the full dollar amount of any payments \nreceived. If a bank that issues a retirement CD fails at a point when \nthe customer had already received the full value of the account through \nlump-sum distribution and monthly payments, the FDIC would neither \ninsure nor continue to pay the monthly payments for the rest of the \ncustomer's life. This is the case despite the fact that the promotional \nmaterial claims to guarantee payments for life.\n  Mr. President, at the time they approved the sale of the retirement \nCD, the regulators expressed many of the concerns I have about the \nlikelihood of customer confusion, the existence of misleading marketing \ninformation, and the impact of this product on bank safety and \nsoundness. They outlined these concerns in their respective no \nobjection letters I referred to earlier. However, the regulators chose \nnot to prevent Blackfeet from going forward with the issuance of the \nretirement CD, as long as the bank complied with a lengthy list of \nconditions.\n  Mr. President, I think this was ill-advised. There continues to be \nstrong evidence of substantial customer confusion regarding the \ninsurance status of non-deposit investment products like mutual funds \nand annuity products being sold by banks and other insured depository \ninstitutions. These products are much less complex than the retirement \nCD. The regulators themselves have helped to collect compelling \nevidence about the ongoing problem of customer confusion. At a time \nwhen we are wrestling with how to eliminate this problem, I find it \ndifficult to understand why the regulators gave their stamp of approval \nto the sale of this new complex product which can only make a bad \nsituation worse.\n  Mr. President, for this and many other reasons, the retirement CD as \nit's currently structured should not be offered by banks to the public. \nThe legislation we are introducing today will exclude the retirement CD \nfrom the definition of a deposit under the Federal Deposit Insurance \nAct. The Retirement CD will therefore not be covered by Federal deposit \ninsurance.\n  The legislation does not prohibit banks from offering the retirement \nCD. It simply denies the product deposit status under the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Act.\n  The legislation is not intended to eliminate existing levels of \ndeposit insurance coverage to deposit accounts established in \nconnection with certain individual retirement accounts, Keogh plans, \neligible deferred compensation plans, pension plans or similar employee \nbenefit plans which may be maintained at an insured depository \ninstitution. This legislation eliminates Federal deposit insurance \ncoverage for products which expose the issuing insured depository \ninstitution, and ultimately the deposit insurance funds, to liabilities \nthat are annuity contracts and are tax deferred under section 72 of the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986.\n  The provisions of this act do not apply to any liability which is not \nan annuity contract, whether or not tax deferred under section 72 of \nthe Internal Revenue Code. For example, a liability other than an \nannuity contract which is part of an individual retirement account \nwould not be affected by the provisions of this act even though the tax \nliability is deferred under section 72 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 because section 408(D) of the code incorporates section 72 only by \nreference.\n  Mr. President, the retirement CD may be cleverly packaged. It may be \na tempting new business opportunity for the banking industry. But \nbecause it raises serious public policy concerns that have not been \nfully explored, it must not receive the protection of the Federal \nsafety net. I hope that the Banking Committee will be able to closely \nexamine this matter soon either separately of in the context of \nfinancial services modernization.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n           Affairs,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 1994.\n     Hon. Eugene Ludwig,\n     Comptroller of the Currency, Office of the Comptroller of the \n         Currency, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Andrew C. Hove,\n     Acting Chairman, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Ludwig and Chairman Hove: We are following with \n     great interest and concern the efforts of the Blackfeet \n     National Bank (``Blackfeet'') of Browning, Montana to offer \n     to the general public a new ``Retirement CD.'' We are \n     disappointed that the OCC and the FDIC, by separate \n     correspondence dated May 12, 1994, have in effect sanctioned, \n     with certain conditions, plans to market and offer this \n     Retirement CD investment product.\n       We are very troubled that the OCC and FDIC would react \n     favorably to a product with such enormous ramifications for \n     the banking system, the Bank Insurance Fund, the insurance \n     industry--and, most importantly, for the consumers of \n     financial products--without consultation with Congress and \n     without requesting more specific commitments and information \n     from American Deposit Corp. or Blackfeet.\n       The Retirement CD product raises a number of significant \n     concerns which we have detailed below. We strongly believe \n     these matters need to be thoroughly addressed by the \n     regulators and Congress before this investment product is \n     offered to the public.\n                     1. Consumer Protection Issues\n\n       The OCC and FDIC letters clearly indicate that both \n     regulators have rather significant reservations about the \n     consumer-protection implications of the Retirement CD. Both \n     letters contain suggestions or conditions aimed at ensuring \n     customer understanding and adequate disclosure. This insured \n     deposit product combines features of both certificates of \n     deposit and annuities, and it is enormously complex. \n     Consumers may not fully comprehend how it works, the interest \n     rate structure or the extent of FDIC insurance coverage.\n       The Retirement CD will pay a fixed rate of interest for up \n     to five years, after which the rate becomes adjustable until \n     the agreed-upon maturity date. The only assurance given to \n     the consumers with respect to this variable interest rate is \n     that it will be at least 3 percent. Upon maturity, the \n     customer may withdraw up to two-thirds of the account \n     balance, and the remainder of the account will be dispersed \n     for life in fixed payments. These periodic payments \n     incorporate an imputed interest rate. The consumer must \n     understand that the interest rate, during much of the \n     accumulation period (prior to the agreed-upon maturity date) \n     and all of the payout phase, will be determined at the sole \n     discretion of the bank. Furthermore, as we understand this \n     product during the payout phase, there will be no minimum \n     imputed interest rate, similar to the three percent floor in \n     the accumulation phase. This raises an ominous prospect: that \n     a customer will not know exactly what the ``imputed'' rate is \n     keyed to and that the bank could offer a fixed payout at an \n     extremely unfavorable rate.\n       As we understand the product, FDIC insurance would only \n     apply to the balance (principal plus accrued interest) that \n     was not withdrawn on the date of maturity, less the full \n     dollar amount of any payments received during the pay-out \n     period. Therefore, a customer would have to understand that \n     if the bank were to fail at a point when the customer had \n     already received the full value of the account through lump-\n     sum distribution and monthly payments, the FDIC would neither \n     insure, nor continue to pay, the monthly payments for the \n     rest of the customer's life.\n       The OCC and the FDIC have expressed consumer protection \n     concerns with respect to depository institution sales of \n     uninsured non-deposit investment products, such as mutual \n     fund shares. There is evidence that banking consumers do not \n     always understand the simple fact that some of the products \n     that banks offer are not FDIC-insured. With respect to the \n     Retirement CD, we are concerned that consumers will not be \n     able to fully-understand that a\n      product that is called a ``certificate of deposit''--a \n     traditional insured deposit product--contains a component \n     that is not FDIC-insured (although we understand that the \n     promotional materials misleadingly ``guarantee'' payments \n     for life).\n       Even the regulators seem somewhat uncertain about how the \n     Retirement CD works. The respective letters from the OCC and \n     the FDIC differ in their descriptions of one of the most \n     important basic terms of the product--mainly, at what point \n     the payout is agreed to. The OCC letter states, ``[o]n the \n     maturity date the customer will select from various options \n     for repayment'' (p. 2, emphasis added). The FDIC letter \n     states, ``[u]pon opening the account, the customer also \n     chooses his/her payout options'' (p. 1-2, emphasis added). If \n     the regulators are confused, certainly the potential for \n     consumer confusion is enormous.\n       We must ask this question: ``Do the regulators honestly \n     believe that this product--that contains variable interest \n     rates, certain tax benefits, and partial FDIC-insured deposit \n     status--will not create substantially greater confusion than \n     non-deposit investment products?''\n                  [[Page S6604]] 2. Regulatory Issues\n\n       Annuties are currently subject to state regulations \n     enforced by state insurance officials. It is unclear if state \n     insurance regulatory requirements will apply to the \n     Retirement CD. Both customers and the bank should know this. \n     If state regulations do not apply, it should be determined \n     whether banks and bank regulators currently have the ability \n     or resources to safeguard these accounts, and what policies \n     and procedures are necessary to train bank personnel about \n     annuities and about appropriate sales practices.\n\n\n                     3. Safety and Soundness Issues\n\n       Blackfeet and other banks that may offer the Retirement CD \n     clearly will be acting as an underwriter of what is \n     essentially an annuity. Although clever lawyering has gained \n     this annuity product designation as a ``deposit'', it poses \n     much greater risk to the bank than a traditional deposit. \n     National banks will be assuming an unprecedented and \n     inappropriate risk as a result of having to make a fixed \n     payout for the life of a customer. Ultimately, these payments \n     could exceed the consumer's balance on deposit at maturity. \n     While the OCC suggests that Blackfeet's business plan should \n     indicate how it will manage the risk associated with the \n     annuity payment, the OCC requires no specific\n      showing that the bank has the capability to quantify or \n     manage this long-term liability of unknown proportions.\n       This ``deposit'' is structured so that at the date of \n     maturity, the bank must determine the fixed lifetime payout \n     for the customer using a complex and not entirely-discernible \n     process to achieve a proper rate of return. The Congress has \n     opted not to authorize banks to assume the type of risk \n     Blackfeet would assume in offering the Retirement CD, The OCC \n     and the FDIC seem willing to disregard this consistent record \n     of Congressional reluctance to allow federally-insured \n     depository institutions to engage in such high-risk \n     activities. The OCC and FDIC also seem too willing to take it \n     on faith that a small national bank (armed with a software \n     program) will have the business acumen and operational know-\n     how to handle the risk of underwriting this annuity product.\n\n\n                     4. Competitive Equality Issues\n\n       The proliferation of the Retirement CD will produce an \n     unfair competitive advantage for banks. It is reasonable to \n     expect that consumers will be drawn to a tax-deferred annuity \n     that also offers federal deposit insurance. By allowing \n     national banks to underwrite, market and sell a tax-deferred \n     annuity that is FDIC-insured, the FDIC is granting a \n     substantial competitive advantage over similar annuity \n     products that do not come with a government guarantee.\n       In expanding future opportunities for all financial service \n     providers and consumers, the Federal government's goal should \n     be to encourage competition on a free and fair basis. Balance \n     sheet strength, customer service and other market-determined \n     characteristics, not market-distorting government guarantees, \n     should determine success. Given the recent savings and loan \n     crisis, and the regulators' concerns over the abuse of \n     deposit insurance, it would seem ill-advised to extend the \n     reach of the federal safety net to a product that raises so \n     many regulatory, competitive and consumer protection \n     concerns.\n       The OCC and the FDIC have made it very clear that when \n     given the opportunity, they will usually take the most \n     expansive and creative view of bank powers under current law. \n     We strongly support the view that, to the maximum extent \n     possible, an explicit statutory mandate must exist before the \n     regulators authorize expanded powers for banks, or any other \n     financial intermediaries. For this reason, we continue to \n     support comprehensive modernization of our entire financial \n     system. Until this can be accomplished by Congress, we urge \n     the OCC and FDIC to balance the proclivity to expand bank \n     powers through regulatory channels against the legitimate \n     public policy concerns of consumer protection, safety and \n     soundness, and competitive equality. Products that raise \n     serious public policy concerns deserve great scrutiny, \n     regardless of how cleverly they are packaged or how \n     attractive they may be to the banking industry. The \n     Retirement CD is clearly one such product.\n       We do not share your view that this product, as it is \n     currently structured, is an appropriate product for national \n     banks to offer to retail customers. Therefore, we are \n     developing, and will soon introduce, legislation to prohibit \n     the sale of this investment product. Pending consideration of \n     this legislation by Congress, we urge the OCC and the FDIC to \n     reconsider their respective positions on the Retirement CD.\n           Sincerely,\n     Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Richard H. Bryan,\n     Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     Lauch Faircloth.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/12/senate-section/article/S6601-6", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 44\n\n  At the request of Mr. Reid, the names of the Senator from Oklahoma \n[Mr. Inhofe] and the Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 44, a bill to amend title 4 of the United States Code \nto limit State taxation of certain pension income.\n\n\n                                 S. 388\n\n  At the request of Ms. Snowe, the name of the Senator from Vermont \n[Mr. Jeffords] was added as a cosponsor of S. 388, a bill to amend \ntitle 23, United States Code, to eliminate the penalties for \nnoncompliance by States with a program requiring the use of motorcycle \nhelmets, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 534\n\n  At the request of Mr. Baucus, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n534, a bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to provide authority \nfor States to limit the interstate transportation of municipal solid \nwaste, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 585\n\n  At the request of Mr. Shelby, the name of the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Cochran] was added as a cosponsor of S. 585, a bill to \nprotect the rights of small entities subject to investigative or \nenforcement action by agencies, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/12/senate-section/article/S6604-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6604-S6642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n   THE INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE ACT OF 1995\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                    D'AMATO AMENDMENTS NOS. 878-913\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. D'AMATO submitted 36 amendments intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill (S. 534) to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to provide \nauthority for States to limit the interstate transportation of \nmunicipal solid waste, and for other purposes;

as follows:\n\n       On page 49, strike lines 1 through 8 and insert:\n       ``(3) The term `out-of-state municipal solid waste' means, \n     with respect to any State, municipal solid waste generated \n     outside of the State. Unless the President determines it is \n     inconsistent with the North American Free Trade Agreement and \n     the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the term shall \n     include municipal solid waste generated outside of the United \n     States. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     generators of municipal solid waste outside the United States \n     shall possess no greater right of access to disposal \n     facilities in a State than United States generators of \n     municipal solid waste outside of that State.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the managers of the bill \nwill be able to accept my amendment clarifying what constitutes out-of-\nState municipal solid waste, cosponsored by Senator Abraham.\n  S. 534, as reported by the committee, in title I, section (f)(3) on \npage 49, defines out-of-State municipal solid waste as municipal solid \nwaste [MSW] generated outside of the State. That is pretty clear and \nunambiguous. There should not be court battles over that definition. If \nMSW generated in Ohio comes to Michigan for disposal it should be \ntreated as out-of-State MSW, and vice versa. If MSW generated in Canada \nor any other country comes to Michigan for disposal, it should be \ntreated as out-of-State MSW. That seems pretty clear, too.\n  But, unfortunately, the bill goes further and muddies the clarity of \nthe definition. The next sentence suggests that waste generated outside \nthe country should somehow be treated differently, in a special \ncategory. It suggests that out-of-country waste is only included in the \ndefinition of out-of-State municipal solid waste if the President makes \na determination that including it will be consistent with NAFTA and \nGATT. So, if this bill became law, it would seem to require an \naffirmative determination of consistency by the President before \nMichigan, and other States receiving out-of-country waste, could \nactually control this MSW generated outside of their States.\n  This amendment reverses the presumption in the bill. The bill will \nnow presume that the term ``out-of-State municipal solid waste'' \nincludes out-of-country waste, unless the President makes a \ndetermination that such a definition is inconsistent with our trade \nagreements and treaty obligations. And, the amendment ensures that out-\nof-country generators of municipal solid waste will not be treated any \nbetter than U.S. generators of such waste when it comes to access to \ndisposal in a State.\n  Mr. President, waste is waste. If our States and local governments \nare to adequately manage MSW, all waste must be treated equally. Waste \noriginating in a foreign country is a problem in my home State of \nMichigan.\n  The last thing that we should do is give foreign waste any kind of \npreference. My amendment prevents that from happening.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                       WARNER AMENDMENT NO. 1071\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE (for Mr. Warner) proposed an amendment to the bill S. 534, \nsupra; as follows:\n\n       On page 65, line 6 insert ``or related landfill \n     reclamation'' after ``services.''\n            [[Page S6641]] BREAUX AMENDMENTS NOS. 1072-1073\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE (for Mr. Breaux) proposed two amendments to the bill S. \n534, supra; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 1072\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, on behalf of my colleague, Senator Johnston \nand myself, I ask that an article printed in the New Orleans Times-\nPicayune be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  We found the discussion of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety \nCommission very interesting and wanted to share these informative \ncomments with our colleagues.\n  The article follows:\n\n                    Cutbacks to CPSC Threaten Us All\n\n       Today in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission is conducting a conference titled ``Safety \n     Sells.'' The one-day event features business executives who \n     will ``highlight product safety as an emerging business \n     trend.''\n       In a press release describing the event, the commission \n     said executives from Toys R Us, Hasbro Inc., Proctor & Gamble \n     Co. and Volvo ``will discuss how they have improved their \n     competitive positions by selling safety.''\n       In the case of Volvo, that's certainly true. Its promotions \n     appeal to the growing number of car buyers, who intelligently \n     shop for safer cars, armed with Consumer Reports or the ``Car \n     Book,'' by Jack Gillis.\n       But toys? There are no books or magazines that list the \n     safe ones and the dangerous ones to avoid. And the steady \n     infusion of imported toys, made in countries that do not have \n     safety standards as rigid as ours, routinely pass undetected \n     through customs, filling the marketplace with unsafe products \n     for children.\n       We're talking about toys with excessive amounts of lead or \n     small parts that can choke children, bunk beds that fall \n     apart, etc. Their existence is why a significant portion of \n     this column is routinely given to warning readers about \n     recalls.\n       Imported toys can be bought cheaply and sold at huge \n     profits. And even if there's a recall, the companies know \n     that most buyers will never find out about it and, therefore, \n     their profits will remain high.\n       One of our best defenses against unsafe products is the \n     U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the only federal \n     agency that identifies and acts on a wide range of product \n     safety hazards, from toys to bikes to household products.\n       Unfortunately, the current trend for ``less government \n     interference'' could seriously undermine the commission's \n     much-needed work if it results in additional cutbacks to this \n     important consumer watchdog. If that were to happen, the only \n     beneficiary would be the corporations that profit from unsafe \n     products.\n       During the Reagan administration, the commission's budget \n     and staff were cut in half. Then, as now, it operates on a \n     $42-million annual budget--not much for a major federal \n     agency that addresses the hazards in our lives. Consider \n     these facts from the commission:\n       Unintentional injury is the leading cause of death among \n     people under 45 years old and is the fourth leading cause of \n     death in the nation.\n       More children die from injuries than from diseases.\n       There are 21,700 deaths and 28.6 million injuries each year \n     related to consumer products under commission jurisdiction.\n       The deaths, injuries and property damage associated with \n     consumer products cost the nation about $200 billion \n     annually. Consumer product injuries account for one out of \n     every six hospital days in this country.\n       The commission is the only agency addressing product safety \n     and health hazards for more than 15,000 consumer products.\n       What's more, the money used to support the commission gives \n     an excellent return. Every dangerous product removed from the \n     marketplace prevents an increase in the national health care \n     bill.\n       On the local level, I have nothing but high praises for \n     Sonny Sturdivant and Sidney Englander, the CPSC field \n     inspectors, who are invaluable sources of help for this \n     column and to the residents in this area.\n       If potential cutbacks to the commission worry you, as it \n     does me, you may want to contact your representatives in \n     Washington and let your feelings be known.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/12/senate-section/article/S6642-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      COMMEMORATING THE 47TH ANNIVERSARY OF ISRAEL'S INDEPENDENCE\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to mark a joyous \nevent, the founding of the State of Israel on May 14, 1948. From its \nnear-miraculous beginnings as a country born in strife, Israel enters \nits 48th year a prosperous and vigorous democracy.\n  With the hyperinflation of the 1980's a distant memory, Israel enjoys \nstable economic growth with moderate inflation. Israel's economic \nproblems are now the challenges of any developed country--generating \nand distributing wealth. As the circle of peace in the region expands, \nIsrael will find itself well-placed to be a major regional economic \npower.\n  Israel has renewed itself as the homeland of the Jewish people by \nsuccessfully managing its latest ``aliyah,'' the absorption of Jews \nfrom the Soviet Union and its successor states. Both the infusion of \nnew blood, and the national effort to welcome and absorb over half a \nmillion new citizens has reinvigorated the nation, while educating a \nnew generation on the special responsibilities and benefits of life in \nIsrael.\n  Among the greatest of those responsibilities and benefits is the \nnurturing of a democracy that is the envy, not only of the Middle East, \nbut of the world. To an extent perhaps matched only by the United \nStates, Israel has welded diverse peoples into a democratic society. \nIsrael understands the lesson so eloquently taught by former Jerusalem \nmayor Teddy Kollek that democracy is more than elections. Democracy is \na way of thinking, a way of acting and, most of all, a way of treating \none's neighbor. The world has much to learn from Israel's successful \nexperiment in representative democracy in an often harsh environment.\n  Israel marks its 47th birthday closer to lasting peace than ever \nbefore. As a result of the warm peace with Jordan, Israelis are finally \nvisiting the legendary red rocks at Petra. As a result of the \nmultilateral peace negotiations, Israel is normalizing relations with \nArab states in North Africa and the Persian Gulf.\n  Israel is also inching closer to peace with its Palestinian and \nSyrian neighbors. However, as Israelis above all peoples understand, \npeace never comes cheaply, and Israel is facing a historic challenge as \nit tries to conclude genuine peace in the face of terrorism.\n  All of us grieve with Israel every time another terrorist atrocity is \nperpetrated. All of us pray with Israel that the leaders and peoples of \nthe Middle East, and those of us who support them, will find the wisdom \nto steer a path through the shoals of violence to a lasting peace.\n  The United States Government and individual Americans have an \nimportant role to play in supporting Israel, its people, and its \nleadership, in making the hard decisions necessary for peace. I am \nproud of the record of the United States Senate in providing unstinting \nsupport of Israel, and I will be proud to continue that record.\n  I am particularly proud of the contributions of citizens of my own \nState of New Jersey to Israel's development. These are people like \nMiles Lerman, active in fundraising and philanthropy for Israel, and \nthe man most responsible for the Holocaust Museum in Washington, who \nform the unshakable foundation of America's unwavering support for \nIsrael.\n  Israel today is 47 years strong. I know I speak for the people of New \nJersey, and the United States, when I wish her peace and continued \nprosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/12/senate-section/article/S6642-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, in January 1961, Dwight Eisenhower gave his \nlast speech as President to the American people.\n  And in those remarks, Ike offered some advice which should be \nremembered by all of us in the Senate--and all Americans--as the \nFederal budget moves to the top of our agenda in the coming weeks.\n  Eisenhower said, and I quote:\n\n       As we peer into society's future, we must avoid the impulse \n     to live only for today, plundering for our own ease and \n     convenience the precious resources of tomorrow. We cannot \n     mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without \n     risking the loss also of their political and spiritual \n     heritage. We want democracy to survive for all generations to \n     come, and not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow.\n\n  It has now been over 34 years ago since President Eisenhower spoke \nthose words. And as everyone here knows, they are words that have been \ntragically ignored. When Ike left the White House, our national debt \nstood at approximately $248 million--$248 million. Today, it is $4.8 \ntrillion. And it continues to grow by $355,000 each and every minute--\nthat is $482 million a day--far more than our entire debt in 1961.\n  There can be no getting around the fact, Mr. President, that America \nis at a crossroads, and we face a choice.\n  Down one road is the status quo.\n  It is a road that means living for today, plundering the resources of \ntomorrow.\n  It is a road that means we continue to mortgage the assets of our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  It is a road that sentences our country to the future that Eisenhower \nforesaw--a future as an insolvent phantom.\n  This is a very easy road to take, because it involves no tough \ndecisions, and no leadership of any kind.\n  And it is the road recommended by President Clinton, and by many of \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle.\n  Down the other road is change.\n  A road that means reversing the spending patterns of the last three \ndecades.\n  A road that means reducing the rate of growth of Government spending.\n  A road that allows Congress to rein in the Federal Government, and to \nreturn power to the States and more importantly to the people.\n  It is a road that will be very bumpy, because it will require some \ntough, tough, tough decisions.\n  It is a road that requires leadership--leadership that House and \nSenate Republican majorities are willing to provide.\n  It is a road that we must take, because it is a road that will result \nin a stronger America for our children and our grandchildren.\n  And thanks to the courage and hard work of Chairman Domenici, and his \nfellow Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee, we now have a map \nwhich will help guide us down this road.\n  In developing a historic budget that slows the growth in Federal \nspending from 5 to 3 percent a year, and that achieves a balanced \nbudget within 7 years, Senator Domenici and the Budget Committee \ndeserve the gratitude of all Americans.\n  The Domenici budget reflects our commitment to the American people to \nrein in the Federal bureaucracy. It eliminates more than 140 Federal \ndepartments, agencies, and programs--including the Department of \nCommerce. In doing so, it moves power out of Washington, and back to \nthe people, where it belongs.\n  The Domenici budget reflects our commitment to keep Americans safe. \nIt maintains funding for the FBI, the DEA, the INS, and for crime-\ncontrol initiatives that aid police on the front lines in the war \nagainst crime.\n  The Domenici budget reflects our commitment to protect Social \nSecurity, and to preserve, improve, and protect Medicare.\n  And it reflects our commitment to maintain a safety net for those in \ntrue need, by funding WIC, School Lunch and Breakfast Programs, Head \nStart, child care, and efforts to track down deadbeat dads.\n  Senator Domenici should also be congratulated for keeping the \nmajority members together in defeating Democrat amendments to raise \ntaxes, cut defense, or spend more money.\n  Is the Budget Committee proposal perfect? Of course not. Every \nSenator--including this one--could find some program they thought \nneeded more money, or others that needed less. But it is a historic \ndocument that truly sets America in the right direction.\n  And I might add that, according to this morning's newspapers, the \nworld agrees with that statement. These press reports suggest that \nbecause of speculation we actually might do more than we have in the \npast to cut the deficit, the dollar staged its biggest 1-day rally in \nnearly 4 years.\n  Apparently, this news slipped by the Clinton administration. Despite \nthe Vice President's promise a few months ago that--and I quote: ``We \nthink the task of balancing the budget is one that we have to actually \ntake responsibility for ourselves,'' notwithstanding that quote, the \nWhite House has chosen to abdicate a leadership role in reducing our \ndeficit.\n  The budget they proposed earlier this year, is one that would give us \ndeficits \n [[Page S6644]] of $300 billion for as far as the eye can see.\n  Mr. President, the new Republican Congress promised to make the tough \ndecisions. We promised to fight the status quo. We promised to stand \nfor real change. We promised to balance the budget. And as this budget \nproves, we are keeping our promises.\n  And make no mistake about it, at the same time we are balancing the \nbudget, we will also keep our promise to provide real tax relief to \nAmerica's families.\n  Let me close, Mr. President, by warning the American people that in \nthe coming weeks, President Clinton and his administration will be \ntrotting out the same old scare tactics they tried before last \nNovember's election.\n  We will hear them say that Republicans are heartless. We will hear \nthem say that Republicans want to help the rich, and harm those in \nneed. We will hear them say that we are targeting children and seniors. \nWe will see them throw a lot of rocks at Republicans. But I am afraid \nwhat we will not see from them is leadership.\n  While they engage in class warfare, the Republican Congress will \ncontinue to declare war against the deficit. And with the support of \nthe American people, it is a war that we will win.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/12/senate-section/article/S6643-5", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M., MONDAY, MAY 15, 1995\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
