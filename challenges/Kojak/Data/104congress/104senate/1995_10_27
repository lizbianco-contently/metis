The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I take 3 minutes and answer the \nSenator?\n  Senator Graham, I understand that the staff, Senator Dole's staff, is \nin the process of delivering the amendment to you right now.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The point I was making, if I could, Mr. President, is \nthat I am going to object strenuously if the 10-minute rule is \nattempted to be applied to the Finance Committee amendment.\n  We have not had an adequate opportunity to evaluate and to understand \n\n\n[[Page S 15980]]\nits significance. I am alerting the manager to my intention to protect \nthe rights of those who have been waiting now for almost 18 hours to \nget a copy of this amendment. We have been denied that opportunity, and \nsoon we will be asked to vote upon a stealth amendment which will quite \nlikely be the most significant amendment on this most significant \nlegislative enactment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2978\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The next amendment on our side is Senator Gramm's. He \nis not here and asked we set his amendment aside and proceed to the \nnext amendment, which is the Kerry amendment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am interested in this amendment. Are you \njust skipping it once or what?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am asking that it be set aside for one amendment. If \nthe Senator is not ready----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Reserving the right to object.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. EXON. Reserving the right to object, may I interject a few \nstatements?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I simply say I share the concerns expressed \nby my colleague from Florida. I think, if we will check the Record, we \nwill find very clearly that the Roth amendment--that is the subject of \nconcern, and I think legitimately so, of the Senator from Florida and \nothers--was supposedly the first amendment we were going to take up \nwhen we started this process of voting yesterday. It was laid aside. We \nwere advised late last evening, sometime before midnight, that the \nmeasure would be presented to us so we could study it overnight. I \nremind all it was a rather short night. We still have not received it. \nI have not received it. Maybe it is in the process of being delivered \nto us at this time.\n  Here, it seems to me, we have to exercise some discipline. All day \nyesterday, this Senator, along with my colleague, the chairman of the \ncommittee, kept telling Senators you have to be here to offer your \namendments. We cannot run the U.S. Senate for the benefit of every \nother Senator, regardless of their station in life and regardless of \nwhat office they are running for.\n  It seems to me, if we are going to move this process along, we are \ngoing to have to institute a policy that, if the Senator on the list \nthat has been published now for about 24 hours is not here to offer the \namendment, then I suggest the amendment should be set aside and \ndisposed of and not considered.\n  We have to exercise some discipline on everyone. I simply say I hope \nI can see the Finance Committee amendment. But in the meantime, I am at \nthe mercy of the majority, and I simply ask my colleague if he could \nnot join with me--and I think he will--to try to exercise some \ndiscipline on both sides of the aisle, not only with regard to the time \nconstraints that we must maintain, but, also, we cannot move ahead \nunless Senators put the priority I think is necessary and that we \nshould expect for them to be here to offer their amendments in a timely \nfashion, if for no other reason than out of consideration for the other \nMembers of the body.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Gramm is here. He does not \nintend to offer his amendment. He withdraws it.\n  We are ready to proceed with your amendment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. EXON. I appreciate that very much. That is very good news.\n  Mr. FORD. Should we not make a motion to withdraw the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to withdrawing?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can the manager of the bill withdraw the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to withdrawing 2978?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I will not object. I will just say, there are a \nnumber of Senators here, including the Senator from Rhode Island and \nthe Senator from West Virginia, who note this withdrawal may have been \nstrategically a very good idea because it was going down to a dreadful \ndefeat because it is such a dreadful amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm].\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I do not withdraw the amendment and I am \nready to speak on behalf of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the amendment? The Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, what we have in this bill is an effort by \nSenators----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute equally divided on the \namendment.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, what we have in the bill before us is a \ndoublecross of the States. We reduced the rate of growth in Medicaid \nspending in agreement with the Governors by $187 billion. But the \ncondition under which the Governors took the reduced rate of growth was \nthat they were going to get to run the program. This is in Medicaid. \nSo, in the Medicaid Program, we reduced the growth of spending in that \nprogram by $187 billion. The Governors agreed to it on the condition \nthat they run the Medicaid Program. We now are trying to tell them how \nto run it.\n  I do not doubt the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from \nRhode Island have very good intentions. But we should not be telling \nthe States how to run this program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, we have 30 seconds now?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to my colleague from West \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is yielded 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this is the most cruel and unusual \namendment of this entire 24-hour fiasco. It rejects the idea of making \nsure America's poorest children, poorest elderly, pregnant women, \ndisabled, SSI--it decimates people who need help. It is an evisceration \nof Medicaid. It is a cruel amendment. It ought to be rejected by both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, there is a lot of talk about who is in the \nwagon these days. If we have no room in the wagon for 12-year-old poor \nchildren, pregnant women, the blind, and disabled, we have become an \nunworthy society.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the first vote be 15 \nminutes and thereafter votes be limited to 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The first \nvote will be 15 minutes. Then further votes will be 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is on the Gramm amendment No. \n2978.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 23, nays 76, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 518 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--23\n\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Brown\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Dole\n     Faircloth\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     Nickles\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Smith\n     Thompson\n\n                                NAYS--76\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle \n\n[[Page S 15981]]\n\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n  So, the amendment (No. 2978) was rejected.\n  Mr. EXON.

Under the previous order, No. 2979 offered by \nthe Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] will be considered, 1 minute \nequally divided.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will withhold.\n  Mr. EXON. Once order is restored in the Senate, I would like to yield \n30 seconds on our side to the Senator from Kansas for remarks that I \nunderstand she has to make on this measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. If I could have the attention of the Senator from Kansas. \nThe Senator from Kansas, I yield her 30 seconds off of our time on the \nKennedy amendment. I apologize. We are going to the Kerry amendment at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Kerry amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 30 seconds to Senator Kerry.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this amendment does not ask Senators to \nvote on any number. It simply asks Senators, as a sense of the Senate, \nto say that before the end of the session we will vote and debate on \nthe minimum wage issue.\n  I will just share with Senators an article in the New York Times \ntoday.\n  It says:\n\n       The income gap between rich and poor was wider in the \n     United States during the 1980s than in any other large \n     industrialized country, according to the most comprehensive \n     international study ever released on income distribution.\n\n  Seventy percent of the poverty wage, $8,500, is the current income \nlevel.\n  We simply want to vote and debate on it. And I hope colleagues will \nagree we ought to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I assume I had 30 seconds under the \nrule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back my 30 seconds and make a point of order \nthat this violates the Budget Act. I raise a point of order under the \nprovisions of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act, I move to waive the applicable section of that act for the \nconsideration of the pending amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the motion \nto waive the Budget Act.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 51, nays 48, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 519 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens).

I yield 30 seconds of our time to the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support \nstriking this provision from the bill before us, because I believe it \nis bad pension policy. We are making some assumptions here which we do \nnot really know the consequences of, and I feel that it is absolutely \nessential that we not begin to make inroads into pension plans in which \nretirees have counted on without knowing the consequences. I urge all \nto support the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think the leader wants some time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE.

I will \ntell you right now, regular people are tired of having to pay more in \ntaxes because of these egregious loopholes. I urge my colleagues to \nvote ``aye.''\n  Mr. President, last night I talked briefly about each of the four \namendments I was going to offer separately, that I continued in my \nomnibus amendment.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that a statement elaborating on each tax \nloophole, and the reasons for its elimination, which this omnibus \namendment proposed to do, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statements were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n\n               REPEAL CORPORATE WELFARE IN THE TAX CODE:\n\n                  ELIMINATE OIL AND GAS TAX BREAKS NOW\n\n       Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment which I know \n     will be controversial with some Senators, but which I think \n     deserves debate and a vote. It is part of my larger effort to \n     help reduce the deficit over the next several years through \n     scaling back corporate welfare, instead of making such \n     unnecessarily large cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, student \n     loans, and other areas, many of the proceeds from which will \n     be used to finance a tax cut primarily for the wealthy.\n       This Republican budget package is radical, and it fails to \n     meet a basic test of fairness that Americans expect us to \n     apply in order to get to a balanced budget. One of its major \n     failings that has not been much discussed is that it does \n     almost nothing to eliminate the fantastically expensive tax \n     loopholes that have been embedded in the code for years, and \n     that give special treatment to one industry or type of \n     investment over all others. These preferences distort \n     economic decisionmaking, and because they are so expensive \n     make regular middle-class families, who are struggling to \n     make it these days, pay much higher income taxes than they \n     otherwise would have to pay.\n       Let me make a simple point here that is often overlooked. \n     We can spend money just as easily through the tax code, \n     through tax loopholes, as we can through the normal \n     appropriations process. Spending is spending, whether it \n     comes in the form of a government check or in the form of a \n     tax break for some special purpose, like a subsidy, a credit, \n     a deduction, or accelerated depreciation for this type of \n     investment or that. These tax loopholes allow some taxpayers \n     to escape paying their fair share, and thus make everyone \n     else pay at higher rates. These arcane tax breaks are simply \n     special exceptions to the normal rules, rules that oblige all \n     of us to share the burdens of citizenship by paying our \n     taxes.\n       I think it is a simple question of fairness. If we are \n     really going to make the spending cuts and other policy \n     changes that we would have to make to meet the balanced \n     budget amendment targets, then we should make sure that \n     wealthy interests in our society, those who have political \n     clout, those who hire lobbyists to make their case every day \n     here in Washington, are asked to sacrifice at least as much \n     as regular middle class folks that you and I represent who \n     receive Social Security or Medicare or Veterans benefits or \n     student loans.\n       That is just common sense, and I think we ought to signal \n     today that the standard of fairness we will be applying will \n     require elimination of at least some of these tax breaks. Too \n     often, in discussions about low-priority federal spending \n     which ought to be cut, one set of expenditures is notoriously \n     absent. That is tax breaks for wealthy and well-positioned \n     special interests.\n       Tax subsidies are heavily skewed to corporations and the \n     relatively few people in very high-income brackets, while \n     government benefits and services go in far larger proportions \n     to the middle class and the poor. If it is harder to \n     eliminate tax breaks or other preferences than cut programs, \n     the burdens of deficit reduction are likely to be borne \n     disproportionately by those in the bottom half of the income \n     scale. The effect of this, of course, is a further transfer \n     of political power up the income scale. This imbalance means \n     the system is likely to favor the wealthy and powerful over \n     those in the bottom and middle of the income scale.\n       Many of these tax breaks are industry-specific, others were \n     designed to encourage particular kinds of activities or \n     investments, or to subsidize consumers of certain products. \n     The General Accounting Office issued a report last year, in \n     which they noted that most of these tax expenditures \n     currently in the tax code are not subject to any annual \n     reauthorization or other kind of systematic periodic review. \n     They observed that many of these special tax breaks were \n     enacted in response to economic conditions that no longer \n     exist. In fact, they found that of the 124 tax expenditures \n     identified by the Committee in 1993, about half were enacted \n     before 1950. The particular oil and gas tax break that my \n     amendment focuses on was enacted in its original form in the \n     1920's. Many of these industry-specific breaks get embedded \n     in the tax code, and are not looked at again for years.\n       Now some will vote against this motion reflexively, arguing \n     wrongly that this is simply an attempt to raise taxes. It is \n     not. These arcane tax breaks are simply special exceptions to \n     the normal rules, rules that oblige all of us to share the \n     burdens of citizenship by paying our taxes. They are pushed \n     by high-priced lobbyists, who have hired even more highly-\n     paid tax lawyers, to make their special pleadings.\n       The effect of allowing them to continue is to ensure that \n     hard-working Americans will not be provided much real tax \n     relief, since all of the revenues that might help pay for \n     such relief are being siphoned off by wealthy special \n     interests. This amendment simply calls the question on one \n     small part of the very targeted spending we do through the \n     tax code, spending that is not subject to the annual spending \n     process and is rarely debated on the floor of the Senate.\n       This amendment would repeal the current special tax \n     treatment for what are called ``intangible drilling costs'' \n     in the oil and gas industry. Since around 1916, the oil and \n     gas industries have benefitted richly from this special \n     benefit. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that \n     eliminating this loophole will save US taxpayers at least \n     $2.5 billion over the next five years; and billions more in \n     the years thereafter.\n       This is how this longstanding special tax benefit works. \n     Companies engaged in oil and gas exploration are allowed to \n     completely deduct from their federal taxes what are termed \n     the ``Intangible Drilling Costs'', or IDC's, of conducting \n     drilling and related activities as they explore for \n     profitable wells. These include what they pay for labor, \n     fuel, repairs, hauling, supplies, site preparation--many \n     different kinds of expenses they pay when looking for new and \n     more profitable wells. By expensing rather than capitalizing \n     these costs, taxes on much of their income are effectively \n     set to zero.\n       In most industries, the logic of tax policy requires that a \n     company is allowed to recover its costs of doing business, \n     either through depreciation or a special form of depletion, \n     over the valuable life of the asset. But this special benefit \n     is an exception to these general tax rules. And though \n     decades ago it was argued that these special benefits were \n     necessary to encourage oil exploration, they can no longer be \n     justified--and certainly not in the current budget crunch. \n     Even with the introduction of the alternative minimum tax in \n     the 1980's, when you consider the many other breaks these \n     industries still receive--including the very expensive \n     percentage depletion allowance--this still keeps the \n     effective marginal tax rate on gas and oil companies below \n     that for other industries. That is not fair, and it makes \n     middle income people pay higher income taxes. It should stop, \n     now.\n       I know that oil and gas companies, and those who represent \n     them here in the Senate, have in the past argued that these \n     special tax breaks should be extended because of the special \n     risks involved in looking for oil and gas wells to drill. \n     While it is true that these are sometimes high-risk ventures, \n     they are also very profitable, or else companies would not be \n     pursuing them. The risks are justified by the large profits \n     to be made. I also wonder whether they are intrinsically any \n     less risky than small business start-ups in new markets, or \n     the launching of new products, or similar entrepreneurial \n     business decisions. I suspect probably not.\n       Proponents will also argue that capital is hard to come by \n     in the oil and gas industry, and that small producers need to \n     be protected. Of course, everyone who enjoys these kinds of \n     tax breaks are going to try to couch \n\n[[Page S 15983]]\n     their plight in terms of being the embattled little guy. But that is \n     not what this is about. This is mostly about special tax \n     benefits being showered on large and small producers alike--\n     even though there are somewhat different rules for each--in a \n     single industry that has been consistently showing signs of \n     profitability in recent years. While sometimes volatile oil \n     markets make oil and gas investments risky, that doesn't \n     necessarily justify this special treatment.\n       In addition to the huge costs to taxpayers that must be \n     considered when looking at this tax break, we should also be \n     aware of the environmental costs that are attached. As with \n     many other energy subsidies, this subsidy encourages drilling \n     in environmentally sensitive areas, and serves as a \n     disincentive for us to explore more environmentally \n     sustainable means of energy production.\n       And these are areas which have been protected for years by \n     the ravages of thoughtless oil and gas development. For \n     example, I strongly oppose drilling in the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge. This has been an issue that I have been \n     involved in from the time I first came to the Senate. There \n     was a filibuster over ANWR that I led when I was here just a \n     short period of time and now ANWR is back again. The Energy \n     Committee has voted, over the objections of a large \n     bipartisan group of Senators, to open up ANWR for drilling \n     and to use the revenue to meet reconciliation instructions. \n     These large oil and gas company subsidies only encourage \n     those kind of developments by artificially increasing and \n     subsidizing demand for new wells.\n       It also seems to me that there are compelling energy policy \n     arguments against this tax break. To the extent that these \n     subsidies stimulate drilling of domestic wells, they reduce \n     our short-run dependence on foreign oil--but force us to \n     deplete our own Nation's reserves at a faster rate. While oil \n     is flowing freely to the U.S. from the Middle East and \n     elsewhere, I see no reason to subsidize domestic drilling to \n     such an extent.\n       Some will argue there are national security considerations \n     here, and that we should preserve this subsidy because it \n     helps to ensure the future of domestic producers. I think if \n     we are so concerned about the national security implications \n     of our reliance on foreign oil, then maybe we should be \n     rethinking provisions to sell off the strategic petroleum \n     reserve that were included in this bill.\n       Others will claim that eliminating the expensing of IDC's \n     would hamper domestic oil exploration, and that the \n     industry's profit margins have declined steadily over the \n     last 15 years or so as the alternative minimum tax has kicked \n     in on some producers, and various lucrative other tax breaks \n     have been slightly reformed. However, it is clear that most \n     of the reason for this decline was not the increased tax \n     burden, but the worldwide decline in oil prices. Experts from \n     academia to industry analysts to CRS are agreed on that.\n       Finally, oil and gas companies will also argue that \n     eliminating their expensing provisions will effectively raise \n     costs for the consumer at the gas pump. The Congressional \n     Budget Office has no formal projections of this cost \n     increase, but I suspect that if there is any increase at all, \n     it would only be a fraction of one cent per gallon at the gas \n     pump. Much of any additional costs would be absorbed by oil \n     and gas companies, as they strive to remain competitive in \n     world markets.\n       Mr. President, this issue is complex, but in the end, it is \n     not even a close call. As a recent CRS study on tax \n     expenditures states, ``There is very little, if any, \n     justification for this non-neutral tax treatment of IDCs. \n     Many economists believe that expensing is a costly and \n     inefficient way to increase oil and gas output and enhance \n     energy security . . .''\n       The oil and gas industry has for decades been enjoying a \n     tax benefit that has not been available to other American \n     industries, and so to eliminate it is really just to ``level \n     the playing field.'' For those who support a flat tax, or \n     even a flatter tax rate structure than we have now made \n     possible by closing special loopholes, this amendment is a \n     good place to start. I urge my colleagues to make good on \n     pledges to fairly and responsibly reduce the federal deficit \n     by voting for this amendment. I yield the floor.\n\n\n               REPEAL CORPORATE WELFARE IN THE TAX CODE:\n\n                    ELIMINATE THE PUERTO RICO CREDIT\n\n       Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to repeal \n     outright Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, which \n     provides certain corporate income tax credits to firms doing \n     business in Puerto Rico and the other U.S. Possessions. This \n     repeal would become effective on January 1, 1997. It speeds \n     up the repeal already provided for in the bill by, in some \n     cases, 9 years, saving over $35 billion dollars in the \n     process.\n       Let me be clear: the Finance Committee, for the first time \n     in decades, has already acknowledged that this loophole \n     should go; it is simply now a question of when, and how. For \n     those who support a flat tax, or even a flatter tax rate \n     structure than we have now made possible by closing special \n     loopholes, this amendment is a good place to start.\n       This amendment is part of a larger attack on corporate \n     loopholes to highlight something I have seen over and over in \n     that short time: the political gap between the promise to cut \n     spending, and actual follow-through on that promise. Between \n     the promise of spending restraint, and actual spending \n     restraint. Let me make a simple point here that is often \n     overlooked. We can spend money just as easily through the tax \n     code, through tax loopholes, as we can through the normal \n     appropriations process. Spending is spending, whether it \n     comes in the form of a government check or in the form of a \n     tax break for some special purpose, like a subsidy, a credit, \n     a deduction, or accelerated depreciation for this type of \n     investment or that.\n       In the last few years, for example, many of us voted for \n     billions in actual cuts on this floor--not gimmicks, not \n     smoke and mirrors, not deficit reduction formulas that never \n     identify precise cuts, but actual reductions in federal \n     spending contained in actual amendments to appropriations \n     bills. We have also voted consistently against continued \n     wasteful and unnecessary defense spending contained in \n     appropriations bills each year. And often it was precisely \n     those who support the balanced budget amendment, and employ \n     elaborate Heritage Foundation-concocted across-the-board \n     spending cut formulas that do not contain any specific cuts, \n     who voted against actual spending cuts on the floor. This is \n     where the rubber meets the road, where the rhetoric meets \n     reality. Many balanced budget amendment proponents have \n     failed the test of political courage on this point, and I \n     think that should be made clear.\n       These tax loopholes allow some taxpayers to escape paying \n     their fair share, and thus make everyone else pay at higher \n     rates. These arcane tax breaks are simply special exceptions \n     to the normal rules, rules that oblige all of us to share the \n     burdens of citizenship by paying our taxes.\n       I think it is a simple question of fairness. If we are \n     really going to make the over a trillion dollars in spending \n     cuts and other policy changes that we would have to make to \n     meet the balanced budget amendment targets, then we should \n     make sure that wealthy interests in our society, those who \n     have political clout, those who hire lobbyists to make their \n     case every day here in Washington, are asked to sacrifice at \n     least as much as regular middle class folks that you and I \n     represent who receive Social Security or Medicare or Veterans \n     benefits.\n       That is just common sense, and I think we ought to signal \n     today that the standard of fairness we will be applying will \n     include elimination of at least some of these tax breaks. Too \n     often, in discussions about low-priority federal spending \n     which ought to be cut, one set of expenditures is notoriously \n     absent. That is tax breaks for wealthy and well-positioned \n     special interests.\n       Tax subsidies are heavily skewed to corporations and the \n     relatively few people in very high-income brackets, while \n     government benefits and services go in far larger proportions \n     to the middle class and the poor. If it is harder to \n     eliminate tax breaks or other preferences than cut programs, \n     the burdens of deficit reduction are likely to be borne \n     disproportionately by those in the bottom half of the income \n     scale. The effect of this, of course, is a further transfer \n     of political power up the income scale.\n       Many of these tax breaks are industry-specific, others were \n     designed to encourage particular kinds of activities or \n     investments, or to subsidize consumers of certain products. \n     The General Accounting Office issued a report last year, in \n     which they noted that most of these tax expenditures \n     currently in the tax code are not subject to any annual \n     reauthorization or other kind of systematic periodic review. \n     They observed that many of these special tax breaks were \n     enacted in response to economic conditions that no longer \n     exist.

It is \n     not. These arcane tax breaks are simply special exceptions to \n     the normal rules, rules that oblige all of us to share the \n     burdens of citizenship by paying our taxes. The effect of \n     allowing them to continue is to ensure that hard-working \n     Americans will not be provided any tax relief, since all of \n     the revenues that would pay for such relief are being soaked \n     up by wealthy special interests. This amendment simply calls \n     the question on one small part of the very targeted spending \n     we do through the tax code, spending that is not subject to \n     the annual spending process and is rarely debated on the \n     floor of the Senate.\n       I suspect most Americans, if asked, would scale back the \n     Puerto Rico tax break further rather than cut spending on \n     prisons or police or environmental protections or workplace \n     safety or Medicare or Medicaid. For that matter, for the \n     amount of money generated by eliminating this tax break, we \n     could pay for Head Start, meals-on wheels for the elderly, \n     WIC, and the National Park Service for a year, and still have \n     money left over.\n       This amendment eliminates outright the Puerto Rico subsidy, \n     starting next year. In 1993, as we were preparing to consider \n     the Reconciliation bill, I concluded that this tax credit \n     should be phased out over a short period, given the other \n     strains on the federal budget, and the need for further \n     deficit reduction. While I was concerned that an immediate \n     repeal might have too large and abrupt an impact on the \n     economy of Puerto Rico, which was at the time reeling under a \n     very high unemployment rate, I would have supported a prompt \n     phase-out. While the 1993 \n\n[[Page S 15984]]\n     Reconciliation Act did scale back somewhat the benefits provided to \n     eligible companies under this provision, it failed to phase \n     out the provision. And so now I think the time has come to \n     repeal it outright, starting in 1996. That will put a stop to \n     efforts by corporations who invest in Puerto Rico and the \n     other U.S. Possessions to shelter profits and avoid paying \n     their fair share of taxes.\n       Ostensibly a tax credit to encourage economic development \n     in U.S. possessions, primarily Puerto Rico, the Section 936 \n     tax credit has over the years evolved into a huge corporate \n     loophole, providing a multi-billion offshore tax shelter for \n     some of America's most profitable companies. While it has \n     been narrowed, and some of the most egregious abuses \n     addressed, it remains a fantastically expensive subsidy for a \n     few special interests. That is unfair, Mr. President, \n     especially when we consider all of the competing budget \n     claims on these scarce federal funds. It is time to bring a \n     halt to it.\n       Over the past several decades, as I have mentioned, several \n     efforts were launched to try and bring the section 936 tax \n     credit under control. Rules regulating the allocation of \n     income derived from intangible assets were tightened, but to \n     little avail. Additional loopholes were created, which allow \n     companies to continue the long-established practice of \n     shifting income derived from intangible assets created on \n     shore to Puerto Rico. The 1993 OBRA bill took a step toward \n     trying to reconfigure the section 936 credit as a wage-based \n     credit by tying the amount of the credit, in many cases, to \n     actual wages paid or investments made. But it also allowed \n     corporations to receive the credit according to a generous \n     alternative formula that continues to cost taxpayers billions \n     per year. While this modest linkage between actual \n     investments made and wages paid was a step in the right \n     direction, it is still a credit that is no longer justifiable \n     in this current budget crunch.\n       In 1993, Finance Committee Chairman Moynihan observed that \n     the 936 program, as it is known, dates back to the 1920's. He \n     said that the changes in the 1993 Reconciliation bill were \n     done in such a way as to ``clearly anticipate the phasing out \n     finally of this measure.'' But that hasn't happened yet, and \n     this amendment is designed to make sure that there is a \n     final, clean termination of the program as soon as possible.\n       The bill before us today, while it recognizes that this \n     provision must eventually be eliminated, provides for a very \n     long phase-out, in some cases up to 10 years. I am very \n     concerned that if we do not repeal this program now, which \n     has been in the Tax Code in some form since the 1920's, it \n     will continue to cost taxpayers billions of dollars per year, \n     and that clever tax lawyers, lobbyists, and the companies for \n     whom they work might even find ways to retain it in the Tax \n     Code in the next few years.\n       Section 936 presents a very complicated set of calculations \n     to derive the tax credit against taxable income, but the \n     simple effect of this provision is to reduce the cost of \n     corporate investment in territories, mainly Puerto Rico. Its \n     purpose, quite obviously, was to attract investment in the \n     struggling possessions; instead it has been used as major \n     loophole for U.S.-based corporations to shelter taxable \n     income.\n       While I recognize the economic impact that repeal of this \n     provision will have on certain U.S. companies doing business \n     in Puerto Rico--some of which are in my own state, the GAO's \n     extensive 1993 report concluded that reliable estimates of \n     the changes in corporate behavior could not responsibly be \n     made, since that would require anticipating how many, if any, \n     beneficiaries of the credit would move to other regions, \n     would relocate or scale back their operations there. Of \n     course, many other factors, including labor costs, \n     productivity, transportation and infrastructure costs, and \n     other tax consequences of their decisions would be considered \n     by these firms.\n       Given this uncertainty, and the fact that this is a special \n     subsidy available to firms nowhere else, I do not believe we \n     can continue to subsidize the activities of a few large \n     corporations at the expense of millions of American \n     taxpayers. Companies that invest in Minnesota directly would \n     love to benefit from a very generous tax credit like this, \n     but they do not. Nor do firms in any other states, to my \n     knowledge. It only applies to the U.S. possessions, with most \n     of the benefits going to pharmaceutical, food, chemical, and \n     instrument-manufacturing firms in Puerto Rico.\n       The costs of special interest corporate tax loopholes like \n     this are often astronomical. This one is particularly \n     expensive. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that \n     repealing this provision outright would save almost $20 \n     billion over just 5 years. $20 billion. And about the same \n     amount in the second 5 years. That money could be used to \n     mitigate the huge cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, or in the \n     EITC, that are made in this bill. It could be used to reduce \n     the federal deficit.\n       I hope my colleagues will support this effort to scale back \n     this longstanding tax break for a relatively few wealthy \n     companies, and dedicate these funds for deficit reduction. \n     How on earth can we continue to support giving a few major \n     corporations this enormous tax break at the same time that \n     cuts are being made in Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs \n     that affect the most vulnerable among us?\n       Another problem with this tax credit program is that it \n     draws investment away from the U.S. While this provision has \n     over the years encouraged considerable investment in the \n     possessions, that investment often came at the expense of \n     corporations investing here. These investment effects are now \n     amplified under NAFTA and GATT; just as 936 bleeds investment \n     out of the States and into possessions where labor costs are \n     traditionally cheaper, it may now act as an incentive for \n     manufacturers to hold onto their operations in Puerto Rico, \n     rather than moving to countries like Mexico or Singapore. I \n     have heard over the years from many workers in my state who \n     are upset about the transfer impact of this provision on \n     Minnesota jobs.\n       Even if this provision could once have been justified as an \n     economic development tool following the Second World War, \n     that is no longer possible. A recent report of the Senate \n     Budget Committee said ``. . . the measure's cost in terms of \n     foregone tax collections is high compared to the number of \n     jobs the provision creates in Puerto Rico.''\n       My colleagues will recall, I am sure, that our \n     distinguished colleague, Senator Pryor, released a GAO study \n     done several years ago in which it was pointed out that the \n     primary beneficiaries of this provision are the large \n     pharmaceutical companies that have located in Puerto Rico. \n     Let us call this what it is: corporate welfare of the most \n     stark kind.\n       The huge Section 936 credit claimed by a number of U.S. \n     pharmaceutical firms are a case in point. A GAO study \n     requested by our colleague Senator Pryor revealed a number of \n     shocking details. According to the GAO:\n       Since section 936 is intended to be an employment and \n     economic development program for Puerto Rico, the GAO \n     measured the tax credit provided companies for each employee. \n     For pharmaceutical companies, the credit amounted to over \n     $70,000 per employee--267 percent of the wages actually paid \n     the average employee. One pharmaceutical company, Pfizer, \n     received a tax credit equivalent to over $150,000 per \n     employee--amounting to 636 percent of the typical wage paid \n     to its Puerto Rican workers. Now I know that these outrageous \n     disparities were mitigated somewhat by the 1993 changes in \n     the formula, but the fact remains that this is a very \n     inefficient economic development subsidy. And even the more \n     recent GAO report done in 1993 found that the ratio of a \n     firm's tax benefits per employee was still far higher than \n     the total wages paid to these employees.\n       The time has come to pull the plug on this corporate \n     welfare program. At the same time that historic huge cuts in \n     Medicare and Medicaid are being made, at the same time we are \n     slashing student loans and the earned income tax credit, at \n     the same time that we are slashing economic development \n     funding in our own cities and rural areas, we somehow find \n     the funds to continue a multi-billion dollar tax credit of \n     questionable merit and effectiveness, the prime beneficiaries \n     of which are a small number of large, profitable drug \n     companies.\n       Mr. President, continuing this credit for years while \n     trying to balance the budget by 2002 is bad public policy. It \n     is bad tax policy. It is bad budget policy. It cannot be \n     allowed to stand, especially in the current budget climate. I \n     urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I yield the \n     floor.\n\n\n           Eliminate the Foreign Earned Income Tax Exclusion\n\n       Mr. President, I have already spent some time here on the \n     Senate floor in an effort to close a number of tax loopholes. \n     Underlying these efforts is a recognition that we must reduce \n     the federal budget deficit in a way that is fair, \n     responsible, and that requires shared sacrifice. Closing \n     corporate welfare loopholes will help us do that.\n       At this point, I would like to address a loophole that will \n     cost $8.9 billion over the next 5 years in lost receipts, and \n     billions more thereafter. In other words, while American \n     citizens all over this Nation will have to pay taxes over the \n     next 5 years, a certain group of taxpayers will use this \n     loophole during that time to get out of paying $8.9 billion \n     in taxes. And over 10 years, that is about $18.4 billion that \n     the rest of American taxpayers will have to make up in higher \n     taxes or reduced services from their government.\n       The loophole is called the Foreign-Earned Income Tax \n     Exclusion, and it allows Americans living overseas to earn \n     the first $70,000 of their income entirely free of American \n     taxes. While this Exclusion is related to the Foreign Tax \n     Credit--which allows you to reduce your U.S. taxes by the \n     amount you paid in taxes to a foreign government--the two \n     should not be confused. The Foreign Tax Credit simply \n     protects, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, against paying tax \n     twice on the same income: once to the U.S. and once to a \n     foreign government. The Exclusion entirely ignores the \n     existence of $70,000 of the income you earned abroad, \n     regardless of how much tax you paid on it. In short, it is an \n     overly broad way to protect against double taxation, and it \n     is unnecessary because of the existence of the Credit.\n       Some will charge that by closing this tax loophole, by \n     restricting this special interest tax break we are somehow \n     proposing to raise taxes. They are wrong. What they fail to \n     understand is that even with the reforms of the mid-1980's, \n     which closed many of the most egregious tax loopholes, the \n     presence of tax breaks in the current tax system forces \n     middle class and working people to pay far more in taxes than \n     they otherwise would have to pay. While some are paying less \n     than their fair share in taxes because of this special tax \n     subsidy for people working abroad, those \n\n[[Page S 15985]]\n     who work in the U.S. are being forced to pay more in taxes to make up \n     the difference. Closing this tax loophole is not raising \n     taxes.\n       When taxpayers in my State of Minnesota file their returns \n     every year, they are not allowed to disregard $70,000 of \n     their income. So why do we let Americans living abroad to \n     take advantage of this loophole?\n       When it first came on the books in 1926, the Exclusion was \n     said to help support U.S. trade because it was a tax break \n     for U.S. citizens living abroad that were promoting trade \n     between the U.S. and foreign countries. However, since then \n     there has been a constant tension between those fighting for \n     tax equity (who want to close the loophole) and those who \n     believe that the loophole actually benefits U.S. trade abroad \n     (who have actually tried, at times, to expand the loophole, \n     i,e, raise the Exclusion above the current $70,000).\n       Clearly, in deciding whether or not to eliminate a special \n     tax break, we need to balance the good effects against the \n     bad. In this age of telecommunications and global markets we \n     no longer need to give a special tax break in order to \n     promote foreign trade, nor is it clear that this particular \n     tax break does promote foreign trade. To quote from a Senate \n     Budget Committee print:\n       ``The impact of the provision is uncertain. If employment \n     of U.S. labor abroad is a complement to investment by U.S. \n     firms abroad--for example, if U.S. multinationals depend on \n     expertise that can only be provided by U.S. managers and \n     technicians--then it is possible that the exclusion has the \n     indirect effect of increasing flows of U.S. capital abroad.'' \n     [Tax Expenditures: Compendium of Background Material on \n     Individual Provisions, Senate Budget Committee Print 103-101, \n     December 1994, p. 22].\n       Three times between 1962 and 1978, Congress passed laws to \n     limit and finally eliminate the Exclusion. But in 1981, the \n     give-away returned, bigger than ever and with a built-in \n     yearly increase. The enormous cost of the loophole led \n     Congress to enact a 4-year freeze in its size in 1984 at \n     $80,000, with $5,000 annual increases to resume in 1988. That \n     ultimately proved too rich for Congress, and the 1986 Tax \n     Reform Act brought us to where we are today: a hefty $70,000 \n     Exclusion that will cost the Treasury about $1.6 billion \n     before this calendar year is out.\n       A 1994 Senate Budget Committee print describes one negative \n     effect of the provision:\n       ``The exclusion's impact depends partly on whether foreign \n     taxes paid are higher or lower than U.S. taxes. If an \n     expatriate pays high foreign taxes, the exclusion has little \n     importance; the U.S. person can use foreign tax credits to \n     offset any U.S. taxes in any case. For expatriates who pay \n     little or no foreign taxes, however, the exclusion reduces or \n     eliminates U.S. taxes. Available data suggest that U.S. \n     citizens who work abroad have higher real incomes, on \n     average, than persons working in the United States. Thus, \n     where it does reduce taxes the exclusion reduces tax \n     progressivity.'' [Tax Expenditures: Compendium of Background \n     Material on Individual Provisions, Senate Budget Committee \n     Print 103-101, December 1994, p. 20]\n       In other words, if a foreign country has taxes as high or \n     higher than the U.S., the foreign tax credit may help to \n     achieve the goal of preventing double taxation. But where \n     taxes are lower, the Exclusion provides a windfall for people \n     who make more than the average person who stays in the U.S. \n     make a living.\n       When you see a long-lived whopper of a loophole like this, \n     you have to wonder who is fighting to save it. Some light is \n     shed on this question by the IRS's Statistics of Income \n     Bulletin from Fall 1994. It tells us that while only two-\n     tenths of one percent of people filing individual tax returns \n     in 1991 claimed the Exclusion, 45 percent of those claiming \n     the Exclusion ultimately ended up with no income tax \n     liability. In plain English, that means that almost half of \n     the people who got to use the loophole in 1991 didn't have to \n     pay U.S. income taxes.\n       Now that we see the substantial benefits this Exclusion can \n     bestow upon a foreign-resident American who takes advantage \n     of it, let us see who those people tend to be. Well, it might \n     interest my colleagues to know that the total foreign-earned \n     salaries and wages in 1991 for Americans living in Saudi \n     Arabia were the third-highest in the world, right behind the \n     United Kingdom and Hong Kong. I am all for Americans making a \n     good living, but there is something particularly interesting \n     about those living in Saudi Arabia: that country charges no \n     income tax on those earnings. Thus we have the exact \n     situation the Budget Committee print warns against: where the \n     foreign taxes are lower than U.S. taxes, the Exclusion \n     reduces U.S. taxes paid; and where higher-than-average \n     earners receive reduced taxes, our income tax system becomes \n     less progressive.\n       But do not stop there. A smattering of unorganized \n     Americans living in Saudi Arabia is not likely to pack enough \n     political clout to be able to protect a taxpayer give-away \n     like this one. There must be some other force here, somebody \n     with money and political punch. That's where the major \n     multinationals like the oil companies come in. Through \n     private agreements with their employees, these corporations \n     arrange to pocket the windfall that comes to employees when \n     they are detailed to Saudi Arabia and other low-tax countries \n     and become eligible for the Exclusion. These agreements \n     provide that when an employee goes to work overseas, the \n     employee's standard of living will not be changed. While that \n     could mean a generous protection for employees in high-tax \n     countries, in low-tax countries it is the employer who is \n     receiving the benefit, this time at the expense of the \n     American taxpayer.\n       Now it all makes sense. We have this unjustifiable loophole \n     in our tax system so that huge oil companies and other \n     multinationals can pocket yet another subsidy. Of course, \n     this subsidy is hidden in the tax code because it would be \n     hard (or at least embarrassing) for Congress, in the full \n     light of day, to directly subsidize the oil industry--\n     especially under current budget constraints. By eliminating \n     this tax break, we could make the tax system fairer, flatter \n     and simpler--goals which all of us share.\n       I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. I yield \n     the floor.\n\n\n   ELIMINATE CORPORATE WELFARE BY STRIKING RELAXATION OF ALTERNATIVE \n                              MINIMUM TAX\n\n       Mr. President, I am offering this amendment to strike from \n     the reconciliation bill the provision to eliminate the \n     Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), and to use the billions in \n     savings generated from this amendment to reduce the federal \n     deficit.\n       The AMT was put into the law as part of the 1986 Tax Reform \n     Act. As many of my colleagues will recall, the effort during \n     1986 tax reform was to simplify the tax code as well as \n     infuse some elements of fairness into the tax code. In 1984, \n     two years before tax reform became law, the non-partisan \n     research group Citizens for Tax Justice did a report that \n     found 130 of 250 of the major American corporations had paid \n     nothing in federal taxes during at least one of the five \n     years from 1981 to 1985. Among the companies were Champion \n     International, Dow Chemical, Phillips Petroleum, Texaco, \n     Shell, and Mobil. We must not return to that scandalous \n     record of tax avoidance by relaxing, and for some firms even \n     repealing, the alternative minimum tax. But that's the way \n     this bill would take us. The Treasury Department estimates \n     that if the AMT is repealed, by the year 2005 we could have \n     more than 76,000 corporations not paying taxes.\n       Because the other thing that we should remember about 1986 \n     Tax Reform is that together with getting rid of many tax \n     breaks for corporation and wealthy individuals, we lowered \n     tax rates for everyone--it was a trade off.\n       The Alternative Minimum Tax became law in response to the \n     egregious level of tax avoidance by many large and profitable \n     corporations. Indeed the official summary of the Tax Reform \n     Act of 1986 states: ``Congress concluded that the minimum tax \n     should serve one overriding objective: to ensure that no \n     taxpayer with substantial economic income can avoid \n     significant tax liability by using exclusions, deductions, \n     and credits. . . . It is inherently unfair for high-income \n     taxpayers to pay little or no tax due to their ability to \n     utilize tax preferences.'' The same holds true now. The AMT \n     is still necessary to prevent abuses, it has worked, and we \n     should not be effectively repealing it.\n       The AMT ensures that corporations and individuals that \n     receive large tax savings by making use of tax deductions and \n     exemptions pay at least a minimum amount of income tax. In \n     very simple terms this is how it works. If corporations and \n     individuals calculate their tax and find that they owe \n     nothing, the AMT kicks in with a set of rules so these \n     companies and individuals pay at least something. Under the \n     AMT certain items are designated as so-called ``preference'' \n     and those items are taxed at the regular rate. If the AMT is \n     higher than the regular tax, the higher alternative tax is \n     the tax that is owed.\n       The AMT imposes a lower tax rate rather than the regular \n     tax rate. However, the AMT tax applies to a broader range of \n     items in the tax base. It negates the benefit of many of the \n     preference and exclusions that a company or individual might \n     benefit from under the regular income tax system.\n       The Finance Committee provisions of reconciliation make \n     changes to the AMT that in some cases would effectively \n     eliminate it. According to the Joint Tax Committee these \n     provisions could cost an estimated $9.2 billion in corporate \n     tax breaks over then next five years. The House-passed \n     version of this provision will costs taxpayers about $25 \n     billion, so we know that it's only likely to get worse if we \n     don't knock out this provision here.\n       Beginning next year the AMT would be reduced for both \n     corporations and individuals. It would allow taxpayers to \n     take most of the tax writeoffs which are not currently \n     allowed under the AMT, such as accelerated depreciation and \n     intangible drilling costs, for purposes of the AMT and thus \n     reduce the portion of income that would be taxed under the \n     AMT. This would effectively eliminate the core of the AMT \n     because the tax would be the same under the AMT and the \n     regular tax system.\n       The bill would allow corporations to apply past payments of \n     the AMT toward the payment of future years tax by up to 50%, \n     as long as a corporation's tax liability was not below the \n     newly-reduced AMT. Under current law, corporations are \n     allowed to use prior tax payments of the AMT to reduce their \n     current regular tax liability, but only down to the amount of \n     AMT tax. In other words, Mr. President, this proposal would \n     eliminate the floor that the AMT was supposed to provide.\n       Mr. President, I believe reconciliation should be for \n     reducing the deficit, not for giving more aid to dependent \n     corporations in \n\n[[Page S 15986]]\n     the form of new tax breaks for wealthy individuals and big business. \n     Corporations and wealthy individuals should not escape their \n     fair share of the tax burden through tax shelters. In this \n     day of severe budget cuts, when we are all asked to tighten \n     our belts, we should not excuse the most wealthy of our \n     country from that obligation.\n       To add insult to injury, this legislation would \n     substantially increases the tax burden on working families \n     and the poor by restricting eligibility for the Earned Income \n     Tax Credit while scaling back the AMT on corporations and \n     wealthy individuals. This is the quintessential shift of tax \n     burden from the very wealthy to low and moderate income \n     working families. How can we in good conscience increase \n     taxes on 17 million low-income working families while at the \n     same time decrease taxes on the wealthiest people in this \n     country, those making hundreds of thousand of dollars \n     annually?\n       During the debate on the balanced budget amendment, \n     Republicans repeated over and over again that we need to \n     balance the budget to provide for a better future for our \n     children and grandchildren. But now that we have before us \n     the actual plan for balancing the budget (which actually will \n     do no such thing) we can see what they're offering everyone: \n     a tax cut for the well off, and a higher bill for the middle \n     class.\n       This kind of a tax break benefits the very high-income \n     people with wealth and power and clout, and corporations with \n     high-powered lobbyists. They're the big political campaign \n     contributors, the people who spend $50,000 per person to \n     attend small, intimate dinners to support the pet political \n     causes of certain politicians; they're the wealthy corporate \n     interests who are well-represented in Washington, while \n     average Americans are left out in the cold.\n       Repealing the AMT would undoubtedly take us back to the \n     days when corporate America was making billions in profits \n     and paying little or no tax. That is not the direction we \n     should be going. It is not good for the economy and it is not \n     good for the citizens of this country.\n       Some would argue that the AMT has been burdensome on \n     business, especially small business. Some claim that it \n     increases taxes and thus reduces return on capital and makes \n     continued investment difficult. They are wrong. If we are all \n     supposed to be tightening our belts to reduce the budget \n     deficit and ultimately reach a balanced budget, asking \n     profitable firms to pay at least some income tax, as everyone \n     else is required to do, is simple fairness and common sense.\n       Indeed, our tax code is already filled with too many tax \n     breaks for special classes or categories of taxpayers. We \n     should be repealing those tax breaks instead of considering a \n     bill that adds more giveaways to the rich while increasing \n     the burden on the working families. I think it's a simple \n     question of fairness. If we are really going to cut billions \n     of dollars in government spending and other policy changes to \n     achieve a balanced budget, then we should make sure that \n     wealthy interests in our country, those who have political \n     clout, those who hire lobbyists to make their case every day \n     here in Washington, are asked to sacrifice at least as much \n     as regular middle class folks that you and I represent who \n     receive Social Security or Medicare or Veterans benefits.\n       I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.

I ask unanimous consent that I and Senator Exon be \npermitted to speak for 3 minutes each to explain to Senators where we \nare and what we expect of them in the next couple of hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me explain to the Senators where we \nare, and I will then yield obviously to Senator Exon.\n  We are next going to vote on the substitute budget resolution by \nSenators Simon and Conrad. And then we have only one amendment left in \nthe so-called second tier, the tier about which we have agreed to have \n5 minutes on each side of debate. That is the Roth Finance Committee \namendment. Excuse me, Senator Pryor on nursing homes is next, and \nSimon-Conrad on the substitute follows that, and the Roth Finance \nCommittee amendment. They are circulating parts of it to the various \nstaff. And I talked to Senator Graham of Florida. We are trying to get \nthe staff involved very soon. But those are the three that are left on \nthat part.\n  Then we come to that ominous group, that nebulous group that is \ncalled third tier. We have invented that term. But that means all the \nother amendments that anybody would like to offer.\n  I might mention that we have been waiting for a list, and we do not \nhave a list. But the minority leader is working to try to get that \nlist.\n  The minority leader and the majority leader suggest the following: If \nyou have amendments that you intend to call up in that period of time \nwhen there is little or no time to discuss them, we would ask Senators \nto submit their amendments to the desk so that they will be with the \nclerk, and then submit them to Senator Exon and Senator Domenici at our \ndesks so that we will have some idea by the time we finish tier 2 of \nwhat amendments we have to consider.\n  It is very important for everyone, to all Senators--not we as \nmanagers--that we establish some order for that series of amendments. \nSo I urge that all Senators who have amendments to get them to the \ndesk, not have them circulating around here, and get them to the \nmanager and the ranking member's desk here in the Senate.\n  I yield now to Senator Exon.\n  Mr. EXON. I agree completely with what the chairman has said. I \nsimply remind all that if you file your amendments now in a timely \nfashion, as we have indicated, giving a copy to each of us, when we get \ninto the voting procedures on these amendments we will try and give \npriority consideration as nearly as possible with regard to how they \nwere filed to give some incentive for people to file the amendments.\n  We are trying to get together, as the chairman has said, the \ndefinitive list on this side. We do not have a list of all \n\n[[Page S 15987]]\nof the amendments that are proposed on the other side. This is a way to \nget that worked out. Numerous Senators have come to me and have said, \n``What plan should I make with regard to leaving Washington, DC, this \nweekend?'' I said that is very, very much up in the air.\n  I would simply say that my best guess at the present time is that we \nhave, as of now, a minimum--I emphasize the word ``minimum''--on both \nsides of the aisle of somewhere around 50 individual separate \namendments to be considered. Multiply that out. Even at a limited 10-\nminute timeframe, you can see we are talking about a minimum of 8 hours \nof steady voting, which should give everyone pause for consideration if \nthey have any visions of leaving sometime this evening for obligations \nthat they have elsewhere.\n  Therefore, I hope we can continue to whittle down the amendments. We \nhave been tremendously successful thus far on this side. We started out \nwith about 120. Right now I think we are down to somewhere between 41 \nand 45. That is still an awful lot. But we have come a long, long way, \nand we intend to go further. Suffice it to say that if we are going to \nhave the cooperation that is necessary while allowing each Senator \nrights as guaranteed to offer the amendments, then we are going to have \nto have some restrictions in the better understanding than we have \nright now on both sides with regard to limiting the amendments.\n  So I hope that all will agree with the suggestion made by the \nchairman, which I agree with completely. We have checked this, as I \nunderstand it, with both the minority leader and the majority leader. \nAt least that is the best chance we have of moving forward in as \nexpeditious a fashion as possible. I use that word advisedly.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to confirm what the ranking member \nand the chairman have indicated. The majority leader and I have talked \nabout how we are going to proceed now with the third tier. I urge \nSenators to accommodate our two ranking members. They have been working \nwith us very carefully and closely.\n  I think the only way we can accommodate the schedule for the balance \nof the day is to do what the chairman has suggested. We have talked to \nall of our colleagues on this side of the aisle. We know approximately \nwhat the list is. We do not have the text of any of the amendments. \nThey need to be filed within the next hour. And then the list needs to \nbe provided to the ranking member so we can begin to put the list in \norder.\n  So I urge everyone's cooperation to allow us to get through this list \nas expeditiously as we can but also as knowledgeably as we can. No one \non the Republican side has seen the text of any of our amendments. We \nhave not seen the text of their amendments. The only opportunity for us \nto look at the text is while we are voting on additional amendments.\n  So it is important that everyone come forth and bring their \namendments to the desk, and allow us to list them officially. Then we \nwill begin considering them.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Nebraska has \nexpired. There are 40 seconds left to the other side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would Senator Graham like to ask me a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If the Senator will yield for a question, does he have \nany idea when we will have an opportunity to get to review the Finance \nCommittee amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Fellow Senators, let me just add to what we said \nheretofore. I have been asked by Senators what time we can get out of \nhere. So my comments are attempting to accommodate you. I think \nsometime within the next couple of hours we will have made all the \nmajor votes, taken all the major votes, and will have decided all the \nmajor issues. So I do not think we should stay around here until 12 \no'clock tonight. We are going to do our best to expedite things.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The question is, When will we have an opportunity to \nreview the Finance Committee amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I just spoke to Senator Roth. He said that his staff is \ngoing to exchange views with your staff and other staff. They are \nalready going to give you parts of the amendment, which are ready. They \nare going to do that right now. And we will just go from one step to \nanother. But you will have part of it quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. EXON. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the first amendment has been handed to both \nsides by Senator Simon, an important step in the right direction. We \nhope all will follow.\n  Second, I would suggest that if possible--we cannot insist on this--I \nwould suggest that Senator Simon and all that will follow with this \nprocess to try to add a one- or two-sentence explanation of what their \nmeasure is intended to do. That will help expedite things on all sides.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2983\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next vote occurs on the amendment of the \nSenator from Arkansas. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered.\n  There are 30 seconds to each side.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Let us listen to the Senator from Arkansas for \n30 seconds. Senators clear the well, please.\n  The Chair cannot hear the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is offered by myself and Senator Cohen \nand several of our colleagues. This amendment very simply reinstates \nthe nursing home standards that we adopted in 1987 with a bipartisan \neffort. These standards have worked. They have worked well. They have \nsaved money. The nursing home industry is not trying to repeal these \nstandards. And we are going to hear that another proposal from the \nother side of the aisle is going to fix this issue. But I will say, Mr. \nPresident, we have not seen all of the ramifications. We know that \nthere is a gaping hole----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. PRYOR. In the waiver process and that there are no standards \ngoing to be submitted on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Cohen's proposal with reference \nto this issue is going to be incorporated in the Republican, in Senator \nRoth's, proposal. I urge that Republican Senators vote against this \namendment because it is going to be taken care of and in some respects \neven be better than this amendment. It will be part of the package, and \nwe are sorry we cannot give it to you yet. But it is Senator Cohen's \nproposal that is incorporated in the Republican package.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, will the Senator from New Mexico yield for \na question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Arkansas be given an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I just want to ask a question, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to additional time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will not object this time, but I really do not think \nwe can do it every time.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, if I can ask my friend from New Mexico, is \nthe so-called nursing home regulation or standard fix, is this a part \nof the larger omnibus Finance Committee package that none of us have \nseen?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. That is right.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senators will see it shortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  All time is yielded back. The question is on agreeing to the Pryor \namendment No. 2983. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote? \n\n[[Page S 15988]]\n\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 48, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 522 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  So the amendment (No. 2983) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2984\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next amendment is the Simon amendment No. \n2984 with 30 seconds for each side.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute for an \nexchange of views between the managers----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order. There is a \nrequest for additional time. The Senator from Nebraska wants 1 minute; \nis that the request?\n  Mr. EXON. After consultation with the two leaders, and the managers \nof the bill, it is our feeling----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the Senator's \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator's request is \ngranted.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. After consultation with the two leaders, Senator Domenici \nand myself, and others, we would simply say that we have two amendments \nleft on what we have referred to as tier two. That is the Simon-Conrad \ndeficit-reduction amendment, and then the final one, the Roth Finance \nCommittee amendment.\n  We are now on Simon-Conrad. We will move ahead in the usual fashion. \nIt is our suggestion then that there be an agreement that the Roth \namendment will be put indefinitely aside for later consideration to \ngive all a chance to look at some of the details of that, and allow us \nto move then to the so-called tier three category, and begin votes, and \nbring up the Roth Finance Committee amendment at the call of the \nchairman.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Nebraska has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Was that in the form of a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. EXON. No. That is simply to state what we hope we could do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no further time for debate unless you \nask for it. The Senator from New Mexico is entitled to 30 seconds at \nthis time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I compliment the sponsors of this \namendment and make just two observations. We have heard a lot of debate \non the floor of the Senate that all we needed to do to save Medicare \nwas $89 billion. Actually, it is interesting to note that this \nDemocratic proposal requires $168 billion in savings for Medicare. It \nis all too interesting to note that much has been said about us doing \ntoo much on the programs of senior citizens.\n  I just say that this amendment has $268 billion in program reductions \nthat affect senior citizens. That brings it to at least the same level \nas the Republican package, if not more. We are not going to vote for it \non this side. But we commend the Senators for their realism in \nacknowledging that these kinds of things have to be done.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I had hoped that I would hear from the \nchairman on the suggestion that I made. I have heard nothing from him \non that. He went into the debate. I have not yielded the 30 seconds yet \nthat I have, which I will do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The two leaders on the floor cannot hear one \nanother. The Senator from New Mexico does not realize, in the Chair's \nopinion, that he had 30 seconds to respond to the Senator from \nNebraska. Does the Senator wish 30 seconds to respond?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. To respond to his request about setting aside this \namendment or this bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska asked for 1 minute, \nequally divided, to discuss the question that he asked the Senator from \nNew Mexico. Does the Senator wish to respond?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, with reference to the Roth amendment, we \nwill acknowledge that the other side deserves ample time to review it. \nWe do not intend to call it up next. We intend to set it aside and \nprovide ample time for its review. It will be taken up in due course, \nbut not next under this list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired except for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 30 seconds to Senator Simon.\n\n\n                   Modification to Amendment No. 2984\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk, and I \nask unanimous consent that I may modify my amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to modify my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n       On page 18 of the amendment delete subtitle B.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senators \nConrad, Robb, and Kerrey. It eliminates the tax cut, reduces the CPI \n0.5 percent, which is less than the experts have recommended. That \nmeans, for the median person on Social Security, $3.85 a month. For \nthat, you get more than $100 billion in Medicare, more than $100 \nbillion in Medicaid, $36 billion in welfare, and you eliminate the cuts \nin education. It has bipartisan support in the House, and I hope it can \nhave that here in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 2984, as modified.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 19, nays 80, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 523 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--19\n\n     Akaka\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Feinstein\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Johnston\n     Kerrey\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Moynihan\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Robb\n     Simon\n\n                                NAYS--80\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n  So the amendment (No. 2984) was rejected.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to lay that motion on the table. \n\n[[Page S 15989]]\n\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                             CHANGE OF VOTE\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on rollcall vote 518, I voted ``no.'' My \nintention was to vote ``aye.'' I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to change my vote, which in no way would change the outcome \nof the vote.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. If I could inform my colleagues where we are and where we \nare headed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator using leader's time?\n  Mr. DOLE. I will use my leader's time.\n  We are now ready to proceed to the third tier. So we have some order \nand know what we are voting on, I will request that the two managers \neach have 30 seconds to explain their amendment, or maybe they do not \nneed explanation. The votes on the pending amendments will be 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, the last \nitem on tier 2, what is going to be its disposition?\n  Mr. DOLE. The last item?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Florida \nthere is no amendment before the desk.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I was asking a question. We have been proceeding under a \nunanimous-consent request, taking up amendments under tier 2.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time for debate.\n  Mr. DOLE. Under my leader's time, we will postpone action on that, \nand we have talked to the Democratic leader and the manager of the \nbill, and that gives everybody a chance to look at it, study it, and \nbring it up sometime later.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the majority leader have an indication of when we \ncan see the legislative language?\n  Mr. DOLE. Probably the time we get to see the list of tier 3 \namendments on that side.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So we have no indication of when?\n  Mr. DOLE. As quickly as we can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Is there any objection to the request of the Senator?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Would the Chair restate the Senator's request?\n  Mr. DOLE. That the two managers have 30 seconds to explain the \namendments and then have 7\\1/2\\-minute votes.\n  Mr. SIMON. Reserving the right to object, why not go to 5 minutes?\n  Mr. DOLE. It is not possible for the clerk to do it any more quickly \nthan 7\\1/2\\, plus there is always one or two that never get the message \nand are rolling around out here somewhere.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, did the 1 minute apply \nto the Roth?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, using my leader time----\n  Mr. DOLE. All we have is 7\\1/2\\ minutes, so I am asking we have 30 \nseconds, for the managers to have 30 seconds. I do not include the 7\\1/\n2\\.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, using my leader time, let me emphasize we \nhave asked all Senators to turn their lists in, their amendment in--we \nhope it is not a list, but an amendment--by noon. The amendment ought \nto be filed by noon, and it ought to be turned in to the managers by \nnoon.\n  That is the only way I am going to put it on a list. If I do not have \nthat amendment by noon, it is not on the Democratic list. So it is very \nimportant everybody cooperate to the extent that we have 40 minutes, \nnow, to file the list and compare our lists so we can get on with our \nwork.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nrequest for 30 seconds on each side before each amendment?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, there is objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. There is no further time \nfor debate.\n  Mr. DOLE. No debate, no explanation of amendments. Let us vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an amendment to present?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2985\n\n   (Purpose: To restore funding for Medicare disproportionate share \n                           hospital payments)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President I call up amendment No. 2985. I ask \nunanimous consent there be 1 minute equally divided to comment on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania asks unanimous \nconsent for 1 minute on a side to explain his amendment. Is there \nobjection?\n  Mr. DOLE. Wait a minute. There has already been an objection. I want \nto be sure the Senator from Florida has a right to object to this \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania for 1 minute on each side, to explain his \namendment and to answer that explanation?\n  Mr. EXON. I reserve the right to object. Is the Senator suggesting a \ndifferent proposal than what the majority leader did?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For the amendment he submitted to the desk, he \nasks for 1 minute on a side on his amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2985.\n       On page 539, line 16, strike all that follows through page \n     541, line 9.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 15 seconds to \nexplain this amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask for 30 seconds for the managers on \neach side to discuss the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The question is on the amendment. All in favor say aye?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me restate my request in a little \ndifferent way, which has been cleared by the Democratic leader and the \ntwo managers: That there be 30 seconds by each manager to explain the \namendment, unless they designate the sponsor of the amendment to make \nthat 30-second explanation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Chair is in doubt. That applies to all further amendments on this \nbill, is that correct? Does that apply to all further amendments on \nthis bill?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes, except the Roth amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Except the Roth amendment. With the exception \nof the Roth amendment, that is the order for the balance of this bill. \nAll amendments, 30 seconds to each side. The managers to have the right \nto designate the sponsor or principal objector?\n  Mr. DOLE. Right. We would hope they would cooperate with the managers \nand let the managers give a very short explanation. I think the \nmanagers are prepared to do that. We are just trying to move the bill \nalong. This will accommodate those who feel strongly about their \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I do not \nobject. The \n\n[[Page S 15990]]\npoint is that, if an objection is made, there will be no time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. If there is an objection, \nthere will be no time.\n  Is there an objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no time. The manager has to \ndesignate the sponsor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 30 seconds to Senator Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this bill cuts out--if there may be \norder, Mr. President--this bill cuts out $14.5 billion from \ndisproportionate share payments, and indirect medical education which \ncripples the major hospitals and the major teaching institutions. And \nthis amendment reinstates $4.5 billion.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is yielded back.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In opposition to the amendment?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I am speaking in favor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. There is no time for that.\n  Mr. EXON. Is there anyone who seeks to speak in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not the agreement. The Senator from \nNebraska has the time to designate the spokesman in opposition to the \namendment.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 30 seconds to the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, this would just throw out all of the effort \nwe spent--weeks and weeks trying to deal with this issue. It would put \n$4.5 billion back into the pot. We have had all this redistribution. We \nhave worked on it very hard in a bipartisan way.\n  I hope this amendment will be soundly defeated. I regret that it is \nnot subject to a point of order. But it is a motion to strike.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Is there a request for the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I request the yeas and nays, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Pennsylvania. On this question, the yeas and nays \nhave been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 47, nays 52, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 524 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mack\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Specter\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--52\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  So, the amendment (No. 2985) was rejected.\n  Mr. EXON.

The Chair has been requested to ask Senators \nto stay out of the well during debate.\n  Is there an amendment?\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2992\n\n  (Purpose: To amend title 4 of the United States Code to limit State \n                  taxation of certain pension income)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the following has been cleared by the \nmajority manager.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Nevada, Senator Reid, I \nsend an amendment to the desk on source taxation and ask unanimous \nconsent that further reading of the amendment be dispensed with; that \nthe amendment be agreed to, and that the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 2992) was agreed to, as follows:\n       At the end of subchapter E of chapter 1 of subtitle J of \n     title XII, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I send a technical amendment to the desk \non behalf of the Banking Committee and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. \n     D'Amato, proposes an amendment numbered 2993.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with. \n\n[[Page S 15991]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is agreed to on both sides. I ask \nthat the amendment be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 2993) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is open to amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2994\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have an amendment for Senators \nHutchison, McCain, Lieberman, and others. It has been cleared on both \nsides, as I understand it. I send it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mrs. \n     Hutchison, Mr. McCain, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. \n     Levin, proposes an amendment numbered 2994.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Will the Senator state what the amendment is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senate will be in order, the Senator \ndid state that he had an agreement from both sides.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Will the Senator state what the amendment is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Did the Senator from New Mexico hear the \nSenator's request?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He wants to know what is in the amendment.\n  This is a sense of the Senate with reference to Yugoslavia that has \nbeen cleared on all sides.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, unless we have an understanding of what this \namendment is, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will read the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Sense of the Senate on continued human rights violations in \n     the former Yugoslavia.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senate will be in \norder.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, can we withdraw the amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will take unanimous consent to withdraw the \namendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All right, let us proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Stop the reading.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that we be permitted to \nwithdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, the \namendment is withdrawn.\n  So the amendment (No. 2994) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not do that because I oppose the substance. I \njust do not want to set a pattern that we are going to waste a lot of \ntime on amendments so that is why I withdraw it.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2988\n\n (Purpose: To strike the provision authorizing oil and gas development \n  in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge while preserving a balanced \n                            budget by 2002)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Pursuant to the previous agreement, the Senator from \nMontana has submitted an amendment to the desk. I would hope that it \nwould be the time when we could let him offer that amendment, and I \nyield 30 seconds for that purpose to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is open to amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, do we have that amendment?\n  I do not believe we can proceed in this manner. I could not possibly \ntake 30 seconds in opposition because I do not have the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is at the desk.\n  Is the Senator from Montana calling up his amendment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Which number does the Senator call up?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is the ANWR amendment, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. OK, let us proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for himself, Mr. \n     Roth, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Biden, and Mr. \n     Lautenberg, proposes an amendment numbered 2988.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 272, strike line 21 and all that follows through \n     page 293, line 22.\n       On page 161, strike line 3 and all that follows through \n     page 178, line 7.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds on each side.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment strikes the provision \nopening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. To \noffset the loss of revenue from ANWR drilling and to keep the budget \nbalanced in 2002, the amendment also strikes the sale of the naval \npetroleum reserves.\n  Opening Arctic Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling will seriously disrupt \nprecious natural resources, will do nothing to enhance our energy \nindependence, and it will not generate the amount of revenue that the \nproponents claim.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this would increase the deficit by \nnearly $3 billion over the next 7 years. I think everybody knows the \nissue with reference to ANWR.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, we yield it back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. DOLE. Move to table.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, let me say to Senators who contemplate \noffering amendments that unless we have seen a copy of the amendment \nbefore you offer it, we are going to offer a second-degree amendment, \nbecause there is no way to state the case if we have never seen it. We \nhave three now that we have seen that are the next three. I am dealt \nthis process; I did not invent it, but we are stuck with it. We are \ngoing to make it as orderly as we can. I do not like the disorder that \nexists in the Senate, but I cannot do anything about it. I am not going \nto vote on an amendment that I have not seen. There will be a second-\ndegree offered and we will vote on that.\n  So get the amendments in. It is only in fairness to all of us. I \nyield back any time I have.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators will clear the well.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask for 30 seconds for an inquiry to the \nchairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, so that we can proceed in an orderly manner, \nthere is a second Baucus amendment regarding Medicare that I understand \nhas been delivered to that side, is that correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, this amendment strikes the provision of \nthe reconciliation bill that would open the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge up for oil drilling. As an offset, it strikes the provision of \nthe bill that authorizes the sale of the Naval Petroleum Reserve. So it \npreserves the balanced budget in 2002.\n  Let me explain why Members should support the amendment.\n  We've heard a lot of talk, during the budget debate, about the \nfuture. About how we should sacrifice today so that our children and \ngrandchildren can benefit tomorrow.\n  That's well and good. But opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nto oil drilling goes in exactly the opposite direction. It puts profits \nahead of prudence. As a result, it risks causing serious harm to one of \nour national treasures, squandering the natural resources that we leave \nto future generations.\n  And there's another thing. Opening the refuge to oil drilling is yet \nanother example of public lands policies that favor special interests \nover the interests of ordinary American families. It opens the Refuge \nup to drilling. At whose expense? The people who want to hunt, fish, \nand otherwise enjoy the natural beauty there.\n  Proponents of oil drilling argue that it will enhance our energy \nsecurity.\n  They argue that it will reduce the Nation's budget deficit. And they \nargue that it won't really pose significant risks to the refuge or its \nwildlife resources.\n  I disagree. Let me take the arguments in turn.\n  First, energy security. According to a 1995 assessment by the U.S. \nGeological Survey, oil and gas reserves under the refuge may be only \nabout half as large as previously thought. Furthermore, economic \nanalyses show that a lot of the oil won't even be used here in the \nUnited States. Instead, if the bills lifting the ban on oil exports \npassed by the House and Senate are enacted into law, the oil will be \nshipped overseas. As a result, oil drilling in the Arctic Wildlife \nRefuge has little, if anything, to do with energy security.\n  Second, the budget deficit. The Office of Management and Budget has \nconcluded that oil and gas development in the refuge would produce \nsignificantly less revenue than predicted by CBO. OMB looked at updated \nestimates of the amount of recoverable oil reserves. It looked at \nprojected oil prices. And OMB concluded that drilling likely would \ngenerate only $850 million, 35 percent less revenue than predicted by \nCBO.\n\n  And that assumes that taxpayers get the revenue. But if the State of \nAlaska successfully asserts a claim that it is entitled to 90 percent \nof all revenues, Federal revenues will decline to about $170 million.\n  Third, the environmental impact. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nis unique. It's been referred to, for good reason, as ``America's \nSerengeti.'' More than 150,000 caribou migrate through the refuge, \nbearing their young on the coastal plain. The caribou are an important \nsource of food for the native people who live near the refuge and \ndepend on the land to sustain their way of life. In addition, the \nrefuge supports a spectacular array of other wildlife, including polar \nbears, grizzly bears, wolves, and snow geese.\n  OMB has stated that ``exploration and development activities would \nbring physical disturbances to the area, unacceptable risks of oil \nspills and pollution, and long-term effects that would harm wildlife \nfor decades.''\n  Recent opinion polls demonstrate that the American people--by a \nmargin of more than 2 to 1--oppose opening up the refuge to oil and gas \ndevelopment. I urge members to vote for prudence and for open access to \npublic lands. I urge them to vote for this amendment.\n\n[[Page S 15993]]\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nreconciliation provision to open a small part of the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge to competitive leasing for oil and gas exploration and \ndevelopment. Like many of the other issues we have addressed on this \nfloor in the past ferw weeks, this issue has generated a lot of \nemotion. We hear about destroying the pristinity of the refuge, the \nthreat to the wildlife of the area, the irreversible changes that such \ndevelopment will cause, the mortal wounding of a national treasure. \nThis is one of the most controversial provisions of the reconciliation \npackage, and the President has threatened a veto over it. The irony is \nthat there is no reason for this. In the final measure, all of the \narguments and objections that have been raised over the leasing in ANWR \ncome to nothing. These objections just don't hold water, and I'll tell \nyou why.\n  The environmental concerns have been raised before, and found \nwanting. All of the research done on oil development on the North Slope \nproves that such development can occur without having an adverse effect \non wildlife. As a matter of fact, the caribou herds have not only \nsurvived during the nearly 30 years of oil development in the Prudhoe \nBay area, they have shown strong grown. Some people predicted that the \ncaribou would be disturbed by the development, particularly the \npipeline. They argued that the caribou would not cross it and therefore \nthe range of the herd would be cut in half, they would not be able to \nget to their calving areas and the herd would suffer. Because of the \nconcern over this possibility, the oil companies buried portions of the \npipeline at great expense and effort. This has proven to have been a \nwaste of time and money. The caribou were not scared by the pipeline, \nthey did not even ignore it. The fact it they use it. Biologists have \nfound that caribou enjoy the heat that the pipeline provides during the \ncold winter months, and they can even be found taking advantage of the \nshade that it provides during the summer on this treeless plain. Some \npredicted that caribou would be trapped by the pipeline, and that \npredators would change their behavior to take advantage of the \npipeline. But this has not happened either. There has been very little \neffect on the wolves or bears in the area. Some said that waterfowl and \nother birds such as hawks and falcons would avoid the area because of \nthe development. Again, this has not happened. Each year thousands of \nwaterfowl and other birds nest in the Prudhoe area. In fact, there has \nnever been a incident of what could even approach being called serious \nenvironmental damage in the North Slope oil fields.\n\n  This environmental record has been established using old \ntechnologies. The methods for oil development on the North Slope have \nimproved to the point that the direct impact area, or footprint of \ndevelopment, will only be a small part of what it has been at Prudhoe \nBay. New slant drilling techniques allow wells to reach farther than \nthey could before. Drilling methods now allow 12 wells to be drilled \nwhere only one could be drilled before. And the size of the drill pads \nhave been reduced to one eighth of what was needed at Prudhoe. Not only \nare the drill pads smaller, but there will be fewer of them and they \nwill be spaced farther apart than at Prudhoe. The actual footprint at \nANWR will only be about 3,000 acres. That is not much land to commit \nfor all of the benefits that development will provide. We have learned \nhow to improve other aspects of oil development technology through our \nexperiences at Prudhoe and other Arctic oil fields as well. And this \ntechnology is getting better every day. The result is that there is \neven less potential of environmental damage at ANWR than there was at \nPrudhoe. And there has not been any environmental damage at Prudhoe.\n  Objections have been raised because of the presumed effect on the \nnative peoples of the region. But the truth is that there is no \nconflict with the subsistence lifestyle of native Americans. The North \nSlope residents have grown up with oil development, and they have not \nsuffered a reduction on their reliance on the caribou herds. The people \nof Barrow have stated in hearings before the Senate that development \nhas improved their lives. It has provided them with the capability of \ndeveloping community services that other Americans take for granted. \nNorth Slope residents will be the most directly affected by oil \ndevelopment, and they support development of ANWR. And this is not \nbecause they have been bought off, bullied or coerced by the oil \nmoguls. They are not ignorant on this issue. The fact is that they have \nseen what oil development will do to their land. They have watched it \nfor almost three decades. And they know what it will not do. It will \nnot destroy the land that they love, like some people keep who have \nnever even seen the area keep trying to tell them. They know that.\n  The alternative energy argument is bogus as well. Sure, we need to \ndevelop alternative sources of energy. Sure, we need to continue to \nprogress and improve our use of resources. Sure, we want to become more \nenergy efficient. But there are no magic solutions. We are not going to \nreplace oil products in our economy overnight. Petroleum will continue \nto be a primary source of energy and other products for us in the \nforeseeable future. Millions of people are dependent on petroleum \nproducts, and anyone who thinks that this is going to change soon is \nbadly deceiving themselves. To supply this demand we are now importing \nmore oil than we are producing. Production of our older fields like \nPrudhoe Bay is declining. Without bringing new domestic supplies on \nline, this will only get worse. Petroleum is crucial to our way of \nlife, and we are becoming more dependent on the production of foreign \nnations, some much less stable than ours. If you want to know what this \nmeans to us, just think about what happened back in the seventies with \nthe oil cartel, or what might have happened if we had not stopped \nSaddam Hussein.\n\n  This raises the issue of the effect of development of ANWR on the \neconomy. Under our present situation with the trade and budget deficits \nthe economic argument is obvious. We need to open ANWR. There is no \nother conclusion. Leasing ANWR will benefit the economy in almost every \naspect. It will reduce the budget deficit by bringing over $1 billion \nto the Treasury over the next 5 years. It will reduce the trade deficit \nby reducing our dependence on foreign oil. That money will remain at \nhome to strengthen our own economy and provide good jobs to our own \ncitizens, jobs that are now going overseas. These are jobs that we \nneed. It will create over 75,000 directly related, high paying jobs in \nthe oil industry. It will create as many as three quarters of a million \nnew jobs, directly and indirectly, throughout the Nation. As a result \nof all of this, opening ANWR will stimulate other sectors of the \neconomy as well. Without opening ANWR all of this will be lost. And our \ntrade deficit will just get worse. We will be less able to pay our \ndebts.\n  The arguments of the outspoken interest groups on this issue anger \nme, not just because, like with Prudhoe Bay, they are untrue, and these \ngroups know it. What really angers me is the hypocracy of their \narguments. These people rely on oil products, just like everyone else. \nThey heat their homes and drive cars just like the rest of us. They use \nplastic products just like you and me. They take vacations and recreate \nusing planes and trains and boats just like everyone else. And yet they \nsomehow feel justified, in fact sanctimonious, about opposing our \ndevelopment of oil resources. This in spite of the fact that we have \nthe most environmentally sensitive laws in the world. We have the best \nrecord of being able to produce oil with the least environmental risk. \nThe reality is that we will continue to use oil products. Keeping ANWR \nis not going to reduce the demand for oil in this country, we will just \nimport what we need from other countries. For some irrational reason \nopponents would rather see us do that, would rather see the \nenvironmental degradation that happens in other countries, than see us \ndevelop our own resources under our tight environmental controls. They \nwould rather see the benefits of development go to other countries, \nthan allow those benefits to remain here at home. That is the hypocracy \nthat I find so distasteful. It has damaged us. It has damaged the \ncitizens of my State of Montana. And I look forward to this Congress \ndoing something about it, doing the right thing for the country, and \nopening ANWR to leasing.\n\n[[Page S 15994]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, America knows that drilling the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge to balance the budget is wrong. Common sense \nand a basic concern for the environment is all you need to come to this \nconclusion. Now all we have to do is convince the Senate of the right \nthing to do. I am disappointed at the difficulty of what should be a \nsimple task.\n  The refuge is one of a kind--in fact, it is the last of its kind. The \nAlaska National Wildlife Refuge is the only place we have left that \nresembles the kind of land that gave birth to our Nation centuries ago.\n  I wonder how many people realize that outside this chamber, 500 years \nago, the first Americans could hunt bison and elk in the open forests \non the banks of the Potomac. I wonder how many people remember that \noutside this building passenger pigeons used to roost in American \nchestnut trees, sometimes in flocks of thousands.\n  Today the bison and elk are gone, the passenger pigeon is extinct, \nand the American chestnut has been wiped out in this region by an \nexotic disease. The first Americans would not recognize this place.\n  Now we turn to a remote corner of our country, the last expanse of \ntrue wildness left, and Congress is saying ``we need that too--to \nbalance the budget.''\n  To me it takes only a simple sense of decency, respect and history to \nknow that drilling ANWR is the wrong thing to do, but there are many \nother reasons that support the American public's opposition to this \nprovision.\n  First of all, drilling for oil in Alaska is just a tiny drop in the \ndeficit bucket. The leasing revenues will contribute only one-fifth of \n1 percent of the budget gap, provided the residents of Alaska do not \nsue for a 90 percent share of the royalties. Even the $1.3 billion \nrevenue estimate is flawed because it assumes we will make about $30 a \nbarrel when the rest of the world is actually paying only $20 a barrel. \nAdd to that the fact that the production estimates are outdated, and it \nis clear that we are selling the orchard for an apple.\n  Second, we should ask ourselves why the residents of the other 49 \nStates should chip in to support Alaska's welfare state. Alaska is a \nState that collects no income tax, collects no sales tax, pays each \nman, woman and child almost $1,000 a year just for being there, has $18 \nbillion in the bank, and enjoys the highest Federal spending per \ncapita. And now the State has come to Congress to ask the American \npeople to dedicate another $1.3 billion to support their welfare state.\n  Third, we have to look at the huge environmental cost of lacing the \narctic plain with truck roads, gravel drill pads, and pipelines. Some \nargue that Prudhoe Bay proves that drilling can be done in an \nenvironmentally sound way. But what is so environmentally benign about \n500 oil spills a year, air pollution that exceeds the total emissions \nof six States, pushing millions of gallons through a rapidly \ndeteriorating pipeline, and littering 9,402 acres of arctic tundra with \noil rigs and roads? Prudhoe Bay does not have a track record to \nemulate.\n  The Senate should also consider the impact of oil wells on wildlife \nand people that use the refuge. The coastal plain is the cradle of life \nfor birds that migrate from four different continents, 160,000 caribou \nthat migrate between nations, polar bears, musk ox, grizzly bears, and \nthe Gwich'in Indians. The global significance of the resource is \nrecognized in international agreements including the 1987 Canada-United \nStates Agreement on the Conservation of the Porcupine Caribou Herd and \nthe Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears. The Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge is, after all, supposed to be refuge for wildlife, not \na refuge for desperate Senators looking to fund a tax cut.\n  Fifth, we should recognize the parody of drilling for 90 days worth \nof oil to reduce our dependence on oil. It is like curing an alcoholic \nby serving him vodka instead of his usual whiskey. National security is \nnot served by simply defering our dependence on foreign oil for a mere \n90 days. If this same Congress had funded the President's budget for \nenergy conservation and efficiency and refused to gut efficiency \nstandards with environmental riders we would have saved more oil than \ncould be drilled in ANWR. Energy conservation is not a quick fix, it \nsticks with us for good.\n  Sixth, I object to the backdoor process to that is being used to pass \na law that could not survive the light of day. Drilling for oil in the \nAlaska Wildlife Refuge has been a controversial issue for almost 10 \nyears. This is not a reason to sneak it into the budget resolution \nthrough a legislative trick.\n  Finally, the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge is an American treasure \nthat does not belong to us. It is the heritage of our country. Just as \nVermonters recognize a responsibility to pass on a clean Lake \nChamplain, our best trout streams, and the Green Mountain National \nForest to future generations, Vermonters recognize a responsibility to \npass on North America's Arctic plain to future generations.\n  Despite overwhelming public oppostion, this bill trades an American \ntreasure for $1.3 billion, a mere trinket in a trillion dollar package. \nWe can not let this Congress drill ANWR to balance the budget. I urge \nbi-partisan support of this amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Baucus \namendment to strike the provision in the Energy Committee's \nreconciliation instructions which opens the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge to oil drilling activity.\n  The Arctic Wildlife Refuge is one of this Nation's last great \nwilderness areas. I have often said that we must forge an environmental \nethic in our society--that we must preserve America's natural treasures \nfor generations to come. We are the stewards of this land. We are the \nones responsible for ensuring that some part of our planet remains for \nour children.\n  Protecting our wilderness yields benefits in ways that we do not \nalways see. Scientists will tell you that a vast amount of the \nmedicines that we take for granted today were first discovered in \nnature. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is unique among America's \ndiverse climate. The secrets this unspoiled land holds may well provide \nus with benefits beyond what any of us can imagine now.\n  Some would have us believe that this is just an economic issue. I \nwould disagree based on the hundreds of letters and phone calls I have \nreceived from Marylanders who are concerned about opening this land to \ndrilling. I have heard from the native people, both in the United \nStates and Canada, whose culture and livelihoods depend on the caribou \nthat breed within the confines of the refuge. Opening this precious \nland to oil drilling will wipe these timeless cultures out.\n   Mr. President, I, for one, am not willing to do that. I am not \nwilling to destroy the lives of thousands of native villagers just so \nthat the oil industry can turn a larger profit next year than it did \nthis year.\n  I urge my colleagues to support removing this dangerous provision \nfrom this bill and vote for the Baucus amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, a financial debt is not the only threat that \nhangs over the heads of future generations. There is a threat to their \nenvironment, as well. A threat we must address. We have a moral duty to \ngive them a world that has clean water and clean air, and open vistas \nwhere wildlife can thrive. One of the opportunities of every American \ncitizen is to enjoy the wealth of beautiful public lands.\n  It is my desire that as we work through this budget reconciliation we \ntake great care not to jeopardize one of the most spectacular places in \nAmerica: the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. \nThere is a provision in the budget that provides for oil and gas lease \nsales in this sanctuary. Located in the northeastern corner of Alaska, \nthis unique piece of our natural heritage is bordered on the north by \nthe Arctic Ocean and Beaufort Sea, and on the south by the snow-capped \nBrooks Range.\n  As a lead sponsor of S. 428, the bill that designates the coastal \nplain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness area, I am \nconcerned by a provision in this budget reconciliation bill that uses \nrevenues taken from sales of leases to drill the coastal plain.\n  My concern arises on two levels: first, that the budget is assuming \nrevenue from a pristine wilderness area; and second, that the revenue \nraised from drilling in this wilderness area \n\n[[Page S 15995]]\nwill not amount to be such a significant amount of money that it could \neasily be found elsewhere.\n   Mr. President, as I have said before, the best thing we have learned \nfrom nearly 500 years of contact with the American wilderness is \nrestraint, the need to stay our hand and preserve our precious \nenvironment and future resources rather than destroy them for momentary \ngain.\n  For this reason, I have been active in the effort to designate the \nrefuge coastal plain of Alaska as a wilderness area. And I am not \nalone. Only 4 years ago, Congress rejected the idea of sacrificing a \nprime part of our national heritage, the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, for what most likely will be a minimal supply of oil. The \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge is an invaluable region with wildlife \ndiversity that has been compared to Africa's Serengeti.\n  As I have said in earlier statements, the Alaskan wilderness area is \nnot only a critical part of our earth's ecosystem--the last remaining \nregion where the complete spectrum of arctic and subarctic ecosystems \ncomes together--but it is a vital part of our national consciousness. \nIt is a place we can cherish and visit for our soul's good. It offers \nus a sense of well-being and promises that not all dreams have been \ndreamt.\n  The Alaskan wilderness is a place of outstanding wildlife, \nwilderness, and recreation, a land dotted by beautiful forests, \ndramatic peaks and glaciers, gentle foothills and undulating tundra. It \nis untamed--rich with Caribou, polar bear, grizzly, wolves, musk oxen, \nDall sheep, moose, and hundreds of thousands of birds--snow geese, \ntundra sands, black brant, and more. In all, about 165 species use the \ncoastal plain. It is an area of intense wildlife activity. Animals give \nbirth, nurse and feed their young, and set about the critical business \nof fueling up for winters of unspeakable severity.\n  Addressing my second concern--that the revenue raised from drilling \nin this wilderness area will not result in such a significant amount of \nmoney that it could not be found elsewhere--let me say that the \nestimated revenue is only two tenths of 1 percent of the total savings.\n  And that is why I am here today, to support the Baucus amendment that \nwill prohibit the leasing of the coastal plain of ANWR to pay for \ndeficit reduction.\n  This amendment is consistent with the current law--with the dictates \nof Congress--law that prohibits oil and gas drilling in the coastal \nplain of ANWR. It is also consistent with agreements that we have made \nwith Canada to preserve and protect this wilderness area, especially \nthe habitat and culture of the native people who live in the area.\n  This amendment prevents oil and gas leasing in the coastal plain of \nANWR without hearings in Congress. It does not preclude future \ndevelopment of this area, but only prevents Congress from using these \nsavings from oil and gas leasing in the current budget process.\n  The coastal plain--where the oil and gas leasing would occur--is the \nbiological heart and the center of wildlife activity in the refuge. It \nis a critical part of our Nation's preeminent wilderness and would be \ndestroyed by oil development.\n  There are those who may think the northern coast of Alaska is too \nremote for use to worry about. I urge them to read the Congressional \nRecords from the 1870's. The men who initially urged the Congress to \nprotect a place called Yellowstone were subject to ridicule. Why, \ncritics asked, should we forgo the opportunity to dig up minerals from \nthe area? It is a remote place, and few Americans will ever venture \nthere.\n  Today, as we wrestle with America's future, let us be as far-sighted \nas that Congress eventually proved to be. Let us not cash in a unique \npiece of America for a brief, hoped for a rush of oil. Let us protect \nthe coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Forever.\n  Mr. President, I believe that we should not allow revenues to be used \nin this budget that are supposed to come from doing something that \nCongress has not allowed.\n  This is how is should be done. The Baucus amendment accomplishes this \npurpose. And I encourage my colleagues to support this important \neffort.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for this \namendment, which will help ensure continued protection for the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge.\n  The issue of whether or not to allow oil drilling along the Arctic \ncoastal plain has been lobbied heavily for years. I have listened \ncarefully to the various arguments made by my colleagues, by \nrepresentatives of the oil industry, by a delegation of Gwich'in people \nwho inhabit the area in question, by members of the Arctic Slope \nRegional Corporation who are veterans of North Slope oil production, by \nenvironmentalists, and by the public at large. I appreciate the strong \nfeelings this debate evokes.\n  The fate of ANWR is far reaching. It involves national and State \neconomics, environmental and social values, and the relationship \nbetween the Federal and State government.\n  Anyone who has visited Alaska knows that the stakes for Alaskans are \nhigh. The State and its people depend heavily on oil revenues, and its \nleaders are sensitive to, and have experience with, the potential \nenvironmental tradeoffs of oil development.\n  This issue has come before Congress in the past. I have consistently \nopposed opening ANWR during those debates. I remain strongly opposed to \ndisrupting this unique and fragile habitat for the purposes of oil \ndrilling today.\n  Most opponents of opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge cite \nthe potential environmental tradeoffs of drilling in this fragile \necosystem. I appreciate and share that concern.\n  As I have said in the past, I take seriously the national obligation \nembodied in the Alaska lands bill to ensure that these remote 19 \nmillion acres continue to achieve their purpose of providing a refuge \nfor wildlife. There is no other place in America or in the world where \ncaribou, polar bears, and wild geese flourish as they do in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge. And, as we know from both history and recent \nscientific study, once one component of an ecosystem is adversely \naffected, then the entire system can become effected by a chain \nreaction.\n  Declining populations of polar bears, birds, and caribou, and the \nanimals and Native American communities that depend on them, is a valid \nfear. A recent article in the Anchorage Daily News reports that the \nCentral Arctic caribou herd that inhabits Prudhoe Bay has suffered a 23 \npercent reduction from 23,400 to 18,000 animals in just the last 3 \nyears. Although it is difficult to determine the exact reason for this \nmarked decline, the part of the herd that ranges near the oil drilling \nactivity has experienced almost all of the losses.\n  Nonetheless, the debate over the future of ANWR should not be framed \nas it all too often is as a face off between elitist environmentalists \nand rapacious developers. It is also a debate about national energy \npolicy and national values.\n  It is particularly hard to justify opening the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge to oil drilling, with all the industrial activity and \nassociated disruption that would involve, when the probability of \nfinding oil is so low. Moreover, even if oil were to be found, the \npotential oil reserve in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would at \nmost sustain our country's basic petroleum needs for a mere 6 months. \nClearly, then, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is not the answer to \nachieving independence from foreign oil supplies.\n  Meanwhile, this perpetuation of our national love affair with \nhydrocarbon fuel has other downsides. Our profligate energy consumption \ncripples our international competitiveness, pollutes our air and \nbeaches, and increases the trade deficit. We must take serious steps to \nmake ourselves more energy-efficient and to conserve energy whenever \nand wherever possible. And we should better develop our domestic \nrenewable energy supplies like ethanol and renewable methanol.\n  Mr. President, last week, representatives of the petroleum, natural \ngas, automotive, ethanol, and engineering industries met in Washington \nat the World Conference on Transportation Fuel Quality to review the \nprogress made in just the past few years with reformulating gasoline as \nrequired in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Today, approximately \none-third of all the gasoline sold in the United States \n\n[[Page S 15996]]\ncontains noncrude oil-derived additives called oxygenates, primarily \nethers and ethanol from grain. EPA has called the reformulated gasoline \nprogram the most significant automobile pollution reduction advance \nsince the removal of lead. The pollution reductions achieved this year \namount to the equivalent of taking 8 million cars off the road.\n  What is little recognized, however, is that the reformulated gasoline \nprogram is also the most significant crude oil reduction program ever \ninstituted. The Congressional Research Service has concluded that it \ncould reduce U.S. oil requirements by 500,000 barrels or more per day, \nand that it represents the most significant means of reducing oil \nimports in the near to mid-term of any other approach.\n  Even more exciting is the fact that if the proposal to have a ``49 \nState Fuel''--in other words, a nationwide RFG standard--is adopted, \nU.S. oil requirements could be reduced by over 1.5 million barrels per \nday, or more than 20 percent of our daily gasoline demand. At an \naverage $20 per barrel, this would mean that nearly $11 billion \nannually would remain in the United States rather than be exported to \nforeign oil producers.\n  This alternative far overshadows the benefits to the Nation of \nopening ANWR. It also carries with it the additional advantage of more \ndiversified job creation, and the ongoing benefits of stimulating \nrenewable fuel technologies that cannot be depleted as is the case with \nfinite oil fields.\n  I believe the case for continuing to protect the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge from oil drilling is strong. Drilling would risk the \necological health of the coastal plain for a relatively small and \nspeculative supply. And, from a national energy policy standpoint, it \nmakes more sense to look to energy conservation and the development of \nrenewable fuels than to seek new reserves of fossil fuels in the Arctic \ncoastal plain.\n  For most Americans, opposition to oil drilling in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge is more profound than the mere sum of these concrete \narguments might suggest. Our country has a revered tradition of \nprotecting its natural heritage. Through our system of State parks, \nnational parks, wilderness areas, and wildlife refuges, Americans have \nbeen in the forefront of conservation, articulating and enforcing a \nland ethic that embodies the best impulses of our Nation. We have \nalways had a clear sense in this country of the natural heritage that \nmakes our lives so special and worthwhile, and we have been willing to \ntake tangible steps to protect that heritage.\n  Robert Kennedy, in a speech delivered only 3 months before his death, \nspoke at the University of Kansas on the measure of America's worth. He \nnoted that too often we pay attention only to the bottom line and judge \npolicies only on their contribution to the gross national product, and \nthat in using that simple measure, we fail to account for that which \nmakes life in America so special. He stated that--and I quote:\n\n       [The] GNP counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, \n     and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage. It counts \n     special locks for our doors and the jails for those who break \n     them. It counts the destruction of our redwoods and the loss \n     of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. . . . It measures \n     neither our wit nor our courage; neither our wisdom nor our \n     learning; neither our compassion, nor our devotion to \n     country; it measures everything, in short, except that which \n     makes life worthwhile.\n\n  For most Americans, who will never have a chance to see the Arctic \ncoastal plain and witness the thundering herds of caribou in their \nannual migration, or watch a wolf run down a ptarmigan, the simple \nknowledge that this special and unique place will remain unspoiled by \nthe heavy footprint of industry will make life richer and more \nworthwhile. It will also encourage us to invest in domestic \nalternatives, such as more efficient end-use technologies and new \nstrategies for energy conservation--alternatives that have positive \nenvironmental effects and which make us more economically competitive \nin the international marketplace. The route toward energy independence \nlies down the road of energy conservation and efficiency, and I \nbelieve, greater use of domestic renewable fuels. It does not lie down \nthe road of more consumption of fossil fuels.\n  This vote is as much a test of our common sense as it is of our \ncommon character. We are setting national priorities in this budget, \npriorities that should reflect our deepest and most closely held \nvalues. If we allow this wild and unspoiled refuge to become yet \nanother monument to avarice and addiction to fossil fuels, then we will \nhave lost more than a single wildlife refuge in a remote land; we will \nhave sacrificed part of our character, that intangible part of each of \nus that values the gentle and respectful treatment of our natural \nheritage and from which we derive a profound sense of national worth.\n  If we set this precedent, if we vote to open this remote refuge to \noil drilling, then we will have defeated the better part of ourselves. \nCollectively, we will have failed this important test of national \ncharacter.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and vote to protect \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, since I first came to the Senate I have \nbeen active in the fight to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nfrom oil and gas drilling. I intend to continue the fight to save the \nArctic Refuge as we debate the reconciliation bill in the Senate.\n  The Senate reconciliation bill contains a number of provisions that \nare poor policy, that are unfair to those least able to defend \nthemselves, and that consider only short-term gain and not long-term \nloss; the proposed plan to open the Arctic Refuge to gas and oil \ndrilling is one such provision. Since I have been in the Senate I have \nspoken time and time again about the fact that this is poor energy \npolicy, poor environmental policy, and cynical politicking.\n  The Arctic Refuge is one of the last pristine wilderness areas left \nin America, it contains the Nation's most significant polar bear \ndenning hibitat on land, supports 300,000 snow geese, migratory birds \nfrom six continents--some of those birds even make it to my State of \nMinnesota, and a concentrated porcupine caribou calving ground.\n  While proponents of drilling in the Arctic Refuge will tell you that \nthe caribou are not harmed by drilling, an October 21, 1995 article in \nthe Anchorage Daily News reports that new information shows a sharp \ndecline in the Central Arctic caribou herd. While nobody knows exactly \nwhat caused the decline, most of it has occurred in the part of the \nherd that lives near the oil field. Despite our uncertainty about the \neffects oil drilling would have on the animals, there are those who \ncontinue to push for oil drilling without an update environmental \nimpact statement [EIS] as required by current law. An EIS has not been \ndone in the area since 1987. We just do not know what drilling would do \nto the Arctic Refuge, and barreling ahead with drilling is just poor \nenvironmental policy.\n  The Gwich'in people have relied on those porcupine caribou for \nthousands of years to provide their food and meet their spiritual \nneeds. I have heard them speak very eloquently and directly about what \noil drilling in the Arctic Refuge would do to their way of life. People \nlike the Gwich'in want to save the environment. But they are not the \nbig oil companies. They do not have the money. They do not have the \nlobbyists, and they do not have the lawyers here every day. In today's \nWashington environment, that seems to mean that their concerns are less \nimportant than the concerns of big industry.\n  Even if whatever amount of revenue gained were somehow worth \ndestroying this unique land and the lives of the Gwich'in, there are a \nnumber of questions regarding whether the Arctic Refuge has oil, how \nmuch it has and what the cost would be to retrieve it. Estimates are \nbroad and disagreements are rampant. Even I, a nonscientist, know one \nthing for certain: There is no way to tell how much revenue can be \ngained from drilling in the Arctic Refuge. New information, however, \nsuggests previous figures overestimated possible revenue.\n  Alice Rivlin, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, stated \nin an October 25 letter that drilling in the Arctic Refuge would \nproduce ``significantly less revenue than has been scored by the \nCongressional Budget Office.'' New studies suggest there is less oil \nthan previously thought, the price of oil as projected by the \nDepartment \n\n[[Page S 15997]]\nof Energy has dropped and serious concerns remain about whether Alaska \nwill stage a court battle to change their share of the revenue from 50 \npercent to 90 percent as the State claims its statehood act allows. \nRegardless of who is right, barreling ahead with incomplete information \nand short-term thinking is just plain poor energy policy.\n  The administration has indicated that if the bill includes drilling \nin the Arctic Refuge, the President will veto it. I would \nwholeheartedly support him if he did.\n  Throughout the course of my years of work to save the Arctic Refuge, \nI have heard from many Minnesotans, including many children, about \ntheir desire to preserve it. Our natural resources are among the most \nimportant things we can leave to these future generations. Our children \nand our grandchildren deserve more than what this bad energy policy, \nbad environmental policy, and shortsighted politicking would leave \nthem. I will continue to speak for all Minnesotans, for their sense of \nfairness and equity and for their love and concern for the environment. \nI will continue to fight to save the Arctic Refuge from gas and oil \ndrilling. I urge my colleagues to join me.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this \namendment to protect our children's heritage. I rise because this \nbudget reconciliation debate should be about revenues. It should be \nabout how much we have and how much we spend. The Arctic Refuge coastal \nplain is not about money; it is about values. It is a question of \nwhether we are willing to trade off wilderness and wildlife that are \nour national heritage and legacy for our children, in order to make a \nshort-term payment on bills we have accumulated.\n  Future generations will look back on what we might do today with \nsadness. They will not see this as a matter of shared sacrifice, but as \na mark of the selfishness of a generation which, to pay off a minuscule \nfraction of its debts, sacrificed the inheritance of future \ngenerations. Let me explain the several other reasons why I support \nthis amendment.\n  First, leasing the Refuge does not result in a significant return of \nmoney to the Federal Treasury. If the dubious assumptions of the Budget \nCommittee prove correct, the leasing revenues would be a mere two-\ntenths of 1 percent of our budget gap. If we lease this unique Arctic \nwilderness that has been called America's Serengeti, it would be \npermanently destroyed. For most Americans, trading our natural wealth \nin the Arctic Refuge wilderness for the possibility of oil is not worth \nit.\n  Even worse, there is little assurance that the leasing revenues would \nbe at the level assumed by the Budget Committee. Other highly \nprospective leases nearby in Alaska have been made at considerably less \nper acre. Lease sales in the Beaufort Sea, immediately offshore the \nArctic Refuge, received only $33 to $153 per acre; the most recent \nonshore State lease sale, located west of the refuge, brought in just \n$48.41 per acre. This budget provision assumes an astounding $1,733 per \nacre if the entire coastal plain is leased.\n  Furthermore, the State of Alaska, not the Federal Government, is \nlikely to reap a significant amount of the financial benefit of the \nleases. The Budget Committee assumes that only 50 percent of the \nleasing proceeds will go to the State of Alaska. However, Alaska \ncurrently receives 90 percent of the leasing revenues from Federal \nlands. It is unlikely that the citizens of Alaska--who receive annual \ndividend checks of nearly $1,000--would willingly forfeit proceeds they \nbelieve they are due; a lawsuit to recover the difference would be much \nmore likely.\n  Second, the public could lose access to this remarkable area. A \nhandful of major oil companies stand not only to make enormous profits, \nbut to have the right to exclude the rest of us from their leased \nrefuge lands. Today, public access in the Prudhoe Bay oil fields is \nstrictly prohibited without an oil company escort. So hikers, rafters, \nfishers, hunters, and solitude seekers will likely be excluded from \ntheir Arctic Refuge. One more wild place will be closed.\n  Third, the Budget Committee suggests that the square acreage impacted \nby oil and gas leasing would be relatively small. However, this area is \nthe biological heart of the refuge. It is the most coveted by oil \ncompanies and the most critical for wildlife. The coastal plain is an \nintegral part of the only conservation area in North America that \nprotects a full spectrum of Arctic and sub-Arctic ecosystems. While \nonly 13,000 acres would be affected, the wilderness in the entire \ncoastal plain would be impacted by oil development. The massive \nindustrial complex would not be in a compact area, but would sprawl \nover hundreds of square miles in a network of roads, pipelines, \nairports, and processing plants.\n  Fourth, budget reconciliation is the wrong place to decide such an \nimportant issue. We should have a full and fair airing of all views \nabout the leasing of our Arctic Refuge. Money is not the only value we \nshould consider. Before we drill holes and pave portions of the refuge, \nwe should consider all of its value, not just its infinitesimal \ncontribution to the budget deficit. I believe its sponsors know that \nthey could not win in the light of full debate. A massive spending bill \nprovides them the cover of darkness that they know they must have to \nwin.\n  In closing, I quote the great writer and naturalist Margaret Murie, \n``Wilderness itself is the basis of all of our civilization. I wonder \nif we have enough reverence for life to concede to wilderness the right \nto live on?''\n  I will cast my vote to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--\nfor wilderness and for my children.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, my amendment would reallocate the tax \ncredits in the reconciliation bill toward the middle-income taxpayers \nand apply the savings to reduce the Medicare spending cuts. It \nspecifically strikes capital gains for corporations and gives some \nrelief for individuals who make capital gains over $100,000 a year. It \nis geared more toward the million-dollar income taxpayers.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment adds new language. It is \nnot germane and is subject to a point of order.\n  I make a point of order that this amendment violates the Budget Act.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act \nfor the consideration of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays on the motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The \npoint of order is well-taken and the amendment is rejected.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. \n\n[[Page S 15998]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2995\n\n  (Purpose: To provide that the repeal of the exclusion for punitive \ndamages shall not apply to punitive damages in a wrongful death action \n in a State where on September 13, 1995, only punitive damages may be \n                       awarded in such an action)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. Heflin, \n     for himself and Mr. Shelby, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2995.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 1773, strike line 24, and insert the following:\n       (c) Special Rule for States in Which Only Punitive Damages \n     May Be Awarded in Wrongful Death Actions.--Section 104 is \n     amended by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (d) and \n     by inserting after the subsection (b) the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(c) Restriction on Punitive Damages Not to Apply in \n     Certain Cases.--The restriction on the application of \n     subsection (a)(2) to punitive damages shall not apply to \n     punitive damages awarded in a civil action--\n       ``(1) which is a wrongful death action, and\n       ``(2) with respect to which applicable State law (as in \n     effect on September 13, 1995 and without regard to any \n     modification after such date) provides, or has been construed \n     to provide by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a \n     decision issued on or before September 13, 1995, that only \n     punitive damages may be awarded in such an action.\n\n     This subsection shall cease to apply to any civil action \n     filed on or after the first date on which the applicable \n     State law ceases to provide (or is no longer construed to \n     provide) the treatment described in paragraph (2).''\n       (d) Effective Date.--\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, in my State of Alabama, the courts have \nconsistently held that the damages recoverable under the wrongful death \nstatute are punitive as distinguished from actual or compensatory \ndamages. For the past 140 years, the Alabama Supreme Court has \ninterpreted this statute as imposing punitive damages for any conduct \nwhich causes death, regardless of the degree of negligence or \ncapability. The premise for this interpretation is the belief that all \npeople are worth the same, and this interpretation stimulates diligence \nin protection of natural right to live, without respect to personal \ncondition or disability of the person so protected. Breed v. Atlanta, B \n& CRR, 241 Ala. 640, 4 So.2d 315 (1941). Therefore, the entire focus of \na wrongful death civil action in Alabama is on the cause of the death.\n  The amendment I am offering provides that punitive damage awards made \nin wrongful death cases should not be included in gross income Alabama \nwhere only punitive damages can be recovered for a wrongful death. \nTaking into account the revenue aspects of the Finance Committee \nprovision, I have narrowly drafted this amendment.\n  This amendment would only effect my State of Alabama. Of all the 50 \nStates, Alabama has a different and unique recovery in the event a \ndecision is made by a court or jury in regard to the death of an \nindividual, whether it be brought by negligence or any form of action. \nA person cannot prove, in a wrongful death case in Alabama, \ncompensatory damages. An Alabama plaintiff cannot show his wages, his \ndoctor bills, or anything similar of an economic or noneconomic nature. \nTherefore the award granted in such a case would be fully taxable by \nthe Internal Revenue Service. For this reason I see the tax effect of \nthe current provision as unfair to those Alabama victims and their \nfamilies and the amendment as an equitable solution.\n  I strongly support this amendment. I think it is the correct language \nto narrowly address what would be an intolerable tax burden on the \ngrieving families of Alabama victims who are killed by negligence or by \ngross negligence or recklessness or wantonness or any type of proof \nthat is necessary to prove a cause of action. I think the Senate ought \nto adopt this fair and equitable amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will take the 30 seconds allowed to explain this \namendment.\n  This is agreed to on both sides. It is for the two Senators from \nAlabama and it relates only to an 1852 statute with reference to \ndamages for wrongful deaths--civil damages for wrongful death. It will \ncorrect a very old law.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we have checked. We have found no objections \non our side. If there are any, I would like to hear them at this time.\n  Hearing none, I yield back the balance of our time. We support the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2995) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, do you have an amendment on your side?\n  Mr. EXON. I yield to Senator Kennedy for an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 30 seconds.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2996\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit balance billing by providers participating in \n                         Medicare choice plans)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment will maintain provisions \nof current law that protect Medicare beneficiaries who join a Medicare \nHMO or other private insurance plans under the new Medicare choice \nprogram from excess charges by physicians or other providers. All we \nare saying is what is the current law today will be the current law \ntomorrow in terms of the HMO's or other health delivery systems. That \nprotection is not included in the legislation that is before us. This \nwill provide that kind of protection for the seniors of this country. \nIt is absolutely necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Massachusetts or the \nSenator from Nebraska send that amendment to the desk?\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2996.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the dispensing of the \nreading of the amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 469, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n       ``(g) Prohibition of Balance Billing.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, an individual who is enrolled in a \n     medicare choice plan under this part shall not be liable for \n     a provider's charges for items or services furnished under \n     the plan if such charges are in excess of the copayments, \n     coinsurance, and deductibles required by such plan in \n     accordance with subsection (c).\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I gather Senator Kennedy has spoken to \nthe amendment. We are not going to give him double time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand the amendment before us \ndoes nothing to change the prohibition on balance billing in the \ntraditional Medicare Program. It does not extend price controls to the \nprivate Medicare choice plans. In short, the Finance Committee thinks \nthey did a good job on this and there is no need for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been consumed. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, at the suggestion of the majority \nleader, I ask that after this vote we have a quorum call to last until \n1 o'clock, and that be for purposes of Senators getting some \n\n[[Page S 15999]]\nrelief from the floor and perhaps getting more of the amendments \nprepared so we can know what we are doing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, so that we can give staff on each side time \nto sort of bring the amendments together in some order on each side so \nwe will know precisely where we are--it makes it very difficult if we \nare not quite certain, and if we have not seen the amendment--I think \nwe can save time by taking a brief recess now to give them that \nopportunity.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that we stand in recess until the hour of \n1:20 p.m. and that when we come back we resume voting immediately after \nreconvening with 7\\1/2\\-minute votes, the same as we have now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will just use a minute of my leader's \ntime.\n  I am now advised that there are at least 40 amendments on the other \nside that will be offered, after we were at least hopeful yesterday and \nwe agreed to have up-and-down amendments on tier 1. We will probably \nend up with maybe 25 tier 3 amendments. We have already disposed of a \nnumber. So it seems we are going to exceed almost up to 50 amendments \nin that category.\n  If you just took the votes themselves, you allowed 10 minutes, that \nis 400 minutes. That is 7 hours. I am not going to stick around here \nvery long tonight, but I am very happy to come back early tomorrow \nmorning. We will go along and see how many of these--we have 13 over \nhere, so that is another couple hours. So if that is what we want to \ndo, we will have plenty of time this weekend to do it. We are going to \ndo it this weekend, but we are not going to stay up half the night to \naccommodate somebody who has to be somewhere tomorrow.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Senator Kennedy has an amendment that we would like to \nbring up at this time, so I yield him the 30 seconds to explain his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Will the Senator please send the amendment to \nthe desk.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I raise a point of order that section 7171, raising the \nage of Medicare eligibility, violates section 313(b)(1)(a) of the \nCongressional Budget Act.\n  It has been submitted to the Budget Committee, so I make that point \nof order at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could have order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senate please come to order so we can \nhear the amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the reconciliation bill raises the \nMedicare age of eligibility to 67 beginning in the year 2003.\n  While the reconciliation provision is described as conforming to the \nSocial Security change enacted in 1983, it has significant differences. \nIndividuals affected by the Social Security change had a minimum of 20 \nyears to adjust their retirement plans, while individuals affected by \nthis change have only 7 years. Social Security change continued to \nallow individuals to receive benefits at 62.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts must send his \namendment to the desk.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask that the Budget Committee, where I submitted it--\nif I could have their attention, please.\n  As I understand, the point of order was sustained, so I wonder why I \nneed to send something----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a time limit of 30 seconds on \nthe amendment. And if the amendment is not at the desk, the Senator \ndoes not have any time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I made the point of order. It was sustained.\n  I ask, in place of sending the amendment, that I be entitled to the \nsame amount of time to speak on the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senator has prevailed.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He has prevailed.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I just say, if we are going to be taken off our feet \nwhen the parliamentary situation is not clear, we will be staying \naround for a long time.\n  I am asking for fairness, for the 30 seconds we were entitled to, \nthat I was told I am entitled to by the Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nhave an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Social Security change continued to \nallow individuals to receive benefits at age 62; the age of early \nretirement, and age 65, the normal retirement age, although at reduced \nlevels.\n  Under this proposal, no Medicare benefits at all will be provided \nuntil the individual is 67. The provision breaks faith with American \nworkers who paid into the Medicare system in the expectation they will \nbe provided health security at the age of 65 and will leave millions of \nsenior citizens without health insurance coverage.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hope----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I hope for purposes of management that Senators on our \nside would leave it up to one of us, either the leader or I, in terms \nof asking \n\n[[Page S 16000]]\nthat people be recognized or granted time. I understand the Senator, \nbut I hope in the future the Senator will leave that up to us. He has \nprevailed. We had no intention of stopping him. So I think this matter \nis over. We yield back any time we might have had on the point of \norder. It has already been granted.\n  The next amendment, I understand, is on our side by Senator Cochran.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3004\n\n   (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a \nspecial marketing order to equalize returns on all milk used to produce \n Class IV final products, to consent to the Northeast Interstate Dairy \n  Compact, and to require the Secretary to carry out an agricultural \n                      competitiveness initiative)\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for himself and \n     Mr. Jeffords, proposes an amendment numbered 3004.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment helps farmers and markets \nadjust to the changes in Federal dairy policy in this bill. It does so \nby creating an export class for dairy products and establishing a \nfarmer-financed mechanism to boost exports. It saves money and provides \nfor research to make our products more competitive.\n  It will also grant the consent of Congress to the Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact, which is supported by all the Governors and \nlegislatures in New England.\n  I urge Senators to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 30 seconds has expired.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues Senator Cochran, \nSenator Leahy, Senator Gorton, Senator Cohen, and Senator Snowe in \nsupporting the creation of an export class for dairy products, and \ngranting the consent of Congress to the Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact. This amendment is vital to the future of the New England dairy \nindustry and the national dairy industry as a whole.\n  Mr. President, the Senate reconciliation bill cuts the cost of the \ndairy program by 49 percent over the next 7 years. This comes on top of \na reduction of 69 percent in the last decade. While the dairy industry \nis willing to accept some cuts, and I realize the need to cut, the \nindustry has already pulled its load. As it stands, this bill does not \naddress the critical need to increase sales of butter and nonfat dry \nmilk in the world market.\n  As the support price for butter and nonfat dry milk are eliminated, \ntheir prices will fall and cause a glut of those products. This surplus \nwill either be cleared on the world market at a very reduced price, or \nbe converted into cheese. In either case, this will case a substantial \ndrag on the return to dairy farmers and manufacturers of these \nproducts. This amendment will expand U.S. dairy markets by providing a \nway for all producers to share the cost of moving those products to the \nexport market. It is GATT-legal, plus will reduce U.S. reliance on \nexport subsidies.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the conversion from \npowder to cheese will increase Commodity Credit Corporation purchases \nby $230 million. This amendment will help farmers and taxpayers--by \nensuring dairy products will be exported instead of being purchased by \nthe Government.\n  This amendment will also grant consent to the Northeast Interstate \nDairy Compact, an agreement among the six New England States to create \na commission that will have the authority to oversee the pricing for \nfluid milk produced in the New England region. The compact will not \naffect milk prices outside the compact region. In fact, it will act as \na useful pilot project for other regions, and is strongly supported by \nmany groups and individuals across the country.\n  Mr. President, the New England States have joined together to do what \nmany States do already on their own. If America had grown from west to \neast I would not be standing here because New England would likely be \none large State and would not have to ask for consent of Congress.\n  All six States' Governors-Republican, Democrat, and independent and \ntheir legislatures strongly support this amendment. On vote after vote \nthis year we have acted to give more responsibility back to the States. \nHere is an opportunity for the Senate to do just that--in precisely the \nmanner the Founders laid out in the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, the National Milk Producers Federation strongly \nsupports this amendment as well as Mid-America, AMPI, Darigold, Milk \nMarketing Inc., and many other farmer cooperatives and dairy farmers \nfrom throughout the country. Supporting it is an opportunity to vote \nfor State's rights, and to vote for dairy farmers and to vote for our \ntaxpayers. I urge my colleagues to support our amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, Senator Jeffords, \nSenator Cohen, Senator Snowe, and Senator Leahy, as a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, the Senate Agriculture Committee has eliminated dairy \nprice support purchases for butter and nonfat dry milk, and retains \nsuch purchases for cheese. The dairy farmers in my State support this \nprovision, but only if a farmer funded class IV export program is \nestablished. The Agriculture Committee failed to address export sales \nof butter and nonfat dry milk to the world market. Our amendment \naddresses this issue and according to CBO will save an additional $233 \nmillion in the next 7 years. These savings are in addition to $1 \nbillion, the Government will save during the same 7 years by the \nelimination of dairy support for butter and nonfat dry milk.\n  This farmer funded class IV export program has the support of many, \nincluding; Darigold--80 percent of all Washington State producers, \nNational Milk Producers Federation, Mid-America Dairymen, Milk \nMarketing Inc., AMPI, American Farm Bureau, Kansas Dairymen \nAssociation, Utah Dairymen Association, NE Council of Farmer \nCooperatives, Michigan Milk Producers Association, Florida Dairy \nFarmers Association, Dairlylee Cooperatives, United Dairymen \nAssociation, Western Dairymen Cooperatives, and a legion of other \nfarmer cooperatives and dairy farmers across the country.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthis amendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \namendment offered by the gentleman from Vermont, and I rise in strong \nsupport of the amendment.\n  Family dairy farms are facing hard times across the country, and this \namendment is designed to assist these farmers while protecting the \ninterests of the taxpayers and consumers.\n  The Jeffords amendment does two things. First, it creates a class IV \npool for nonfat dry milk and butter. This pool will help to offset the \nfinancial impact on farmers of the reconciliation bill's repeal of the \nprice support program for these two products. The new pool would be \nGATT-legal, allowing a greater volume of U.S. butter and nonfat dry \nmilk to be exported than would be the case if we do not create the new \npool. In short, the class IV pool will help farmers maintain their \nincomes without increasing Federal expenditures.\n  Mr. President, the second provision of the amendment provides the \nconsent of the Congress to the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. Like \nthe class IV proposal, the compact is designed to help family dairy \nfarmers survive in a very difficult market environment. But unlike the \nclass IV proposal, the compact does not involve the Federal Government. \nIt represents a regional, State-based solution to a regional problem, \nand the Federal Government need only give its assent and then step out \nof the way.\n  Today, New England is practically bleeding dairy farms. In Maine, for \ninstance, we have lost more than 200 farms since 1988, and this number \nwould have been far higher if Maine \n\n[[Page S 16001]]\nhad not instituted a dairy vendor's fee to help stabilize farm income. \nUnfortunately, that vendor's fee has been invalidated by a Federal \ncourt, and farmers are exceedingly vulnerable once again.\n  The decline in New England's dairy farms can be attributed to low and \nvolatile dairy prices under the Federal marketing order program that do \nnot reflect the costs of production in the region. Because New England \nfarmers sell much of their milk in the fluid milk market, they face \nsubstantially higher costs to get their milk to the plant, and they do \nnot have access to subsidized electricity like farmers in some other \nparts of the country. Consequently, New England's dairy farmers receive \nsome of the lowest mailbox prices of any dairy farmers in the country.\n  In response to this farm crisis, the six New England States \nnegotiated an interstate compact in 1993 that allows them to add, if \nthey choose, an additional increment to the Federal marketing order \nprice in the New England region. These increments would have to be \napproved by a commission created under the compact which consists of \nrepresentatives from each of the New England States, and which includes \nboth producer and consumer interests.\n\n  Mr. President, this compact is a regional solution to a regional \nproblem in the most literal sense. With very few exceptions, it affects \nonly the consumers, farmers, and dairy processors of New England. The \ncompact applies only to fluid, or class I, milk, and 97 percent of the \nfluid milk consumed in New England is processed by New England-based \nprocessors.\n  Approximately 75 percent of the milk processed by these processors \ncomes from New England farmers. The remainder comes from New York, \nwhose farmers would receive the same prices for their milk under the \ncompact as farmers in New England.\n  Although the compact only affects the participating States, the \ncosponsors of the amendment have included explicit assurances to remove \nany doubt. These assurances further clarify that the compact only \napplies to class I fluid milk, that no new States can join the compact \nwithout the formal approval of both Houses of Congress, that out-of-\nregion farmers who sell milk in the compact region will get the same \nprice as New England farmers, and that the compact commission will take \nactive measures to prevent increases in production.\n  Mr. President, the Jeffords amendment is profarmer, protaxpayer, and \npro-States' rights. It will help to ensure that good farmers have a \nreasonable chance to stay in business, but at less cost to the Federal \nGovernment. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment offered by Senator Cochran to grant the consent of Congress \nto the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact and to create a class IV \npricing system for milk used to make butter or powder.\n  Both of these provisions would take dairy policy in the opposite \ndirection in which congressional reformers are attempting to take all \nagricultural policy--this amendment provides more market intervention, \nmore regulation, and more inequity.\n  It is unfortunate that the major changes that this amendment makes \nand the enormous precedent that it sets will not be fully debated by \nthis Chamber. I am certain that few Members of this Chamber will have \nan opportunity to actually learn and understand just what it is they \nare voting on. I am also certain that this amendment will be approved.\n  This amendment balkanizes the U.S. dairy industry by insulating the \nNortheast dairy industry from the market conditions that all other \nfarmers in this country must face.\n  This amendment will provide congressional consent to an interstate \ncompact, the like of which has never been approved by the Congress. It \nis, Mr. President, unprecedented.\n  This compact will allow a Commission in the Northeast to set fluid \nmilk prices artificially high for the six States in the compact. It \nallows dairy farmers in six States in the Northeast to enjoy higher \nprices for their milk, erects barriers to keep out lower cost milk from \noutside the compact walls, and will result in lower prices for \nproducers in the rest of the United States.\n  The compact would allow for an increase in the fluid milk \ndifferential up to $17.40 per hundred pounds of milk, or in terms of \ngallons--$1.50 per gallon. This is well over $3 greater than the price \nproducers in the New England order enjoy currently for fluid milk.\n  However, the compact we are being asked to approve also allows that \nprice to be increased with inflation, as measured by the CPI, since \n1990. By the year 2,000 the cap could be well over to $20 if inflation \nincreases by 3 percent per year.\n  With those kinds of price increases, we can expect producers in \nVermont and elsewhere to increase their milk production in response to \nthose higher prices. And, Mr. President, as far too many dairy farmers \nknow, production increases in one region of the country drive down milk \nprices for producers throughout the Nation.\n  One might ask why producers in the Northeast should be allowed to \nhave their milk prices adjusted for inflation each year, when that \nprivilege is given to no other commodity in any other region. One might \nask why we should allow one region of the country to increase consumer \ncosts when virtually every other effort in this Congress has attempted \nto eliminate the burden on consumers from overly regulatory \nagricultural policies.\n  We must ask, why should the Congress grant its approval to the \nNortheast Interstate Dairy Compact?\n  The answer is that Congress should not provide its consent for an \ninterstate price fixing compact.\n  The supporters of this amendment have tried to present this as a very \nsimple idea--that of a simple interstate compact designed to help the \nstruggling producers of that region in isolation from national markets \nand having no effects on non-compact producers.\n  But, Mr. President, producers in the upper Midwest have learned \nthrough painful lessons that regional changes in milk prices have \nnational effects and national implications.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact is not a simple proposal. It is not an \ninnocuous interstate compact isolated to the participating States and \nit will have national implications.\n  Mr. President, it is time to remove the artificial fluid milk price \ndifferentials that discriminate against certain regions to the benefit \nof others, distort markets, and cost consumers millions of dollars in \nfood costs annually--It is not time to enhance them.\n  I would urge my colleagues to think seriously about whether or not \nthis body wishes to endorse price-fixing compacts of any nature.\n  The precedent that congressional approval of the Northeast Interstate \nDairy Compact would set is very serious indeed--we will be allowing a \nsmall group of States to fix prices for a product produced and marketed \nnationally.\n  The second half of this amendment establishes a class IV pricing \nsystem which benefits a few producers on the other coast of the United \nStates--the west coast powder-producing States, to the detriment of \nproducers elsewhere. This class IV pricing system is not necessary for \nthe U.S. dairy industry to expand exports. I have 30,000 dairy farmers \nin Wisconsin that want to expand exports and are planning to do so, but \nWisconsin dairy producers oppose class IV pricing.\n  Why? Because it forces them to pay a tax to support producers on the \nwest coast. In fact, producers throughout the country will likely pay a \nminimum of 15 cents per hundredweight to help producers on the west \ncoast continue to overproduce milk powder which will no longer be \nsupported by the Federal Government which is no longer demanded by the \ndomestic market. I would urge my colleagues to look with a skeptical \neye on projections that this amendment will greatly enhance producer \nrevenues to compensate for powder tax that all producers will pay. If \nsuch projections were realistic, the thousands of milk producers in the \nupper Midwest--the heart of this Nation's dairy country--would be \nembracing this proposal, not opposing it.\n  Mr. President, this amendment provides help to producers in eight \nStates--the six Northeastern States that will benefit from the Compact, \nand two west coast States that will benefit from the class IV system. \nAll other producers in between are the big losers. \n\n[[Page S 16002]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. It creates more \nregulation, more market distortions, and discriminates against all but \na few producers in the country. Mr. President, this is bad policy.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, it is difficult for me to oppose my friends \nfrom the Northeast in their efforts to help the dairy farmers of that \nregion. But it is on behalf of the dairy farmers of my State that I \nfeel that I must. Not only because I believe his compact will have a \nnegative effect on the dairy farmers of regions outside the northeast, \nbut also because I believe it to be a inappropriate method of \naddressing the problems of the dairy industry, which are national in \nnature.\n  This measure is a regional compact. It is an effort by six \nNortheastern States to require artificially increased milk prices for \nthe farmers in those States exclusively. It is at its heart \nanticompetitive, and I believe that it is market distorting.\n  The sponsors of this measure claim that the Northeast is an island \nunto itself, and that this compact will not affect any other region. I \nbelieve that that statement ignores the complexities of dairy markets, \nwhich are national in nature.\n  To predict the exact effects of the compact on other regions is \nnearly impossible. But to assume that there will be none is to turn a \nblind eye to the history of agricultural policy.\n  My region of the country, the upper Midwest, has learned this lesson \nall too well. We, in this region, have seen our dairy industry become \nthe victim of unforeseen market distortions caused by the milk \nmarketing order system. This system, which was instituted in the 1930's \nrequires that higher minimum prices be paid to producers the farther \nthey are from Wisconsin. Since the upper Midwest was the traditional \nhub of dairy production, the purpose of this regional discrimination \nwas to help dairy industries outside the upper Midwest develop, so that \nevery region could have a locally produced supply of fluid milk.\n  But that goal has been largely accomplished, and the policy that was \nintended to give other regions an artificial ``leg up'' over the upper \nMidwest, is now contributing to the decline of dairy farming in the \nupper Midwest.\n  But make no mistake about it. This debate is not only about the upper \nMidwest. And it is not only about dairy policy. This debate is about \nthe future direction of all agricultural policies.\n  I and many of my colleagues from farm States have been willing to \npromote farm programs that we believe will provide a safety net to farm \nprices, to help provide some security for the family farmers of this \nNation.\n  But the Northeast Dairy Compact goes beyond anything ever done in a \nfarm bill. And it goes far beyond any other regional compact presented \nto the Congress for approval.\n  It is the product of one region's frustration with national policies, \nand an effort by that region to remove themselves from that national \nsystem and establish a regional dairy policy.\n  So why is this compact before the Senate? The answer is that the \nNortheast needs Congress' approval in order to interfere with \ninterstate commerce.\n  The commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution makes it clear that \nStates cannot infringe on interstate commerce. Court case after court \ncase has turned down efforts be individual States to do so. Most \nrecently, in the 1994 West Lynn Creamery, Inc versus Healy decision, \nthe Supreme Court turned down a Massachusetts milk pricing policy that \nwould have artificially increased the price of milk sold in \nMassachusetts in order to bolster the dairy farmers of that State \nalone. The Supreme Court turned down that effort as being a clear \nviolation of the commerce clause of the Constitution. At that time, \neven the State of Vermont argued in opposition to the Massachusetts \neffort, claiming that it was ``economic protectionism that burdens \ninterstate commerce by interfering with competition.''\n  But now all six Northeastern States have banded together to do \nsomething very similar to what Massachusetts tried to do on its own, \nand that it to artificially increase milk prices in that region for the \nbenefit of the farmers in that region, and to protect their higher milk \nprice by placing a protectionist tariff on all milk coming into the \nregion for outside.\n  Clearly this too would be considered a violation of the commerce \nclause if subject to the scrutiny of the courts.\n  However understanding the threat that this constitutionality question \nposes to their efforts, the Northeast have been very cleaver in getting \naround that question by packaging the pricing scheme as a compact.\n  The Constitution allows States to enter into a compact with other \nStates, as long as those compacts are approved by Congress. This \nauthority has been used many times, without controversy, by States that \nseek to address multistate environmental or transportation concerns. \nBut it has never been used to allow States to engage in price-fixing \nactivities. And it has never been used as a way to circumvent the \ncommerce clause of the Constitution.\n  Make no mistake about it. This compact is unprecedented in the \nhistory of the Nation.\n  While the context of this compact may be milk pricing, its \nramifications are far more significant. Congressional approval of this \ncompact is an invitation for all sorts of economic balkanization.\n  Our forefathers had the foresight to see the dangers of allowing \nStates and regions to erect economic barriers against other States in \nthe Union. They asked the question ``What are we, as a nation, if we do \nnot have a unified economic market?''\n  Last year, when the Northeast Dairy Compact was considered in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, many of my colleagues raised constitutional \nconcerns with the compact.\n  Senator Hatch commented on this matter. He stated:\n\n       I am afraid that this is the kind of precedent-setting \n     compact that will lead other States to seek the same type of \n     protection, to the economic detriment of all their bordering \n     States. More importantly, I would expect that other \n     industries will line up seeking compacts as a means of \n     protecting their particular States' interests, and we just \n     can't go down that route.\n\n  On the same matter, Senator Thurmond stated:\n\n       I believe that Congressional approval of this compact would \n     set a bad precedent. Approval would encourage other regions \n     of our country to form compacts to assist regional producers \n     in a variety of industries at the expense of those outside \n     the region. A breakdown of our nation into regional cartels \n     and economic infighting would be very harmful and should be \n     opposed.\n\n  At that same mark up in the Judiciary Committee last year, Senator \nGrassley stated:\n\n       Historically, these compacts have dealt with border issues, \n     environmental cooperation, and other subjects limited to the \n     member States not having an impact on the rest of the \n     country. . . . Without Congressional approval, I believe that \n     the compact would be unconstitutional. Clearly, if one of the \n     States in the compact enacted State legislation along these \n     lines, the Commerce Clause would be violated. Protection of \n     in-state industry against out-of-State industry is \n     prohibited. I think that we should be very hesitant to allow \n     a group of States to do what a single State could not do \n     under our Constitution.\n\n  And lastly, my good friend from Illinois, Senator Simon added:\n\n       I tend to agree with Senator Grassley that this [Compact] \n     is probably constitutional. . . . But what it constitutional \n     is not necessarily wise.\n\n   Mr. President, the Senate Agriculture Committee has already started \nthe debate on the reauthorization of national farm programs through the \n1995 farm bill. It is my sincere hope that as we begin that debate, we \ncan craft dairy policy changes that are beneficial to all the dairy \nfarmers of this country, not just those of one region.\n  I too want to help the farmers of this Nation. But I firmly believe \nthat the Northeast Dairy Compact is the wrong approach.\n  Another provision of this amendment authorizes a class IV price for \nmilk. The rationale for this provision is that since the Senate \nAgriculture Committee eliminated the price support for milk powder and \nbutter, the prices for those products will fall to world prices. \nHowever, the problem is that the class IV price would merely create a \ntax on all dairy farmers nationwide, to be transferred to the farmers \nin those few States that have excess milk production, and put that \nexcess milk into butter and powder. In short, this imposes a butter/\npowder tax on the dairy farmers of all States, to be transferred to the \ndairy farmers of those States producing those products. \n\n[[Page S 16003]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in strong opposition to this compact \nand the class IV pricing provisions.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what is happening here is quite clear: \nInstead of just letting us vote on whether or not the other side is \nwilling to accept some level at which we are saying we will not give \ntax breaks to those individuals, instead we are going to try to keep \nthe cuts in Medicare and Medicaid from being as high as they are.\n  Why, I do not understand, why can we not simply have a vote on it? I \nthink by not permitting a vote they are absolutely voting on the \nRepublican side. They are saying that we are not even going to cut off \nour friends who make $1 million a year or more.\n  I hope we can get to a vote on my amendment, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the fact is that the tax bill before the \nU.S. Senate, 90 percent of the tax cut goes to Americans earning \n$100,000 or less. That is the fact.\n  This is a political amendment. We have a right to offer second degree \nand when we find amendments like this we will do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 1332, beginning with line 5, strike all through \n     page 1336, line 17.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this amendment I send to the desk on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Dole, Senator Roth, Senator Snowe, and \nSenator Chafee is an amendment that would eliminate section 7573, which \nwould require States to collect an annual amount equal to a $25 \napplication fee and 6.6 percent of collections for non-AFDC families, \nif they use child support enforcement services.\n  I think this provision should not have been in the bill. I mentioned \nthat \n\n[[Page S 16005]]\nduring the Finance Committee hearings. I have worked with the majority \nleader, and, also, Senator Roth says this section should be stricken. \nThat is what this amendment would do.\n  The Governors strongly support this amendment. They do not think that \nthey should be mandated to have the child support enforcement check \nfees in this bill. I agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, here we are. I am fearful. I am making \ninquiry. Are we violating the agreement that we should have a copy of \nthis amendment? I thought we had agreed earlier they had been filed.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the question was asked, Is this a 10-\npercent tax? My colleague from New Jersey raised this as well. \nOriginally, this was a 10-percent tax. I think the committee made \nadjustments and made it 6.6 percent. I happen to agree with him that \neven at 6.6 percent, the tax is too high.\n  Also, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator Chafee be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. We are eliminating the 6.6-percent tax.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We do not need a vote.\n  Mr. EXON. It would appear to me, with the 30 seconds that I have on \nthis side of the aisle, that as of now this Senator has not been \nadvised that there is any opposition to this matter on this side.\n  Evidently, we have found this was given to us in a different order.\n  Does anyone wish to oppose?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. As I understand it, the amendment offered by Senator \nNickles is the exact content of the amendment that I was going to \noffer. So I have no opposition.\n  Mr. EXON. Hearing no objection on this side, I yield back the \nremainder of my time and suggest possibly this could be voice voted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The amendment (No. 3008) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the next amendment that we have agreed to \nconsider would be by the Senator from New York. I yield the required \ntime allotted to us to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Might we have order, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Chair asks \nthat conversations be taken off the floor.\n  Does the Senator from New York have an amendment at the desk?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3009\n\n    (Purpose: To strike the reduction of indirect medical education \n                    payments to teaching hospitals)\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York (Mr. Moynihan) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3009.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 541, strike line 10, and all that follows through \n     page 542, line 8.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this amendment would strike the 40-\npercent reduction in indirect medical education payments in the \nreconciliation bill and restore $9.9 billion to teaching hospitals in \nthe years 1996 to 2002. This reconciliation bill seriously threatens \nthe future of medical research, physician training and care for the \nindigent. Teaching hospitals are a national treasure. To abandon them \nnow would be a tragedy.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment adds $9.9 billion to the \ndeficit. In the Finance Committee bill, $1.7 billion is added back to \nthis. I think we ought to table this amendment and move on to the next \none.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the pending amendment, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from New Mexico to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from New York. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am going to send to the desk, with the \nfull concurrence of the ranking member and no objection that I am aware \nof, six amendments en bloc. Let me just list them: a Dole-Kohl-Grassley \namendment with reference to truckers that has been agreed to on both \nsides; the Hutchison amendment that we had a little while ago that was \nwithdrawn--it has been cleared on both sides--a Senator D'Amato sense \nof the Senate.\n  Mr. BYRD. That amendment has not been cleared on both sides. I have \njust been talking with Mrs. Hutchison.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We withdraw it. I say to Senator Hutchison, that has \nnot been cleared on their side.\n  Senator D'Amato has an amendment cleared on both sides, a sense of \nthe Senate; Senator Grassley has one with reference to an advisory task \nforce; Senator Boxer has one on no pay--what do you call it, I say to \nthe Senator?\n  Mrs. BOXER. No pay. We already passed it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We already passed it. Senator Graham, an amendment to \nensure Medicare beneficiaries have urgent Medicare treatment. We have \nno objection to it.\n  I send all five to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask they be reported en bloc and accepted en bloc.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S 16006]]\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes \n     amendments numbered 3010 through 3014, en bloc.\n\n  The amendments, en bloc, are as follows:\n\n                           amendment no. 3010\n\n (Purpose: To increase the deductibility of business meal expenses for \n individuals subject to Federal limitations on hours of service and to \n                      provide offsetting revenues)\n\n       At the end of chapter 8 of subtitle I of title XII, insert \n     the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . INCREASED DEDUCTIBILITY OF BUSINESS MEAL EXPENSES FOR \n                   INDIVIDUALS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL LIMITATIONS ON \n                   HOURS OF SERVICE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 274(n) (relating to only 50 \n     percent of meal and entertainment expenses allowed as \n     deduction) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(3) Special rule for individuals subject to federal \n     limitations on hours of service.--In the case of any expenses \n     for food or beverages consumed by an individual during, or \n     incident to, any period of duty which is subject to the hours \n     of service limitations of the Department of Transportation, \n     paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting `80 percent' \n     for `50 percent'.''\n       (b) Repeal of Special Transition Rule to Financial \n     Institution Exception to Interest Allocation Rules.--\n     Paragraph (5) of section 1215(c) of the Tax Reform Act of \n     1986 (Public Law 99-514, 100 Stat. 2548) is hereby repealed.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1995.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering with \nSenator Dole will restore the business meal deduction to 80 percent for \ntruckers, long-haul bus drivers, and others subject to Department of \nTransportation hours of service regulations. My amendment would cost \n$673 million over 7 years and would be offset by repealing the special \ntransition rule to financial institution exception to interest \nallocation rules.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I understand Senator Kohl is expected to \noffer an amendment that would restore the business meals deduction from \n50 to 80 percent for workers using Department of Transportation [DOT] \nhours-of-service regulations. The amendment specifically targets only \nthe segment of middle-income Americans who, due to the nature of their \nemployment, must eat away from home. Such individuals include truckers, \nbusdrivers, and some railworkers. The deduction for business meals and \nentertainment expenses was reduced from 80 to 50 percent under the \nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and went into effect on \nJanuary 1, 1994.\n  I support Senator Kohl's efforts to restore the business meals \ndeduction to 80 percent for workers on DOT service hours. However, I \nstrongly believe that the amendment should go further than the \ntransportation segment of the population. I, along with Senator Hatch \nand others, have introduced S. 216, which would restore the business \nmeals deduction to 80 percent of all industries.\n  The restoration of this deduction is essential to the livelihood of \nthe food service, travel and tourism, and entertainment industries \nthroughout the United States. These industries are being economically \nharmed as a result of this reduction. All are major industries \nemploying millions of people, many of whom are already feeling the \neffects of the reduction.\n  Contrary to what many might believe, most individuals who purchase \nbusiness means are small business persons: 70 percent have incomes \nbelow $50,000, 39 percent have incomes below $35,000, and 25 percent \nare self-employed. Moreover, 78 percent of business lunches and 50 \npercent of business dinners are purchased in low to moderately priced \nrestaurants. The average amount spent on a business meal, per person, \nis about $9.39 for lunch and $19.58 for dinner. The business meal \ndeduction is hardly the exclusive realm of the fat cats.\n  Again, I commend Senator Kohl for his efforts to restore the business \nmeals deduction to 80 percent for workers on DOT service hours. I urge \nmy colleagues to also support my bill, S. 216, which would restore the \nbusiness meals deduction to 80 percent for all industries.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3011\n\n    (Purpose: Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding the tax \n     treatment of conversions of thrift charters to bank charters)\n\n       At the end of chapter 8 of subtitle I of title XII, insert:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TAX TREATMENT OF \n                   CONVERSIONS OF THRIFT CHARTERS TO BANK \n                   CHARTERS.\n\n       In order to facilitate sound national banking policy and \n     assist in the conversion of thrift charters to bank charters, \n     it is the sense of the Senate that section 593 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to reserves for \n     losses on loans) should be repealed and appropriate relief \n     should be granted for the pre-1988 portion of any bad debt \n     reserves of a thrift charter.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. MR. President, this sense-of-the-Senate resolution would \nexpress the will of the Senate that Congress should eliminate a \nsignificant disincentive in the current law which prevents thrift \ninstitutions from changing their charters. It also prevents thrifts \nfrom diversifying into other lending opportunities. Given developments \nin financial institutions and the debate in Congress over the future of \nthe thrift industry, it is desirable for Congress to seriously examine \nthis aspect of the tax law that applies only to thrifts.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3012\n\n       On pages 764 and 765, section 2106. Medicaid Task Force, \n     under subsection (c) ``Advisory Group for the Task Force'' \n     and new number (14) to read:\n       ``(14) American osteopathic association.\n       Redesignate old (14) to be (15); redesignate old (15) to be \n     (16); redesignate old (16) to be (17); redesignate old (17) \n     to be (18).\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3013\n\n (Purpose: To provide that Members of Congress and the President shall \n            not be paid during Federal Government shutdowns\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.   . PAY OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT DURING \n                   GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Members of Congress and the President \n     shall not receive basic pay for any period in which--\n       (1) there is more than a 24-hour lapse in appropriations \n     for any Federal agency or department as a result of a failure \n     to enact a regular appropriations bill or continuing \n     resolution; or\n       (2) the Federal Government is unable to make payments or \n     meet obligations because the public debt limit under section \n     3101 of title 31, United States Code has been reached.\n       (b) Retroactive Pay Prohibited.--No pay forfeited in \n     accordance with subsection (a) may be paid retroactively.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this amendment is identical to one offered \nto the D.C. appropriations bill that passed the Senate unanimously and \nwas cosponsored by both the majority and minority leaders, among \nothers.\n  Because this issue is so important and because the D.C. bill appears \nto have stalled in the House, I believe it is important for the Senate \nto revisit this proposal.\n  Under my amendment, if there is a lapse in appropriations for any \nFederal department or agency or if the Government is unable to operate \nbecause of a default caused by a failure to raise the Federal debt \nceiling, the pay for Members of Congress and the President will be \ndocked.\n  I believe this legislation is important for two key reasons:\n  First, it will help avert the predicted Government shutdown by \nhelping Members of Congress understand the fear and uncertainty now \nbeing felt by the millions of Americans who rely on Government \nservices.\n  Second, it codifies a principle that all other workers in America \nlive by: If you do not do your job, you should not get paid. One of \nCongress' most important functions is to pass the Nation's budget. If \nwe fail in that critically important task, it simply makes sense that \nour pay should be docked.\n  Mr. President, this amendment makes common sense, and I thank the \nmanagers for accepting it.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3014\n\n  (Purpose: to ensure medicare beneficiaries have emergency or urgent \n care provided and paid for by medicare choice plans by establishing a \n  definition of an emergency medical condition that is based upon the \n                      prudent layperson standard)\n\n       Beginning on page 476, strike line 20 and all that follows \n     through page 477, line 3 and insert the following: such \n     individuals have contracted for) available and accessible to \n     each such individual, within the medicare service area of the \n     plan, with reasonable promptness, and in a manner which \n     assures continuity,\n       On page 481, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n       ``(h) Timely Authorization for Promptly Needed Care \n     Identified as a Result of Required Screening Evaluation.--\n\n[[Page S 16007]]\n\n       ``(1) Access to process.--A medicare choice plan sponsor \n     shall provide access 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to such \n     persons as may be authorized to make any prior authorizations \n     required by the plan sponsor for coverage of items and \n     services (other than emergency services) that a treating \n     physician or other emergency department personnel identify, \n     pursuant to a screening evaluation required under section \n     1867(a), as being needed promptly by an individual enrolled \n     with the organization under this part.\n       ``(2) Deemed approval.--A medicare choice plan sponsor is \n     deemed to have approved a request for such promptly needed \n     items and services if the physician or other emergency \n     department personnel involved--\n       ``(A) has made a reasonable effort to contact such a person \n     for authorization to provide an appropriate referral for such \n     items and services or to provide the items and services to \n     the individual and access to the person has not been provided \n     (as required in paragraph (1)), or\n       ``(B) has requested such authorization for the person and \n     the person has not denied the authorization within 30 minutes \n     after the time the request is made.\n       ``(3) Effect of approval.--Approval of a request for a \n     prior authorization determination (including a deemed \n     approval under paragraph (2)) shall be treated as approval of \n     a request for any items and services that are required to \n     treat the medical condition identified pursuant to the \n     required screening evaluation.\n       ``(4) Definition of emergency services.--In this \n     subsection, the term `emergency services' means--\n       ``(A) health care items and services furnished in the \n     emergency department of a hospital (including a trauma \n     center), and\n       ``(B) ancillary services routinely available to such \n     department,\n\n     to the extent they are required to evaluate and treat an \n     emergency medical condition (as defined in paragraph (5)) \n     until the condition is stabilized.\n       ``(5) Emergency medical condition.--In paragraph (4), the \n     term `emergency medical condition' means a medical condition, \n     the onset of which is sudden, that manifests itself by \n     symptoms of sufficient severity, including severe pain, that \n     a prudent layperson, who possesses an average knowledge of \n     health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of \n     immediate medical attention to result in--\n       ``(A) placing the person's health in serious jeopardy,\n       ``(B) serious impairment to bodily functions, or\n       ``(C) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\n\n  Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, could I yield myself 1 minute for a \ndiscussion with the Senators?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think we sort of set a pattern here. \nIf the Senators could look at the remaining amendments--I say this to \nboth sides; we will do it on ours--if the Senators could look at \ntheirs, maybe they could package them with reference to subject matter. \nIf the Senators package them with reference to subject matter, then we \nmight get five amendments all of which deal with the subject. We think \nwe know how they are going to turn out, but that is not terribly \nrelevant. We could offer them en bloc.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope that we will be careful that we do \nnot try to streamline this silly process further. Now we are really \nflying deaf, dumb, and blind. So I hope we will look at these so-called \npackages with four or five amendments. I want to see them.\n  I am not going to set myself up as a traffic cop, but this process is \njust entirely out of control. We do not know what we are voting on now. \nNow we are just voting on amendments. They do not know what is in this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 1 minute has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Byrd for his \nconcern. We discussed this concern on the whole process, and, \nhopefully, this is the last time we will have it under this process. We \nshould change it. But I have to get a bill through under this process. \nWe will be as careful as we can. If we need to, we will certainly \nconsult with a broad array of Senators before we proceed.\n  Is another amendment ready?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, whose turn is it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I recognize the Senator from Connecticut for \nthe purpose of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and I thank my friend from Nebraska.\n\n\n                       Lieberman Motion To Commit\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have a motion at the desk which I \noffer on behalf of myself, and Senators Daschle, Harkin, Graham, \nRockefeller, Breaux, and Kennedy, who are members of a Medicare working \ngroup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], moves to \n     commit the bill to the Committee on Finance with instructions \n     to report the bill back to the Senate within 3 days, not to \n     include any day the Senate is not in session, with the \n     following amendment, and to make sufficient reductions in the \n     tax cuts to maintain deficit neutrality.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to restore the \nsolvency of the Medicare part A trust fund for the next 10 years and \nthen to go on, beyond dealing with that immediate, obvious deficit \nlooming, to reform the Medicare Program and provide real choices to \nMedicare beneficiaries by increasing the range of health plan options \navailable, providing better information so that beneficiaries can act \nas informed consumers, and to require planning and action for the \nchanges that will come with the retirement, later in the first decade \nof the next century, of the baby-boom generation.\n  This is a constructive Medicare alternative.\n  Mr. President, what we have here is a missed opportunity. Democrats \nand Republicans agree generally that there are some problems with the \nMedicare Program that we must address:\n  Problem No. 1. Our Republican colleagues argue that the Medicare \nProgram must be saved from impending bankruptcy in the part A trust \nfund. Democrats agree that we must act to restore the solvency of the \npart A trust fund. The Health Care Financing Administration's Actuary \ntells us that it will take $89 billion in spending reductions to assure \nsolvency through the next 10 years--through 2006. Democrats have put \nforward a strong proposal that would do this in a fair manner. It has \nbeen scored by CBO and achieves solvency for at least the next 10 \nyears.\n  Problem No. 2. The rate of increase in the cost of the Medicare \nProgram is unsustainable at 10 percent each and every year. We all \nagree that this problem must be dealt with. Democrats and Republicans \nhave both put forward proposals that begin to bring competitive market \nforces into the Medicare Program. I would argue that the Democratic \nproposal is much stronger in this regard. We would strongly move the \nMedicare Program toward competitive bidding among the private health \nplans participating in Medicare. We would also tie rates of increase in \npayments to private health plans to the private sector market place, \nrather than to arbitrary budget targets. Ultimately, I am convinced \nthat competition among an expanded range of private health plans \nserving Medicare patients will be the key to reducing long term rates \nof growth in the Medicare Program.\n  We recognize that the Medicare Program is 30 years old and is showing \nsigns of its age. We have proposed changes that would bring the program \ninto the rapidly changing health care system of the 1990's and the next \ncentury.\n  Problem No. 3. The most difficult problem looming on the horizon, Mr. \nPresident, is the coming retirement of the baby boom generation--a \nrelatively huge number of Americans will begin to turn 65 starting \naround the year 2010. There are 76 million individuals in the baby boom \ngeneration. They outnumber by 50 percent the generation that preceded \nthem into retirement. Over the next 5 years, only about 10 percent of \nMedicare cost increases will be attributable to more beneficiaries. \nOnce the baby boomers retire, however, \n\n[[Page S 16008]]\nthe combination of, one, a declining base of workers and, two, longer \nlifespans will double the combined costs of Medicare and Medicaid even \nif medical inflation, above CPI is eliminated altogether.\n  If Medicare is not prepared for the implications of this demographic \nshift, it may not be able to weather the storm. Democrats and \nRepublicans have both put forward Medicare reform plans that would set \nup a high level, bipartisan commission to make the tough \nrecommendations that are needed to prepare for this historical shift.\n  The differences between the parties, nevertheless, remain stark. The \nbill that is on the Senate floor today would cut $280 billion out of \nthe Medicare Program over the next 7 years. The problem, Mr. President, \nis that this figure is based solely on a series of budget targets that \nlead to a balanced budget and reductions in taxes of $254 billion over \nthe next 7 years.\n  The reconciliation bill before us is too long on squeezing \nbeneficiaries and too short on genuine reform. It treats Medicare as a \ncash cow to be milked to keep promises of deficit and tax reduction \nmade in the campaigns of 1994.\n  The figure of $280 billion in Medicare cuts is not good for the \nMedicare Program and the population it serves--those who depend on it \ntoday and those who will depend on it in future generations.\n  In the end, Mr. President, I am convinced that we can find a solution \nto all of these problems. What we have on the Senate floor today, \nhowever, is not the solution. It maintains all of the problems of the \nexisting Medicare Program and underfunds them. It is a package of cuts, \nnot reforms.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a Democratic Medicare \nplan printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n            A Democratic Medicare Plan for the 21st Century\n\n       Since Democrats created Medicare thirty years ago over GOP \n     opposition, protecting this program has been a top Democratic \n     priority. Today, as Republicans propose the largest cuts in \n     Medicare's history--cuts made in the name of ``saving'' \n     Medicare--Democrats once again are coming to Medicare's \n     defense.\n       Our proposal: To ensure that Medicare remains solvent and \n     strong by implementing reforms that strengthen and improve \n     the program.\n       Our position: That the GOP Medicare plan cuts Medicare \n     three times more than is necessary to restore Trust Fund \n     solvency--and raids Medicare to pay for their scheme of tax \n     breaks for the wealthiest.\n       Rejecting the Republican plan is not enough. Democrats will \n     offer a proposal which:\n       Preserves seniors' right to keep their own doctor while \n     giving them more choices of private health plans that provide \n     high-quality and comprehensive benefits;\n       Improves Medicare's traditional fee-for-service program by \n     making it more efficient and responsive to beneficiary needs, \n     without imposing unnecessary and unfair increases in out-of-\n     pocket Medicare expenses;\n       Tackles Medicare waste, fraud and abuse through programs \n     applauded by law enforcement officials; and\n       Guarantees solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund through the \n     year 2006 and prepares for the long-run challenge of the baby \n     boom generation that will begin to retire in 2010.\n       The GOP claims we must cut $270 billion in order to save \n     Medicare. That's just not true. According to the Health Care \n     Financing Administration's Chief Actuary--who produced the \n     estimates relied upon by the Medicare trustees--only $89 \n     billion in cost reductions are needed to extend the life of \n     the trust fund through the fourth quarter of the calendar \n     year 2006.\n       In this proposal, we show that we can preserve and protect \n     Medicare without slashing needed services for the elderly or \n     increasing their out-of-pocket costs. Our plan places no new \n     burdens on seniors--and our hospital cuts are half the \n     Republicans'.\n\n\n           summary of democratic proposal to ensure solvency\n\n                       I. Providing real choices\n\n       Medicare beneficiaries currently may choose from only two \n     options--the traditional fee-for-service program and health \n     maintenance organizations. Since 19 states have no Medicare \n     HMOs, seniors in many states have no choice at all. This plan \n     would ensure beneficiaries have access to a wide variety of \n     health plans. Specific reforms include the following:\n       Expand private health plan choices: Medicare's current \n     options would be expanded to allow the participation of \n     preferred provider organizations, point-of-service plans, and \n     provider sponsored networks. Plans would offer a basic \n     benefit package equal to the fee-for-service plan with \n     additional preventive services and lower cost-sharing.\n       Preserve a vital and affordable fee-for-service option: The \n     GOP's $270 billion in cuts will spell disaster for hospitals \n     and other health care providers all across the country, \n     particularly in rural and underserved areas. The Democratic \n     plan protects and improves fee-for-service Medicare--so \n     seniors will continue to have a real choice. It keeps \n     premiums affordable, saving seniors hundreds of dollars a \n     year.\n       Reform payments to private health plans: Medicare would pay \n     HMOs and other health plans a rate which would increase at \n     the cost of other private health plans, unlike the GOP plan \n     which arbitrarily caps payments at 4.3% and the current \n     outmoded system which ties payments to fee-for-service costs. \n     The Democratic plan would also require Medicare to test and \n     recommend options to Congress on ways to pay private health \n     plans through a market-based competitive bidding process.\n       Provide information on health plan options: Medicare would \n     provide to all beneficiaries information comparing plans \n     available in their region. The comparative plan information \n     would be in a standardized format, in language that is easily \n     understood. Such information would be provided to \n     beneficiaries before they become eligible for Medicare and \n     yearly after that during an open enrollment period.\n       Strengthen Consumer Quality Protections: Medicare would \n     enhance health plan quality standards to prevent improper \n     marketing and inappropriate incentives for utilization \n     reviewers and to ensure access to the full range of Medicare \n     covered services, including emergency and urgent care.\n\n        II. Strengthening traditional (fee-for-service) Medicare\n\n       Currently, 90% of Medicare beneficiaries are in Medicare's \n     traditional fee-for-service program. The vast majority of \n     seniors are likely to continue to enroll in this part of the \n     program, even with the new options available to them. Given \n     these trends, it makes sense to strengthen and improve \n     Medicare's fee for service sector.\n       Under this proposal, a series of reforms would transform \n     the fee-for-service program from a bill-paying insurance \n     program into a responsive health plan that uses a variety of \n     techniques to improve quality and service, restrain costs, \n     and hold providers accountable for improving the health of \n     their patients. To achieve this goal, Congress would provide \n     authority to Medicare to adopt the same types of successful \n     purchasing and quality techniques pioneered by private sector \n     payers. Specific reforms include the following:\n       Establish quality performance standards: Require Medicare \n     to establish explicit performance standards to allow \n     enrollees to assess the program's performance on the basis of \n     cost, quality, outcomes, and service. ``Report cards'' \n     disseminated to beneficiaries would allow patients to compare \n     providers against professional benchmarks.\n       Streamline rule-making process for purchasing: Develop \n     options for simplifying the rule-making process and \n     increasing Medicare's flexibility in negotiating contracts \n     for specific services and categories of services.\n       Allow selective contracting with specialized programs: \n     Allow Medicare to contract with specialized programs that \n     manage chronic diseases like diabetes and congestive heart \n     failure, complex acute care needs and the needs of disabled \n     beneficiaries. Such specialized programs may include the use \n     of alternatives to inpatient or institutional care or the use \n     of specialized networks of caregivers. Private sector efforts \n     along these lines have resulted in higher quality care, \n     reductions in the need for institutional care and lower \n     costs.\n       Provide authority to designate and contract with centers of \n     excellence: Allow Medicare to use centers of excellence for \n     additional complex and expensive services like surgery and \n     cancer care. Medicare currently contracts with such centers \n     for heart and liver transplant operations.\n\n                 III. Attacking waste, fraud, and abuse\n\n       The General Accounting Office and others have estimated \n     that up to 10 percent of health care expenditures and \n     billions of dollars in Medicare payments are lost every year \n     to fraud, waste, and abuse. These losses must be the first \n     target of any responsible plan to reduce Medicare \n     expenditures. This plan would take the most aggressive and \n     comprehensive steps ever proposed to stamp out Medicare \n     waste, fraud and abuse.\n       Specific measures include the following:\n       Expand abuse-fighting activities: Much abuse goes \n     undetected and unpunished because there are not enough \n     inspectors, auditors and prosecutors to do the job. Estimates \n     indicate that every dollar invested in anti-fraud activities \n     by the HHS Inspector General and Medicare contractors results \n     in up to ten dollars in savings to Medicare. The Democratic \n     Medicare plan more than doubles the current investment in \n     fighting fraud and abuse. The plan also requires greater \n     coordination of Federal, State and local law enforcement \n     efforts to combat health care fraud.\n       Strengthen penalties for committing fraud: The Democratic \n     plan would impose stiff penalties on those convicted of \n     health care fraud, illegally distributing controlled \n     substances, providing kickbacks, charging Medicare excessive \n     fees, submitting false claims, or engaging in other abusive \n     activities. This plan also strengthens available criminal \n     remedies.\n       End wasteful Medicare spending for certain items and \n     services: For example, Medicare \n\n[[Page S 16009]]\n     pays $2.32 for gauze pads that the Veterans Administration purchases \n     for four cents. The Democratic Medicare plan would make \n     Medicare a more prudent buyer of certain types of durable \n     medical equipment, medical supplies, and other services while \n     assuring continued access to these important services.\n       Improve collection of inappropriate Medicare payments: The \n     Democratic Medicare plan would strengthen the Medicare \n     Secondary Payor Program, requiring Medicare to more \n     aggressively to collect payments due from private insurers. \n     It would also extend Medicare secondary payor provisions for \n     ESRD beneficiaries.\n       Employ more sophisticated, private sector computer \n     technology: Require Medicare contractors to employ code \n     manipulation detection software such as that widely used in \n     the private sector.\n       Increase incentives to expose Medicare fraud and abuse: \n     Establish rewards for reports by consumers that lead to \n     criminal convictions for health care fraud and encourage the \n     voluntary disclosure of fraud and abuse by health care \n     providers.\n       Simplify administration and reduce paperwork: Require a \n     uniform application process for health care providers seeking \n     to participate in Medicare.\n\n                    IV. Ensuring Medicare's solvency\n\n       Only $89 billion in savings--not the $270 billion proposed \n     by the GOP--are needed to keep the Medicare Trust Fund \n     solvent through at least the next decade. The Chief Actuary \n     of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), whose \n     estimates form the basis of the Medicare Trustees' \n     recommendations, has certified that an $89 billion reduction \n     in the rate of growth of Part A expenditures over the period \n     1996-2002 would extend the life of the Medicare Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund through at least the fourth quarter of \n     calendar year 2006.\n       This proposal would call for a series of measures to reduce \n     Medicare spending by $89 billion over the next seven years. \n     Savings would be achieved through the above-mentioned reforms \n     to Medicare's fee-for-service program and Medicare's private \n     health plan options, while slowing the rate of growth of \n     payments to providers. Special provisions are included to \n     assist rural hospitals. No new costs would be imposed on \n     beneficiaries.\n       This plan provides more reasonable reductions in all \n     categories:\n\n                          SENATE MEDICARE PLANS                         \n                        [In billions of dollars]                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                             Democrats      Republicans \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeniors and the disabled................              0              68 \nHospitals...............................             42              86 \nSkilled nursing facilities..............              6              10 \nHome health.............................              9              18 \nPhysicians..............................             11              23 \nHMO's...................................             23              50 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       While preserving Medicare's solvency until 2006, the plan \n     would help Medicare prepare for the challenges it will face \n     when the baby boom generation begins to retire in 2010. A \n     commission would be created, charged with conducting \n     strategic planning for the Medicare program to ensure that \n     recipients in the 21st century have available to them the \n     high quality and secure coverage that current beneficiaries \n     enjoy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is the amendment. It is very \ndifficult to understand what is in it. But let me make a point.

Mr. President, I understand now that if I send the \nHutchison amendment to the desk, which had previously been withdrawn--\nSenator Byrd objected, and he now has no objection. I send it to the \ndesk for immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mrs. \n     Hutchison, for herself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n     Stevens, Mr. Levin, Mr. Coverdell, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. \n     Thurmond, and Mr. Thomas, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3015.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n       The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (a) The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Human rights violations and atrocities continue \n     unabated in the former Yugoslavia.\n       (2) The Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights \n     recently reported that starting in mid-September and \n     intensifying between October 6 and October 12, 1995 many \n     thousands of Bosnian Muslims and Croats in Northwest Bosnia \n     were systematically forced from their homes by paramilitary \n     units, local police and in some instances, Bosnian Serb Army \n     officials and soldiers.\n       (3) Despite the October 12, 1995 cease-fire which went into \n     effect by agreement of the warring parties in the former \n     Yugoslavia, Bosnian Serbs continue to conduct a brutal \n     campaign to expel non-Serb civilians who remain in Northwest \n     Bosnia, and are subjecting non-Serbs to untold horror--\n     murder, rape, robbery and other violence.\n       (4) Horrible examples of ``ethnic cleansing'' persist in \n     Northwest Bosnia. Some six thousand refugees recently reached \n     Zenica and reported that nearly two thousand family members \n     from this group are still unaccounted for.\n       (5) The U.N. spokesman in Zagreb reported that many \n     refugees have been given only a few minutes to leave their \n     homes and that ``girls as young as 17 are reported to have \n     been taken into wooded areas and raped.'' Elderly, sick and \n     very young refugees have been driven to remote areas and \n     forced to walk long distances on unsafe roads and cross \n     rivers without bridges.\n       (6) The War Crime Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has \n     collected volumes of evidence of atrocities, including the \n     establishment of death camps, mass executions and systematic \n     campaigns of rape and terror. This War Crimes Tribunal has \n     already issued 43 indictments on the basis of this evidence.\n       (7) The Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights has \n     described the eye witness accounts as ``prima facia evidence \n     of war crimes which, if confirmed, could very well lead to \n     further indictments by the War Crimes Tribunal.''\n       (8) The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that \n     more than 22,000 Muslims and Croats have been forced from \n     their homes since mid-September in Bosnian Serb controlled \n     areas.\n       (9) In opening the Dodd Center Symposium on the topic of \n     ``50 Years After Nuremburg'' on October 16, 1995, President \n     Clinton cited the ``excellent progress'' of the War Crimes \n     Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and said, ``Those accused \n     of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide must be \n     brought to justice. They must be tried and, if \n\n[[Page S 16010]]\n     found guilty, they must be held accountable.''\n       (10) President Clinton also observed on October 16, 1995, \n     ``Some people are concerned that pursuing peace in Bosnia and \n     prosecuting war criminals are incompatible goals. But I \n     believe they are wrong. There must be peace for justice to \n     prevail, but there must be justice when peace prevails.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Senate condemns the systematic human rights abuses \n     against the people of Bosnia and Herzegovena.\n       (2) with peace talks scheduled to begin in the United \n     States on October 11, 1995, these new reports of Serbian \n     atrocities are of grave concern to all Americans.\n       (3) the Bosnian Serb leadership should immediately halt \n     these atrocities, fully account for the missing, and allow \n     those who have been separated to return to their families.\n       (4) the International Red Cross, United Nations agencies \n     and human rights organizations should be granted full and \n     complete access to all locations throughout Bosnia and \n     Herzegovenia.\n       (5) the Bosnian Serb leadership should fully cooperate to \n     facilitate the complete investigation of the above \n     allegations so that those responsible may be held accountable \n     under international treaties, conventions, obligations and \n     law.\n       (6) the United States should continue to support the work \n     of the War Crime Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.\n       (8) ethnic cleansing by any faction, group, leader, or \n     government is unjustified, immoral and illegal and all \n     perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide \n     and other human rights violations in former Yugoslavia must \n     be held accountable.\n\n  Mr. EXON. I yield back our time and support the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We yield back our time\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3015) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3016\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow qualified \nretiring farmers to rollover the gain from the sale of farm assets into \n an individual retirement account, provide an offset by improving the \n  application of the capital gains tax to sales of stock in domestic \n    corporations by 10 percent foreign shareholders, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, let me thank Senator Kohl, who has worked on \nthis for a long, long time. It is a very good amendment. He has worked \nwith the majority leader on this. We are enthusiastic about this on our \nside.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Byrd would like to have the amendment \nexplained.\n  Mr. KOHL. This amendment will allow family farmers--not farmers who \nare not farming the land, family farmers--who farm the land for \ngenerations, when they sell their farm to roll over up to $500,000 of \nthe proceeds into an IRA account. It only applies to hard-working \nfamily farmers.\n  We offset it by requiring those individuals from foreign lands or \ncorporations, foreign lands who own U.S. stocks who are not now subject \nto tax, when they sell that stock, they will in the future be required \nto pay a U.S. tax on the sale of that U.S. corporation stock that they \nown.\n  I think the offset is an outstanding offset and I think the purpose \nof the IRA is to reward hard-working family farmers. I think it is a \nreally good amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3016) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON.

GENERATIONAL ACCOUNTING IN PRESIDENT'S BUDGET.\n\n       Section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding at the end thereof the following:\n       ``(32) an analysis of the generational accounting \n     consequences of the budget including the projected Federal \n     deficit, at current spending levels, in the fiscal year that \n     is 20 years after the fiscal year for which the budget is \n     submitted and the revenue levels (including the increase \n     required in current levels) required to eliminate the \n     projected Federal deficit.''.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nall Senators should be able to agree on. It would require that the \nPresident's annual budget continue to include a chapter on generational \naccounting.\n  ``Generational accounting'' is a way to consider the fiscal treatment \nof different generations. Specifically, it indicates what the members \nof each generation can expect to pay on average, now and in the future, \nin taxes, as a result of current budget expenditures and revenues.\n  President Bush included a chapter on generational accounting in his \n1993 fiscal year budget and President Clinton included a chapter on \ngenerational accounting in his 1995 fiscal year budget--but he failed \nto include any mention of generational accounting in this year's \nbudget.\n  Thirty of the 32 of us on the bipartisan commission on entitlements \nand tax reform concluded that if we do nothing about the impending \nentitlements crisis, by 2012 every penny of our Federal revenues will \nbe necessary to pay for entitlements and interest on our national debt. \nIn 2040, our children and grandchildren will be forced to pay 40 \npercent of the national payroll tax base in taxes.\n  It is crucial that we begin to take a longer term view of the future \nand consider how the impact of our decisions today will affect our \nchildren and grandchildren. If you truly are concerned about the burden \nof taxes on those we love, then you will support this amendment.\n  For 2 days now, I have listened to my colleagues wail about the poor, \nthe young, the disenfranchised while they ignore the biggest crisis--\nthe impending bankruptcy of the Social Security Program. It is like \ncrying about slipping on a banana peel on the deck of the Titanic.\n  Our temporary fix for the Medicare Program is nothing more than \ndelaying the inevitable. My colleagues are cheering that Medicare will \nnot go broke in 2002, but rather in 2008. Now that is something to be \nproud of. Yet, we only have ourselves to blame.\n  In the past, the Social Security Advisory Council provided guidance \non Social Security and Medicare issues. However, we got rid of the \nAdvisory Council and instead created an Advisory Board--except that \nthey no longer provide guidance on Medicare issues. How ironic. The \nprogram that is going to the dogs first, is the program we decided we \ndo not want any guidance on.\n  So we have done it to ourselves. But we can stop this game-playing if \nwe are forced to consider what we are doing to future generations--and \nthis is why generational accounting is so important.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would simply require the annual budget \nof the President include a chapter on generational accounting. \n\n[[Page S 16011]]\n\n  The President of the United States, President Clinton, did a nice job \non that in the first budget message. It was left completely out of the \nsecond one.\n  I think it is vitally important we tell the American people 20 and 30 \nyears down the line who is paying the bills. I hope we can get back \nwhat President Clinton put in his first budget. This requires that so \nthat we know what is out there 20 or 30 years from now--generational \naccounting, who is paying the bills, who really cares about the \nchildren of the country and also deals with that issue in an upfront \nway.\n  Mr. EXON. We yield back our time and accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3017) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3018\n\n(Purpose: To provide States with the flexibility to continue to provide \n   medical assistance under the Medicaid program to certain disabled \n         individuals with incomes over 250 percent of poverty)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we have agreed on an amendment that has been \nworked on for a long time by Senator Wellstone.\n  I yield 30 seconds to him for the purpose of introducing the \namendment which both sides have agreed to accept.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is a Wellstone-Chafee amendment. I \nsend my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself and \n     Mr. Chafee proposes an amendment numbered 3018.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of section 2171(b) of the Social Security Act, \n     as added by section 7191(a), insert:\n       ``The Secretary may waive this section at the request of \n     the State for any category of individuals who, as of the date \n     of enactment of this title, would have qualified for coverage \n     under section 1915(c) and 1902(e)(3).''\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment that I send to the desk \nwith Senator Chafee would just provide States with the flexibility to \ncontinue to provide medical assistance under the Medicaid Program to \ndisabled individuals, especially children that are staying home, in \norder to make sure that they can continue to stay at home.\n  It is very important in the disability communities, and I am very \npleased to have the support from both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think we ought to accept this \namendment. This says States have the right to continue the same kind of \nservice they are giving now for disabled people.\n  It eliminates any concern that they might now have and mandates \nnothing. I think we should accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3018) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. I advise the Senate and the chairman of the committee that \nthe next four amendments all have to do with medical matters. We think \nwe have those bundled into one amendment that can be offered.\n  If required, though, I would like unanimous consent that we have \ntentatively agreed to; roughly, that if we have situations like this--\nin this case there are four introducers--if the introducers would like \n30 seconds each, we would grant them that to encourage further melding \nof these amendments that are similar into one amendment and therefore \nexpedite the process.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the minority leader agree with that? I had talked \nto him. It sounded a little different when he was proposing it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have no objection to that approach. I \nthink all Senators need to have the opportunity to express themselves, \nwhether it is a block of time or one person does it or individual \nblocks of time.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from West Virginia is very concerned \nthat everybody have a complete appreciation of what it is that these \namendments include. In this case, all of the amendments deal with \nMedicaid. They are interrelated and in some cases the original \namendments were overlapping. So it is our view it expedites not only \nthe process but the issue, in order to allow us to bring them up \ntogether.\n  So I think all concerns are served in this particular amendment. I \nhope we can support it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me just address this for a moment. Senator Byrd, as \nI understand it, if they would have sent their amendments up singly, \nthey would have had 30 seconds. That is the agreement. They are going \nto send up four together--three--and they will have 30 seconds on each \nof those and we will have 30 seconds to respond on each of those, which \nI think does nothing more than save us the time of three votes. The \nrest of the rights are all intact, as we have agreed to them here in \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. EXON. I was explaining that rather than four, we set aside the \nDodd matter, which will be considered separately. The Feingold, \nMoseley-Braun, and Rockefeller amendments are embodied under the \nagreement that we have worked out.\n  Pending final working out of some details, I suggest, since Senator \nDodd, whom I earlier thought was included in this, is not and since he \nis next on my list, at this time I yield 30 seconds to Senator Dodd for \nan explanation and the introduction of his motion that both sides have \nreceived some time ago.\n\n\n                         Dodd Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes a motion \n     to commit.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \nmotion be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion is as follows:\n\n       Mr. President, I move to commit the bill S. 1357 to the \n     Committee on Finance with instructions to report the bill \n     back to the Senate within 3 days (not to include any day the \n     Senate is not in session) making changes in legislation \n     within that Committee's jurisdiction to reduce revenue \n     reductions for upper income taxpayers by $51,000,000,000 in \n     order to--\n       (1) restore current law Medicaid eligibility for children \n     and pregnant women;\n       (2) include coverage of prenatal care and delivery services \n     for pregnant women and Early and Periodic Screening, \n     Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) for children;\n       (3) strike the 20 percent cut from title XX of the Social \n     Security Act;\n       (4) strike the cap on foster care administrative expenses;\n\n  Mr. DODD. This does three things. It restores Medicaid coverage for \npregnant women and children, both eligibility and benefits; it restores \nthe cut in title 20, which States are widely using for child care \nassistance; and, third, it restores the cut in foster care funds that \nStates use to investigate reports of child abuse and to recruit foster \nparents. Again, these are three issues I think most people here believe \nare critically important. This would restore those parts of the bill.\n\n\n                      children: caring has a cost\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to speak today about the children \nof this Nation, about my hope they will not give up hope, and my wish \nthey will look forward to a brighter future. I want to tell the \nchildren of this country and of my state--despite what is going on in \nthis current budget fight--there are adults who care about them.\n  I do not want to say the adults in the majority party don't care \nabout our children. This budget plan does make me wonder, however, \nwhether some Members of this austere body remember what it is like to \nraise children:\n  It makes me wonder whether some Members have ever really had to deal \nwith the modest problems and costs every working family has to deal \nwith: the costs of child care, the costs of medical care, the costs of \nschool lunch. \n\n[[Page S 16012]]\nI would simply remind those Members: caring does have a cost, and the \ncost is in no way reflected in this budget.\n  Children in this country feel like they have less to look forward to \nthan ever before. Many adults on this floor have decried the state of \nour children's present and future, and many of us have felt the eyes of \nthese kids upon us as we have cast a vote or made a speech.\n  So, here is what the majority will do for our kids in this budget: \nthey will take away the health care coverage that allows kids to be \nhealthy and ready to learn and grow. They will take away the child care \nthat allows kids' parents to work. And, they will take away the foster \ncare that helps kids in serious need.\n  Well, we have an amendment to this budget reconciliation bill to \nrepair the damage: it will restore current Medicaid coverage for \npregnant women and their kids, restore child care, and restore foster \ncare funding.\n  On Medicaid, we need to preserve a basic safety net for children born \ninto families of modest means. Medicaid is not free tummy-tucks for \nfolks who don't need it.\n  Medicaid provides preventive and emergency care for needy kids, and \nlong-term care for disabled children--who could be the children of any \nAmerican family. We are restoring Medicaid coverage for these children, \non a per-capita basis, instead of a block-grant that would cause them \nto compete against the elderly or other groups.\n  On child care, we cannot say to working mothers, struggling to stay \noff public assistance, ``Oh, by the way, we are cutting money that \nallows you to work for a living.'' The Republicans have cut $3.3 \nbillion in title XX child care grants to States at the same time they \nare promising $3 billion under welfare reform. Do not try and trick \nanyone. They are cutting child care--our amendment restores the cut.\n  On foster care, the majority is now going after children who do not \neven have birth-parents to rely upon. This cut is a classic: it tells a \nchild, ``we're really sorry that it's not working out with your folks, \nand that this is the toughest time in your life, but we cannot afford \nto pay for your foster care.'' Meanwhile, of course, the Republicans \nwant to give tax breaks to people who can already afford to leave their \nchildren in the care of a high paid nanny every day.\n  Mr. President, our children are more important to us than a number on \na balance sheet. I understand and agree we must balance the budget. We \nmust preserve a future for our children, by not handing down our debts. \nBut let us keep families alive, and able to work to support and raise \ntheir kids. Otherwise, we will shackle future generations with a much \nworse kind of debt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to table the Dodd motion.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the motion to table the \nDodd motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced, yeas 50, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 532 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Snowe\n     Wellstone\n  So, the motion to lay on the table the Dodd motion to commit was \nagreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nmotion was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, earlier we had suggested that three Medicare \namendments by Senator Feingold, Senator Moseley-Braun, and Senator \nRockefeller be combined into one. We agreed that each Senator would \nhave 30 seconds to explain their joint amendment.\n  At this time, I ask the Chair to recognize Senator Feingold, then \nSenator Moseley-Braun, and then Senator Rockefeller.\n  I congratulate them for expediting the process.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not believe consent has been given to \npackage amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, may we have order in the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if this were the only time we would have a \nrequest for three amendments in one package, it might be all right. My \nproblem with this is two or threefold. One, if we start down this road \nof packaging three amendments, the next time it will be four, and the \nnext time five. Suppose someone objects, and would like to vote against \none of the amendments in the package? He has to vote against the whole \npackage. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, if permission is given for this request, then I would assume \nour friends on the other side of the aisle will think they are entitled \nto package three or four amendments, but there may then be some \nobjections over here.\n  So it seems to me to at least prevent ill will, hard feelings, and \nstreamlining the process further--we do not know what we are voting on \nnow. It is an absolute absurdity what is going on here.\n  I am not going to object in this one instance. But who is going to be \nthe next to make such a request?\n  I do not object in this one instance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3019\n\n    (Purpose: To retain 1-year Medicaid coverage for recipients of \n assistance under State plans funded under part A of title IV who lose \n medicaid eligibility because of income when the recipient enters the \n                              work force)\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment appears in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to offer this amendment \nwith Senator Moseley-Braun and also Senator Feingold. It basically does \nthree things, and we combine them for the sake of efficiency.\n  We propose several improvements to the Medicaid Program. One is to \nhelp low-income families get health care when they move from welfare to \nwork. Second is to help seniors get long-term care. And third is to \nmake it much better for pregnant women and children----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from West Virginia has \nexpired.\n\n[[Page S 16013]]\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment provides for flexible \ncommunity and home-based, long-term care programs for individuals with \ndisabilities of any age that have been Medicaid funded by striking \nprovisions in the bill providing new tax expenditures for long-term \ncare insurance and expanded IRA's.\n  The amendment would save $2.3 billion over 7 years. It is based on a \nvery successful program in Wisconsin that has saved us hundreds of \nmillions of dollars by keeping people in the community rather than in \nnursing homes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 20 \nseconds.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, the other part of the amendment has \nto do with people who are transitioning from welfare to work so we can \nprovide that they will not lose health coverage, and particularly that \nthe children will not be put in jeopardy of losing their health care \nwhen their parents go into the work force. Over a million children will \nbe involved with this, Mr. President, and I encourage support for \nproviding a minimal safety net for them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I appreciate your graciousness. \nSenator Feinstein had an amendment like this and would like to be a \ncosponsor, and I ask unanimous consent she be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Moseley-Braun's amendment \ncreates new entitlements, not germane, mandates on the States that are \nnot found in the bill. Senator Feingold's long-term care amendment \nwhich has been added here--is that correct? Whose long-term care \namendment is here?\n  Mr. EXON. Senator Feingold.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Feingold, excuse me. He would destroy the badly \nneeded relief proposals and spend the money on Medicaid. The amendments \nare filled with these kinds of things, but overall they violate the \nBudget Act for germaneness, and I make a point of order.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act, I move to waive the sections of that act for the purpose of \nconsidering the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nmotion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act for the consideration of the amendment. The yeas \nand nays are ordered.

I might announce on our side, if Senator Pressler would \ncome to the floor. If he cannot make it for some reason, let us take \nSenator Grassley.

We do have the Mikulski amendment.\n  I recognize Senator Mikulski from Maryland for the purpose of--before \nI recognize her, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order that the \nSenator from Maryland be permitted to offer a motion to instruct \nconferees on the clinical lab standards at this time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Was that a consent request?\n  Mr. EXON. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have to object while I speak for a minute on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I thought it--recognizing the Senator's \nright, certainly, to object--I thought it had been cleared that I could \noffer my amendment and that it had been cleared with the Republican \nleadership. So I am happy to wait and let another amendment go by. I \nthink we need to clarify this situation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Why does the Senator need consent to proceed with an \namendment? Why? Does the Senator need unanimous consent?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. No.\n  I thought it was agreed that no one would object to this coming up, I \nsay to the Senator. I am surprised the Senator objected.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think we are going to be able to agree \nwith the Senator shortly. Can the Senator wait a little bit?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I will be happy to wait.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, since the Mikulski matter has been set aside \ntemporarily, the next amendment is an amendment regarding dairy, \noffered by the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold. I yield 30 \nseconds on our side to him for that stated purpose.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2999\n\n (Purpose: To strike the provision relating to the milk manufacturing \n  marketing adjustment which provides special treatment to California \n           cheese processors at a budget cost of $20 million)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I offer an amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Pressler, Senator Grams, Senator McCain, and Senator \nKohl, which I send to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Pressler, Mr. Grams, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Kohl, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2999.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 33, strike lines 21 through 24.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the 1990 farm bill contains a provision \ndesigned to prevent California cheese \n\n[[Page S 16014]]\nprocessors from receiving artificial milk manufacturing incentives \nwhich are significantly higher than those allowed in the rest of the \ncountry under the Federal milk product support program.\n  The reconciliation bill repeals this provision resulting in a $20 \nmillion cost to the Federal taxpayer by the purchase of additional \ncheese surpluses from California. This amendment strikes that provision \nand leaves current law intact and saves $20 million.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is amendment No. 2999.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is the amendment that was just described?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do I not have 30 seconds to respond?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Agriculture Committee bill would \nrepeal section 102 of the 1990 farm bill. Section 102 was put in that \nbill to override State operating orders. It has been in existence for 5 \nyears and has never been used.\n  It seems to me we ought to remain consistent and we ought to defeat \nthe amendment.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table amendment No. 2999. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 57, nays 42, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 534 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--57\n\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--42\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bradley\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Glenn\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     McCain\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Smith\n     Stevens\n     Wellstone\n  So the motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 2999) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there further amendments to the bill?\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am not quite certain where we are in the \nprocess. Some have suggested that we take a couple hours recess here to \ntry to get the amendments into a little group. I do not know how many \nare left. We do not have any idea how much longer it is going to take.\n  We are trying to decide whether to leave here at six and come back at \nnine in the morning, or whether to take an hour break and see if we \ncannot further winnow down the number of amendments. We would like to \nfinish it sometime tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/27/senate-section/article/S15999-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16014-S16067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask that we stand in recess for 20 minutes.\n  There being no objection, the Senate, at 3:46 p.m., recessed until \n4:17 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Presiding Officer (Mr. Coats).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I had a discussion with the Democratic \nleader, Senator Daschle. We have had discussions here with Members on \nboth sides.\n  It is my understanding we can now, maybe shortly, propound a list of \namendments and only those amendments would be in order. Hopefully, they \nwill not all be offered, but that is where we are right now.\n  I think, in the meantime, I am prepared to consent to the request of \nthe Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, who made a unanimous-\nconsent request that we might have a vote on a motion to instruct \nbefore passage rather than after passage.\n  I have no objection to that request. We are trying to work out the \nmotion itself.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the leader for his consideration. What, then, \nwould he advise me to do? Just wait patiently, as is my temperament?\n  Mr. DOLE. The Senator has always been patient. But I would ask that \nthe Senator be permitted to offer it before the vote rather than after \nthe vote. I make that unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. We will try to work it out so maybe it will go very \nquickly.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. In the meantime, I guess we can just continue back and \nforth.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think I have one here which I would like to go ahead \nand get done, which is an amendment of Senator Grassley regarding \nIndian health.\n  Mr. EXON. It has been approved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2955\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. \n     Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 2955.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 862, line 16.\n       Subsection (e) of Section 2123 is amended by adding ``, \n     other than a program operated or financed by the Indian \n     Health Service,'' after ``other federally operated or \n     financed health care program''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this has been cleared on both sides. \nSenator Grassley has taken an interest in a concern of the Indian \nHealth Service with reference to Medicaid and other third party \nreimbursement programs. This gives them permission to get involved in \nthat program as a health delivery system.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time. We agree \nwith the amendment. I ask for the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2955) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, moving ahead in the fashion in which we have \nbeen plowing ahead and making some progress, the next amendment on this \nside would be by the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin.\n  I yield our time on his amendment to him for the description and \nintroduction of the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3020\n\n  (Purpose: To support the President's promise in 1993 to not require \n significant additional cuts in programs that affect rural America, to \npreserve the safety net for family farmers which represent the backbone \n of American Agriculture, to maintain the competitiveness of American \n  Agriculture, and to ensure a future supply of American Agricultural \n                               products)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment appears in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself \nand Senators Daschle, Dorgan, Wellstone, Heflin, and Bumpers.\n  Basically, Mr. President, this is an agricultural substitute. It cuts \n$4.2 billion out of agriculture, not the $12.6 billion that is in the \nbill. It provides for a two-tier marketing loan system for wheat and \nfeed grains. And we offset the cost of the bill by striking the \nprovisions of the bill affecting the alternative minimum tax.\n  So basically, if you want a fairer farm bill for our farmers and \nrural people, this is it. It only cuts $4.2 billion, not the $12.6 \nbillion in the bill. And we do have an offset.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is a rewrite of the farm bill which \nis in this reconciliation bill. After much concern and consideration, \nthe Committee on Agriculture provided a farm bill which reforms much of \nagriculture in America.\n  I do not believe we ought to be undoing that here with a total \nsubstitute. It is not germane and is subject to a point of order under \nthe Budget Act. And I raise a point of order against the pending \namendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act \nfor the purpose of the consideration of the pending amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays on the motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes \n     amendment numbered 2986, as modified.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section: Sec.   . Sense of the Senate.--\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) The current Internal Revenue Code, with its myriad \n     deductions, credits and schedules, and over 12,000 pages of \n     rules and regulations, is long overdue for complete overhaul;\n       (2) It is an unacceptable waste of our nation's precious \n     resources when Americans spend an estimated 5.4 billion hours \n     every year compiling information and filing out Internal \n     Revenue Code tax forms, and in addition, spend hundreds of \n     billions of dollars every year in tax code compliance. \n     America's resources could be dedicated to far more productive \n     pursuits;\n       (3) The primary goal of any tax reform must be to unleash \n     growth and remove the inefficiencies of the current tax code, \n     with a flat tax that will expand the economy by an estimated \n     $2 trillion over seven years;\n       (4) Another important goal of tax reform is to achieve \n     fairness, with a single low flat tax rate for all individuals \n     and businesses and an increase in personal and dependent \n     exemptions, is preferable to the current tax code;\n       (5) Simplicity is another critically important goal of tax \n     reform, and it is in the public interest to have a ten-lined \n     tax form that fits on a postcard and takes 10 minutes to fill \n     out;\n       (6) The home mortgage interest deduction is an important \n     element in the financial planning of millions of American \n     families and must be retained in a limited form; and\n       (7) Charitable organizations play a vital role in our \n     nation's social fabric and any tax reform package must \n     include a limited deduction for charitable contributions.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should proceed expeditiously to adopt flat tax \n     legislation which would replace the current tax code with a \n     fairer, simpler, pro-growth and deficit neutral flat tax with \n     a low, single rate.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President--within 30 seconds--this amendment \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that Congress should proceed to adopt \na flat tax. It does not specify the precise type of a flat tax. There \nhas been a lot of expression in favor of a flat tax as being progrowth, \nnot regressive with a substantial exemption for individuals.\n  And I ask my colleagues to support this concept in general terms with \nthis sense of the Senate resolution.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this amendment has no effect on reducing the \ndeficit, which is what this bill is all about. It is a good political \nstatement for people who are involved in politics at this particular \ntime in the year. I think we do not have the time to look at this. I \nmay be for a flat tax at some time in the future, but this is not the \nplace or the time to put the Senate on record.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending \namendment is extraneous and violates the Byrd Rule, section \n313(b)(1)(A) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to waive that section.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is made to waive.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the motion to waive the \nBudget Act.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 17, nays 82.\n  \n[[Page S 16016]]\n\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 536 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--17\n\n     Baucus\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Campbell\n     Craig\n     Dole\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Helms\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Lott\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Reid\n     Specter\n\n                                NAYS--82\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe the next amendment that we have \nwould be by the Senator from New Jersey.\n  I yield 30 seconds for the purpose of an explanation of the amendment \nto the Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3023\n\n(Purpose: To strike sections 5400 and 5401 of the reconciliation bill, \n sections which provide for the discounted prepayment of construction \n     costs currently owed by farmers to the Federal government for \n   irrigation water provided under the Reclamation program, thereby \n  relieving them of the 960 acre limitation on delivery of federally \n   subsidized water contained in the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982)\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3023.\n       Strike sections 5400 and 5401.\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I move to strike sections 5400 and 5401 \nof the reconciliation bill. These provisions represent corporate \nwelfare at its worst. They direct costly Federal irrigation subsidies--\noriginally intended to support small family farmers--to the largest \nfarm operations in the West. They will benefit only a handful of \nwealthy individuals. I oppose granting additional subsidies to those \nleast in need of Federal handouts, and ask my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  When the Reclamation Program began in 1902, Congress provided low \ncost irrigation water to small, 160 acres or less, family farms. The \npolicy was intended to help small farmers; large farms were explicitly \nexcluded from the subsidies.\n  In 1982, Congress recognized that the average family farm had grown, \nand increased the acreage limitations from 160 acres to the present 960 \nacres. Holders larger than 960 acres were required to pay full cost for \nirrigating their excess holdings.\n  The reconciliation bill creates a loophole permitting the wealthiest \nfarmers to avoid paying full cost instead of the subsidized price. It \nallows farmers with excess holdings to prepay for their water--nothing \nwrong with that--but at the subsidized rates intended for small family \nfarms. For these large farm operations, the cost of prepaying could be \nless than the cost of 1 year's irrigation water. These individuals \nwould then be exempt forever from acreage limitations and full-cost \npricing, even if the Federal Government makes new investments that \nwould enhance their water projects. The net present value of the \nbenefits to these individuals--and loss to the U.S. Treasury--could \nexceed $1,000 an acre. How can we justify such welfare for the \nwealthiest?\n  As a result of this provision, the very family farmers for whom the \nReclamation Program was designed will face ever-larger competitors who \nobtain even greater subsidies than the small farmer. This change in \npolicy would be accomplished without hearings and without any \nmeaningful analysis of impacts, taxpayer costs, winners or losers. It \nalso is not fair to the many farmers throughout the West who have \ncomplied with the letter and intent of reclamation law, and did not \nseek additional discounts or waivers of key provisions of Federal law. \nI believe that allowing people to buy their way out of Federal \nregulations is fundamentally unfair; to offer them a discount just \ncompounds the inequity.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the motion \nby the Senator from New Jersey to strike the provisions in the title of \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources that would repeal the \nprohibition on prepayment of construction charges.\n  I read with some interest the ``Dear Colleague'' sent around by the \nSenator from New Jersey. It presents a curious and inaccurate history \nof reclamation provisions. Its description of the committee provision \nis also flawed. The letter uses the rhetoric of ``corporate welfare'' \nand ``costly * * * subsidies'' as if they were some magic incantation \nthat would transform the true intent of the motion. The committee \nlanguage does not create a loophole; it terminates a foolish \nrestriction inserted in the 1982 Reclamation Reform Act to prevent \nirrigation districts and individuals who hold repayment or water \nservice contracts from prepaying their debt. Prior to 1982, that \nlimitation did not exist.\n  The letter is not correct about the history of reclamation law that \nled to the 1982 act. The letter states that when the reclamation \nprogram began in 1902, Congress provided low cost irrigation water to \nsmall--160 acres or less--family farms. That sounds nice, but it simply \nis not true. First of all, Congress decided that unlike other public \nworks projects that had been fully funded by the Congress, in the case \nof reclamation projects, the beneficiaries would have to repay the \nFederal Government for their allocable costs. The irrigation component \nwould be without interest, but it would have to repaid. Contrast that \nwith the complete subsidy given to farmers who benefit from Corps \nprojects in New Jersey \n\n[[Page S 16018]]\nand elsewhere who repay nothing because their benefits are called flood \ncontrol.\n  The statement is also inaccurate in suggesting that Congress provided \nthe water, since in many of the early projects, such as the Newlands \nProject, the water users held, and still hold, the water rights. What \nthe Federal Government did was provide the financing for the storage \nand conveyance systems. Even where the Federal Government obtained the \nwater rights for a project, the Reclamation Act specifically required \nthe rights to be obtained in full compliance with State law, and the \nSupreme Court made it clear that the Federal Government held those \nrights as a trustee for the water users. Congress did not provide \nwater. In addition, the suggestion that Congress was providing low-cost \nwater would come as a surprise to the water users who were required to \nreimburse the Federal Government annually for all operation and \nmaintenance costs as well as a portion of the capital construction \ncosts. Granted the Federal Government was not seeking to make a profit, \nbut repayment was a new concept imposed on the reclamation program.\n  The statement also says that the program was limited to ``small (160 \nacres or less) family farms''. In fact, the reclamation program spoke \nof individual ownership limitations. Each person could own 160 acres. \nSo could that person's spouse and so could each of that person's \nchildren. A family with four children could own 960 acres. In addition, \nthere were no limitations on how much additional land could be leased. \nThat family could lease an additional thousand acres in addition to the \n960 acres it owned. One major problem that the 1982 reclamation reform \nsought to resolve was whether those acreage provisions applied only on \na district by district basis or Westwide. When the letter speaks of the \n1982 act easing ``the acreage limitations, raising them from 160 acres \nto the present 960 acres'', it is not being completely honest. In the \n1982 act, we set the acreage limit at 960 acres for an entire family \nincluding both owned and leased lands and then applied the limit \nWestwide. That was reform; it was not necessarily good news for large \nfamilies.\n  The letter describes the provision in the committee reconciliation \nbill--Part I of Subtitle E--as creating a loophole for large farmers. \nIn fact, the provision simply repeals a foolish limitation on \nprepayment that was inserted in the Reclamation Reform Act in 1982. \nThat limitation excluded any contract that already contained a \nprepayment provision, so it was discriminatory on its face.\n  The letter suggests that enactment is bad for family farmers who will \nface ever-large competitors who obtain even greater subsidies. That \nstatement is simply disingenuous. The reason for opposition to the \ncommittee provision has nothing whatsoever to do with concern for \nfamily farmers--or farmers in general. Prepayment eliminates the \nconstruction debt and the false accusation that the repayment is a \nsubsidy. What the proponents of this motion fear is the loss of their \nrhetoric. Upon payment of the construction debt, the operation of the \nproject is turned over to the water users. Section 6 of the 1902 \nReclamation Act provides in relevant part that ``when the payments \nrequired by this act are made for the major portion of the lands \nirrigated from the waters of any of the works herein provided for, then \nthe management and operation of such irrigation works shall pass to the \nowners of the lands irrigated thereby, to be maintained at their \nexpense.'' That is what really bothers the authors of this motion. They \nfear the loss of control and their ability to load totally unnecessary \ncosts onto the farmers in the Western States under the guise of \noperations.\n\n  Operation and maintenance will pass to the project beneficiaries as \nsoon as repayment is complete, and the acreage limitations will no \nlonger apply. It is not a concern for the family farmer that lies \nbehind this motion, but rather a desire to keep Federal control over \nfamily farmers for as long as possible. No one should misunderstand the \ntrue motives of those who support this motion. All you have to do is \nlook at the proposed regulations issued by Secretary Babbitt to see \nwhat the objective is. The regulations, which depend solely on \ncontinuing the construction debt, are part of the savage and \nunrelenting attack on water users in the West by this administration \nand its allies in the Congress.\n  The letter states that this is a change in policy that would be \naccomplished without hearings and without any meaningful analysis. In \nfact, the limitation on prepayment was specifically raised during our \nhearings on S. 602 earlier this year when witnesses noted the \nprohibition on prepayment as an obstacle to transfer of certain project \nfeatures. It was implicit in our field hearings on the Department's \nproposed regulations that were conducted in Twin Falls, ID and in \nRiverton, WY. I hope my colleagues who truly care about the farmers in \nthis Nation pay close attention to what this administration has \nproposed in these regulations. Under the guise of defining what \nconstitutes a lease, Secretary Babbitt is seeking to impose a new and \nonerous intrusion into individual farm operations.\n  Reclamation law speaks to ownership, land owned or leased, and \nCongress explicitly adopted an economic benefits test to distinguish a \nlease from a management agreement. Secretary Babbitt ignored the \nlegislation and its history to conduct his campaign of aggression on \nWestern farmers, and it is that campaign the authors of this motion \nseek to perpetuate. We have gone down that road several times. We have \nfaced efforts in the Energy Committee to use the mere sharing and \nequipment by farmers as an indicia of a lease, so we know what the real \nintent is.\n  Despite Congress's explicit adoption of the economic benefit test, on \nApril 3, 1995, Secretary Babbitt proposed new regulations that would \nadopt a far broader and more intrusive standard.\n  According to the proposed regulations:\n\n       Lease means any agreement between a landholder (the lessor) \n     and another party (the lessee) under which possession of the \n     lessor's land is partially or wholly transferred to the \n     lessee. Possession means the authority to make, or prevent \n     the lessor from making decisions concerning the farming \n     enterprise on the land; or the assumption of economic risk \n     with respect to the farming enterprise on the land. In \n     situations where possession has been partially transferred \n     from a landholder to another party, a lease will be \n     considered to exist if the majority of possession is not held \n     by the potential lessor. In situations where possession has \n     been transferred from a landholder to more than one other \n     party, a lease will be considered to exist between the lessor \n     and the party holding the greatest degree of possession.\n\n  In its analysis of the proposed rules (60 Fed. Reg. 16924) Interior \nexplains the lease definition change as follows:\n\n       Lease would be substantially modified. Under the existing \n     regulation, one of the key elements in the definition of \n     lease is the assumption of economic risk by the reputed \n     lessee. This definition permits the development of \n     arrangements under which an individual or legal entity is \n     paid a fixed fee for operating a farming enterprise. Since \n     the operator under these arrangements assumes no economic \n     risk, Reclamation currently does not deem the operator to be \n     in a lease relationship. Therefore, under the existing rules, \n     operators are not subject to full cost irrigation water \n     rates.\n       The new definition would make possession the singular \n     element indicating the existence of a lease. The definition \n     would eliminate economic interest as an essential element of \n     a lease (although economic risk would remain a factor \n     indicating the existence of a lease). Thus, under the \n     proposed regulation, whenever someone other than the \n     landowner has possession of non-exempt land, a lease would \n     exist. Reclamation would consider fixed-fee operations leases \n     and would subject the parties to full cost pricing if \n     possession of the land has been transferred, and if non-full \n     cost entitlement are exceeded.\n       The second and third sentences of the definition would \n     address the situation where more than one party has some \n     degree of possession; for example, a landowner may contract \n     with a farm manager but may retain some decisionmaking \n     authority.\n       Reclamation intends the proposed definition of the term \n     lease to exclude arrangements between landowners and custom \n     operators, employees, lenders, and other landholders with \n     whom farm equipment is shared.\n\n  Interior's examples show that even if a landowner ``retains all \neconomic risk associated with'' farming his land, if he does not ``make \nall major decisions concerning the farming operation,'' a lease will \nexist, and full cost will be charged. (60 Fed. Reg. 16929).\n  During our field hearings in Twin Falls, ID this August, Senator \nMcClure, the chairman of the Energy \n\n[[Page S 16019]]\nCommittee when the Reclamation Reform Act was adopted, made a very \neloquent statement on the effect and propriety of the proposed \nregulations. He stated:\n\n       Under the proposed regulations, if a farmer were to fall \n     ill and his children or neighbors were to take over the \n     management of the farm until he recovered, they would get a \n     bill for full cost from Secretary Babbitt.\n       If a farmer were to die and his children took over the \n     management of the farm so that their mother would not have to \n     sell off the homestead, Secretary Babbitt would send a bill \n     for full cost even if the children were not even reimbursed \n     for their costs.\n       If a farmer were called to military service and his father \n     took over the farm while he served his country, the President \n     would present him a medal and Secretary Babbitt would send \n     him a bill for full cost.\n       At the rate EPA is trying to regulate every aspect of our \n     lives, I guess we could send the bill for full cost to Carol \n     Browner.\n       The point I want to make is Congress settled this issue. \n     The test is beneficial interest measured solely by economic \n     benefit. That is the law and Secretary Babbitt lost.\n       Mr. Chairman, you have other witnesses who can testify to \n     equivalency, trusts, involuntary acquisitions, and other \n     provisions of these new rules. I will not go into them at \n     this time. What I want to emphasize is that these rules have \n     no foundation in law or legislative history. They are \n     symptoms of a larger struggle of federalism in which this \n     Administration seeks to abuse its authority and impose its \n     social agenda on the West. While there is an underlying \n     preoccupation with certain farm arrangements in California, \n     there is also a philosophy that Secretary Babbitt represents \n     that believes Washington should dictate the future of the \n     West. It is a philosophy that wants control of water and an \n     end to irrigated agriculture. It is a philosophy that hides \n     behind the need for conservation in the arid west to drive \n     its particular vision. This is an ongoing struggle that \n     surfaces here with attempts to make farming uneconomic and \n     municipal water supplies prohibitively expensive. It surfaces \n     elsewhere on grazing, on mining, on mineral leasing.\n       I take great pride in what I was able to accomplish in \n     returning salmon runs to portions of Idaho that had not seen \n     salmon in years. I managed to do that while respecting State \n     law and the primacy of State water law. I take great pride in \n     moving the Hells Canyon legislation through the Congress, but \n     I did that in full compliance with State law including \n     subjecting federal reserved rights to future upstream \n     beneficial uses. As anyone can see, we have not dried up the \n     Snake.\n       Mr. Chairman, the federal-state relationship is not one of \n     master-servant, as much as Secretary Babbitt may want it to \n     be. Federalism means a respect for the rule of law and a \n     recognition that this is a Republic of sovereign States with \n     a central government of limited delegated powers. These rules \n     violate that trust.\n\n  Mr. President, the sole reason behind the motion to strike is a \ndesire to continue the predation undertaken by Secretary Babbitt on \nWestern farmers. There is not the slightest concern for farmers, small \nor large, family or corporate. What the committee did was solely to \npermit individuals or districts holding repayment or water service \ncontracts to pay off the intolerable subsidy that the proponents of the \nmotion to strike have complained of for so long. The outrageous \ndiscount that the ``Dear Colleague'' complains of is language imposed \nby the Senator from New Jersey on the prepayments that he has agreed to \nover the past 6 years--it is his language. The language also includes a \nprovision that requires a premium if the district were to use tax \nexempt bonding--as many of them could. There is no such requirement in \nreclamation law or in any of the existing contracts that provide for \nprepayment or accelerated payment. That is a requirement also insisted \non by the Senator from New Jersey in our recent legislation and we have \nincluded it here.\n  In short, Mr. President, the cries of ``corporate welfare'' and \n``unwarranted subsidies'' ring very hollow when the true motivation is \nsimply to protect the scorched earth assault on the West being \nconducted by this administration through Secretary Babbitt and his \nallies. Even Director Rivlin plaintively objects to this provision as \nan unjustified provision allowing prepayment--unjustified solely \nbecause farmers might be able to go back to farming without fear that \nthis administration will succeed in driving them off their land.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield my 30 seconds to Senator Craig \nin opposition to the amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President I hope we could oppose this amendment.\n  In the bill we are attempting to pass, we are asking reclamation \nprojects ready to prepay to repay now upon a negotiated relationship \nwith the Bureau of Reclamation, to return money to the Treasury now.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is striking that. We think we have \ncrafted good law, which is exactly the intent of the original \nreclamation law, only we advance the opportunity to pay it out and then \nturn those authorities to the owners of the property according to those \nwithin the projects.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to table and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Chair has just requested that, I say to \nthe Senator from West Virginia.\n  What is the explanation of the amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. This amendment allows pregnant women to stay on food \nstamps, if they otherwise are eligible for food stamps, even after 6 \nmonths if they cannot find a job. This treats pregnant women with their \nfirst child in the same manner as women who care for dependent \nchildren. The amendment is paid for by cuts in the standard deductions. \nThe amendment saves money.\n  Without this change, pregnant women will be taken off food stamps in \ntheir third trimester of pregnancy if they cannot find a job.\n  That is a brief explanation of the amendment that has been agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the amendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 3024) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the reconciliation bill contains a \nprovision which would put the Hyde language permanently into law. This \nis the first time that this has been done. The Hyde language has always \nappeared in annual appropriations bills which are open to modification.\n  This provision, subsection 2123(g) of the Social Security Act, as \nadded by section 7191(a) in the reconciliation measure, does not \nproduce a change in outlays or revenues and is not necessary to \nimplement a provision that does change outlays or revenues.\n  I, therefore, raise a point of order under section 313(b)(1)(a) of \nthe Budget Act against that provision.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support for the \namendment offered by the Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, to \nstrike certain restrictive language from the Medicaid block grant \nportion of this bill, and I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this \nimportant amendment. I consider the inclusion of this language to be \nyet another attack on poor women waged by this Congress, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this motion to strike.\n  The Medicaid block grant proposal approved by the Senate Finance \nCommittee includes a provision which bars States from using Federal \nfunds to pay for most abortions for poor women. The bill allows States \nto use Federal dollars to fund abortions only in cases of rape, incest \nor where the mother's life is in danger. This is not a new idea--we \nhave seen restrictions like this one, known as the Hyde amendment, \nadded to appropriations bills year after year. The key difference is \nthat, now, this discriminatory ban could be made permanent--and I urge \nmy colleagues to join us in ensuring this does not happen.\n  Including this ban as a component of Medicaid law is an unprecedented \nand alarming evolution in the attempt to restrict women's access to \nabortion, and will have devastating effects on the women who rely on \nthe Medicaid program to provide health care coverage. Even more \noffensive, the target in this case is low-income women, who deserve the \nsame access to critical reproductive health services available to other \nwomen in this country. If we do not strike this language from the bill, \nwe are allowing Congress to single out poor women, and this sends a \nvery strong message to the women of this country.\n  This ban is shortsighted, careless, and insulting to women across our \nNation. Voting to include the Hyde language tells these women--we do \nnot care. Without providing coverage for abortion services, we will be \nsending low-income and poor women straight to the back alley where they \nwill be forced to choose unsafe alternatives and risky procedures--and \nmake no mistake, Mr. President--women will die.\n  Women who receive an average of $400 a month from public assistance \ncannot raise the estimated $300 for a first-trimester abortion. What do \nyou think a woman in this position will do? Will she divert money she \nshould be spending on rent? Will she be forced to use the money she \nsets aside to feed herself or her child she already has? Or will she \nchoose the cheaper, albeit unsanitary and dangerous, alternative? I do \nnot want to place poor women in the position of having to make this \nkind of choice. It is wrong and it is cold-hearted.\n  And lastly, Mr. President, how does this federally-mandated \nrestriction on how States can spend block granted funds fit into the \nmantra of the Republican reform agenda--State flexibility? This ban \ndoes not foster State innovation, and it certainly is not about getting \nWashington, DC out of local policy decision-making. In fact, this ban \nties the State's hands and is really nothing short of the kind of \nFederal micro-management the Republicans are usually so quick to \nattack.\n  I want to commend Senator Chafee for his commitment and his \nleadership on this issue. I know he tried to strike this restrictive \nand discriminatory language in Committee, but was unfortunately \ndefeated. I thank him for trying again here on the floor, and I am \nproud to join in his efforts. I urge my colleageus to support this \namendment.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the debate is over.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904(d) of the Budget \nAct, I move to waive the Budget Act for this provision if included in \nthe conference report on this measure.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma. On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 55, nays 44, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 539 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--55\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Coats \n\n[[Page S 16021]]\n\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Reid\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--44\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cohen\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Wellstone\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We want to do the same for \nSenator Nickles that we did for Senator Mikulski.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for Senator Nickles, \nimmediately after Senator Mikulski offers her motion to instruct, to \nmove to instruct the conferees with reference to the Hyde amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n\n\n                 mikulski motion to instruct conferees\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Kassebaum, Senator Snowe, Senator Boxer, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Murray, and Senator Moseley-Braun and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski] moves to instruct \n     the conferees on the part of the Senate to insist upon \n     guaranteeing to the American public that the quality and \n     effectiveness standards set forth by the Clinical Laboratory \n     Improvement Amendments of 1988 will be maintained by striking \n\n\n[[Page S 16022]]\n     certain provisions in the House amendment relating to section 353 of \n     the Public Health Service Act (standards that ensure quality \n     in testing for risk factors such as a heart attack or stroke, \n     kidney disease, prostate and colon cancer, gout and strep).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 30 seconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the purpose is to instruct conferees to \nreject the provisions in the House bill to repeal the Clinical Lab \nImprovement Amendments of 1988.\n  Before 1988, clinical labs lacked uniform standards. Dirty labs were \ntolerated. Tests were misread. Diseases were misdiagnosed. Staff was \ninadequately trained and overworked. People died of sloppy work.\n  What does the House bill do? It repeals CLIA '88 for all physicians' \nlabs except when the labs conduct Pap smears. I urge conferees to stick \nwith the Senate position and to reject the House repeal of CLIA '88.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what CLIA is. And why it is so important.\n  CLIA '88 set for the first time uniform quality standards for all \nclinical labs. I am proud that this law, which I authored, was passed \nwith broad bipartisan support.\n  CLIA was passed in 1988 and implemented in 1992 to address serious \nand life-threatening conditions in clinical labs.\n  To now even suggest we turn back the clock to pre-1988 will have \ndevastating results. Do we really want to:\n  Turn back to a time when tests were misread and diseases \nmisdiagnosed.\n  Turn back to the bad old days of misdiagnosis of the HIV/AIDS virus, \nwhen doctors were using inferior methods of reading slides; when people \nwith the virus went undetected because the virus was mutating and was \nunrecognized by physicians.\n  Or turn back to a time when the lab technicians were overworked and \nundersupervised, when slides were taken home, when dirty labs were \ntolerated, when lab technicians had little or no formal training, \nresulting in many diseases going undetected.\n  My colleagues, CLIA works. It works because CLIA saves lives.\n  Prior to CLIA, women were dying after having pap smears misread 2 or \n3 years in a row.\n  Prior to CLIA, complex tests for heart disease, conducted improperly, \nput patients at risk of serious impairment or death. As we know, \nmedical conditions like heart disease not detected early, not only are \nmore expensive to treat but result in certain disability or death.\n  Today, the stakes are high for quality lab tests and diagnosis. The \nneed for quality testing for HIV and AIDS and the impact this has on \nour communities is without question. We are talking here about a matter \nof life and death.\n  CLIA ensures quality testing and quality laboratories.\n  For the first time, all labs that perform similar tests must meet \nsimilar standards, whether located in a hospital, a doctor's office or \nother site.\n  Americans must be assured that all labs are of the highest quality \nand performance standards.\n  CLIA saves tax dollars by curbing fraud and abuse.\n  An unexpected benefit of the CLIA law has been to weed out the most \nunscrupulous of labs that run scams and take advantage of the most \nvulnerable members of our society.\n  Today, CLIA is threatened. Why?\n  The House Reconciliation bill repeals CLIA for all physician labs \nexcept when the lab conducts pap smears. No hearings, no review of the \nInspector General's report on the impact of CLIA, no opportunity for \nthe public to respond.\n  The House even recognized the importance of CLIA by carving out one \nexemption--for labs that conduct pap smears.\n  My question is this: Does the Senate really want to tell somebody \nfacing the prospect of heart attack or diabetes, that we do not care \nthat your tests are performed adequately?\n  That we only care if quality standards are met for one particular \ntest and not the entire battery of other life-saving tests being \nconducted? I do not think so.\n  Quality standards in labs are critical to saving lives. Uniformity is \nthe key. Safe and effective standards are the goals of CLIA--no matter \nwhere the lab is located--in a hospital, doctor's office or other \nhealth setting.\n  My colleagues, the Senate position is right. The Senate wisely left \nCLIA alone.\n  Changes in CLIA should not be done in the context of Reconciliation, \nbut should be done with careful and deliberate consideration in the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee.\n  CLIA is so important. We should not act hastily. To do otherwise, \nputs lives in danger, puts families at risk. I am not willing to take \nthat chance, are you?\n  My motion is simple. Stick with the Senate position. Leave CLIA \nalone.\n  I urge support for the Mikulski motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote no on this \nmotion, because the House had some provisions to allow some flexibility \nfor physicians to conduct tests in their offices.\n  Frankly, we are talking about some simple tests; in some cases, strep \ntests or blood tests. CLIA, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act, \ndrives up the cost of doing a lot of these tests, in some cases makes \nit prohibitive to do it, so they have to send off the test to the \nbigger cities. That wastes time, it wastes money, it makes health care \na lot more expensive and dangerous in many areas of the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 49, nays 50, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 541 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--50\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  So the motion was rejected.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, the Chafee point of order, a few minutes \nago, removed the Hyde language, which \n\n[[Page S 16023]]\nis no Federal funding for abortions except in the case of rape, incest, \nor life to the mother, which has been on the books a long, long time.\n  Basically, the Nickles and Smith motion would instruct the conferees \nto preserve the status quo on Federal funding of abortions.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we previously voted on my plan during \nconsideration of the budget resolution. I received 39 votes. Today, if \nwe held a vote, I might add a few votes to that total but I am under no \nillusion that I would prevail.\n  In order to spare my colleagues another rollcall vote and in the \nfleeting hope that I might inspire some of my other colleagues to \nwithdraw amendments that are not absolutely necessary we vote on this \nevening, I withdraw my motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is withdrawn.\n  So the motion was withdrawn.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague for his fine \nstatement.\n  I might suggest we move two other matters I understand we have \nclearance on--the Lott amendment and the Bingaman amendment.\n\n\n                             Change of Vote\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent on behalf of \nSenator Helms that on rollcall vote 520 wherein he voted no be changed \nto aye. He made a mistake, and the changing of this vote will not \naffect the outcome.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3026\n\n(Purpose: To eliminate reasonable cost reimbursement under the Medicare \n  Program of legal fees after an unsuccessful appeal of denied claims)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On behalf of Senator Bingaman and myself, I offer an \namendment looked at by our Finance Committee, and which is obviously \nsatisfactory on that side.\n  We believe the Medicare law already prohibits payments to providers \nfor legal fees when the providers lose an appeal.\n  However, the GAO has reported some loopholes in the Medicare law so \nthat this might not be the effect out in the field--even losers may \ncollect losers' fees.\n  This will correct the situation. I send the amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for himself and \n     Mr. Bingaman proposes an amendment numbered 3026.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in subtitle A of title VII, insert \n     the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . ELIMINATION OF REASONABLE COST REIMBURSEMENT FOR \n                   CERTAIN LEGAL FEES.\n\n       Section 1861(v)(1)(R) (42 U.S.C. 139x(v)(1)(R) is amended \n     by striking ``section 1869(b)'' and inserting ``section \n     1869(a) or (b)''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to \nprohibit the payment of legal expenses to providers when they appeal \nthe denial of a claim or cost adjustment and lose that appeal. \nProviders would still be able to recover other legal expenses, \nincluding the cost of an appeal if they prevail on the appeal under the \nprovisions of this amendment.\n  The amendment would save money for Medicare part A and prevent a \npotentially large abuse of the current system. The Federal Government \nshould not be paying for individuals or corporations to sue the Federal \nGovernment especially when they sue and lose their appeal.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield back our 30 seconds. I agree with \nthe understanding that has been made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \n\n[[Page S 16024]]\n\n  So the amendment (No. 3026) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3027\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Civil War Battlefield Commemorative Coin Act of \n                     1992, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On behalf of Senator Lott and Senator Jeffords, I send \nanother amendment to the desk.\n  This is to amend the Civil War Battlefield Commemorative Coin Act of \n1992, which I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. Lott, \n     for himself, and Mr. Jeffords proposes an amendment numbered \n     3027.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 205, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3005. AMENDMENTS TO THE CIVIL WAR BATTLEFIELD \n                   COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT OF 1992.\n\n       (a) Distribution and Use of Surcharges.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 6 of the Civil War Battlefield \n     Commemorative Coin Act of 1992 (31 U.S.C. 5112 note) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 6.

Mr. President, the Congress passed commemorative coin \nlegislation in 1992. These funds were to be used for the preservation \nand acquisition of Civil War battlefields.\n  Proceeds from the sale of the coins have been accumulating in the \ntrust fund, rather than being spent to purchase land.\n  This amendment will not add to the deficit; it merely will require \nthat these funds be used for their original purposes.\n  Under this amendment, the funds would be used to purchase land only \nin places where there is already a commitment of private matching \nfunds. The $4.8 million designated here will purchase $24.1 million in \nbattlefield land; that is 20 percent coin revenues leverages the \nremaining 80 percent from other sources.\n  If these funds are not expended, options on the land will be lost and \nthe battlefields will be developed rather than preserved.\n  Mr. EXON. I have to advise my colleague, I thought this was cleared. \nI am now advised we have one Senator that has asked to be consulted on \nthis yet.\n  I am wondering if we could hold this up momentarily.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if we could accept the \namendment without reconsideration.\n  Mr. EXON. I apologize. I thought it was cleared. I think we can clear \nit if we can hold it over temporarily.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that it be temporarily set \naside, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I believe the next amendment is another \namendment by the Senator from Arkansas with regard to asset sales. For \nthe purpose of introducing that amendment and explaining it, I yield \nour 30 seconds to the Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3028\n\n(Purpose: To restore fiscal sanity to the budget process by prohibiting \n  the scoring of asset sales to ensure that taxpayers are adequately \n                               protected)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for himself, Mr. \n     Bradley, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3028.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill add the following new title:\n\n                      ``TITLE XIII--BUDGET PROCESS\n\n       ``For purposes of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the \n     amounts realized from sales of assets shall not be scored \n     with respect to the level of budget authority, outlays or \n     revenues.''\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, from 1987 until 1995 we had a specific \nprohibition against scoring asset sales for a very good reason. You \ncannot balance the budget by selling off all our assets. It is like \nRudolph Penner who talked about the lawyer coming home one night and \ntold his wife he had a great day. She said, ``What happened?'' He said, \n``I sold my desk.''\n       The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n       Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, did we miss something?\n       Mr. EXON. Yes. But it is all right.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the asset sale \nscoring prohibition amendment jointly offered by Senators Bumpers, \nBradley, and me.\n  The budget resolution before us has been termed an historic document. \nIt certainly is. For the last decade, the Congress of the United States \nhas recognized that our public lands and other Federal assets were too \nprecious to sell or lease unless Congress or the Administration decided \nthat so doing was in the best interest of the public. That is good \npolicy and one that traditionally has enjoyed strong bi-partisan \nsupport.\n  But it is a new day. Today, we may well vote to sell our children's \nheritage to pay our debts. I reject this approach to debt reduction and \nI reject this approach to disposition of our Federal assets.\n  While this bill only puts up for sale the rights to develop oil and \ngas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, these wilderness lands are \nonly the beginning. Other public lands, national treasures and assets \nare being proposed for sale in the House budget reconciliation bill and \nmore likely will be targeted next year and the year after. Henceforth, \nunless this amendment is adopted, any public lands or Federal assets \ncan be sold for the quick cash and political capital gained from \nbalancing the budget in a given year. It is a dangerous, bad precedent.\n  Mr. President, our assets should not be sold simply to reduce the \ndeficit. Instead, our Federal assets should be sold only when, after \nreasoned debate and a full public airing, we decide their sale is in \nthe best interest not only of our generation--but of every generation \nthat follows. We owe our children much more than a balanced budget. We \nowe them their heritage.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support our important \namendment and thwart efforts to sell our heritage for quick cash.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bumpers/Bradley \namendment to restore the traditional method of scoring asset sales that \nthe Congress changed last June in the Budget Resolution. The change \nallows Congress to count the sale of public assets--parks, powerplants, \nbuildings, \n\n[[Page S 16025]]\nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, even oil in national storage \nfacilities --as deficit reductions despite the fact that such sales are \nactually money-losers.\n  This budgetary innovation opened the floodgates for proposals to \nunload valuable Federal assets in return for the fast buck, often at \nfire-sale prices. Many of these proposals, in fact, will lead to \nreduced revenues in the future, and higher deficits. This approach \nrelies on political myopia--a simpleminded scoring of sales revenue \nwithin the limited budget window--and fails to withstand the straight \nface test. Only by railroading these proposals through the Senate, \nunder the very restrictive and controlled conditions of budget \nreconciliation, would many of these proposals ever have a chance of \nbecoming law.\n  The Energy Committee's title is loaded down with asset sales that \nfollow the same pattern. While they produce deficit reductions in their \nfirst few years, as valuable assets are sold off, after a few years the \npattern reverses and deficit reductions are turned into increases. In \nmost cases the red ink continues far out into the future, easily \ndwarfing the deficit reductions of the early years. Thus asset sales \nare both short term and short sighted.\n  Why we produce these budget resolutions in the first place? The \nreason is not to balance the budget. If it were, I am sure we could \ncreate some appropriate fiction which showed budgetary balance by \ndefinition.\n  But that is not what we were supposed to be doing here. We are \nsupposed to be systematic. We are supposed to be honest. We are \nsupposed to be consistent. We are supposed to address the substantive, \nstructural issues which keep the Federal Government spending--year in, \nyear out--more money than it takes in.\n  So what do we have here, buried deep in this bill? We have a trick, a \ngimmick. We cut spending, by redefining what a cut is. Now, for the \nfirst time since we gave this budget process teeth--with the passage of \nGramm-Rudman--we can sell off national property--national assets--and \ninclude the proceeds as deficit reduction.\n  Mr. President, because of these cynically clever changes, we can now \npropose all sorts of asset sales, from ANWR to the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve, and chalk that up to deficit reduction.\n  This asset sale formula leads to all sorts of questionable proposals. \nBecause even outrageously low sales prices would still score as deficit \nreductions for the short period of the budget window, asset giveaways \ncould receive a budget blessing.\n  In fact, I doubt that any business accountant or economist would \nagree with the underlying budgetary premise--that liquidating public \nassets adds to public wealth. If I sell my stock portfolio and put the \nreturns in my checking account, do I become wealthier? Have I protected \nmy children? It may make sense to sell my stocks, but the transaction \nitself produces no wealth--except for my broker.\n  Consider the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We can lease the Refuge \nto oil developers and sell any oil that might be underground to them. \nWe will get some money. The companies will get the rights to oil. If \nthey find oil, probably it will be shipped to the Pacific rim and \nburned completely. Have we done a lot for our kids? You must be joking.\n  At best, we can claim for our children a neutral financial \ntransaction. But what about the larger issues? If we go ahead with the \ndevelopment of ANWR, we damage probably irrevocably a unique, world-\nclass ecosystem. We consume utterly a non-renewable resource. We get \nsome cash.\n  If we forego the drilling of ANWR, we preserve intact this ecosystem. \nWe preserve intact any oil underground and the possibility of future \ndevelopment. We do not get the cash.\n  I, frankly, reject any claim that our children will thank us for \nusing up this oil and running oil rigs and oil pipelines across the \nArctic Plain.\n  Mr. President, what the American public expects, and what our \nchildren expect, is for us to get our fiscal house in order. Our \nchildren are not asking us to sell off their collective inheritance. \nOur children are not asking us to look narrowly at some budget window \nand forget that many of these assets produce public value--and I do not \njust mean financial value--beyond the window.\n  When one Member from the other side of the aisle, Senator Craig, \nconsidered this issue as a House Member, he said, ``Asset sales are in \nfact blue smoke and mirrors at best. If they are to happen, they should \nbe set off budget.'' Exactly right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not think I will even address the amendment.\n  Mr. President, the amendment does not produce a change in outlays or \nrevenues and is not necessary to implement the provisions of this \nbudget. Therefore, I raise a point of order that the amendment violates \nthe Budget Act.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act \nfor the consideration of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays on the motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I know of no legal or constitutionally binding reason why \nthe Senate has to ever pass a reconciliation bill. It may have some \nbudgetary consequences if the Senate does not. But as long as we are \ngoing to pass such a bill--and I assume that we will continue to do so \nfor a while--we should lengthen the time for debate.\n  This is not a partisan amendment. It is not a political amendment. It \nis for the good of the institution----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. The budget process, and the good of the American people.\n  I hope Senators will vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President and fellow Senators, it is with greatest \nrespect and some degree of sorrow that I have to raise the Byrd rule \nagainst the amendment.\n  But Senator Byrd has made sure under the rules that you cannot change \nthe budget or the Budget Act without sending the matter through the \ncommittee of jurisdiction. So this amendment will increase from 20 to \n50 hours the time limitation on debate on future reconciliation \nmeasures; increase the time limitation from 10 to 20 hours on Senate \nconsideration of conference reports; and, therefore, it violates the \nBudget Act.\n  I make a point of order against it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I believe the clerk read the wrong \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is correct. The \nChair will correct it. The amendment is 2942, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself and \n     Mr. Dorgan, proposes an amendment numbered 2942.\n\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Does the Senator want to do this one?\n  Mr. BYRD. I want the amendment that I wanted called up.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We assumed that was the amendment.\n  I ask for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. This is the amendment that extends the time for debate from \n20 to 50 hours on reconciliation measures and from 10 to 20 hours on \nconference reports.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, may we hear the Senator on this very \nimportant matter?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is correct. The \nSenate will please come to order. The Senator from Nebraska has 22 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, pursuant to section 313(d) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I raise a point of order that several \nprovisions in the list I now send to the desk are extraneous and \nviolate the Byrd rule, section 313(b)(1) of that act.\n  My point of order objects to about 50 provisions that the \nParliamentarian has confirmed violate the Byrd rule against extraneous \nmatter in reconciliation because they have nothing to do with deficit \nreduction, worsen the deficit, or otherwise violate the rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I might request of the Senator from \nNebraska, this is a very important subject matter and the Senator has \nbeen selective. There are many. I wonder, if the Senator would give us \na little time to review it.\n  Mr. EXON. Yes, I will be glad to do that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will not take a long time. We would like to review \nit and discuss it with the Senator.\n  Mr. EXON. That is perfectly reasonable.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. EXON. We will lay that temporarily aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the point of order will be \nset aside.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the next amendment is an amendment that the \nSenator from Arkansas is prepared to offer--I do not see the Senator \nfrom Arkansas on the floor--with regard to mining payments and \nroyalties. I have not been advised by the Senator he does not wish to \noffer the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I advise my friend from Arkansas that he is up next on \nthe mining patents and royalties amendment. Does the Senator wish to \noffer that amendment?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I do.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 30 seconds of my time to the Senator from Arkansas \nfor that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike ``for'' on line 4 of page 369 through ``thereby'' on \n     line 19 on page 395.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, there is some confusion about what fair \nmarket value is in this bill. This amendment simply says that the \nmining industry, when they apply for patents from the Interior \nDepartment for land, will pay fair market value.\n  Fair market value means just what it says: Land and minerals. Is that \nfair? All you have to do is vote ``aye'' and the U.S. Government will \nreceive fair market value.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this is the same item we have already \ndealt with in budget reconciliation. In fact, we already voted on this. \nIt will be a repeat of the same amendment my friend from Arkansas \nproposed previously.\n  Given Senator Bumpers' rhetoric and the ``we only print one-side of \nthe issue'' perspective of the national media, it is difficult to get a \nclear understanding of what's going on with mining law reform in the \n104th Congress.\n  Senator Bumpers, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, and the \nnational media are long on mining law rhetoric but short on substance.\n  Senator Bumpers often argues the goal of mining law reform should be \nsignificantly revise patenting, to impose a royalty on the production \nof hardrock minerals, and to establish a mechanism to clean up \nabandoned mines throughout the country.\n  I happen to agree, but would quickly add one more essential point. \nAny reform bill passed by Congress should also aim to preserve the \neconomic foundation of hardrock mining in this country--a critical \nindustry that provides high-paying jobs for tens of thousands of \nAmerican men and women.\n  It is on this point that legislation sponsored by mining critics like \nMr. Bumpers falls flat on its face. The punitive royalties and onerous \nenvironmental provisions he favors would make future mining on Federal \nlands nearly impossible.\n  Economic analyses of Senator Bumpers' comprehensive mining law reform \nlegislation, including in-house studies done by the Department of the \nInterior, conclude that the punitive royalty supported by Senator \nBumpers will cost thousands of U.S. jobs. His legislation would shift \nexploration and development capital over seas, export U.S. jobs, \ndecrease our tax base, and increase our balance of trade deficit.\n  I take strong exception to criticisms that members representing \nwestern mining States oppose mining law reform legislation. What we \noppose is punitive legislation that would cause unnecessary economic \nharm to rural mining communities across working America.\n  In our effort to impose a royalty on the hardrock mining industry we \nshould not presume that more is better.\n  One would hope that Congress would learn from history. In 1990, when \nCongress enacted the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, we imposed a \nsignificant tax on luxury items, including high-end luxury yachts. \nUnfortunately, instead of taxing the rich, this recklessness destroyed \nthe yacht building industry and eliminated thousands of jobs in this \ncountry.\n  In addition, we should learn from our foreign competitors. In 1974, \nBritish Columbia enacted the Mineral Royalties Act, which imposed \nroyalties on mines located on Crown Lands and the Mineral Land tax Act \nwhich subjected owners of private mineral rights to royalties \nequivalent to those applied to Crown Lands. The result was a disaster.\n  During the period the royalty was in effect, no new mines went into \nproduction and several mines closed. Two years later, after thousands \nof mine related jobs were lost, the royalty was repealed.\n  Should the hardrock mining industry pay a royalty to the Federal \nGovernment? The answer is yes. But let's not make it so punitive that \nwe destroy the industry or run it off-shore. We need to remember, just \nlike Arkansas rice farmers, the domestic mining industry must compete \nin a worldwide market.\n  At the outset of the 104th Congress, I cosponsored the Mining Law \nReform \n\n[[Page S 16028]]\nAct of 1995 (S. 506), a bipartisan bill that recognizes the world of \nchange in which we now live. The bill balances economic reality with \nthe environmental concerns facing today's hardrock mining industry. \nI've actively pursued enactment of this legislation during the past \nseveral months.\n  It's worth noting that Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt \ncontinues to issue press releases decrying the shortcomings of the \nexisting mining law. Yet he offers no reform proposal of his own. Why? \nVery simply, it is much easier to be critical than to be constructive.\n  It's no secret this is a divisive issue. In an effort to strike an \nacceptable compromise, the Senate Energy Committee included mining law \nreform provisions in its budget reconciliation package.\n  Those provisions represent significant compromise by both sides in \nthis debate.\n  For the first time in history, the legislation would require miners \nto pay fair market value for the surface estate of patented land.\n  For the first time in history, the legislation requires patented land \nused for nonmining purposes to revert back to the Federal Government.\n  This would end the so-called Federal land give-away.\n  For the first time in history, miners would be required to pay a \nroyalty to the Federal Government for the production of minerals on \nFederal land.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates the royalty will generate \nover $36 million dollars during the first 7 years. As new projects come \ninto production, revenues received from the royalty are expected to \nincrease to $25-$50 million per year.\n  Finally, for the first time in history, we would create an abandoned \nmine land fund [AML fund], establishing a mechanism to clean up old \nmines, many of which were abandoned in the 1800's.\n  The program will be financed by one half of the royalty receipts. As \nroyalty revenues increase, funds for the AML fund will also grow.\n  The legislation contained in the committee's reconciliation package \nanswers the urgent call for increased Federal revenue without adding \nlayers of crippling new Federal regulations or usurping the rights and \nresponsibilities of individual States to oversee mining operations \nwithin their own jurisdictions.\n  Simply put, it would significantly revise the existing patenting \nsystem; impose a royalty on the production of minerals; and create a \nmechanism to fund the cleanup of abandoned mines; all while allowing \nAmericans to enjoy the benefits of a strong domestic mining industry.\n  It's time for mining critics to stop the rhetoric and begin working \nto enact reform.\n  Senator Bumpers' amendment is not a good faith effort at enacting \nresponsible reform. His claims of a Federal land give-away cannot hold \nwater in the face of the dual requirements in budget reconciliation of \nfair market value for the surface of patented lands and a royalty on \nproduced minerals from the subsurface.\n  The time is right for reform. The language in the budget \nreconciliation package represents comprehensive reform that ends the \nso-called Federal give-away, and according to CBO, raises $148 million \ndollars.\n  I urge critics of the mining industry to support the mining law \nprovisions in the budget reconciliation package and oppose the \namendment being offered by Senator Bumpers.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered denies \na tax deduction for the expense of advertising tobacco products. \nFederal savings of $3.2 billion would be used to offset cuts in \nMedicaid. Currently tobacco manufacturers deduct the cost of their \nadvertisements from their taxable income. In other words, it favors the \nJoe Camel ad. This amendment would eliminate that deduction.\n  The amendment would not prohibit tobacco manufacturers from \nadvertising their products. It only removes the Federal subsidy through \nthe Tax Code for their advertising.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this denies a legitimate business from \ntaking a deduction under legitimate costs. And it will go to all \ncompanies in the future, if we allow this one to prevail.\n  So, Mr. President, I raise a point of order against the pending \namendment. It violates section 305(b) of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1994 because it is not germane.\n  Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, I am pleased to report that two Senators \nhave been successful in working together to offer two amendments in a \njoint form. The two Senators are Senator Dorgan and Senator Harkin. I \nyield each of them 30 seconds as per the previous arrangement.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will still report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3033.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It changes \nthe capital gains portion of the legislation. It would provide that if \nyou hold an asset for 10 years, this would exclude up to $250,000 of \ncapital gains--an exclusion, twice as much benefit for the first \nquarter of a million dollars in capital gains. But that is what the \nlimit would be. It actually saves $10 billion over the capital gains \nprovisions in the bill.\n  I yield to Senator Harkin for the explanation of the second provision \nin the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is the so-called Benedict Arnold \namendment. Many of the very wealthy individuals who renounce their U.S. \ncitizenship then later reside in the United States for up to 180 days. \nUnder this amendment, such individuals would resume paying taxes in the \nUnited States as if they were resident aliens similar to U.S. citizens \nif they would stay in the United States for 30 days.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As to Senator Harkin's portion of the bill, let me \nremind Senators, Senator Moynihan had put this provision together. And \nit strikes an appropriate balance. This would essentially do away with \nthe Moynihan balance in this bill.\n  The Dorgan part of this limits the capital gains tax to a lifetime of \n$250,000. This would be incredibly difficult to keep track of and \nalmost impossible to enforce if it was fair.\n  I move to table both amendments. They are both en bloc.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment eliminates the special 22 \npercent percentage depletion allowance for certain mine substances--\nasbestos, lead, mercury, and uranium.\n  It would allow mining companies to deduct only the cost of their \ncapital investments as other businesses have to do. The amendment would \nsave $83 million over 5 years, and the bulk of this tax break goes to \nlead mining. I do not think that makes any sense to have this kind of \nsubsidy when State and local and Federal health officials and \nenvironmental agencies are spending precious resources for lead \nabatement and testing. \n\n[[Page S 16031]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe permitted to change my vote. This will in no way change the outcome \nof the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I wonder if we can take a short reading on \nwhat may be happening tonight or tomorrow.\n  I have had a discussion with the distinguished Democratic leader, \nSenator Daschle, and I think he is prepared to give us a fairly \noptimistic report on amendments left on that side.\n  I will be happy to yield to the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have consulted with colleagues, and I \nthink we are down to five amendments. One of those may fall. We are \nwithin reach now. That is the total on our side.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think on this side we have just the \nFinance Committee amendment. As I have indicated, there would be some \nadditional debate on that--probably not more than 10 minutes will be \nallotted--because it is a 46-page amendment.\n  I know the Senator from Florida was suggesting additional debate \ntime.\n  I say to my colleagues, if we can move as quickly as we can here and \nfinish this bill at a reasonable time tonight, we will not be in \ntomorrow and we will be not be in on Monday. I think it would depend on \nhow quickly we can complete action on the bill.\n  In addition, we are now looking at the Byrd-Exon package on different \nmatters that have been subjected to the Byrd rule. We have not had that \nlist very long, but we have people working on it now to match it \nagainst our list to see why some are left out and some are put in. It \nis a rather selective list.\n  I suggest that may require some additional votes. I am not certain.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Would the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Did I hear the majority leader say if we can expedite \nthis and come to final passage tonight on the bill, we would not be in \nsession on Monday. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DOLE. That is correct. We have some conference reports, but I \nthink they can be disposed of very quickly on Tuesday morning.\n  I have also discussed this with the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, who has a very important appointment on Monday. I want to try \nto accommodate every Senator where I can. I think I can.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I discuss the points of order that were submitted \nas a package by Senator Exon?\n  Senator, as you might know, since it is a very selective list, it has \ncaused a lot of concern on our side; some are just working with me to \nsee what they want to do about it. The first step we are taking so we \nwill know is, we are comparing your selected list with our list to \nfirst find out whether there are any that we do not think should be in \nthere.\n  We would like to handle those in a way--by presenting those to you on \nthe basis that if they do not properly belong in that we might drop \nthem out. We are not sure there are a lot but there are some and they \nare of concern.\n  I might also suggest a goodly number of the motions of the Byrd rule \nproblems come from the welfare bill--not all, but many.\n  I might reflect for a moment how that happened. The Senate cleared a \nwelfare bill with how many votes? Mr. President, 87-12. That bill was \nput in the reconciliation bill and it has its own track going. It was \nnever perfected by the U.S. Senate or by any committees in a way that \nmade it absent the Byrd rule problems.\n  In other words, we handled that on the floor. It turns out when you \nput it in reconciliation, obviously it has a lot of points of order.\n  We are concerned because most of the Senators on the other side of \nthe aisle and this side voted for that bill. In fact, 87 voted for it. \nWe might want to present to the Senate a package of those Byrd rule \nviolations and see if you all want to waive them on the basis that they \ngot 87 votes, or if you might want to reconsider since they got 87 \nvotes.\n  After all, we are the ones who vote on the 60-vote number that is \nrequired under the law. We can make that decision.\n  It is not simple. Frankly, it comes late, which is no one's fault. \nEverybody on our side knew or should have known that, as they moved \ntheir committee work law, the Byrd rule was imperative. If we did not \nknow it on the welfare bill--because we were not preparing the welfare \nbill for reconciliation.\n  I think we may take a little time tonight because I have a lot of \nconcern on my side for the Senators, and I want to make sure they \nunderstand and get a chance to evaluate it. I do not think you would \ndeny us that. We will give you adequate time on our major \n\n[[Page S 16032]]\namendment. This is major, major to some people on our side.\n  With that explanation, let us proceed, and we will do the best we \ncan.\n  Mr. DOLE. I indicated before, I know we will do these things, but if \nwe do them as quickly as we can, then it will make things easier for \nall of us and make it possible to leave here tonight by 10:30 or 11 \no'clock and not be here on Monday.\n  Mr. EXON. May I have 30 seconds? I simply say that I will be glad to \nlisten and look at anything that is presented to us. I simply point out \nto my colleagues that the points raised were the most serious, in my \nview, of the violations of the Byrd rule. We believe they are all valid \npoints of order and the Parliamentarian has so told us.\n  We published a comprehensive list of all budget rule violations in \nyesterday's Record. This is no surprise deal.\n  I certainly say that I will look forward to hearing from your side \nand, as usual, take a careful look at your proposition.\n\n\n                      Lautenberg Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. EXON. The next motion would be by the Senator from New Jersey, \nSenator Lautenberg.\n  I yield to him the 30 seconds I have as part of my time for his \ndisposition.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. This is to commit the bill to the Finance Committee \nwith instructions to report back on an amendment that would expand the \ndeductibility of expenses that occurred in connection with business \nthat one conducts in one's moment.\n  In 1993, the Supreme Court decision drastically reduced the \ndeductibility of items in connection with a home/office kind of \nbusiness.\n  If one was a plumber or electrician or an accountant and operated out \nof home, they would lose their deductibility because their clients \nwould not have visited the home.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] moves to \n     commit S. 1357 to the Committee on Finance with \n     instructions to report the bill back to the Senate within \n     3 days, not to include any day the Senate is not in \n     session, inserting provisions to expand the deductibility \n     of expenses incurred in connection with the business use \n     of one's home, and to offset the resulting costs by \n     adjusting the corporate capital gains tax rate.\n\n               motion to expand the home office deduction\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a motion that \nwould benefit home-based small business owners. My motion would send \nthe Senate reconciliation bill back to the Committee on Finance and \nwould instruct the committee to insert language expanding the home \noffice deduction. For a relatively small sum, to be offset by a \nmodification to the corporate capital gains tax rate, Congress can \nremedy a 2-year-old court holding that interpreted a section of our Tax \nCode too narrowly.\n  Under current law, a taxpayer may only obtain a home office deduction \nin one of the following ways: First, If the office is the principal \nplace of business for a trade or business; second, if the office is a \nplace of business used to meet with patients, clients, or customers in \nthe normal course of the taxpayer's trade or business; or third, if the \noffice is physically separate from the home. A 1993 Supreme Court \nholding interpreted the principal place of business too narrowly, thus \neffectively denying this deduction to taxpayers unless their offices \nwere physically separate from their homes or unless their clients \nphysically visited their offices.\n  This court decision, and the IRS's subsequent application of it, have \nprevented taxpayers from obtaining a deduction Congress intended them \nto have. The Government should not be providing a disincentive to those \npersons who have made the decision to work at home, a decision that was \nmost likely based upon economic constraints and family considerations.\n  Women-owned businesses are being disproportionately hurt by this \nnarrow interpretation of section 280A of our Tax Code. Women are more \napt to work out of their homes than men and they should not be punished \nfor choosing to work near their families. By voting for my motion, my \ncolleagues will be sending a profamily message to their constituents.\n  Expanding this deduction would also help workers who have been \ndisplaced by corporate downsizing to remain in the work force and avoid \nwelfare by defraying some of their startup costs should they decide to \ngo into business for themselves. My motion would also benefit the \nelderly and persons with physical disabilities who want to work but for \nwhom commuting to traditional offices is simply too difficult.\n  Mr. President, expanding the home office deduction was endorsed by \nthe recently held White House Conference on Small Business, which had \nparticipants from every State. The Committee on Finance held a hearing \non this matter in June and it has strong support in the small business \ncommunity. Legislation was introduced earlier this year that would \naccomplish the same goal I am seeking today. I would ask unanimous \nconsent that a letter written to the Majority Leader Dole by dozens of \nsmall business groups supporting this goal be inserted into the Record. \nI strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support my \nmotion.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: The undersigned associations strongly \n     urge you to cosponsor S. 327, the Home Office Deduction Act. \n     The original sponsors of the bill are Senators Orrin G. \n     Hatch, Max Baucus, Charles E. Grassley, James J. Exon, Robert \n     J. Kerrey, Joseph I. Lieberman, Bennett J. Johnson, and John \n     H. Chafee.\n       S. 327 will promote economic growth and help create \n     prosperity for the nation's work force. It is designed to \n     ameliorate the economic hardships caused by the 1993 U.S. \n     Supreme Court decision in the Commissioner v. Soliman case.\n       Tens of thousands of persons stand to lose the home office \n     deduction as a result of the Soliman decision; particularly \n     if (a) these people visit customers outside the home and (b) \n     they generate revenues of the business outside the home. The \n     list of people potentially losing the deduction includes \n     independent sales persons, plumbers, electricians, remodeling \n     contractors, home builders, veterinarians, travel agents and \n     others. The bill would put home-based businesses like these \n     on a more equal footing with other businesses.\n       S. 327 is an excellent response to the current spate of \n     corporate downsizings which have resulted in the layoffs of \n     tens of thousands of workers. They, like many other people, \n     are now attempting to live the American dream by starting \n     businesses out of their homes.\n       The bill shows a clear appreciation for the convenience \n     offered American families by home-based businesses. A home-\n     based business provides a spouse (including a single parent) \n     the emotional benefits of taking care of his or her children \n     at home while earning money at the same time. S. 327 also \n     takes into account modern telecommunications equipment (such \n     as personal computers, facsimile machines, and modems) which \n     can make home-based business technologically competitive with \n     any commercially leased space.\n       Thank you for considering cosponsoring S. 327. If you would \n     like to cosponsor the bill, please call West Coulam (4-0134) \n     of Senator Hatch's office.\n           Sincerely,\n       Alliance for Affordable Health Care.\n       Alliance of Independent Store Owners and Professionals.\n       American Animal Hospital Association.\n       American Association of Home-Based Businesses.\n       American Society of Media Photographers.\n       American Society of Travel Agents.\n       American Veterinary Medical Association.\n       Associated Builders and Contractors, Inc.\n       Bureau of Wholesale Sales Representatives.\n       Communicating for Agriculture.\n       Communicating for Health Consumers.\n       Council of Fleet Specialists.\n       Direct Selling Association.\n       Family Research Council.\n       Home Office & Business Opportunities Association of \n     California\n       Illinois Women's Economic Development Summit.\n       National Association for the Cottage Industry.\n       National Association for the Self-Employed.\n       National Association of Home Builders.\n       National Association of Private Enterprise.\n       National Association of the Remodeling Industry.\n       National Association of Women Business Owners.\n       National Electrical Manufacturers Representative \n     Association.\n       National Federation of Independent Business.\n       National Small Business United.\n       National Society of Public Accountants.\n       Promotional Products Association International.\n       Retail Bakers of America.\n       Small Business Legislative Council. \n\n[[Page S 16033]]\n\n       SMC--``The Voice of Small Business.''\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this would increase corporate tax rates \nfrom 28 to 32 percent in order to expand the deduction of home business \nexpenses, and I believe it adds new language to the bill by way of the \nhome-business expenses.\n  Therefore, it is subject to a point of order on germaneness. I raise \nthat point under the Budget Act.\n  Mr. EXON. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act, I \nmove to waive the sections of that Act for the consideration of the \npending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum).

The next amendment I have is an ESOP amendment that will be \noffered by the Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon]. I yield him the 30 \nseconds of our time for however he wishes to use it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I offer this amendment in behalf of Senator \nStevens, Senator Breaux, and myself. The employee stock option plan----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon], for himself, Mr. \n     Stevens, and Mr. Breaux, proposes an amendment numbered 3035.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 1771, line 25, strike ``1995'' and insert ``1997''.\n       On page 1772, line 3, strike ``1995'' and insert ``1997''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I offer this in behalf of Senator Stevens, \nSenator Breaux, and myself. Our former colleague, Russell Long, helped \nto develop the employee stock option plan. Even the Chamber of Commerce \nsays when it is enacted in companies, it increases productivity 3 to 17 \npercent.\n  What this bill does, without my amendment, it starts to strangle the \nESOP's. CBO says it will cost $27 million. Let me just add----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SIMON. Not a single hearing has been had on this. This would just \ndelay the date 2 years.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor and strong \nsupporter of Senator Simon's amendment to strike a provision ending \nfavorable consideration for banks providing loans to employee stock \nownership plans.\n  This provision, known as section 133, was originally put in place by \nSenator Long, when he was the honorable chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee. It allows banks making loans for the establishment of \nemployee stock ownership plans [ESOP's] to deduct half of the interest \nreceived from that loan from income. In practice, this provision has \nlowered the costs of establishing an ESOP, and thus expanded employee \nownership. It is estimated that about 50 ESOP's are established in this \nmanner each year.\n  Mr. President, I support the current provision because I support \nemployee ownership. In a time when corporations are enjoying soaring \nprofits and wages remain stagnant, employee ownership gives workers a \nmeans to share in the profits of their labor. In cases in which \nemployee ownership is significant and in which voting rights are \nextended to employee owners, as required by section 133, it also can \ngive workers an important voice in corporate decisions.\n  Beyond helping individual workers, there is significant evidence that \nemployee ownership enhances the competitiveness of corporations. \nSeveral studies, including a 1995 study by Douglas Kruse of Rutgers \nUniversity, have established a positive link between employee ownership \nand corporate performance. It is no surprise that workers are more \nproductive when they own the fruits of that productivity. In a global \neconomy, shouldn't we be doing everything we can to encourage \ncorporations to be more competitive?\n  Beyond these substantive policy reasons for striking the anti-ESOP \nprovision in this legislation, I believe that there are budgetary \nreasons for striking this language. Most notably, it is my \nunderstanding that the revenue estimates attached to this provision are \ngrossly overstated. No hearings have been held on the provision or its \nrevenue effects, and the ESOP Association has done an analysis showing \nthe anticipated revenue is extremely unrealistic. I ask that a copy of \nthat analysis be included at the conclusion of my remarks.\n\n  In summary, Mr. President, I believe that the provision in the \nlegislation before disallowing the preferential tax treatment of ESOP \nloans is bad policy, and I urge support of Senator Simon's amendment to \nstrike it.\n  There being no objection, this material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         The ESOP Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 17, 1995.\n     To: Tax Staff of the U.S. Senate.\n     From: The ESOP Association.\n     Re: Incredible Revenue Estimate on Repeal of ESOP Provision.\n       The revenue estimate for the proposed repeal of the ESOP \n     tax provision known as the ESOP lenders interest exclusion \n     (Code Section 133) is unbelievable for each year estimated.\n       Fact, the average ESOP leveraged transaction, where \n     borrowed money is used to acquire stock for employee owners, \n     is at most, $5 million per transaction.\n       Fact, at the highest, only 50 transactions a year since \n     January 1, 1990, have used the tax incentive that is proposed \n     to be repealed.\n       Fact, 50 times 5 equals 250. If the interest rate on the \n     $250 million in ESOP loans is 10%, the interest paid on these \n     loans is $25 million per year. The lender may exclude $12.5 \n     million of this interest from its income tax. The revenue \n     loss to the Treasury is $3.5 million per year.\n       The revenue estimates that in the year FY '99, for example, \n     that the revenue loss is $149 million is ridiculous. To reach \n     this level of revenue loss, the amount of 50% plus ESOP \n     transactions would be $8.6 billion per year! Never, ever, has \n     the value of ESOP transactions where employees acquired 50% \n     or more, and use borrowed money, come close to this level.\n       The ESOP community in its wildest dreams would wish that \n     there were that \n\n[[Page S 16034]]\n     many 50% plus ESOP transactions a year to justify such an estimate. \n     Sadly for America there is not.\n       The ESOP Association knows how many transactions a year \n     there are. Obviously those wishing to damage employee \n     ownership are not informed as to the facts.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, this amendment would lose $500 million over \n7 years. It would chip away at the deficit reduction package of \ncorporate welfare reforms and loophole closures. This is a big, big \nESOP loophole.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Whatever time we have we release.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have now had 34 amendments considered \ntoday. And I have an amendment. I am going to ask I be permitted to \nyield to the Senator from West Virginia, and that he may proceed for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from West Virginia is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader.\n  May we have order in the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order. Senators \nwill take their conversations to the Cloakroom.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, 31 years ago the Senate, on June 16, 1964, \nbroke the record for the number of rollcall votes cast in one calendar \nday by casting 34 rollcall votes. I should say that the record number \nof votes in any one legislative day was made in 1977, when the Senate \ndebated the Natural Gas Deregulation Act. There were 38 rollcall votes \ncast on that legislative day, 26 before midnight, and 12 after \nmidnight, so that there were parts of 2 calendar days included in one \nlegislative day. That was 38 total votes on one legislative day.\n  But for the record number of votes cast on any single calendar day, \nthat occurred, as I say, on June 16, 1964. We are about to cast the \n35th rollcall vote to occur in one calendar day--a new record.\n  Let me reminisce, if I just might, for a moment about that occasion.\n  June 16th was 3 days before the final action occurred on the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. I filibustered against that bill. I spoke for 14 \nhours and 13 minutes. I was the only non-Southern Democrat to vote \nagainst the bill. Alan Bible of Nevada and Carl Hayden and I were the \nonly three Non-Southern Democrats to vote against cloture on June 10.\n  Now, so that I might not impose on the time of the Senate, let me \njust read from Volume II of my history of the Senate.\n  ``When the bill arrived from the House on February 26, 1964, it went \ndirectly to the Senate calendar.'' On March 9, Majority Leader Mike \nMansfield moved to take up the bill, ``and the motion was debated until \nMarch 26''--therefore, the debate on the motion to proceed required 17 \ndays--``when the Senate voted, 67-17, for the motion [to proceed] . . . \nFrom March 26 [then, when the bill was first brought before the Senate, \nfollowing the debate on the motion to proceed,] until cloture was \ninvoked on June 10, the bill was before the Senate for a total of 77 \ndays--including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays--and was actually \ndebated for 57 days, 6 of which were Saturdays. Still, the bill was not \npassed until 9 days after cloture was voted. Hence, 103 days had passed \nbetween March 9, the day that the motion was first made to proceed to \ntake up the bill, ``and final passage on June 19.''\n  That was a very historic occasion. The vote on cloture occurred on \nJune 10, which was the 100th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's \nnomination for a second presidential term. The 34 rollcall votes \noccurred on June 16, and the bill passed on June 19 by a vote of 73 to \n27.\n\n  Mr. President, this is another historic occasion today. We are about \nto cast 35 rollcall votes, which will, of course, set a new record, the \nfirst such new record in 31 years.\n  I wish we would pause just a moment and think about the contrast \nbetween the bill that was before the Senate then and the bill that is \nbefore the Senate now--not the subject matter at this point, but the \nprocedural aspects.\n  On that occasion, we had one bill which was before the Senate. There \nhad been hearings on that bill. There had been 17 days of debate on a \nmotion to proceed to take the bill up. There had been 57 days of actual \ndebate, including Saturdays. There had been scores of amendments \noffered thereon and cloture was finally invoked. And then more \namendments were called up and additional votes occurred.\n  Think of the time that it took the Senate to dispose of that bill: \n103 days. It was a historic bill. I voted against it, to my regret \ntoday. I have said that many times. But here we have a bill that has \nbeen before the Senate now 2 days--3 days; only 3 days--and we are \nlimited to 20 hours on this bill--20 hours.\n  On that bill in 1964, we had 103 days; on this bill the limit is 20 \nhours and only 2 hours on an amendment, and the motion to proceed to \nthis bill was non-debatable. But we are down to the point now where we \nhave only 30 seconds to the side for debate on an amendment--30 seconds \nfor debate. I am not criticizing either party or anybody in either \nparty, in saying this. I am just concerned and discouraged by what we \nhave seen taking place here in the Senate on this bill.\n  It is a historic bill also, but we have gone from 103 days on a \nmassive bill--one bill--to 20 hours on what consists of a number of \nbills, not just one bill. No hearings. No hearings on this bill. There \nwere hearings by committees on parts of it, but no single committee had \nhearings on the whole bill, 1,949 pages.\n  I am concerned with what we are doing to the Senate, what we are \ndoing to the legislative process. We are inhibited from calling up \namendments. We have had a very insufficient time for debate on this \nmassive, comprehensive bill, a bill that may be even more far-reaching \nin some respects than was the civil rights bill of 1964.\n  I hope that we will, in the coming days and weeks and next year, \nconsider revising the reconciliation process, that part of the \nlegislative process \n\n[[Page S 16035]]\ndealing with the Budget Act. I was here when we adopted the Budget Act \nof 1974. I never comprehended, never could I have imagined that the \nreconciliation process would have been used as it is being used here, a \nreconciliation process in which we bring several bills into one massive \nbill, on which the time for debate is severely restricted. Cloture is \nnothing as compared with the time limitation on the reconciliation \nbill. Cloture is but a speck on the distant horizon as compared with \nthis bear trap.\n  It is most unfortunate. I do not think it is in the best interests of \nthe institution. I do not think it is in the best interests of the \nlegislative process. I do not think it is in the best interests of the \nAmerican people, because we Senators do not know--to a very \nconsiderable degree--what we are voting for. There is not a Senator in \nthis body--not one--who knows everything that is in this bill. Not one. \nAnd so that is the situation we are in. It troubles me.\n  I thank the distinguished majority leader for asking that I be \nrecognized for 10 minutes. It is a special honor for me to be able to \noffer the amendment on which the record will be broken. I regret that \nwe had to break the record in a situation such as I have described, but \nit is an honor to me. This is a historic occasion. I lived on that \noccasion--Senator Thurmond, Senator Pell, Senator Kennedy, Senator \nInouye, and I are the only Senators who were here when the 1964 record \nvote was cast.\n  I say to the leader, may I proceed with my amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope Senators will now provide the second historic \noccasion that will take place today. [Laughter.]\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2974\n\n   (Purpose: To strike the provisions in title XII reducing revenues)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I call up my amendment, which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Simon, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Robb, and \n     Mr. Bumpers, proposes an amendment numbered 2974.\n\n       On page 1469, strike beginning with line 1 and all that \n     follows through page 1650, line 9.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, How can we possibly tell the American people \nthat the budget will be balanced in 2002, even if we carry out the \nprovisions of this reconciliation measure? CBO's deficit estimates have \nbeen off the mark by an average of $45 billion per year since 1980.\n  Yet, we are not only being asked to accept CBO's projections for \nseven years (as opposed to the usual five-year projections)--we are \nbeing asked to then take a so-called ``fiscal dividend'' that will \noccur if CBO's projections of a balanced budget turn out to be correct \nseven years down the road and to use that as the basis for enacting a \nhuge $245 billion tax cut for the wealthy right now. Not later, after \nthe budget is actually balanced, but now. Let us give Americans a tax \ncut now and promise them a balanced budget seven years from now. Why? \nBecause it makes good politics. It fooled the American people in 1981. \nWhy not do it to them again in 1995? If we are serious about balancing \nthe budget, let us use the spending cuts that will occur this year and \nin the coming 7 years to cut the deficit and only to cut the deficit. \nThe current drag race that is going on between the administration and \nthe Republican Congressional leadership to see who can get to the tax \ncut finish line first with the most is discouraging and will, I fear \nultimately result in a repeat of the failures of Reaganomics--a return \nto using the American people's credit card to pay for never ending \ndeficits.\n  There is no fiscal dividend with which to cut taxes. It is a hoax.\n  I urge Senators to reject the hoax by voting for the pending \namendment which eliminates the $245 billion tax cut from this bill and \napplies the moneys to the deficit.\n  Mr. President, the amendment speaks for itself. It eliminates the tax \ncut in the bill and applies the savings that are projected--and we know \nhow the projections have been in error so many times, and that is not \nto be critical of CBO--but it applies the savings to the deficit.\n  I thank all Senators for listening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think everybody understands this \namendment. It would strike all the tax cuts that were provided for \nchildren, those where we want to correct the marriage penalty and the \nlike.\n  Let me suggest rather than talk about that, I say to Senator Byrd, \nyour speech was eloquent, and I thank you for it. But I must suggest \nthat you were part of putting this together, and we thank you for it, \nbecause if you had not helped us put this kind of process together, we \ncould never change the country.\n\n  I guarantee you that if we did not have a reconciliation process, \nwhat we wanted to change would take 30 years. Any piece of this \namendment could be subject to the exact same 69, 79, 89 days as that \nlegislation, which the distinguished former majority leader brought to \nour attention. That is just too long to change things and turn things \naround.\n  So once a year, we get an opportunity to proceed to change the \ncountry and vote on very large, significant, substantial changes under \nthe privilege of a reconciliation bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed \nfor 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is true this is not the cleanest of \nprocesses, and I submit a clear reading of the Budget Act, which, \nagain, the Senator from West Virginia had a very big hand in drawing, \nthat clearly it was intended that when you put a budget of the United \nStates together, that the U.S. Congress would not avail itself of \ndelaying tactics to implement it. As a matter of fact, the implementing \nof it to make it reconcile with the budget is from whence the word \n``reconciliation'' comes.\n  So maybe it is being used for too many things, and maybe it is too \ndifficult, and perhaps we ought to fix that process a bit. But I \nguarantee you, if you do not find something to take its place and \nabolish it, you will not change America in important matters for year \nafter year after year.\n  I like the rules. But I think once a year you ought to comply with \nthe budget of the United States and change the laws to change the \ncountry, to comply with the fiscal policy. That is why we are here. It \nis difficult. I am glad that I am chairman when we broke the record--I \nam not sure of that, although I am very pleased with the record. We won \nalmost every vote and, for that, I thank the Republicans. I think they \nknew what they were voting about and for. Essentially, the truth of the \nmatter is that we have no other way to get it done, as imperfect as it \nis. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to table the Byrd amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nrecognized for 15 seconds out of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. A little earlier I stated that Senator Thurmond and I were \nthe only two Senators who voted on June 16, 1964, and I inadvertently \noverlooked Mr. Pell who was here, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Inouye.

As near as I can tell, and I stand to be corrected if I am \nin error, we have three amendments and possibly one that I do not think \nwill be offered.\n  The three amendments upcoming are the Wellstone amendment, then the \nExon amendment with regard to the violations of the Byrd rules, and \nthen the Finance package. So I think we only have three with the \npossibility of one more.\n  At this time, then, to move along, I suggest that we recognize the \nSenator from Minnesota, who has an amendment to offer. I yield him the \n30 seconds off of our bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3036\n\n (Purpose: To strike the deep water regulatory relief provision for a \n number of reasons, including: (1) although the provision is estimated \nto save $130 million over seven years, the Congressional Budget Office \n  estimates that the provision will cost the Treasury $550 million in \n  lost receipts over the next 25 years, leading to a net loss of $420 \n million; (2) the provision provides yet another unneeded subsidy for \n   the oil and gas industry, which was described by the Wall Street \nJournal on October 24, 1995 as experiencing a ``Gush of Profits'', and \n by Business Week in the October 30, 1995 issue as benefiting from new \ntechnologies that cut the cost of deep-water drilling; and (3) a short-\n  term savings of $130 million over seven years does not justify the \n            ultimate giveaway of $420 million over 25 years)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3036.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike sections 5930, 5931, and 5932.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment knocks out what is \neuphemistically called the deep water royalty relief. It in fact is \nprobably the most brazen subsidy that goes to oil companies that are \ndoing very well. So well, Mr. President, that in the House of \nRepresentatives, 261 Representatives voted against this--100 \nRepublicans.\n  That is why it got put in reconciliation. That is why somehow it \nwound up in this reconciliation bill. It ought to be knocked out.\n  This is not public interest. This is special interest. It is brazen. \nIt is really a scandalous subsidy when we are asking all sorts of \ncitizens to tighten their belt. I hope we will vote to knock this out.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield our time to Senator Johnston of Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, according to the Mineral Management \nService, this provision which Senator Wellstone would seek to knock \nfrom this bill would produce 320 million barrels of oil in the central \ngulf which would otherwise not be produced.\n  Need I remind my colleagues that the Mineral Management Service is \npart of the Department of the Interior. Bruce Babbitt, a Secretary who \nhas never been known as being in the pocket of the oil companies--this \nis backed by Secretary Babbitt. It is backed by Secretary O'Leary.\n  I ask unanimous consent that her letter backing this be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                      The Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 19, 1995.\n     Hon. J. Bennett Johnston,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Energy and Natural \n         Resources, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnston: The Administration reiterates its \n     support for the title providing deepwater royalty relief to \n     the central and western Gulf of Mexico.\n       In the energy policy plan, ``Sustainable Energy Strategy: \n     Clean and Secure Energy for a Competitive Economy'' in July \n     1995, the Administration outlined its overall energy policy \n     stressing the goals of increased energy productivity, \n     pollution prevention, and enhanced national security. To \n     achieve these goals, ``the Nation must make the most \n     efficient us of a diverse portfolio of domestic energy \n     resources that will allow us to meet our energy needs today, \n     tomorrow, and well into the 21st century. The Administration \n     continues to promote the economically beneficial and \n     environmentally sound expansion of domestic energy \n     resources.'' (page 33) In furtherance of this objective, \n     ``The Administration's policy is to improve the economics of \n     domestic oil production by reducing costs, in order to lessen \n     the impact on this industry of low and volatile oil prices.'' \n     (page 35) One of the ways indicated to lower these costs is, \n     ``providing appropriate tax and other fiscal incentives to \n     support our domestic energy resource industries.'' (page 34) \n     Finally, the ``Strategy'' specifically targets the \n     opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico.\n       ``One of our best opportunities for adding large new oil \n     reserves can be found in the central and western Gulf of \n     Mexico, particularly in deeper water. Royalty relief can be a \n     key to timely access to this important resource. The \n     Administration supports targeted royalty relief to encourage \n     the production of domestic oil and natural gas resources in \n     deep water in the Gulf of Mexico. This step will help to \n     unlock the estimated 15 billion barrels of oil-equivalent in \n     the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, providing new energy supplies \n     for the future, spurring the development of new technologies, \n     and supporting thousands of jobs in the gas and oil \n     industries. (emphasis in original, page 36)''\n       The royalty relief provision in S. 395 as adopted by the \n     conference committee is a targeted, deepwater royalty relief \n     provision that the Administration supports. For existing \n     leases, it targets relief for only those leases that would \n     not be economic to develop without the relief. For new \n     leases, the provision is targeted for a specific time period \n     for only a specific number of barrels of production, and \n     could be offset by increased bonus bids.\n       The Minerals Management Service has estimated the revenue \n     impacts of new leasing under section 304 of S. 395. For lease \n     sales in the central and western Gulf of Mexico between 1996 \n     and 2000, the deepwater royalty relief provisions would \n     result in increased bonuses of $485 million--$135 million in \n     additional bonuses on tracts that would have been leased \n     without relief; and $350 million in bonuses from tracts that \n     would not have been leased until after the year 2000, if at \n     all, without the relief. This translates to a present value \n     of $420 million, if the time value of money is taken into \n     account. However, the Treasury would forego an estimated $553 \n     million in royalties that would otherwise have been collected \n     through the year 2018. But again taking into account the time \n     value of money, this offset in today's dollars is only $220 \n     million. Comparing this loss with the gain from the bonus \n     bids on a net present value basis, the Federal government \n     would be ahead by $200 million.\n       It is important to note that affected OCS projects would \n     still pay a substantial upfront bonus and then be required to \n     pay a royalty when and if production exceeds their royalty-\n     free period. A royalty-free period, such as that proposed in \n     S. 395, would help enable marginally viable OCS projects to \n     be developed, thus providing additional energy, jobs, and \n     other important benefits to the nation.\n       In contrast, in the absence of thorough reform of the 1872 \n     Mining Law, hard rock mining projects on Federal lands can be \n     initiated without paying a substantial bonus and are never \n     required to pay a royalty on the resources developed. The end \n     result is that the public is denied its fair share of the \n     benefits from the resources developed.\n       The ability to lower costs of domestic production in the \n     central and western Gulf of Mexico by providing appropriate \n     fiscal incentives will lead to an expansion of domestic \n     energy resources, enhance national security, and reduce the \n     deficit. Therefore, the Administration supports the deepwater \n     royalty relief provision of S. 395.\n\n[[Page S 16037]]\n\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that it has \n     no objection to the presentation of these views from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n     Hazel R.

If the government were to invest $218 million \n     in T-bonds, it could draw down the investment each year \n     between 2001 and 2018 to offset the foregone royalties in \n     that year. The government would still have $200 million left \n     for deficit reduction in the five-year budget. (This is \n     comparable to an individual planning for reduced income in \n     retirement by investing in an annuity to replace the lost \n     income in the future.)\n       To analyze fully the impact on the Treasury over 25 years, \n     the impact of reducing the debt by $200 million has to be \n     included. By the year 2018, the taxpayers would be ahead by \n     an additional $599 million, the amount of interest that would \n     not have to be paid to finance $200 million of debt from 2000 \n     to 2018.\n       If you have any question, contact Shirley Neff.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON.

The point of order is \nwell taken and the amendment fails.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we are still examining the different items \nof the package, the so-called Byrd-Exon package on the Byrd rule.\n  I wonder if we might proceed on the Finance Committee amendment. \nSenator Roth I think is prepared to proceed on that amendment. We would \nbe prepared to enter into some lengthier time agreement than the 10 \nminutes we were allotted under yesterday's unanimous-consent agreement. \nWe would like to keep it as tight as possible, but we understand the \nSenator from Florida in particular wanted some additional time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I have consulted with a number of our colleagues, and I \nthink that a half-hour on either side might accommodate the needs of \nSenators interested in participating in debate on the Roth amendment if \nthat would accord with the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Half-hour on each side.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Half-hour on each side.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent there be an hour equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to an hour equally divided?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3037\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I had been trying to clear a correcting \namendment to the D'Amato amendment that had heretofore been adopted. I \nunderstand it has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. EXON. It has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. \n     D'Amato, proposes an amendment numbered 3037.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 187, line 3, and on page 187, line 22, strike ``5'' \n     and insert ``10.''\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield back any time I have on the \namendment.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Is there objection to the amendment? Without objection, the amendment \nis agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 3037) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, buried in this gigantic reconciliation bill \nis a provision, Section 12874, that would amend a carefully wrought \nbipartisan measure enacted in 1992 to protect the health benefits \npromised to retired coal miners and their dependents. This provision \nwould jeopardize these health benefits and put the 92,000 retired \nminers and their dependents at risk. I understand this provision was \nadded at the last minute and is a modification of a bill, S. 878, which \nhas not been the subject of hearings by the Finance Committee. Hiding \nthis provision, that has not received careful review or consideration, \nin a 1,949-page bill is an outrage.\n  Section 12874 represents a major policy change that would overturn \nexisting statute and case law in order to provide a two-year tax break \nto a select group of coal companies at the expense of other coal \ncompanies. In so \n\n[[Page S 16038]]\ndoing, this provision would not only change a major provision of the \nCoal Act of 1992, it would also overturn dozens of district and Federal \ncourt decisions.\n  Under the 1992 Coal Act and case law, companies are required to pay \nhealth insurance premiums for their former workers, with whom they \ncontractually committed to pay lifetime health benefits. Section 12874 \nwould relieve certain coal companies from this commitment by allowing \nthem to forego these premiums for 2 years.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), over the 7-year \nperiod, 1996-2002, this provision would produce a net increase of only \n$8 million.\n  In light of the fact that Section 12874 represents a major policy \nchange, which would overturn existing statutory and case law, while \nhaving a minor budgetary impact of only $8 million over 7 years, it is \nclearly a violation of section 313(b)(1)(D) of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, which reads as follows:\n\n       A provision shall be considered extraneous if it produces \n     changes in outlays or revenues which are merely incidental to \n     the non-budgetary components of the provision;.\n\n  Therefore, it is my view that Section 12874 should be stricken from \nthe reconciliation bill as being in violation of the Byrd Rule.\n  In addition to the blatant violation of the Byrd rule, Mr. President, \nthis provision is just bad policy.\n  The 1992 Coal Act was enacted to save the health benefits of over \n120,000 miners and their dependents. The situation which led to the \nneed for enactment of the Coal Act was the impending crisis resulting \nfrom the dwindling number of coal companies left to pay for the health \nbenefits promised to coal miners and their dependents. This situation \nput miners' health benefits in jeopardy. The Coal Act averted this \ncrisis by requiring companies to pay the health benefit premiums of \ntheir former employees, and further solidified the promises made to the \nminers that they would keep their lifetime health benefits.\n\n  Miners' health benefits have a unique history in that the federal \ngovernment has played a role since the coal strike of 1946. Over the \nyears, miners gave up increases in wages and pensions and in return \nwere promised lifetime health benefits by the coal companies. Health \nbenefits are important to coal miners. The coal miner lives \ndangerously, working in cramped, hazardous conditions. The brutal \nnature of mine work and the risks to miners' health that go hand in \nhand with this labor make good health benefits extremely important to \nminers.\n  The provision included in the Reconciliation legislation would, for \ntwo years, provide relief to reachback companies, those companies that \nwere not signatories to the 1988 National Bituminous Coal Wage \nAgreement, by reducing the premiums they are required to pay to the \nCombined Fund if it is calculated that the Fund has a surplus. The \ncalculation of a surplus would be done on the cash method of \naccounting, not the accrual method, and the surplus would be reduced by \n10 percent of benefits and administrative costs. Requiring the \ncalculation of a surplus using the cash method of accounting is unwise, \ncould lead to a misleading statement of surplus, and is not the \nstandard practice with regard to health plans. Further, the provision \nprovides that if a shortfall in the Fund occurs, all companies' \npremiums would be increased, even though only a specific group of \ncompanies would get relief.\n  The financial status of the Combined Fund is precarious. Guy King, \nthe former chief actuary for the Health Care Financing Administration, \nin an analysis of the Combined Fund, suggests that all of the net \nassets in the Fund will be necessary to pay benefits for the next ten \nyears. The annual growth in the premium rates will be insufficient to \ncover the anticipated rate of increase in expenses of the Fund; \ntherefore, the surplus in the Fund is necessary for the Fund to remain \nsolvent in the years ahead. It is patently absurd to absolve certain \ncompanies, who can clearly afford to keep their promises, of \nresponsibility for their former employees and, thus, jeopardize the \nfinancial status of the Fund. Given the uncertainty surrounding the \nCombined Fund, I must adamantly oppose this provision to relieve \ncertain companies of their responsibility to their former employees.\n  Section 12874 is a violation of the Byrd rule because the savings \nattributed to the provision are solely incidental to the goal of policy \nchange. In addition, this provision does not adequately safeguard the \nfinancial status of the Combined Fund, and would jeopardize the health \nbenefits of 92,000 retired miners and widows, including approximately \n27,000 who live in West Virginia. I hope that the Senate will vote to \nremove this ill-advised provision from the Reconciliation legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  There will be 30 minutes on a side. The Chair asks the Senate to be \nin order.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator desire on \nthe amendment? We have 30 minutes on our side.\n  Mr. ROTH. Five minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Roth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Will the Senate please be in order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3038\n\n(Purpose: To make various changes in the spending control provisions in \n     the matter under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Finance)\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  It is very difficult for the Chair to hear even. If the staff does \nnot stay quiet, we will order that the staff be removed.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Parliamentary inquiry. Are we about to debate the \nFinance Committee amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. And how much time is there on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 hour equally divided.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I wonder if we could get the people who are speaking on \nit to tell us whether they are going use the entire hour or not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair does not think that is a \nparliamentary inquiry. I do not think that is within the province of \nthe Chair, to demand in advance whether time will be used.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Would I be within my rights to ask the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee how much time he intends to take?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Will the Senator from Nebraska yield for a question? The Senator from \nArkansas has a question.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The question is, how much time does the Senator from \nNebraska intend to use, if he knows?\n  Mr. EXON. Is the Senator asking about the half-hour time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes.\n  Mr. EXON. I will try to allocate the time as best I can.\n  I just have had a brief meeting with the Senator from Florida, who \nsaid he would wish to begin debate. He asked for more time. I said I \nwill have to be a tough traffic cop. We have a half an hour. I have \nagreed to give 10 minutes to the Senator from Florida. I will allot the \nrest of the time as we can. Anybody who wishes to speak on this, I wish \nthey would come over and visit with me about it, and I will try to \naccommodate as many Senators as possible.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am not asking for time. I am curious whether or not we \nare going to be here for another hour before we vote.\n  Mr. EXON. There will be at least another hour before we vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3038.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with. \n\n[[Page S 16039]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this amendment includes modifications in \nMedicare and Medicaid. The first change in the Medicare provisions \nestablishes a fully prospective payment system for skilled nursing \nfacilities within 2 years.\n  Now, until this new skilled nursing home prospective system is \nimplemented, the amendment changes how Medicare will pay nursing homes \nfor nonroutine services. The change establishes payments based on each \nnursing home's cost in 1994 with an inflation adjustment.\n  The second change in the Medicare provisions is a slower phase-in for \nchanges in Medicare's indirect medical education payments to teaching \nhospitals.\n  Mr. President, this amendment also makes several modifications to the \nMedicaid provisions in the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator suspend?\n  Would the Senators take their conversations off the floor, please?\n  Mr. ROTH. The----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend? The Chair will start \nnaming names. Please take the conversations off the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. That is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. The first modification would modify the Federal quality \nstandards for nursing homes under Medicaid. We have worked with Senator \nCohen on this modification, and he is supportive of these changes. The \nmodification would reduce the costly and duplicate requirement that \nStates perform preadmission screening and annual resident review. In \naddition, a modification to the nurse aide training requirements would \nmake it easier to train nurse aides in rural areas.\n  The amendment would allow States with equal or stricter nursing home \nstandards to seek a waiver from the Secretary of HHS to use the State \nstandards in lieu of the Federal standards. However, the Secretary of \nHHS would continue to enforce State compliance with the Federal \nstandards. States not in compliance with the Federal standards would be \nassessed a penalty of up to 2 percent of their Federal Medicaid funds.\n  Second, the amendment creates a Medicare-Medicaid integration \ndemonstration project to permit Medicare and Medicaid funding to be \ncombined to provide comprehensive services through integrated systems \nof care to elderly and disabled individuals who are eligible for both \nprograms.\n  Third, the amendment creates a separate set-aside for low-income \nMedicare beneficiaries. This set-aside would be in addition to the set-\nasides already in the bill for pregnant women and children, the \ndisabled and the elderly. Under this provision States would be required \nto spend a minimum amount on Medicare premiums for low-income Medicare \nbeneficiaries. The amount States must spend must be at least 90 percent \nof the average percentage spent on Medicare premiums under Medicaid \nover fiscal years 1993 through 1995.\n  Fourth, the amendment requires States to apply the same solvency \nstandards for health plans under Medicaid as the States set for health \nplans in the private sector.\n  And, fifth, the amendment modifies the distribution formula under the \nMedicaid program.\n  Let me start by saying we have worked very hard to improve the \nMedicaid formula----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. To improve the Medicaid formula which was adopted by the \nFinance Committee. Under the modification, each State's base would be \nthe higher of, first, fiscal year 1995 spending, minus all payments to \ndisproportionate share hospitals; second, fiscal year 1994 spending, \nincluding all disproportionate share hospital payments, plus 3.4 \npercent; or, third, 95 percent of fiscal year 1993 spending minus all \ndisproportionate share hospital payments.\n  Each State's funding would increase by 9 percent for fiscal year \n1996. And beginning in fiscal year 1997, each State's base would be \nincreased by a growth rate determined by a formula subject to floors \nand ceilings. The ceilings have been modified by this amendment. We \nhave tried to give more funds to the high-growth States by raising the \ngrowth ceilings in future years. States would be able to carry over a \ncredit of unused Federal funds for 2 consecutive years on a rolling \nbasis. And after 2 years, unused funds from the previous years would \nbegin to go into a redistribution pool. States can apply for additional \nfunds from this redistribution pool.\n  Finally, the amendment strikes section 2116 of the bill limiting \ncauses of action under Federal law.\n  Finally, the provisions in this amendment are paid for by adopting \nthe 2.6 percent cost-of-living adjustment recently----\n  Thirty seconds?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Fine.\n  Mr. ROTH. Recently announced by the administration for 1996 for \nprograms under the Finance Committee's jurisdiction that are updated by \nthe CPI-W. The CBO baseline assumes the CPI-W would be 3.1 percent.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. President, could I seek 1 minute from the manager?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Indeed. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I rise in support of this landmark Medicare reform \nprovision, S. 1357, the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995. For \nthe first time in the 30-year history of the Medicare program, Congress \nis preparing to give the Nation's 38 million elderly and disabled \nMedicare beneficiaries the opportunity to play a greater role in the \ndesign of their health benefits. That opportunity is the Medicare \nChoice program.\n  Largely because of its status as a government program, Medicare has \nfallen behind the times. When it was established in 1965, Medicare was \nbased on the prevailing private sector indemnity health insurance \nplan--what we have come to know as fee-for-service.\n  For the first 15 years or so, there was little change in the \nutilization of American health care, but beginning in the late 1970's, \nhealth care price inflation began to skyrocket. Within a decade, \nAmerican employers were staggering under the weight of rising health \ncare costs. It is important to remember, as well, that by far, health \ncare costs were fully carried by employers.\n  By the early 1980's we began to see the advent of managed care. \nBasically, the American business community demanded a more affordable \nhealth insurance product, and the insurance industry responded. The \nbest company plans were and remain those which were able to offer a \nchoice of coverage to their employees, not unlike the manner in which \nthe Federal Government does today in the Federal Employee Health \nBenefit Plan (FEHBP).\n  Meanwhile, in 1983, the Medicare Program also abandoned traditional \ncost-based reimbursement and replaced it with what we have come to know \nas the prospective payment system. The Health Care Financing \nAdministration at the Department of Health and Human Services devised a \nspecial payment for every medical procedure in advance and, in general, \nthat was all Medicare would pay. It was and is the biggest and most \nexpensive health care regulatory system in America.\n  The problem we face today is that Medicare is going broke. The pre-\nset payments we put into place in 1983 were based on a measure of \nprivate health care costs which have continued to rise at a rate beyond \nany other sector of the economy. Furthermore, Americans are getting \nolder--more beneficiaries with fewer and fewer workers paying the FICA \ntaxes that maintain the Hospitalization Insurance [HI] trust fund.\n  The combination of these conditions, together with the never dreamed \nof costs of medical high technology, have worked to undermine the \nfinancial strength of Medicare. The major hospitalization fund goes \ninto deficit in just a very few years, and is projected to use up \nwhatever surplus we have accumulated by the year 2002.\n  So what should be our policy? The first priority is to secure the \nfuture of \n\n[[Page S 16040]]\nthe program for the beneficiaries. Medicare will have more demands upon \nit than ever before when the baby boom generation begins retiring \naround the year 2010. Our plan is to limit or cap the built-in \nautomatic growth of the program which, as I mentioned, has been based \non medical price inflation and is one of the principal contributing \nfactors to approaching insolvency. Rather than letting the program \ngrow, as it would, at a rate of 10 to 16 percent per year, we will hold \nthe line at an average of 6.2 percent. I repeat, the program will grow \nby an average rate of 6.2 percent a year.\n  This translates into some important numbers that Medicare \nbeneficiaries need to know. In 1995, Federal spending on Medicare will \nreach $157.7 billion. By the year 2002, the program will have grown by \n52 percent to $239.6 billion. This equals for every beneficiary an \nannual increase in the value of their benefit from $4,800 in 1995 to \nover $7,000 in 2002. This is growth, Mr. President, not cuts, and we \nshould make every effort to make sure that our constituents fully \nunderstand.\n  Our next priority has been to actually improve Medicare benefits, and \nmuch, much work has gone in to determining our course. Should we pursue \nanother top-down big government strategy as we did in 1983, or should \nwe return to the roots of the program and follow the private sector.\n  As I said before, the best private employers are able to offer their \nemployees a variety of health care choices--choices which best suit the \nneeds of their employees and their families. The Congress is now \nstriving to do the same for Medicare, putting together an array of \nhealth insurance options second to none. Older and disabled Americans \nhave earned their Medicare entitlement, and it is our responsibility to \nmaintain and improve it in the best possible manner.\n  Older people being what they are--and I am over 65 myself so I can \nsay it--many are naturally reluctant to change. We therefore guarantee \ntheir No. 1 option to stay in the present system. Furthermore, we \nguarantee that their share of the principal expense of the program--the \npart B Premium--will be maintained at 31 percent of program costs. The \nU.S. Treasury pays for 69 percent of Medicare part B today, and it will \nas well in the year 2002.\n  Medicare is not a bargain. Beneficiaries today are asked to pay for \n20 percent of doctor visits. The program does not pay for prescription \ndrugs. Millions of beneficiaries have had to purchase medigap insurance \nat further costs to pay for what Medicare does not.\n  We will offer a selection of managed care options which can be far \nmore affordable for older Americans living on fixed incomes. These will \nbe options for beneficiaries to study and discuss with their families \nto see if they would in fact present a better health care choice than \nthe standard plan. Beneficiaries will be given an annual open season to \njoin if they feel that it is right for them. All options will include, \nfor a reasonable copayment, the right to see a favorite physician who \nmight not be in their local plan.\n  Perhaps the most innovative option will be access to newly available \nmedical savings accounts [MSA's].\n  In my State of Virginia, which has a reputation for fiscal \nconservatism, MSA's have prompted a great deal of interest and support \nby doctors and patients alike.\n  Medicare would offer a catastrophic health insurance policy which, \nfor example, would cover all costs over $3,000 per year. Remember that \ntoday, Medicare hospitalization begins to run out after 60 days in the \nhospital.\n  The beneficiary would then be given an annual Medicare allotment, in \nthis scenario, of $1,500 a year which they could use to directly pay \nfor physician visits, prescription drugs or even new eyeglasses. There \nwould be no redtape between the doctor and the patient, no burdensome \ninsurance forms, no lengthy waits for reimbursement. Beneficiaries \ncould even use a simple debit card to pay for care directly from their \nMSA.\n  Moneys not utilized by the end of the year could be rolled over to \nthe next, without tax consequences, or withdrawn as taxable income for \npersonal use. The only possible out-of-pocket expense, as compared with \nthe copayments and Medigap insurance used by current beneficiaries, \nwould be that measure of $1,500 between the MSA and the catastrophic \nplan. If the beneficiary chooses to save his or her unused MSA funds, \nas many thrifty Americans will no doubt do, the $1,500 amount could \neasily be accumulated in the MSA in just a few years.\n  While an MSA will not be suitable for everyone, I believe it can have \na real impact on the medical marketplace and consumer choice. \nBeneficiaries can shop around for the best price, and providers will \nwant their business. With the prospect of no Medicare redtape, I \nimagine that doctors will jump at the chance to care for MSA \nbeneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, we are veritably on the brink of a new day in \nMedicare. We hope to restore long-term solvency to the program by \ncurtailing exorbitant growth, and open the door for beneficiaries to \nthe modern health care marketplace. Millions of Medicare beneficiaries \nare already educated consumers, and it is my great hope that they will \nlead the way in demonstrating the value of Medicare choice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, to start out the debate, we will yield 5 \nminutes to Senator Rockefeller. Following that, depending on the flow \nof business, I intend to, at my discretion, allow 5 minutes to Senator \nPryor, 4 minutes to Senator Kennedy, 3 minutes to Senator Wellstone, \nand then the closing arguments will be made by Senator Graham from \nFlorida.\n  So, at this time I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator from Nebraska and the Presiding \nOfficer.\n  Mr. President, I find it noteworthy that sometime very recently all \nof a sudden we get 46 pages of actual legislative language, the \nmanager's amendment. I guess we should be grateful for small deeds. The \namendment magically comes up with about $10 billion. We believe there \nis a very good chance that comes from Social Security, which is most \ninteresting, for more Medicare aid, more Medicaid money, parcels it out \nto various health care institutions, HMO's, et cetera.\n  I think there are a number of reasons to reject this bill, which will \nbe my recommendation. One, to protest what is underneath this \namendment, a bill that will cut Medicare and Medicaid by unprecedented \namounts of money. No last-minute amendments by the managers are going \nto soften the blow of this combination of Medicaid and Medicare cuts \nput together. It is a stunning--a stunning--cut.\n  I think we have to question how all of a sudden this new money \nappeared. I suspect it came from Social Security. But we will hear more \nabout that. HMO's, nursing homes, got money. Different people were \naccommodated. We had that process a little bit in the House, and it was \nnot generally given very high marks.\n  I find it, again, amazing that money is falling from the sky to \nsatisfy different folks, and yet these are the same folks who said $270 \nbillion in cuts for Medicare, for example, was the only possible way to \nsave Medicare.\n  So before yielding to three other Senators, I will say, where did all \nthis money come from, and is it from Social Security, for example? Or \nis it from some other place?\n  There is a very bizarre formula for Medicaid in which I think the \nRepublican States somehow end up doing much better than the Democratic \nStates, but I may be wrong on that. Senator Graham will speak on that.\n  Also, the amendment weakens the nursing home standards, a subject \nwhich is incredibly important to me. The Senator from Arkansas will \nspeak on that subject.\n  At this point, with the permission of the Senator from Nebraska, I \nsuggest that we go to the Senator from Arkansas, if that is all right \nwith the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not wish to use his time.\n  Mr. EXON. Yes, I wish to use my time.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  \n[[Page S 16041]]\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager for \nrecognizing me and allowing me a few moments.\n  This morning, by a vote of 51 to 48, the U.S. Senate voted in a \nbipartisan way to restore the OBRA 1987 nursing home regulations. They \nhave worked well. They have served residents well. They have served the \ntaxpayers well, and I am strongly committed to achieving that end once \nagain.\n  Mr. President, with all due respect to the distinguished manager's \namendment that we now have before the Senate, even though the \ndistinguished manager says we are fixing or even improving upon current \nFederal nursing home standards, over the course of today I have been in \ncontact with numerous consumer groups and nursing home reform advocates \nwho are extremely critical of the language offered in the so-called \nmanager's amendment.\n  First, this so-called ``fix'' does not indicate in any way the length \nof time for which a State could operate under a waiver and opt out of \nthe Federal standards. Would the waiver last for 1 month where there \nwould be no Federal standards applying to a nursing home or to a State? \nWould the waiver be for 1 year or 2 years or 10 years? There is nothing \nin the amendment to address this issue. Basic question.\n  Also, in the manager's amendment, there is absolutely no guidance \nwhatsoever as to how the Director of HCFA or HHS would determine that a \nstate's standards were sufficient to opt out of the Federal standards; \nthere is no guidance whatsoever as to what the rules or the guidelines \nwould be in granting making that determination.\n  Also, Mr. President, there is a major flaw in this amendment, I say \nwith all due respect. I am just wondering if the distinguished manager \nknows that under this particular proposal that unless the Federal \nGovernment revokes a State's waiver, it could take--I repeat this--the \nFederal Government could take no action whatsoever against an \nindividual facility, no matter what was going on in a particular \nnursing home. No action whatsoever means that the Federal Government's \nhands are tied, notwithstanding the fact that we are appropriating \nbillions and billions and billions of dollars for the safety and well-\nkeeping of the some 2 million nursing home residents out there in our \ncountry.\n  The very worst facilities in America could be getting away with just \nabout anything, and the Federal Government would have absolutely no \npower, no recourse, no opportunity to go in and correct the wrongs in a \nparticular home, simply because the State would have a waiver from \nFederal regulations and all of the Federal involvement allowing it.\n  Also--and finally, Mr. President--the Roth amendment provides a 120-\nday period during which the Secretary must review a State's waiver \nproposal to make sure that it contains all the essential elements, \nwhich would be insufficient time to go out and investigate that State's \nnursing homes or a particular nursing home.\n  This timeframe, 120 days, to decide whether or not a State could get \na waiver, opt out of the programs, free of Federal regulations is going \nto be an impossible time to meet.\n  Let me say once again that the regulations that we adopted on a \nbipartisan basis in 1987 have worked and they have worked well. I do \nnot know of one Member on either side of the aisle who can argue \nagainst that. I am very hopeful that we will make certain that when \nthis process is over, that we will have the very strongest standards, \nand I truly believe that those strongest standards were supported this \nmorning by the vote of 51 to 48 for the so-called Pryor-Cohen amendment \nadopted by the U.S. Senate.\n  I hope that will ultimately be the language that will be retained and \nthat we will follow in the decades to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Change of Vote\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request.\n  On rollcall vote No. 553, I voted ``no.'' It was my intention to vote \n``aye.'' Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to \nchange my vote. This will in no way change the outcome of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment purports to improve a very \nbad bill, but it does nothing, absolutely nothing, to address the \nfundamental problem. This Republican program slashes Medicare and \nMedicaid to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. It sacrifices working \nfamilies, children and senior citizens on the altar of sweetheart deals \nand tax breaks for the powerful special interests.\n  This amendment symbolizes what is worst about the 2,000 pages of the \nbill as a whole. Every time you turn one of those pages, something ugly \nscuttles out. Look at what is in the so-called perfecting amendment.\n  It weakens the nursing home standards we adopted just this morning. \nThis morning we restored the strong standards that are in current law \nand that the Republican bill would have repealed. This evening, our \nRepublican colleagues are trying to water those standards down.\n  The Medicaid formula changes are the last piece needed to put \ntogether a majority. Vote against seniors, vote against children, vote \nagainst families and, in return, we will rig the Medicaid formula so \nthe disaster in your State is not quite as bad as in some other State. \nLike the underlying bill, this amendment was put together in the dark \nof night, and no wonder there is nothing to be proud of here.\n  The issue is clear: Who stands for senior citizens; who stands for \nworking families; who stands for children; and who stands for the \nspecial interests against the interests of the Americans who work so \nhard to support their families, educate their children and build this \ncountry?\n  This amendment is a disgrace, and it does not deserve to be adopted. \nThe underlying bill is an outrage. It deserves to be rejected by the \nSenate, vetoed by the President and condemned by the American people. \nGreed is not a family value.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the status of the time, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 21 minutes, 45 seconds; the \nminority has 19 minutes, 46 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 minutes to Senator D'Amato. How much would \nSenator Cohen like? And 5 minutes to Senator Cohen, in that sequence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator D'Amato is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I want to commend the manager and all \nthose who have helped us come so far on this historic occasion.\n  Senator Domenici and Senator Roth have done an incredible job. I \nbelieve some of us have done a rather poor job of letting the American \npeople know exactly what is in this package. If you listen to some of \nthe demagoguery that we hear about ``greed'' and ``special interests,'' \nand ``tax breaks for the wealthy,'' you would not really know what is \nin this package.\n  When I hear this business that ``they are weakening nursing home \nstandards,'' that is nonsense. Bull. I want to know how we can weaken \nnursing home standards when you must meet the Federal levels that you \nhave today. You must have at least that or better. If that is not \ndemagoguery, I do not know what is.\n  It is out and out fear and deception that is being practiced. When 90 \npercent of the tax cuts go to families earning under $100,000, I defy \nyou to tell me that that is going to the wealthy. Let me be a little \nmore particular: $141 billion in tax cuts goes to families that have \nchildren. Those families have to earn under $110,000. The bulk of that \ngoes to families in the $50,000 to $60,000 range. Now, let us stop the \nnonsense about greed and wealthy people. That is working middle-class \nfamilies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield another minute to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. We are attempting to keep the promise that was broken by \nthe President of the United States when he said, ``We are going to give \ntax cuts to the middle class.'' Then he went and raised those taxes. \nAnd now \n\n[[Page S 16042]]\nhe says, ``Well, maybe I made a mistake.''\n  Well, he did make a mistake. We are returning IRA's to working \nmiddle-class families. And we are doing something about the marriage \npenalty. We always complained about that. There has not been anybody \nhere on the floor who has run and did not say we need to do something \nabout the marriage penalty. That is $12 billion in relief--a move in \nthe right direction. And in student loans, a billion dollars to help \npay for the interest.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill, and it deserves our support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to address \nsome of the Medicare and Medicaid provisions of this budget \nreconciliation legislation.\n  For the past few months, the debate on Medicare has been rife with \npartisan fingerpointing. Democrats accuse Republicans of ravaging \nMedicare, while Republicans counter with charges that the Democrats are \nfailing to restore solvency to the program.\n  But the simple fact is that the Medicare hospital trust fund is going \nbroke, and spending for Medicare part B--the optional program that \ncovers seniors' doctor bills--is increasing at an unsustainable rate. \nReasonable minds may disagree on how to resolve the looming crisis. But \nwe cannot take the easy route and pretend to senior citizens--or \nMedicare providers--that the crisis will go away if we simply look the \nother way.\n  Changes in Medicare are crucial if it is to survive at all for \ncurrent and future senior citizens. The Republican budget plan takes \nthe tough steps necessary not only to restore solvency to the trust \nfund but also to prepare Medicare for the 21st century.\n  The President and congressional Democrats claim that $90 or $100 \nbillion in savings will be sufficient to ``fix'' Medicare, and that the \n$270 billion in savings proposed in this bill cut too far and too deep.\n  What the Democrats have proposed would certainly be more politically \npalatable. But their proposal falls far short of the reforms that will \nbe necessary to prepare Medicare for the future.\n  Guy King, the former chief actuary for the Health Care Financing \nAdministration agrees with the Democrats that $90 billion will keep the \ntrust fund solvent until 2006. But, by 2010, the year the baby boomers \nbegin to retire, it will leave Medicare $309 billion in the red. It \nwill be difficult enough to cope with this tidal wave of retirees when \nMedicare is solvent. It will be impossible if the program is over $300 \nbillion short.\n  Under Republican budget, Medicare spending will continue to grow at \nan average annual rate of 6.2 percent over the next 7 years--less than \nthe current 10 percent rate of growth, but still twice the rate of \ninflation. In fact, per beneficiary spending in Maine will increase by \nalmost $2,000 over the next 7 years.\n  Equally important to controlling growth, the proposal will give \nbeneficiaries more choice. The ``Medicare Choice'' plan contained in \nthe bill closely resembles the Federal Employee Health Benefit program. \nEach year, Medicare beneficiaries will be given information on a number \nof plans available in their areas. They will then be able to elect to \nremain in the traditional fee-for-service plan or they can choose from \na variety of other insurance options, such as health maintenance \norganizations, physician and hospital sponsored networks, or medical \nsavings accounts.\n  The proposal does include, for the first time, an ``affluence test'' \nthat would require the wealthiest beneficiaries to pay a fairer share \nof the costs of the Medicare program.\n  Taxpayers currently subsidize about 70 percent of the costs of \nMedicare beneficiaries' part B premium cost. The Republican plan phases \nout these taxpayer subsidies for upper-income retirees and eliminates \nthem completely for individuals with incomes over $100,000 and couples \nover $175,000.\n  I believe that this is fair. There is no good reason why a working \nfamily with an income of $40,000 should be subsidizing wealthy retirees \nearning more than four times as much. Further, the vast majority of \nMedicare beneficiaries will be unaffected by the change--about 98 \npercent of all Maine Medicare beneficiaries have an income below the \n``affluence test'' threshold.\n  I am very pleased that this budget bill includes tough anti-fraud \nlegislation that I introduced earlier this year to help rid Medicare of \nthe fraud and abuse that robs the program of as much as $15 billion a \nyear.\n  Specifically, the proposal creates tough new criminal statutes to \nhelp prosecutors pursue health care fraud more swiftly and efficiently, \nincreases fines and penaties for billing Medicare and Medicaid for \nunnecessary services, over billing, and for other frauds against these \nand all federal health care programs, and makes it easier to kick \nfraudulent providers out of the Medicare and Medicaid program, so they \ndo not continue to rip off the system.\n\n  More importantly, the bill establishes an anti-fraud and abuse \nprogram to coordinate Federal and State efforts against health care \nfraud, and substantially increases funding for investigative efforts, \nauditors, and prosecutors by flowing back a portion of fines and \npenalties collected from health care fraud efforts to law enforcement.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, these provisions will \nyield over $4 billion in scorable savings to Medicare--without costing \na penny to senior citizens. I am convinced that the long-term savings \nare much greater, and that billions more will be saved once dishonest \nproviders realize that we are cracking down on fraud, and that they can \nno longer get away with illegally padding their bills to pad their own \npockets.\n  The proposal also makes significant reforms in the Medicaid program. \nLike Medicare, Medicaid is one of our fastest growing entitlement \nprograms. Over the past few years, Medicare spending has increased at \nan alarming rate. Between 1988 and 1993, program costs have more than \ndoubled. From 1990 to 1992, Medicaid grew at an average annual rate of \n28 percent, while private health care and Medicare costs grew at less \nthan one half that rate.\n  The current growth in Medicaid spending clearly cannot be sustained \nby either Federal or State budgets. In Maine, 22 cents out of every \ndollar spent by the State goes to pay for Medicaid, and next year, it \nmay be even more. We simply cannot sit back and watch the program \nconsumer get bigger and bigger bites out of the taxpayer dollar each \nyear.\n  Under this budget plan, the growth in Federal Medicaid spending--\nwhich is now just over 10 percent a year--would be limited to a 7.2 \npercent growth rate in 1996, 6.8 percent in 1997, and 4 percent for the \nremaining 5 years. The plan achieves the necessary savings by \nconverting Medicaid into a block grant which would guarantee only a \nlump sum payment to the States with very little in the way of strings.\n  While I strongly support increased State flexibility with regard to \nMedicaid, I believe that some Federal standards should remain in place \nto help ensure quality and to maintain some protections for vulnerable \npopulations. This is especially important given the fact that the \nFederal Government will be committing nearly $800 billion in Federal \ndollars over the next 7 years toward the Medicaid program.\n  Therefore, I worked to ensure that guarantees of coverage for low-\nincome children, pregnant women and the disabled--including the \ndisabled elderly--were included in the final package. I am pleased that \nthe bill as amended by the Senate includes provisions to provide these \nminimum guarantees to our vulnerable citziens.\n  I am also pleased that the final bill includes provisions that I and \nother moderate Republican Members authored, namely, a requirement that \nStates continue to pay Medicare premiums for low-income Medicaid \nbeneficiaries and requirements that States apply the same solvency \nrequirements on Medicaid providers as on private sector plans.\n  I am also pleased that this package provides has incorporated several \nof the provisions included in my legislation. The Private Long-Term \nCare Family Protection Act of 1995 to improve access to long-term care \nservices. The legislation takes a big step forward in creating \nincentives for older Americans and their families to plan for future \nlong-term care expenses and \n\n[[Page S 16043]]\nremoves tax barriers that stifle the private long-term care insurance \nmarket.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I know the \nobstacles many disabled older Americans and their families face paying \nfor necessary long-term care. Despite heroic caregiving efforts by \nspouses, children and friends, many disabled Americans do not receive \nthe appropriate medical and social services they desperately need. \nFamilies are literally torn apart or pushed to the brink of financial \ndisaster due to the overwhelming costs of long-term care.\n  While approximately 38 million people lack basic health insurance, \nalmost every American family is exposed to the catastrophic costs of \nlong-term care. In fact, less than 3 percent of all Americans have \ninsurance to cover long term care.\n  Sadly, many families are under the erroneous impression that their \ncurrent insurance or Medicare will cover necessary long-term care \nexpenses. It is only when a loved-one becomes disabled that they \ndiscover coverage is limited to acute medical care and that long \nnursing home stays and extended home care services must be paid for \nout-of-pocket.\n  This bill encourages personal responsibility and makes it easier for \nindividuals to plan for their future long-term care needs. It provides \nimportant tax incentives for the purchase of long-term care insurance \nand places consumer protections on long-term care insurance policies so \nquality products will be affordable and accessible to more Americans.\n  A strong private long-term care market will not only give individuals \ngreater financial security for their future, but will ease the \nfinancial burden on the Federal Government for years to come, as our \npopulation ages and more elderly persons need long-term care services.\n  In addition to providing better access to long-term care services, \nthis bill incorporates a demonstration project I introduced last year \nto explore ways to better integrate long-term care with the rest of the \nhealth care system. Today, many of the most expensive, chronically-ill \nelderly and disabled Americans are eligible for both Medicare and \nMedicaid services. While these programs may cover most of their \nnecessary care, patients are often faced with a bias toward \ninstitutional care and a maze of complex and often incompatible \npolicies and rules.\n  The demonstration project included in this bill will allow up to 10 \nStates to pool Medicare and Medicaid dollars for the purpose of \ncreating a more balanced and cost-effective acute and long-term care \ndelivery system. These projects will help States develop ways to better \nmanage the care of high cost beneficiaries and offer elderly and \ndisabled Americans full integration of services, including case \nmanagement, preventive care and interventions to avoid \ninstitutionalization whenever possible.\n  I am also very pleased that this bill now maintains the tough Federal \nstandards that are currently in place to protect elderly and disabled \nindividuals living in nursing homes. Placing a parent, spouse, disabled \nchild, or other loved one in a nursing home is one of the most \nagonizing decisions a family ever faces. Even once at peace with that \ndecision, the nagging fear that a loved one may not receive adequate \ncare, or may be abused or neglected in a nursing home, continues to \nhaunt families nationwide. The continuation of OBRA '87 nursing home \nregulations is a major victory for today's two million nursing home \nresidents, and tomorrow's growing elderly and disabled population.\n  This week I chaired a hearing of the Senate Special Committee on \nAging hearing to examine the need for strong Federal quality of care \nstandards in nursing homes. The testimony from family members and \nexpert witnesses convinced me more than ever that the Federal \nGovernment must continue a central role in monitoring and enforcing \nnursing home standards. Witnesses shared with me heart-wrenching \nstories of how their family members were overdrugged, placed in \nphysical restraints, and left to sit in their own waste while in \nnursing homes. I was also handed a picture by a daughter of one nursing \nhome patient that showed a bloody, oozing bed sore that I will not soon \nforget.\n\n  The basis for this Federal nursing home standards law is simple, \nstrong, and clear: that residents in nursing homes which receive \nFederal Medicare or Medicaid dollars should be treated with care and \ndignity. The law provides a framework through which facilities can help \neach resident reach his or her highest practicable physical, mental, \nand general well-being. It also provides critical oversight and \nenforcement of nursing home standards, following years of evidence that \nthe states simply did not make enforcement of nursing home standards a \nhigh priority.\n  While the Finance Committee bill required that states include certain \nquality of care provisions in their Medigrant State plans, I had strong \nconcerns that many of the important OBRA '87 provisions were eliminated \nthat the bill lacked adequate Federal oversight and enforcement of \nnursing home standards.\n  Over the past few days I have worked with the Republican leadership \nand many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that \nthis bill keeps intact the standards, enforcement and Federal oversight \nnow contained in current law. No family member should have to lie awake \nat night worrying if their loved-ones are being abused or neglected in \na nursing home. This bill gives nursing home residents and families \npeace of mind that their rights are protected and that the Federal \nGovernment will be ensuring States continue to enforce quality \nstandards for nursing home care.\n  The bill provides for states to receive waivers from the Federal \nnursing home reform law only in tightly crafted circumstances. \nSpecifically, a State may apply for a waiver of standards only if its \nstandards are equal to or more stringent than the Federal requirements. \nThe amendment clearly indicates that no such waiver is allowed unless \nthe Secretary approves the waiver, and only if each standard is equal \nto or more stringent than the Federal standard. Further, the provision \nspecifies that waivers allowed under this section in no way waives or \nlimits the Federal Government's enforcement of tough nursing home \nstandards, patient protections, and other provisions of OBRA 87.\n  Mr. President, while I believe that this package includes many \nimportant steps toward reforming Medicare and Medicaid, there are some \nelements of the proposals that I do not support.\n  During the course of the debate on the bill, I have supported \namendments and worked to incorporate provisions aimed at striking a \nmore appropriate balance between Federal responsibility and State \nflexibility, and ensuring protections for our most vulnerable \npopulations. This effort is far from complete and I will continue to \nwork toward achieving the goals of deficit reduction and Medicare and \nMedicaid reform.\n  Mr. President, let me address the issues raised by my colleague from \nArkansas, since he and I have worked for many years in dealing with the \nnursing home reform. It was called OBRA 87, but it is basically the \nnursing home reform that we worked 15 to 17 years to get passed. We \nheld a hearing this week in the Aging Committee in which we, once \nagain, reaffirmed the need and saw the need to maintain strong Federal \nstandards over nursing homes in our country--not only standards, but \nenforcement, oversight and enforcement procedures.\n  This is not, as some might think, a last-minute attempt to weaken and \ndilute what was done this morning. I should tell my colleagues that I \nhave been working for the past 3 or 4 days with the majority leader and \nhis staff, anticipating that we would have a debate, understanding the \nHouse of Representatives wants no standards imposed. They want to turn \nit over to the States entirely.\n  In anticipating that, I went to the majority leader saying, this is \nimportant to me, it is important to us, it is important to the country. \nWe need to develop these standards and do it in a way that we can have \nbroad, bipartisan support. So that has been something we have worked on \nfor the past 3 days. In fact, we worked until last night midnight \ntrying to work out the language.\n  So I just want to assure my colleagues on the other side, this is not \nsomething that has been concocted in \n\n[[Page S 16044]]\nthe dark of the night in order to weaken what was done this morning. I \nsupported strongly what was done this morning.\n  This particular measure reaffirms the need to have OBRA 87 standards. \nWe want the nursing home reform standards we passed in 1987. We finally \nstarted to get the civil monetary penalties imposed as of July of this \nyear. We finally have some bite into those standards. I do not want to \nsee those thrown overboard.\n  I said to my colleagues on this side of the aisle that we need these \nstandards. Let us reaffirm our support for them. Let us reinsert OBRA \n87, as such, and we can make some changes in some of the paperwork and \nthe burdens that the nursing home industry has complained to us about.\n  I think my colleague from Arkansas will agree that we have had these \ncomplaints. No law is perfect. We have tried to modify laws over the \nyears to make sure that, if we overreach, if something is too \nburdensome, too costly, or duplicative, we make changes. So we made \nsome minor changes which I think are positive as far as I am concerned.\n  The one apprehension I had is in the point raised by my friend from \nArkansas; that is, ``If States show that they have standards equal to \nor greater than. . .''--I saw that as a red flag and said, wait a \nminute, I do not want to create that much of an exemption. I am not \nsure where the enforcement is going to lie.\n  I worked very hard late last night with my staff and with the \nmajority staff to make sure that any State--and I do not know of any \nState that has the same or better ones than the Federal ones. But \nassuming States come forward, as they have not in the past, and raise \ntheir standards to those at the Federal level, if they can establish \nthat, and if they can satisfy the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices that they have done that, that does not mean they are free and \nclear to go forward and then abuse their patients. I insisted that the \nFederal Government still retain oversight and still retain enforcement \nresponsibilities.\n  I believe that is in the law itself, in the language--that the \nFederal Government would still have the ability to go in to find out if \nthere are violations and to enforce penalties. I know my colleague from \nArkansas disagrees with that interpretation. But that is specifically \nwhat we worked out last evening. I believe that is in the language \nitself. I will yield to my friend if he has a question.\n  Mr. PRYOR. If my good friend from Maine, who has worked very hard on \nthis bill, would point out where in this language it says that after a \nState receives a waiver--where in the world the Senator might even \ninfer that the Federal Government would have an opportunity to impose \nfines, penalties, or to have any jurisdiction on individual facilities? \nIn fact, if I might, on page 37, it says, ``. . . State oversight and \nenforcement authority over nursing facilities,'' not Federal.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes, equally \ndivided between the two Senators to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes so that the \nSenators can respond.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield an additional minute to Senator \nCohen.\n  Mr. COHEN. If you look on page 38 under section (D):\n\n       No Waiver of Enforcement. A State granted a waiver under \n     subparagraph (A) shall be subject to (i) the penalty \n     described in subsection (b); (ii) suspension or termination, \n     as determined by the Secretary, of the waiver granted under \n     subparagraph (A); and any other authority available to the \n     Secretary to enforce the requirements of section 1919, as so \n     in effect.\n\n  What we have done in this section is to say that just because you get \na waiver, you are not free from the enforcement provisions here. The \nFederal Government retains the authority to go in and impose those \npenalties. Were that not in there, I would not be supporting this.\n  Let me say one other thing to my colleagues. As I indicated before, \nthe House has no such protection. We passed the measure we supported \nthis morning by, I think, three votes. It is my belief--and I support \nwhat we did this morning, and I reaffirm that action--that we are going \nto be in a much stronger position with a majority endorsing what we are \ndoing here and going to the conferees and saying we want this \nprovision, and it will remain in the bill, and we will have it when it \ngoes to the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the manager. Mr. President, on page \n38 in section (C)--let me say to my good colleague and friend from \nMaine that, according to this section and the sections preceding it, if \na State has opted out, if they have been granted a waiver for an \nindeterminate amount of time--and it could be 30 days or 30 years; who \nknows?--but if that State is under a waiver of the requirement, the \nFederal Government cannot fine any nursing home in that particular \nState, the Federal Government cannot penalize, cannot say you cannot \ntake in any more Medicaid patients. Only the State has this \njurisdiction.\n  I am trying to impress upon my friend that, he not knowingly, not \nwillingly, is helping to weaken drastically the nursing home standards \nthat have worked so well since 1987.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I do not think we should be voting on \nthis amendment.\n  In the last several hours, my State of Minnesota just discovered that \nit will be faced with $500 million more in reductions on top of the \n$2.4 billion. What happened, Senators, in the last several hours? What \nkind of decisionmaking process is this?\n  It does seem to me that people in Minnesota and across this country \nhave a right to know what in the world is going on here. These are the \nlives of our children--they are covered. These are the lives of elderly \npeople, nursing homes--they are covered. These are the lives of people \nwith disabilities--they are covered.\n  We should not even be voting tonight. This is back-room deals. This \nis not a democratic--with a small ``d''--process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Nebraska.\n  I have listened carefully to the debate this evening, but I think the \nsimple fact is that no State in the Union is impacted by this amendment \nand this bill to the extent that California is.\n  Senator Rockefeller asked earlier where the money comes from to pay \nfor this amendment. Mr. President, I'll tell you where the money comes \nfrom.\n  $4.2 billion of it comes from Medicaid that in the earlier version \nwent to California. California is the biggest loser in this amendment. \nThis will affect more than 8.6 million people in the State of \nCalifornia.\n  This bill, I believe, is immoral, egregious, and in my 2\\1/2\\ years I \nnever thought I would stand here on the floor of the Senate and see the \nlargest State in the Union treated the way it is in this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 12 minutes and 32 seconds \nremaining, and the Democrats have 16 minutes and 32 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, in the time that I have remaining, I wish to \nallocate 2 additional minutes whenever he wishes to use it to the \nSenator from West Virginia, and I yield 12 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida for use whenever he thinks appropriate.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, when Harry Truman was running for \nPresident in 1948, at one of his whistle stops the people cried out, \n``Give 'em hell, Harry.'' He said, ``Friend, I don't have to give them \nhell. I just tell them the truth and the truth gives them hell.''\n  That is what we are talking about tonight. The truth gives them hell.\n  We have heard from Senator Pryor what this does to rape the standards \nthat have made life tolerable for hundreds of thousands of persons--our \nmost vulnerable people--in nursing homes.\n  Let me talk about two other features of this bill. Let me talk about \nhow we \n\n[[Page S 16045]]\nare going to allocate over $770 billion of your American taxpayers' \nmoney over the next 7 years and the standards by which those allocation \ndecisions were made.\n  There is no rationale to the allocation formula which is in this \nbill. I have been asking for better than 36 hours to get the \nlegislative language. Finally, at 6:25 p.m., we got the first version \nof the legislation but not the last version. The last version came at \n9:45.\n  Let me direct your attention, if you have the 6:25 version, to page \n36. I ask someone on the Republican side to explain the theory and \nphilosophy behind this allocation.\n  On page 36, line 11, it says, ``Additional Amounts Described. The \nadditional amounts described in this paragraph are as follows,'' these \nare additional amounts that go to States just because they are the \nStates.\n  Arizona gets $63 million; Florida gets $250 million, thank you; \nGeorgia gets $34 million; Kentucky, $76.5 million; South Carolina, $181 \nmillion; the State of Washington, $250 million.\n  That was the list as of 6:25. But by 9:45, Vermont has come on for \n$50 million.\n  Friends, we have talked a lot about balanced budget, about fiscal \nprudence and responsible use of taxpayers' money. That is how your \nmoney is being used.\n  Let me tell you another little fact in terms of the rationale of \ndistribution. Of the States which have two Democratic Senators, the \ndifference between what those States would have received out of a pool \nof dollars that was $10 billion less--$10 billion less--total money to \nbe distributed. Those States which have two Democratic Senators lost \n$3.605 billion. Of the States that have two Republican Senators, they \ngained $11.222 billion.\n  That is the rationale way in which we are distributing $770 billion \nof the taxpayers' money.\n  Now, how did we arrive at these absurd allocations? We did it largely \nbecause, unlike the Finance Committee which very thoughtfully made the \ndecision to restrict the amount of money that a State could continue to \ntake into its base for allocation, those funds which were derived from \nwhat is called disproportionate share, disproportionate share.\n  What is disproportionate share? It was the amount of money that was \ndistributed to States over the periods of the 1970's and 1980's \ntheoretically to make up for the hospitals that had a high incidence of \npoor and underserved populations. That became the fastest growing \nelement of the Medicare program. In fact, in 1990, disproportionate \nshare was only $1 billion; by 1992, it had gone to $17.4 billion.\n  Why had we seen this enormous increase? We had seen the enormous \nincrease according to a GAO report, General Accounting Office report, \ndated April of this year, because there were States which were scheming \nthis money. The swapping and redirecting of revenues among providers, \nthe State and the Federal Government resulted in increased Federal \nspending, increased funds for providers, and in some cases additional \nrevenue for State treasuries.\n  So States were manipulating this disproportionate share to their \nbenefit. Under the original Finance Committee, we would have retained \nand limited the benefit that could have been gained by that previous \npredatory action. We have now taken all of the constraints off. We have \nnow said that a State can go back to 1994 and count every dollar that \nthey had gotten under that disproportionate share.\n  Let me tell you something, Mr. President, that may be surprising. The \nGAO did a report, a special report, on three States. I will be blunt \nand say who they were: Michigan, Tennessee and Texas. Michigan, \nTennessee, and Texas.\n  Of all of the new money that came into this plan in the last 24 \nhours, the $10 billion, how much do you think Michigan, Texas and \nTennessee got? Mr. President, $6.5 billion. They got almost 2 out of \nevery 3 new dollars that went to those States which have been \nidentified as the principal perverters of the system.\n  What kind of policy is that? We are going to reward and benefit those \nStates which have been ripping off the Federal taxpayers? What kind of \na plan is this? I would be very interested to get a response from our \nRepublican colleagues on that issue.\n  Friends, the fact that we are about to rape the elderly nursing home, \nthe fact we are raping the Federal Treasury and rewarding \ninappropriate, I would say criminal past behavior is not the end of it.\n  Where are we getting the $10 billion from? We are getting the $10 \nbillion by raiding Social Security.\n  The last position of this legislation states that how we are going to \nfund this $10 billion, where it will come from, is because we are going \nto say that we will break our previous practice of using the \nCongressional Budget Office as the means of calculating what our \ndeficit position is, and we will for this year take the lower cost-of-\nliving number, which has just recently been reported, leave everything \nelse in our revenue estimates the same, but plug in that new number, \nwhich is a 2.6 cost-of-living factor rather than a 3.1.\n  Now, we are not going to do this as it relates to revenue. You know \nthere are some rich people that benefit by this cost of living because \ntheir taxes are indexed. They get held down by virtue of a higher cost \nof living. We are only going to use this against the old folks--\nprimarily Social Security and other Federal retirement programs--who \nare going to have their money used as the basis of funding this raid in \norder to benefit a handful of politically powerful--and I would say \nprobably politically greedy--States in order to pass this atrocious \nproposition.\n  What has the Congressional Budget Office had to say about this \nparticular raid on the Federal Treasury? The Congressional Budget \nOffice has stated--this is Paul Van de Water, who is the Assistant \nDirector for Budget of the Congressional Budget Office. He states that \nthe Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget \n``do not score savings for legislating a COLA that would happen anyway \nunder current law. This rule was applied to veterans compensation in \n1991 and to food stamps in 1992.''\n  In other words, we are changing our previous Congressional Budget \nOffice policy.\n  But, friends, it gets worse. Mr. Van de Water goes on to say that:\n\n       At the request of the Budget Committees, the CBO has from \n     time to time updated the baseline to reflect recent economic \n     and technical developments. In such circumstances, however, \n     we insist on incorporating all relevant new information, not \n     just selected items, such as COLAs. In this instance . . .\n\n  Friends, listen to this sentence.\n\n       . . . if we were to include all of the information in our \n     August baseline, plus the actual 1996 COLA, our estimate of \n     the 2002 deficit . . . would be higher.\n\n  It would be higher, not lower.\n  So we are using a fraudulent method in order to calculate what is \npresented to be savings in order to fund this atrocious raid on the \npublic Treasury when the Congressional Budget Office said, if they were \nasked the right question they would not only not have scored this as \ncreating any additional money, but they would have said that we would \nhave a greater deficit than we started with.\n  So, friends, that is what we are about with this amendment in the \nFinance Committee that we have waited 36 hours to get. If you want to \nknow why this stealth bomber was out there all those hours when we kept \nasking, Can we see what is in this proposal, can we see the legislative \nlanguage, can we see the State-by-State numbers--we could not get any \nanswer. Sorry, it is too complicated. It is being worked. The \ntechnicians are pouring over it.\n  I am certain the technicians came up with a formula that gave $11 \nbillion of additional funds to States that just happened to be \nrepresented by Republicans and cut the funds from the States that \nhappened to be represented by Democrats. That was just a technical \noversight.\n  And then to have the gall to raid our Social Security fund as a means \nof financing this, is there no limit to what we ask our older people to \ndo? We are cutting their Medicare. We are eliminating other important \nprograms for the elderly. And now we are using their Social Security in \nthis back-door means as the basis to fund an additional $10 billion \nwhich does not exist, which is going to add further to the deficit, to \ngive money to a few favorite States so that they can corral the votes \nto pass this steamy mess. \n\n[[Page S 16046]]\n\n  My friends, I wish this thing would stay the stealth bomber. It is \nbetter if we did not see it than if it finally appeared on the radar \nscope and we are able to look and appreciate the details.\n  Mr. President, fellow colleagues, the answer tonight is a simple \nanswer; that is, to defeat this amendment. As bad as the proposal \npassed by the Finance Committee was, it looked so much better than what \nwe are about to vote upon. We have converted a frog into a beauty with \nthis amendment.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote this amendment down, and let us at \nleast send the conference something that we in the Senate can have some \ndegree of satisfaction as it is taken up in conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico has 12 minutes and 32 seconds, and the \nSenator from Nebraska has 4 minutes, 24 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, with reference to the formula, let me \njust state for the record that 46 States are better off under this \nformula than the House formula. Many of those have Democratic Governors \nand many of those have Democratic Senators. Many of those have \nRepublican Governors and Republican Senators.\n  Let me repeat. Under this formula, 46 States are better off than in \nthe House formula.\n  Mr. President, Senator Cohen has adequately answered the remarks with \nreference to nursing homes. I do not know how anybody could stand on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate and say that we are raping the nursing \nhomes when we have just heard Senator Cohen, one of the strongest and \nbest advocates, say that has been fixed in this bill. He just said it. \nHe repeated it. He read the language. And so we hear it from that side \nover and over again.\n  Let me tell you with reference to the money in this budget that is \nused for some of the reallocation, that there is nothing wrong with it. \nIt is not phony. It is plain and simple, the fact: We have already \nestablished in the United States of America that the Consumer Price \nIndex is not 3.1 percent, but, rather, 2.6 percent. We are not talking \nabout 3 years from now. We are talking about right now. It is not 3.1, \nas estimated in this budget. It is 2.6. The reality is that is not \ngoing to change. It is 2.6 for the rest of the year. It just happens, \nif you do the numbers, that saves $13.1 billion. That means $13.1 \nbillion less is being spent because of the real Consumer Price Index--\nnot speculation and not changing anything. That is where you get $13.1 \nbillion.\n  The reason we only use $13.1 billion is because we did not want to \nuse the tax revenues and spend them. We left them there. So we only \nused the revenues that I have just described. It does not mean we \nchanged anything on the Tax Code. The taxes are going to come out at \nthe 2.6 level in terms of the bracket creep that will be adjusted. So \nthat argument just misunderstands what we have done and what the \nreality is.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, I am led to believe that, in spite \nof this interoffice memorandum, there is nothing from the Director of \nthe Congressional Budget Office. This is somebody that works there \nnamed Paul Van de Water, writing to somebody named Sue Nelson, who is \non the staff of the Budget Committee, and gives a little history of \nwhat has and has not been done.\n  The truth of the matter is that Chairman Sasser last year came to the \nfloor--in 1993, excuse me--and he said, ``I want to adjust the numbers \nfor reality, for the real thing.'' And, in fact, he adjusted two items \nin the budget for what he perceived to be the real numbers. In doing \nthat, revenues and moneys were found to make their budget come out as \nplanned.\n  Frankly, ours is absolutely real because the Consumer Price Index is \nnot 3.1 percent. The checks are going out at 2.6. We are not taking \nmoney away from anyone.\n  I am led to believe this is not subject to a point of order, and we \ndecided that we were going to reallocate some money because a number of \nStates felt that they had not been treated fairly here. Some said they \nhad been treated fairly in the House. Others said they had not, and we \nstill have to go to conference in order to come out with the final \nformula and final distribution.\n  So as far as that part is concerned, how the allocations came about, \nI was not part of that committee. I trust them. I think they did a good \njob. And the chairman is here. They all worked together on it. Perhaps \nhe wants to explain in more detail.\n  But let me suggest that we in no way--in no way--are attempting to \ndefraud anyone. As a matter of fact, this budget will be balanced in \nthe year 2002, and if you need a letter on that from June O'Neill, we \nwill get it for you.\n  This does not unbalance the budget, because we have a $13 billion \nsurplus in 2002, and we do not use up that surplus. You do not even \ncome close to using it, so we will still be in balance.\n  If I have not used my time, I wish to yield it back. And I want to \nask Senator Roth if he wants to talk for a couple minutes, or Senator \nDole.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 35 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes 35 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will reserve our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 24 seconds and \npreviously yielded time, I believe 2 minutes.\n  Does the Senator wish to reallocate his time?\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator from West Virginia is not interested in \nadditional time.\n  I wish to yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I will not use all my 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise to ask a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. President, this morning by a vote of 51 to 48, the Senate voted \nfor an amendment offered by myself and Senator Cohen of Maine. The \namendment was adopted and agreed to. Presently pending is another \namendment with different language proposed by the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, in the manager's \namendment. Should the manager's amendment pass, does the manager's \namendment encompassing or including the nursing home provisions of \nSenator Roth, does it prevail over the amendment passed this morning by \na vote of the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is informed that by virtue of the \nfact that this amendment covers a broader spectrum of the bill, if the \nSenate adopts this amendment, it would prevail over the previous text \nthat was included in the smaller reaching amendment that was voted upon \nthis morning.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, then if I have any time remaining, I would \nsimply ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, why? Why are \nwe obliterating these nursing home standards that have worked so well \nfor these years, that my colleague from Maine was saying just now are \nhaving their bite? Why are we taking that bite out?\n  I think, Mr. President, we are going to be committing a terrible \nmistake if we do. I hope we will not adopt the chairman's amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 2 minutes 50 seconds to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 2 \nminutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to make a parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state the inquiry.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Are outlay reductions to Social Security used to offset \nthe spending of this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is not in a position to answer that \nquestion.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would the Chair like to be informed on that matter so \nthat he might be in a position to answer that question? \n\n[[Page S 16047]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would be happy to listen to the \nSenator from Florida.\n  The Senator has 2 minutes 30 seconds. The parliamentary inquiry does \nnot come out of the time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I send to the desk for the review of the \nChair as well as for inclusion in the Record the 1996 COLA versus \nconference resolution baseline assumptions data, October 16, 1995.\n  I would like to ask that these be compared with the projections which \nare utilized to produce the revenue for purposes of supporting the \nfunding contained in this amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       All Cash Benefit Programs Indexed to the CPI\n\n

 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is running.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it was my understanding that time for \npoints of order and parliamentary inquiry is not charged against the \ntime. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Respectfully, the Senator has been answered as \nfar as the parliamentary inquiry is concerned. The Chair is not capable \nof making the comparisons the Senator wishes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I wonder if the Senator from New Mexico or the Senator \nfrom Delaware as chairs of the respective committees would like to \ncomment whether they believe there are outlay reductions to Social \nSecurity used to offset the spending in this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am satisfied with the ruling of the Chair. I have no \ncomment on that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I raise a point of order under section \n310(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 against the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair might inform the Senator from \nFlorida, and will not use the time but give back his time, until the \ntime is all used, it is not yet in order to make a point of order.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will withhold, but reserving the time to \nmake a point of order at the appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will have that time. He has 45 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, just to prepare for the consideration of \nthe point of order that will be made, I would draw the attention of the \nChair to subtitle (c) of the Social Security Act, section 13301 which \nstates:\n\n       Off budget status of Social Security Trust Funds. Exclusion \n     of Social Security from all budgets. Notwithstanding any \n     other provisions of law, the receipts and disbursements of \n     the Federal Old Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and \n     the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund shall not be \n     counted as new budget authority, outlays, receipts, for \n     deficit or surplus, for the purposes of the budget of the \n     U.S. Government submitted by the President, the Congressional \n     Budget or the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \n     Act of 1985.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder who wants time on this side.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. First of all, Mr. President, I think it is important to \nunderstand that 45--45--of the 50 States are better off under the \nSenate amendment than they are under the House. And I would just like \nto make passing reference to the three States that are said to have \nDemocratic Senators.\n  Just let me point out that in the case of California, it is up $700 \nmillion from the House; Florida is up $1.3 billion from the House, and \nMinnesota is up $500 million from the House.\n  Now, one of my distinguished colleagues on the other side mentioned \nthe treatment for seven States on page 36. And I just want to point out \nthat six of these seven States that get additional amounts have one \nRepublican Senator and one Democratic Senator. That was not based on \npartisanship. It was based upon need. And that is the point I wish to \nmake.\n  In concluding, the statement was made that we are using the savings \nfrom Medicare and Medicaid for a tax cut. That is pure demagoguery. \nThere is no truth to that.\n  As a matter of fact, the President's board of trustees, long before \nwe talked about tax cuts, said we had to do something about the trust \nfunds for Medicare. And that is what we are doing with this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time is left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes twelve seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The other side has used all their time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 3 minutes to Senator Cohen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COHEN. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  If I could point out what is also in this measure that has not been \ntalked about in the last few moments.\n  No. 1, there are set-asides for the QMB program. I think everyone is \nfamiliar with what I am talking about. That is in the manager's \namendment. There is a requirement that States impose strong solvency \nstandards on Medicaid providers. That is in this amendment. There is an \nincrease in Medicaid funding. That is in this amendment. There is more \nmoney for Medicare in direct education payments, and allows for more \ncauses of action to enforce Medicaid provisions.\n  What was not talked about in terms of this measure is the following: \nWe, under this measure, are imposing the nursing home reforms on the \nStates. OBRA 1987 will remain in effect. That is what this amendment \ncontains.\n  No. 2, not only do we have the same standards in effect, we also have \nenforcement in effect. Those two key points have to be made. The States \nare required to comply with the national standards, and those \nenforcement standards remain in effect.\n  There is a waiver provision contained on page 38. And I call all of \nthe attention of my colleagues to it. What it says is, if a State does \nin fact have equal to or greater standards, they \n\n[[Page S 16048]]\nmay qualify or try to apply for a waiver. They can do that. If they \nhave penalties that are equal to or greater than what is in the Federal \nlaw, they can apply for the waiver.\n  The Secretary of HHS has 120 days, in which time he either grants it \nor denies it. And assuming he or she grants it, he or she still retains \nthe authority to go in there and impose penalties upon the State if \nthere is any deviation from the standards. They can suspend and \nterminate the institution. They can terminate the waiver.\n  No. 3, at the bottom of the page, please look at it. ``Any other \nauthority available to the Secretary to enforce requirements of section \n1919.'' That is OBRA. That says the Secretary of HHS still has all of \nthe authority to enforce every single provision in OBRA '87, all the \nway up to the change we made as of this date.\n  So, I want to assure my colleagues I would not be supporting this if \nI did not believe that we for the first time have the majority saying \nwe want to maintain OBRA '87. We want the same standards. We want the \nsame enforcement levels. We will provide some opportunities for a \nwaiver, but only if they measure up to what we expect, and then the \nSecretary retains the authority to impose every single penalty. So in \nmany ways we give more authority to the Secretary under these \ncircumstances.\n  So, please, I hope everyone will not mischaracterize what is being \ndone here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has 2 minutes 13 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 minutes to Senator Dole.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I just want to say I think we had a fair discussion of this \namendment, and we indicated to the Senator from Florida this morning we \nwould have that discussion. He did have access, as he indicated, to the \ninformation at about 6:27. So, I believe we had adequate time to take a \nlook at it.\n  We made a lot of changes. Changes are always made in a big, big \npackage like this by either party, both parties, whatever. I believe \nthe Senator from Maine and the Senator from Delaware and others pointed \nout these have been very constructive changes.\n  We always have these formula fights. And there is always someone \nrunning around with a sheet of paper saying how much one State got over \nthe other State. I can name a State with two Republican Senators where \nthey are getting $500 million less than they had in the middle of the \nweek. They were not very happy about it, but that is the way the \nformula worked. Florida gets $1 billion more, California $700 million \nmore than we had in the committee. Minnesota gets $508 million more \nthan we had on the House side.\n  So we believe we are making progress. We are going to go to \nconference. We discussed this with the Senator from Minnesota, I might \nadd. He is aware of it. He was concerned we were going to adopt a House \nformula which was $508 million less.\n  So, I say to my colleagues, it is time, I think, we wrap it up around \nhere. And I hope that we will have every--all the votes. Everybody \nought to vote for this amendment. This is a very constructive \namendment, whether it is nursing homes, whatever it is. I know there is \na lot of politics about nursing homes. I know the liberal media bought \ninto the spin put on by the Democrats.\n  But the Senator from Maine would not be standing up here making these \nstatements if they were not accurate. If anybody wants to question the \nintegrity or the credibility of the Senator from Maine, they ought to \nstand up and do it. They are not going to do it because he has total \nintegrity and total credibility on this issue.\n  I believe that we have made constructive changes. I hope we will \nhave, if not any support from that side, solid support on this side of \nthe aisle for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am directing my attention to section \n7482 of the legislation, which begins on page 45 and states:\n\n       Cost-of-Living Adjustments During Fiscal Year 1996.\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the case of \n     any program within the jurisdiction of the Committee on \n     Finance of the United States Senate which is adjusted for any \n     increase in the consumer price index for all urban wage \n     earners and clerical workers (CPI-W) for the United States \n     city average of all items, any such adjustment which takes \n     effect during fiscal year 1996 shall be equal to 2.6 percent.\n\n  It is to that section, Mr. President, that I direct the point of \norder. I raise the point of order under section 310(d) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 against the pending amendment because \nit counts $12 billion in cuts to Social Security which is off budget to \noffset spending in the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Mexico wish to be \nheard on this point of order?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to say the dollar numbers being referred to are \nactual. That is all I want to say.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, could I respond to the--do you wish \nfurther debate on the point of order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not debatable. I note the Senator from \nNew Mexico wishes not to make a statement.\n  The scoring of this bill under the Budget Act is under the control of \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee, and the precedents of the Senate \ndo not go beyond that. The point of order is not well taken.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I raise a point of order under section 310(g) of the \nBudget Act because the pending amendment achieves its savings by \nchanging the cost-of-living provisions of section 215 of the Social \nSecurity Act, and changing title II of that act violates section 310(g) \nof the Congressional Budget Act.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. CPI was not changed as referred in that act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is informed that the provisions in \nthe act cited are not applicable to this instance and that the point of \norder is not well taken.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. State the inquiry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Section 7482 on page 45 of the pending amendment, line \n22, states: ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law . . .'' \nParliamentary inquiry. Is this not referencing title II of Social \nSecurity?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is informed that that would not be \ninterpreted as referencing anything. That is to indicate that without \nregard to any other provision of law, this provision of this bill would \nbecome law.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Further parliamentary inquiry.\n  Is the Chair then ruling that by that very sentence, \n``Notwithstanding any other provision of law,'' that that would, in \nfact, cover title II of Social Security since it is law? And that, \n``Notwithstanding any other provision of law,'' therefore, that \novercomes title II of Social Security?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would state that that \ninterpretation--I must yield to the Senator's inquiry. The Senator is \nasking this Chair to act as a court and make a determination of law and \nthe conflicts of law, and that is not within the proper prerogative of \nthis Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Further parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is the Chair ruling, as pertains to the ruling on Senator \nGraham's point of order, is the Chair ruling that the Social Security \nAct, title II, may be changed within the reconciliation process by \ndrafting a provision to read, ``notwithstanding any other provision of \nlaw''?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair's ruling with regard to the point of \norder of the Senator from Florida was on the basis of the issues he \nstated. The Chair is not ruling--the Chair is not ruling--as the \nSenator indicated, that there is any indication here before the Chair \nof a provision to change the Social Security Act.\n  Mr. HARKIN. One last----\n  Mr. GREGG. What is the regular order?\n  Mr. HARKIN. One last parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am asking for the regular order.\n  \n[[Page S 16049]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. One last parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is for the Chair to \ndetermine if there is a bona fide parliamentary inquiry being presented \nto the Chair. One further inquiry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If that is the ruling of the Chair, the Social Security \nlaw must be naked to attack under reconciliation.\n  Would not section 310(g) of the Budget Act be now rendered \nmeaningless by the precedent the Chair is now setting?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair has no intention of rendering \nmeaningless any provision of the Budget Act. We are attempting to \ncomply with the Budget Act. The Chair is informing that the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee has the authority, as did the previous chairman, \nto make the determination that has been made with regard to this aspect \nof this bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 57, nays 42, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 554 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--57\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Bradley\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--42\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Leahy\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n  So the amendment (No. 3038) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other amendments to this bill?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I think we may be down to the last vote. Our \nbipartisan staffs have visited with the office of the Parliamentarian. \nThat office has confirmed----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold. The Senate is \nnot in order.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, our bipartisan staffs have visited with the \noffice of the Parliamentarian. That office has confirmed that each and \nevery provision in our point of order is indeed a violation of the Byrd \nrule. So I renew my point of order under the Byrd rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chair is informed that the \nParliamentarian's office has indicated it has reviewed the presentation \nmade concerning extraneous provisions, some 49 provisions. On the basis \nand advice of the Parliamentarian, the Chair sustains 46 of those.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to waive some or all of these.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, could we have a ruling of the Chair?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If you do the ruling, we cannot appeal it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is informed the motion to waive \nwould take precedence over the ruling.\n  The Chair is prepared to rule.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. State the inquiry.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If I move to waive and send that to the desk with an \nattached list of the points of order but not all of them, what governs \nthe debate on that proposal?\n  Is there any debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time left for debate without \nagreement. The point of order has been raised. The motion to waive is \nin order. The motion to waive is not debatable. It is subject to a vote \nby the Senate.\n  Mr. DOLE. I wonder if the Democratic leader would have, say, 10 \nminutes equally divided.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of 10 \nminutes equally divided on this issue?\n  Does the Chair interpret the leader to mean on the motion to waive \nthe point of order? Is there objection?\n  Five minutes on a side, then, on this issue.\n\n\n                domenici motion to waive the budget act\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send a list of the points of order \nthat I am moving to waive--a partial list of the Exon points of order.\n       Mr. President, pursuant to section 904(c) of the Budget \n     Act, I move to waive the Budget Act for the consideration of \n     the following provisions and for the language of the \n     provisions if included in the conference report:\n\n              TITLE VII.--FINANCE, MEDICAID AND WELFARE EXTRANEOUS PROVISIONS, RECONCILIATION 1995              \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n         Subtitle and Section                  Subject            Budget Act Violation         Explanation      \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2174.................................

Let me explain what is in it: only provisions included \nin the welfare bill.\n  The reason I did that is because the Senate approved the welfare \nbill--87 votes on the welfare side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time for debate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I send it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will have to look and see whether \nthere are any of these provisions not covered by the ruling that the \nChair was prepared to make.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hold up for a minute, please.\n  What is the parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. KERRY. The parliamentary inquiry was whether or not the Chair was \nin the process of giving a ruling which would assist us to know what \nthe relevancy of the waiver is. The Senator would certainly appreciate \nhearing the ruling.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will inform the Senate that the \nParliamentarian has indicated the proper procedure would be to act on \nthe motion of the Senator from New Mexico to waive the point of order.\n  It is a partial waiver, he sees. During the vote on that matter, we \nwill assert whether the items that the Parliamentarian informed the \nChair were not acceptable were covered by this motion.\n  If they are not, we will then proceed to rule. There were three items \nthat the Parliamentarian indicated should be dropped from the statement \nof extraneous provisions provided by the Senator from Nebraska.\n  There is now 10 minutes equally divided, 5 minutes on a side.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  We have a time agreement now. There can be no further parliamentary \ninquiry without using the time.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to know which three the Chair has ruled on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair has not ruled and will not rule \nunder the Parliamentarian's advice until the Chair acts on the motion \nto waive the point of order on a series of these items.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. KERRY. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time until we use this 10 minutes, \nexcept for that purpose.\n  Mr. KERRY. Parliamentary inquiry takes precedence over request for \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not unless----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I want to let people know what is in this motion. What \nthis motion would do, what the motion of the Senator from Nebraska \nwould do is strike the 5-year limit. There will no longer be a time \nlimit on welfare.\n  Some people would like that, but we voted 87 to 12. You want to end \nwelfare as we know it, in what the President said he campaigned on, put \na time limit on welfare. If this motion is not waived, we will not have \na time limit on welfare.\n  The growth formula--we worked very long and hard on trying to find \nmoney to be able to give to the States as they grow under the welfare \nsystem. All the growth formulas are struck--no more money. Whatever you \nget in the original formula, you do not get any additional money. We do \nnot take into account any growth in welfare population. They strike it \nall.\n  Want to provide for assisted suicide payments? You can do that. Under \nthe original bill, you cannot actually reimburse people who actually \ntried to go out and help people kill somebody else. Now you can. You \ncan do it because we will strike it under this provision.\n  There is a laundry list of things here that are just punitive. We had \na vote, an overwhelming vote, on doing something about illegitimacy. We \ntalked long and hard about how we wanted to do something on \nillegitimacy. The bonus for States who reduce their out-of-wedlock \nbirth rate is struck from the welfare. Everyone will come back home and \nsay we care about it and strike it.\n  So, no time limit on welfare. No growth formula for States --and many \nof you profit very well on both sides of the aisle from the growth \nformula put in place--for more money. It is gone.\n  I just want people to think long and hard. You have basically gutted \nthe welfare bill. There is no way this thing will be able to survive \nand States will be able to survive under the rules that you will put \ninto effect here.\n  I hope that we would stand by the 87-12 vote on this welfare and \nstand by the Senate vote before and vote with the chairman of the \nBudget Committee on his motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes and 12 seconds left. \nThe Senator from Nebraska has 4 minutes and 47 seconds left.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  I rise to oppose a motion to waive, including a major welfare bill in \nthis massive, multi-page bill under a fast-track procedure. It is a \ngross violation of the process. It is extremism.\n  Yes, most of us voted for the welfare bill, as did this Senator. But \nputting this major policy change in a bill whose sole purpose is to \nreduce the deficit is abuse. This is just the sort of thing that the \nByrd rule was designed to prevent.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this motion to waive.\n  I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, about 2 weeks ago we made a profound \nmistake in voting the welfare measure we did. A report now surfaces \nfrom the White House that says it will instantly plunge 1.1 million \nchildren into poverty.\n  If that is the desire of this body, vote not to waive. You have a \nchance of redemption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I voted for the welfare bill, as well.\n  Let me say I do not hold the same view as the distinguished Senator \nfrom New York about the consequences of the bill that we passed here in \nthe Senate.\n  Obviously, I would like to see a lot more done in welfare reform, and \nultimately I think we will do a lot more. If we feel strongly about \nwelfare, it is important enough to separate out from reconciliation. It \nought to stand on its own. It ought to be considered policy for policy \nsake, not a source of revenue, referred out of current welfare programs \ninto other things.\n  That is what we are doing in the reconciliation package. That is why \nI support the point of order raised by the ranking member, the Senator \nfrom Nebraska.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back the balance of our time. I ask for the \nyeas and nays on the motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I voted for the welfare bill, but I did not \nvote on each of the items, which may be in violation of the Byrd rule \non this bill. That is what we are narrowing it down \n\n[[Page S 16051]]\nto at this point. Is it extraneous to the reconciliation bill?\n  A point of order has been made against certain areas, against certain \namendments, as being in violation of the Byrd rule. That is the \nquestion to be decided.\n  The Senator from New Mexico, the distinguished manager, has moved to \nwaive this Byrd rule point of order.\n  The Senate will vote one way or the other. If the Senate votes to \nwaive the point of order, then there is no point of order. It falls. \nBut if the Senate votes not to waive the point of order, then the Chair \nwill rule on each of the amendments, either en bloc, or, if there are \none or two that the Chair disagrees with, he can so state, as he sees \nit.\n  I hope the Senate will uphold the Byrd rule, the intention of which \nwas to rule out extraneous matter in reconciliation bills. No matter \nwhat your thinking is on the welfare bill--and the point of order has \nnow been made--is that bill extraneous in the context of the \ninterpretations that have been made, the precedents, the definitions, \nand the rule itself?\n  I hope the Senate will vote against the motion to waive so that the \nChair may rule on the point of order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if I could reclaim 45 seconds \nof my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, every rule, including the Byrd rule, is \nmade for waiver. It is not a rule that Senators cannot apply any \njudgment to. And the reason we think this is appropriate is because 87 \nSenators have already voted for these provisions. I mean, I do not \nbring a waiver of the Byrd rule here willy-nilly just to defy the very \nadmirable efforts of the Byrd rule to keep a bill rather clean. But I \ndo not think leaving in a welfare bill, which is in this reconciliation \nbill, provisions that you already voted for with 87 votes, I do not \nbelieve that is a trivial matter for those who voted for it, if they \nare going to vote the opposite way tonight as they choose to strip the \nwelfare bill of provisions they voted for before.\n  If I have any time remaining, I yield it back.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for just a moment for a \nquestion of the Senator from New Mexico?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. State the request.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The question that I would have----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. How much time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Thirty seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is their objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Does the waiver of the Senator from New Mexico only apply \nto welfare provisions?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct. I have taken out of the large package \npurposefully only those that apply to welfare and ask that we waive \nthem. Then we will go on to vote and see what we want to do about it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Do we have a list of what those provisions are?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, we do.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could Senators have a copy of that before they vote?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure. I had 10 or 12 made. I will be happy to give them \nto you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Did the Senator say he wished time to deliver \na copy to every Senator before the Senate votes?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No. I said if any Senators want to see it, we have it \navailable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from New Mexico. On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 53, nays 46, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 555 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--53\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, there are 53 yeas, 46 nays. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is not agreed to.\n  Now, if the Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold for the Chair to \nstate one problem?\n  Mr. DOLE. The Chair is not going to rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, but I wish to state that the Chair has \nbeen informed that each of these extraneous provisions is subject to a \nmotion to waive. It would be incumbent on the Chair somehow to get an \nagreement with the Senate how to handle this. We have never handled \nsuch a massive list of extraneous provisions before.\n  The majority leader has suggested a quorum. The clerk will call the \nroll. There is this problem.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that further proceedings under the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senate will be in order. Will Senators please take their seats?\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask to proceed for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think rather than take further time of the \nSenate tonight, we can knock all the other provisions out in conference \nwith the Byrd rule, the very selective list sent up by the Democrats. \nWe can take care of the other provisions in a conference. They are also \nsubject to the Byrd rule. So, I think rather than do that here this \nevening, we will take care of those in conference.\n  Let the Chair rule, en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is prepared to rule pursuant to the \ngeneral order provisions that were added to the Byrd rule in 1990. And \nthe Chair, on the advice of the Parliamentarian, does rule that of the \n49 items listed on extraneous provisions, 46 are well taken, 3 are not.\n  One is the provision regarding exemption of agriculture and \nhorticultural organizations from unrelated business income tax on \nassociate dues.\n  The second is the tree assistance program under the Committee on \nAgriculture.\n  And the third is the provision of the Commerce Committee dealing with \nthe Spectrum language on page 207.\n  Those are the three items.\n  The Chair must advise that after such a ruling any Senator may appeal \nthe ruling of the Chair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, just a point of inquiry.\n  If this material would be incorporated in the conference report, when \nit comes back would it be subject to the same point of order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is advised it would be.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Did you rule?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair ruled that 46 items listed on the \nextraneous provisions are subject to the Byrd rule. Those items are \nindividually appealable. \n\n[[Page S 16052]]\n\n  The clerk will enter in the Record those items presented to the Chair \nand those that were ruled upon pursuant to the advice of the \nParliamentarian.\n  The extraneous provisions are as follows:\n\n                                   EXTRANEOUS PROVISIONS, RECONCILIATION, 1995                                  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Subtitle and Section                 Subject          Budget Act Violation           Explanation        \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              TITLE I.--AGRICULTURE                                             \n                                                                                                                \n1113(e)(2).........................

President, we have been debating this budget \nreconciliation for several days now, and I must say it looks no better \nnow than it did when we were debating the budget resolution 5 months \nago. In fact, its details are more troubling than I could have \nimagined, and, not surprisingly, the concern in my home State is much \ngreater than I ever predicted.\n  What concerns me most is this budget seems to have no core values or \nprinciples that mean anything to American families. Its principles seem \nto be program cuts for the sake of program cuts, and tax cuts for the \nsake of tax cuts, with little regard for the consequences. I cannot \nunderstand the philosophy that prevails here that we have to somehow \nscorch the Earth in order to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, I, too, want to balance this Nation's budget. In fact, \nI am proud to say I supported the 1993 budget package. That plan has \nthis Nation on the right track; since its passage, our annual deficits \nhave declined in each consecutive year. Earlier in this debate, I \nsupported a balanced budget proposal put forth by my colleague from \nNorth Dakota, Senator Conrad. His plan would have balanced our Nation's \ndeficit in a fair and equitable manner. It would have maintained a \ncommitment to education, health care and retirees. It would have \nbrought our spending in line with our national priorities, and it would \nhave postponed the tax breaks until we can afford them. It was a \nresponsible and realistic alternative; most importantly, it had core \nvalues and principles that are important to every citizen in this \ncountry.\n  And, I, too, want to reduce taxes. Believe me, I know what it takes \nto raise a family, balance the family books and pay taxes. I know how \nbadly my friends and neighbors want tax relief, and I understand how \ndifficult it can be for families to cope with their tax burdens. I also \nknow how expensive it is for small, family-owned businesses to keep \ntheir businesses in the family, and I believe targeted estate tax \nrelief is one example of good tax reform; as is allowing first-time \nhomebuyers to make tax-free IRA withdrawals for the purchase of a new \nhome.\n  But, there is a right way and there is a wrong way to balance the \nbudget, and the plan before us balances our budget the wrong way. We \ncannot afford to balance this Nation's budget on the backs of our \nchildren and the elderly, so that those who are already better off can \nput more cash in their checking accounts. We cannot afford to give tax \nbreaks to people who don't need them, and then increase taxes on the \nworking poor and health insurance on the elderly.\n  It is interesting to note that many of my colleagues argue on behalf \nof this budget package by claiming it will benefit our children and \ngrandchildren in the long run. They claim we will give our children a \nbetter economy and lower interest rates tomorrow by balancing the \nbudget today. They fail to note that this plan cuts our investments in \nthe future to do so; programs like head Start and WIC and college loans \nand AmeriCorps.\n  I ask, what good will lower interest rates do for my children and \ngrandchildren if we reduce their access to higher education and \nvocational training, ultimately limiting their ability to acquire the \nskills they will need to find a family wage job?\n  Moreover, the proponents argue these tax breaks will enable families \nto save more for the future. However, current estimates reveal that \nthese tax breaks will increase our Nation's debt by roughly $93 \nbillion. That's $93 billion our children and grandchildren will be \npaying back through higher taxes later. This sounds like the 1980's all \nover again.\n  It is imperative that we understand how this budget plan really \nimpacts our children and families. How does it impact average \nAmericans? Does this budget provide hope, or does it tell hardworking \nAmericans they're on their own? Does it provide security and safety for \nour children and elderly, or does it lead to uncertainty and \nanxiousness? These are just a few of the important questions I \nconsidered when looking at this budget reconciliation. We should be \nproviding hope for the families that are struggling to pay their rent, \nfeed their children and care for their elderly parents. Instead, we are \nshowing these families and their children that the only way to address \nthese difficult issues is to cut the heart out of what they need to \nsurvive--education, health care and good jobs.\n  Last month, I held a forum back in Washington State to talk about the \nvaried issues surrounding Medicare. I expected one or two dozen to \nattend. Instead, over 500 people showed up to express their views. \npeople are concerned. They are anxious, and not quite certain what a \n$270 billion Medicare cut means to them. How much more money will be \ntaken out of their Social Security check each month? And what are \nseniors on a fixed income going to get for their sacrifice? I hope it \nis more than a tax break for somebody else. This budget is not \nproviding certainty or hope. My constituents see difficult times ahead. \nThey are wondering how they will pay for health care.\n\n  And then there's Medicaid. This program serves the elderly in nursing \nhomes, the adult disabled, pregnant women, and children--the most \nvulnerable in our society, and the working families that support them \nand care for them every day. This budget will take $187 billion out of \nMedicaid, do away with the standards of care, block grant the program, \nand let States decide who won't have their medical costs covered.\n  The fears that working families have about the Medicaid cuts can best \nbe summed up by a letter I recently received from a worried mother:\n\n       What will happen to our family when my mother, who has \n     Alzheimer's disease and lives with us, has no more funds and \n     we can no longer care for her at home? My children's \n     education depends on both my husband and me working. If one \n     of us becomes unemployed or must take on full-time care \n     taking responsibilities, we risk grave financial consequences \n     for all of us.\n\n  The lack of social priorities isn't the only problem in this budget. \nIt fundamentally stalls the best economic development initiatives this \ncountry has in order to compete in the global marketplace.\n  There are over 30,000 Boeing employees in my home State on strike as \nwe speak. There No. 1 issue is job security. The global economy and \nincreased competition has made these employees, and many others like \nthem, uncertain about the future. They increasingly look to us for \nsupport. They want to know what the Federal Government will do to help \nthem compete in the global marketplace.\n  This budget provides no security or hope. Instead, it proposes deep \ncuts in trade promotion programs and trade adjustment assistance. It \ndemolishes the Commerce Department at a time when Secretary Brown has \nmaximized \n\n[[Page S 16054]]\nits effectiveness on behalf of American businesses. This budget sends \nthe message that the Federal Government will provide no leadership in \ninternational competition, and has no role in cultivating good, high-\npaying jobs that will lead our families into the 21st century.\n  And what about the tax increases in this budget? This budget says \nworking families do not count in the scope of principles governing this \nbudget.\n  Many families will see tax increases because of the proposed cuts to \nthe earned income tax credit. We all know how important the EITC is, \nand we're all aware of the bipartisan support it has received over the \nyears. As President Reagan once said, ``this credit is one of the most \nsuccessful profamily, prowork initiatives ever to come out of \nCongress.'' The budget before us will reduce the EITC by $43.5 billion \nover 7 years. In my home State, low-income working families with two \nchildren will see a $452 tax increase in 2002 and a $522 tax increase \nin 2005.\n  The worst aspect of this tax proposal is that it increases taxes on \napproximately 17 million hard-working Americans while the top 13 \npercent of income earners will reap 40 percent of the tax breaks. Does \nthis provide security and hope for our low- and middle-income \ntaxpayers? It does not. Reducing the EITC simply will drop many working \nfamilies into poverty, and make it more difficult for families to take \ncare of their children and parents.\n  The environment doesn't escape this budget, either.\n  I am concerned about the impacts this bill will have on public lands \nand other national assets. For decades, the Congress of the United \nStates has recognized that our public lands and assets are too precious \nto sell unless their sale is in the best interest of the public. But it \nappears to be a new day. Today, this committee may vote to sell--or \nlease--our children's heritage to pay our debts. The leasing of the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge in particular is not an issue of \nrevenues. It's a question of values. It's a question of whether we are \nwilling to trade off open space, parks, wilderness, and wildlife \nvalues--the natural legacy for our children--for a short-term payment \ntoward the bills we have accumulated--or worse, for a tax cut for \nourselves.\n  There truly is a right way to balance the budget; a way that provides \nsecurity and hope and a way that assures average Americans that we are \nlooking out for them. I tried to instill some of this common sense into \nthe budget resolution, and I am pleased the Senate responded to my \namendment calling for an appropriate level of Impact Aid funding. I \nonly wish we could have had more cooperation across the board on other \neducation needs like Head Start, School-to-Work, and Safe and Drug Free \nSchools, and AmeriCorps.\n  Mr. President, given the fundamental disrespect for families in this \nbudget, I am forced to oppose this reconciliation package. It does not \nhave important core principles, and I'm afraid it is leading toward an \nAmerica far different from the one I grew up in. I am alarmed at its \nshortsightedness. I fear it was motivated by a desire to balance the \nbudget by a given date, regardless of the consequences.\n  This budget leads us down a new road; a road none of us have \ntraveled. It says the Federal Government is no longer responsible for \nthe welfare of its people. But, yet, who will be? Who will rise to the \noccasion? Who will pick up the slack? None of us know, but each of us \nshould be prepared. Prepared, because this budget is calling each of us \nto be more vigilant, more aware of the needs of our families and \nneighbors, more willing to pay for the health care needs of our \nparents, children, and friends. Those of us in this room may be able to \npick up the slack, but many in our home States will be hard pressed to \nmeet this challenge.\n  This budget is not good public policy. It is not why I was elected, \nand it's certainly not what the families in Washington State want.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, once again, we are lying to the American \npeople. Instead of a serious attempt to get our fiscal house in order, \nthe reconciliation bill that we are now considering is little more than \na political document. It is more about getting a Republican in the \nWhite House than getting rid of red ink. The American people will not \nbe fooled. The Republican reconciliation bill does not balance the \nbudget--it merely front loads goodies such as the tax cuts and back \nloads all the tough decisions. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat two tables that I have prepared exposing the realities of the GOP \nbudget be included in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the tables were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            ``Here We Go Again'': Senator Ernest F.

Mr. President, as a member of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, I am pleased the distinguished chairman, Mr. \nMurkowski, has agreed to participate in a colloquy with me and my \ncolleague from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne, concerning the energy \nprovisions of S. 1357. Has the chairman reviewed our proposed amendment \nconcerning aircraft services for the Department of the Interior?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have reviewed the amendment submitted \nby the Senators from Idaho, and it reads as follows:\n\n       On page 395, line 24, after ``shall'' insert ``, unless it \n     would be more cost-effective for the Department to use \n     government-owned and operated aircraft,''.\n       On page 396, lines 8 and 9, after ``suppression'' insert \n     ``and those that it would be more cost effective to retain \n     under subsection (a).''.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. As the chairman knows, the Energy provisions of S. \n1357 would change Department of the Interior practices relating to \naircraft services by requiring the Secretary to sell all DOI aircraft \nand related equipment and facilities--except those whose primary \npurpose is fire suppression--and instead contract necessary aircraft \nservices from private entities. Am I correct that this provision is \ntargeted at saving tax dollars and stopping Government waste?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, an independent study of the Bureau of \nReclamation's Government-owned, Government-operated aircraft service in \nBoise, ID, found that it saved more tax dollars than other options, \nincluding contracting out. Would the chairman agree that the committee \ndid not intend to eliminate truly cost-effective programs that happened \nto be Government-owned and operated, such as that of the Bureau of \nReclamation in Idaho?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator is correct. Let me assure the Senators \nfrom Idaho that we are committed to achieving the best and fairest deal \nfor American taxpayers. We will work in conference to further clarify \nthe changes in S. 1357 to address the concerns of my colleagues from \nIdaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for making a \nclarification that I believe will serve the best interests of taxpayers \nand the efficient delivery of Government services.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I also thank my chairman for accommodating \nour concerns while preserving the fairness and cost savings of the \nEnergy Committee's provisions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased that this bill contains \nthe essential elements of S. 959, the Capital Formation Act of 1995.\n  That bill, which I cosponsored with Senator Hatch, had over 40 \ncosponsors.\n  I am pleased that the bill before us contains a broad-based capital \ngains tax cut as well as a targeted provision which provides a \nsweetened incentive to invest in small businesses. I would have liked \nit if the real estate loss provision had been included by the Senate \nFinance Committee and I intend to work to see that that provision is \nincluded in conference.\n  I think it is important to understand that the benefits of a capital \ngains cut are not limited to the wealthy. Anyone who has stock, who has \nmoney invested in a mutual fund, who has investment property, who has a \nstock option plan has a state in this debate. We are talking about \nmillions and millions of American families.\n  Unlike most other industrialized nations, we stifle savings and \ninvestment by overtaxing that savings and investment.\n  This capital gains bill rewards those who are willing to invest their \nmoney and not spend it. It rewards people who put their money in places \nwhere it will add to our national pool of savings. Businesses can draw \non this pool of savings to meet their capital needs, expand their \nbusinesses, and hire more workers.\n  Of course, people who are wealthy can benefit from this proposal \ncapital gains cut but only because they are willing to put their money \nin places where that money will create wealth.\n  I would like to close with a quote from this year's Nobel Prize \nwinner in economics, Robert Lucas. He said, and I quote, ``When I left \ngraduate school in 1963, I believed that the single most desirable \nchange in the U.S. tax structure would be the taxation of gains as \nordinary income. I now believe that neither capital gains nor any of \nthe income from capital should be taxed at all.'' Professor Lucas goes \non to say that his analysis shows that even under conservative \nassumptions, eliminating capital gains taxes would increase available \ncapital in this country by about 35 percent.\n  I could not agree more on the need to increase available capital and \nI would invite anyone who does not think we have a problem with \navailable capital to visit any of the thousands of economically \ndistressed urban and rural countries across this country. While the \ncapital gains provision before us reduces, but does not eliminate the \ntax on capital gains as Professor Lucas would prefer, I hope that you \nwill join in supporting this provision.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2985\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I voted for the resolution offered by the \nsenior Senator from Pennsylvania which expresses the sense of the \nSenate that this body should enact a flat tax.\n  Our current Tax Code is complicated and almost incomprehensible to \nmany of our citizens who must comply with its provisions.\n\n[[Page S 16056]]\n\n  It is high time that we simplify the Tax Code. Simplification should \nand must be on the front burner.\n  We need to consider a flat tax in our search for simplification. But, \nwhatever we do, we must not abandon fundamental fairness and \nprogressivity.\n  A number of questions remain to be answered with respect to the flat \ntax. What will be the impact of disallowing the mortgage interest \ndeduction or the charitable deduction? If companies can no longer \ndeduct their contributions to employee pension plans or health care \nplans--will they continue to make those contributions?\n  There are a lot of questions that need to be answered about a flat \ntax. But it does have one thing going for it. It has to be simpler than \nour current code.\n  As we develop an alternative to the current tax structure, we want to \nkeep an eye on simplicity and fairness.\n  We need an alternative to our current Tax Code. This sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution starts us on our way to structuring a simplified tax \nsystem.\n\n\n                        enhanced enterprise zone\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I had intended to offer an amendment \nwith Senator Abraham to supercharge the enterprise communities and \nempowerment zones we created in 1993\n  This amendment builds on S. 1252, the Enhanced Enterprise Zone Act of \n1995, which I have introduced with Senator Abraham. Our effort has been \nvery bipartisan--to date Senators Santorum, Moseley-Braun, DeWine, \nBreaux, and Frist have all agreed to sign on as cosponsors of 1252.\n  Across this country, there are differing views on the state of race \nrelations, affirmative action, and minority set-aside programs like the \n8(a) program. Racial divisions in this country have been highlighted by \nthe O.J. Simpson trial and to some extent, I believe, healed by the \nmessage that came out of the Million Man March.\n  The differences across America on issues like affirmative action and \n8(a) also exist among Members of the U.S. Senate. That being said, I \nbelieve that each and every Member of the Senate believes the \nfollowing: that regardless of what we each believe we should do about \nthe racial divisions in this country, what to do about affirmative \naction, and what to do about minority set-aside programs, we all \nbelieve that not enough is being done to help those people who live and \nwork in and want to start business in the economically distressed urban \nand rural areas of this country. Any response to the economic distress \nin urban and rural areas which does not include a mechanism to attract \nbusinesses and jobs back to these areas is a response that is destined \nfor failure.\n  Last week the Senate Small Business Committee held a hearing on S. \n1252 and former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp had this to say:\n\n       The train wreck is not so much the inability to reconcile \n     the differences between the House and the Senate over the \n     budget . . . The real train wreck is what those 400,000 men \n     were saying on the Mall a few days ago: that there are not \n     enough jobs in America. We are not creating enough \n     opportunities for people to become entrepreneurs, to become \n     owners, to become homeowners, to become business owners. To \n     get jobs not only as truck drivers, but someday to own the \n     truck and maybe start a little trucking company.\n\n  We took a step toward identifying and helping these areas of economic \ndistress by passing the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Communities Act \nin 1993 with much-needed help from this President. With the passage of \nthat legislation, Congress recognized something that our States have \nacknowledged for many years: Government loses the war on poverty when \nit fights alone. What we really need to do is figure out a way to pull \nthe people and the places with little or no stake in our economic \nsystem, into our system.\n  The 1993 legislation was a fundamental change in urban policy. It was \na recognition that American business can and must play a role in \nrevitalizing poor neighborhoods.\n  The 1993 legislation was a critical step in the right direction. But \nwe need to go further, particularly in helping the existing 94 \nenterprise communities. This amendment is designed to supercharge these \nzones. We propose to add tax incentives and other Federal assistance to \nthese zones with an eye toward the creation of economic opportunities \nfor the urban and rural poor.\n  Very briefly, this amendment provides a zero capital gains tax on the \nsale of any qualified zone stock, business property, or partnership \ninterest that has been held for at least 5 years within an EZ or EC; it \nallows individuals to deduct the purchase of qualified enterprise zone \nstock from their incomes--up to $100,000 in 1 year and $500,000 in \ntheir lifetime and it allows businesses to double the maximum allowable \nexpensing for purchases of plant and equipment in enterprise zones.\n\n  This amendment also includes a modified version of a proposal which \nSenator Hutchison has been working on to provide a limited tax credit \nto businesses to help defray the cost of construction, expansion, and \nrenovation. While revenue constraints have forced us to scale back that \nproposal we hope it will work so well that we will want to expand it in \nthe future.\n  A third initiative embraced by this package is low-income home \nownership and residential management of public housing. Jack Kemp has \nbeen instrumental in pressing us to make this happen.\n  Setting down a stake in the system has been out of reach for the \npoorest among us for far too long. We believe this amendment will \ncreate opportunity for those who work hard, ownership opportunities for \nthose who want to own property and support for those families who need \nit.\n  Last week, the New York Times carried a story about Mr. Lavale \nThomas, a former Green Bay Packer running back and current black \nentrepreneur, speaking to a group of high school students in \nWashington, DC. And here are the questions the students asked Thomas: \n``How did you get a loan? Was it harder for a black man to get banks to \nlend money than a white man? Would blacks buy from other blacks? What \ndid he give back to the community?''\n  These are great questions for kids to be asking. They all get at the \nissue of, ``How do I become part of the system?'' This amendment is \ndesigned to make it easier for these students to become part of the \nsystem and to build a better future for themselves.\n  While we will not be offering this amendment today, I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting much-needed help for our \neconomically distressed areas by supporting S. 1252.\n\n\n                         nursing home standards\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I voted yes today on the Cohen-Pryor \namendment to reinstate Federal nursing home standards. I did so in part \nbecause the so-called Finance Committee manager's amendment, which \nincluded a provision on nursing home standards, was not completed and \navailable at the time of the vote on Cohen-Pryor. The language in the \nmanager's amendment may be preferable over Cohen-Pryor. But, because \nthe amendment was not available for review, I was not able to compare \nthe language of Cohen-Pryor with the manager's amendment to see which \nis the better version for seniors and nursing homes in Montana.\n  My vote on Cohen-Pryor in no way means that I favor the Cohen-Pryor \namendment over the nursing home provisions in the manager's amendment, \nwhich the Senate hopefully will be able to review later today.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to talk \nabout a proposal I have been working on to make the child tax credit \nbetter. This proposal, called Kid$ave, would do much to address a \nnumber of the fundamental problems we face today as well as the \nproblems our children will face in the future. I had hoped to offer \nthis proposals as an amendment to the bill before us but I am not \nconvinced there is adequate time in this process to give this proposal \na thorough airing. For this reason, I would like to outline this \nproposal and ask that the conferees on this bill review this proposal \nin conference.\n  Kid$ave would transform the $500 middle-class tax credit being \nconsidered by the Finance Committee into a long-term retirement savings \naccount. In addition to providing for the economic security of the next \ngeneration, the proposal would buttress savings and investment for the \neconomic security of this generation.\n  Kid$ave allows parents to set aside an annual $500 credit in an IRA \nin their child's name. The tax-deferred account would be governed by \nIRA rules, with \n\n[[Page S 16057]]\none exception: children would be allowed to take a 10-year loan against \nthis money for their higher education. Thanks to the wonders of \ncompound interest, $500 a year set aside from birth to age 18 would, at \n10 percent interest a year, grow to $1.3 million by the time the child \nreached age 59\\1/2\\, the age at which IRA funds can start to be \nwithdrawn with no penalty.\n  One of our greatest challenges is how to create economic opportunity \nand wealth for the working families of this country. I believe Kid$ave \nhelps us meet that challenge in an affordable, responsible way. If \nthere is going to be a tax credit to help families with children, I \nbelieve there is no better way to provide that help than to offer \nparents the opportunity to ensure a sound financial future for their \nchildren.\n  That is good news for the future. But Kid$ave is good news for the \npresent, as well. Kid$ave will help our economy today by creating a \npool of savings available for investment. As you know, savings and \ninvestment rates in the United States are at historic lows: our \nhousehold savings rate is 4.6 percent of disposable income, compared to \nJapan's 14.8 percent and Germany's 12.3 percent. When government \ndeficits are factored in, U.S. net national savings falls to 2.07 \npercent. When our historic trade deficits are added to our plummeting \nsavings rates, the result is an immense disinvestment in our economic \nfuture.\n  While the Social Security trust fund is locked into Federal \nsecurities, Kid$ave would create a savings pool that would soon be the \nlargest in the country, available for investment directly in our \neconomy. It would deal directly with our national savings problem by \nassuring a long term capital source for economic growth and job \ncreation. In other words, Kid$ave can help children when they retire, \nand it can help them find work until they retire.\n  The proposal speaks to the problems we will face from changing \nnational demographics. Because the baby boom is such a large population \ngroup, we will be imposing a vast financial burden on our children's \ngeneration to fund upcoming social security, pension and health care \nobligations, jeopardizing the long term availability of those programs \nto the following generations of Americans. This will create what \nProfessor Rudy Dornbusch of MIT calls a true crunch in world capital \nmarkets, since we share that demographics problem with our industrial \ncompetitors in Europe and Asia. That capital shortage--which means \nmajor government and private sector borrowing to meet social and \npension obligations and resulting sky high interest rates--will have \nserious ramifications for future economic growth unless we act now to \nhead it off. The best course to take is to encourage a large buildup in \nprivate savings rates. Kid$ave tackles that problem head on.\n  One additional advantage of Kid$ave should be noted, although it is \nharder to quantify at this time. This is the effect of encouraging \nAmericans to save. The ethic of thriftiness seems to have been lost in \nrecent decades, replaced by a credit car mentality. We would compound \nour problems if we pass such bad habits on to future generations. \nKid$ave can help us turn the tide of indebtedness into a groundswell of \nsavings and can transform our whole attitude toward money and how to \nuse it to best advantage. That will yield incalculable dividends for \nour nation down the road.\n  I would like to offer Kid$ave to all children in America. But I \nunderstand that revenue targets may require limits on who receives the \ncredit, at least at the outset. I also understand that the Senate is \ndivided between those who would like to cut taxes for middle-class \nfamilies now and those who would prefer to balance the budget first. I \nbelieve Kid$ave can bridge that divide because it is a better kind of \ntax cut, one that helps us address the Nation's savings and investment \ncrisis even as it provides tax relief.\n  But best of all, unlike any other proposal on the table, Kid$ave \ngives our children a tangible, financial head start on the rest of \ntheir lives.\n  In closing, let me say that whether or not you believe a family tax \ncut is a good idea at this time, this is an idea that improves on that \ncredit. Last week's Baltimore Sun carried an article coauthored by an \nunlikely pair: John Rother of the AARP and Martha Philips of the \nConcord Coalition As they point out, they do not agree on much, but \nthey do agree that a Kid$ave-like approach to a tax cut makes sense. \nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of their article \nbe printed in the Record and I would encourage my colleagues to take a \nclose look at this idea.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Oct. 17, 1995]\n\n       If We Must Have a Tax Credit for Children, Do It This Way\n\n                  (By Martha Phillips and John Rother)\n\n       Washington.--You can probably count on half the fingers of \n     one hand the number of times recently that the Concord \n     Coalition, which works for a balanced budget, and the \n     American Association of Retired Persons, which advocates for \n     the elderly, have been on the same side of a public-policy \n     battle. The current debate over the child tax credit is one \n     of those rare instances of common ground.\n       We are dismayed at the prospect of enacting an unnecessary \n     and large tax cut at this time--even one benignly labeled a \n     ``child tax credit.'' A large tax cut only makes the job of \n     reducing the deficit that much tougher and leads to deeper \n     program cuts than otherwise would be necessary, including \n     cuts in programs that help children. The economy is not \n     faltering, so there is little justification for stimulating \n     it by pumping another $500 a year per child into consumer \n     spending. Over the long term, the economy needs more savings, \n     which is the chief rationale for balancing the budget in the \n     first place.\n       Congress and the president nevertheless have signed on to \n     the child tax credit notion, so some version seems likely to \n     be enacted. If there is to be a new children's tax credit, we \n     think an idea that Senators Bob Kerrey and Joe Lieberman and \n     several others have been working on is much better than \n     anything else we have seen.\n       Although the specific details remain to be worked out, \n     their central idea is simple. Allow a $500 tax-refundable \n     credit for children under age 18 only if the money is \n     invested in qualified retirement accounts for that child's \n     old-age security. Funds in the accounts would not be taxed \n     until they were withdrawn by the child at retirement age.\n       If the child saves the $500 credit every year from birth \n     for 18 years, there would be a retirement nest egg of $9,000, \n     plus another $4,000 to $16,000 in compounded earnings by the \n     time the child reached age 18. That's nice, but it gets much \n     better. Over every 40-year period since the Great Depression, \n     diversified equity funds have generated returns of somewhere \n     between 6 percent and 10 percent. Even if another penny were \n     never added to the account after age 18, by the time the \n     child reached age 65, the account would be worth a quarter of \n     a million dollars at a 6 percent real rate of return, and \n     three quarters of a million dollars at 8 percent. Leaving the \n     initial $9,000 untouched until age 70 would result in $1.1 \n     million at an average 8 percent return.\n       These savings would be available to fuel long-term economic \n     growth and could help provide not only future jobs but an \n     improving standard of living for today's children when they \n     are grown. The impressive results of compound earnings over \n     65 or 70 years would help assure old-age economic security \n     for a generation whose prospects today appear uncertain. \n     Since private pensions today cover fewer than half of all \n     workers, and since economic surveys show most households with \n     inadequate levels of private retirement savings, it is clear \n     that we need a new approach. The income from these \n     individually-owned retirement savings would permit everyone \n     in future generations to supplement Social Security benefits, \n     as originally intended.\n       In order to minimize unnecessary risk and overhead, these \n     retirement accounts could be administered in the same way as \n     the federal-employee retirement-savings program. There could \n     be a wide range of investment options combined with the \n     efficiencies and safety of large pools of investment funds.\n       There will inevitably be pressure to permit non-retirement \n     withdrawals from such accounts. Withdrawals for education or \n     health-care needs may very well be in the child's best long-\n     term interests, but any exceptions permitting early \n     withdrawals must be narrow. The full retirement-income \n     benefit to the individual will be at risk for early \n     withdrawal, and one exception leads to pressures for another, \n     undermining the long-term benefit of this approach.\n\n\n                        A phase-out for the rich\n\n       There is no need, of course, to give a $500-per-child \n     contribution to children whose parents can already provide \n     for their futures. So the tax credit should be phased out for \n     higher-income families with the option for those parents to \n     contribute $500 yearly on an after-tax basis.\n       The intangible benefits of this approach may be hard to \n     measure, but may ultimately be more important. Children who \n     today see little prospect for their future will have a \n     tangible stake in thinking longer term. The fact that these \n     accounts exist in their names and are growing over time will \n     reinforce the importance of other types of deferred-\n     gratification behavior. We shouldn't discount the \n\n[[Page S 16058]]\n     impact that such accounts will have on our children, even though they \n     cannot use them immediately.\n       Any legislative proposal must be evaluated in context as \n     part of a budget package. We need to be especially sensitive \n     to the impact of proposed spending reductions and other tax \n     changes on programs for children, working families and \n     vulnerable seniors. Again, our organizations do not think we \n     should be considering major tax cuts at this point. But if \n     Congress is determined to enact a tax cut, we think it should \n     consider this proposal first. It's good for our children, for \n     the economy and for the long-term needs of future retirement-\n     age Americans.\n       The concept that Senators Kerrey, Lieberman and others are \n     working on hasn't been introduced as legislation, and we may \n     well disagree with the particulars they finally devise. But \n     at bottom, the general proposal remains a very compelling \n     option. Properly structured, the children's saving credit \n     offers a way to leave a legacy of savings, responsibility and \n     security to Americans of all ages and income levels.\n\n\n                stop the billion dollar golden giveaways\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the reconciliation bill promises to cut \ncorporate welfare, save taxpayers' money and balance the Federal \nbudget. Yet, tucked away, deep in the more than 2,000 pages of the \nbill, is a golden giveaway of billions of taxpayers' dollars to a \npowerful special interest lobby.\n  Initially passed to encourage settlement of the West, the \nanachronistic 1872 mining law enables gigantic mining interests--many \nof which are foreign-owned--to purchase the right to mine Federal land \nfor as little as $5 per acre. Literally, for the price of a McDonalds \nvalue meal you can buy an acre of Federal land, loaded with gold, \nsilver, platinum and palladium. If this was not enough of a ripoff, the \nlaw does not require mining concerns to pay any royalties to American \ntaxpayers for these minerals, an annual loss of roughly $100 million. \nThe net effect of this law is simple: Foreign mining companies get the \ngold, and American taxpayers get the shaft.\n  The sham reform contained in the bill does little to change the \ncurrent situation. Though the bill requires that fair market value be \npaid, it only applies this standard to the surface of, what is often \ntimes, barren desert land. No consideration is given to the minerals, \nto the gold, silver and platinum, which are buried underneath the \nground. It sounds good on its face--paying fair market value--but this \nalleged reform is nothing more than face-saving.\n  Our conservative colleagues argue endlessly that we need to run the \nFederal Government, more like a business. But how could any business \nsurvive, even for a day, by opening its warehouse doors and giving away \nits products?\n  On top of these fraudulent prospective changes, the bill's grand \nfathering provisions guarantee the status quo for over 200 claims \ncurrently pending with the Interior Department. These applications, \ninvolving over 130,000 acres of public land, 18 national parks, and \nmore than $15 billion in precious minerals, would be granted without \nthe rightful payment to the taxpayers who own the land. Again, billions \nof taxpayers' money is given away, just handed over due to this \nantiquated law.\n  Just last month, Secretary of the Interior Babbitt was forced to sign \naway over 100 acres of land, containing 1 billion dollars' worth of \nminerals to a Danish mining conglomerate which paid an embarrassing \n$275--Federal couch change. This century-old practice has become eerily \nreminiscent of the Teapot Dome scandal during the 1920's.\n  Unlike farmers and ranches who have a vested interest in preserving \ntheir land, miners have virtually no stake in using the land in an \nenvironmentally sound manner. After the gold is taken, the shaft is \nplugged, and the company abandons the land, often times we are left \nwith dangerous, toxic abandoned mines, which require millions of \ntaxpayers' dollars to clean up. In fact, the Superfund national \npriority list of hazardous waste sites contains 59 properties \nassociated with mining.\n  The cosmetic mining law reform in this bill is exactly the type of \nnonsensical policy that has angered many Americans and caused them to \nlose faith in Government's ability to improve the lives of ordinary \npeople. It ought to be rejected: The pot of gold should be found at the \nend of the rainbow, not at the end of a patent application. Americans \ndeserve better.\n\n\n                                  eitc\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise with a few thoughts on this bill \noverall, and on the cuts we are contemplating in the earned income tax \ncredit [EITC] in particular.\n  This bill has a lot to recommend it. It provides incentives in the \ntax code for positive goals. The super IRA provisions will encourage \nsavings. That is a constructive step forward. The capital gains piece \nwill encourage people to put money where it will create wealth--that is \nto say it will encourage investment. While I've supported a middle-\nclass tax credit, I think we could have made the credit even better by \ngiving it to parents who set up retirement accounts for the kids. Those \naccounts would be governed by IRA rules with one exception--children \nwould be allowed to take a 10-year loan against their account for \nhigher education. And I'm not enthusiastic about what this bill does to \nMedicare--not because this bill does too much, but because it does too \nlittle to change the built-in flaws in this program.\n  Overall, I'm encouraged by what this bill does to provide incentives \nfor savings and investment and the creation of jobs and capital. \nHowever, in terms of incentives it falls woefully short in one area. \nThat is in the dramatic and misguided cuts this bill makes in the \nearned income tax credit [EITC].\n  Let me tell you why I like the EITC and why I think that the \nRepublican Party should embrace, not eviscerate this program. Put \nsimply, the EITC provides an incentive to work. It promotes work over \nwelfare and it does so through the Tax Code, not through a new social \nservice program run by bureaucrats in Washington. That is something \nboth parties should be able to support and indeed, in the past, both \nsupported the EITC.\n  President Reagan championed this program as the ``best antipoverty, \nthe best pro-family, the best job-creation measure to come out of \nCongress.'' Last week in testimony before the Senate Small Business \nCommittee, former HUD Secretary Kemp cautioned against cutting back too \nfar on the EITC ``because that is a tax increase on low income workers \nand the poor which is unconscionable at this time * * *''\n  I am particularly troubled that the Senate has cut $43 billion out of \nthis program over 7 years--this figure is nearly doublt what the House \nhas cut from the EITC in their reconciliation package. And this cut of \n$43 billion is a dramatic increase in the cuts this Chamber agreed on \nduring consideration of the budget resolution just 5 months ago. That \nresolution assumed $21 billion in EITC cuts. I found that proposed cut \ndistressing. We are now talking about nearly tripling that cut. I find \nthat downright alarming.\n  Here are the people we will hurt the most with these proposals: \nWorkers without children who receive the EITC. These are workers with \nincomes under $10,000; EITC families with one child and incomes above \n$12,000 and; EITC families with two or more children regardless of how \nlow their income.\n  In practical terms, about 17 million low- and moderate-income \nfamilies--including nearly 13 million low-income families with children \nwill feel the impact of these changes. In my home State of Connecticut \nalone, these changes would amount to an average increase of $311 for \nover 92,000 families. This simply makes no sense. It takes us further \naway from our goal of encouraging work and self-sufficiency.\n  Of course we ought to get rid of waste and fraud in this program. I \nbelieve the administration has done a commendable job in helping in \nthat effort. But the increase in this program in recent years has been \nby design not by fraud and deviousness. Congress voted to expand this \nprogram in 1986, 1990, and 1993. When the changes we made to the \nprogram in 1993 are fully phased in at the end of fiscal year 1996, the \nEITC will actually grow by very modest rate of 4.5 percent a year.\n  This program has had bipartisan support because both sides of this \naisle have been able to agree that we should use both hands to applaud \nthose who are working to lift themselves out of poverty and then use \none of those hands to give them the help and support they deserve.\n  The Democratic Leadership Council, which I am pleased to chair, has a \nlong history of support for this program. The research and writing arm \nof the DLC, the Progressive Policy Institute \n\n[[Page S 16059]]\n[PPI] has done a lot of excellent work on the issue. At this point, I \nask unanimous consent that an article by Mr. Jeff Hammond on the EITC, \nwhich appeared in the September 29 Washington Times, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Washington Times, Sept. 29, 1995]\n\n                    Relief for the Hard-Working Poor\n\n                          (By M. Jeff Hamond)\n\n       This year, both House and Senate have proposed reforms to \n     the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) with the intent to save \n     money rather than make the program work better. The EITC--\n     which helps millions of low-income working families escape \n     poverty--is an example of Congress targeting the good as well \n     as the bad in its quest to reduce social welfare spending.\n       This is a program that should not go quietly into the \n     night. Unlike traditional welfare programs, the EITC is based \n     on the principle of reciprocal responsibility: It says that \n     the government is there to help, but only if you give \n     something back or help yourself in the process. Republicans \n     have supported the credit in the past; in fact, its biggest \n     one-year boost occurred under President Reagan, in 1986. Why \n     change now?\n       Specifically, the EITC assists low-wage workers by \n     providing a wage supplement up to a certain level of \n     earnings, at which the credit reaches a maximum and then \n     begins to phase out. President Clinton's five-year, $21 \n     billion expansion of the EITC, approved in 1993, was designed \n     to guarantee that families with full-time, year-round workers \n     would not live in poverty.\n       By promoting work over welfare with virtually no overhead \n     costs or added bureaucracy, the EITC provides the foundation \n     for any serious effort at welfare reform. The program could \n     use some fine-tuning, but most of the charges leveled by \n     critics are exaggerated or plainly incorrect.\n       Rising costs. Some critics of the EITC, most notably Sen. \n     Don Nickles, Oklahoma Republican, depict it as another out-\n     of-control entitlement program, since its costs have grown \n     quickly. ``The EITC is the fastest-growing government \n     program, period,'' Mr. Nickles has said. ``It's growing much \n     faster than Medicare or Medicaid.''\n       Detractors conveniently ignore, however, that Congress \n     voted to expand the program in 1986, 1990, and 1993, in part \n     as an alternative to increasing the minimum wage. This is in \n     stark contrast to the major entitlement programs such as \n     Medicare, which automatically grow every year with no \n     congressional action. To depict the EITC as simply another \n     exploding entitlement program is simply wrong.\n       Waste, Fraud and Abuse. Critics of the EITC claim the \n     program has a fraud rate of 35 to 45 percent, costing \n     taxpayers billions of dollars in fraudulent refunds. This \n     statistic is based on a January 1994 IRS study, and is \n     inaccurate and misleading for several reasons.\n       First, that statistic is an error rate, not a fraud rate. \n     If a worker claimed the credit but was $1 off--or claimed too \n     little--this was included in the statistic. Many of these \n     inadvertent mistakes are corrected by the IRS. Nearly half of \n     the supposed ``fraudulent'' claims were unintentional errors \n     of this type.\n       Second, some taxpayers who claimed the credit in error \n     (i.e., when they did not qualify) may have done so \n     unintentionally, due to the complicated tax laws.\n       Third, the study was based on 1993 returns. Since than, the \n     IRS has implemented new procedures to cut down on fraud, such \n     as double-checking the Social Security numbers of all \n     dependents claimed. Thus, the fraud and error rate will be \n     much lower for 1994 and future tax years.\n       Work Disincentive. Some critics assert that the EITC is \n     actually a net work disincentive, because the phase-out of \n     the credit in effect applies an additional 16 to 21 percent \n     tax to earnings within the phase-out range.\n       It is true that effective marginal tax rates are high in \n     this range, and that the maximum allowable income to be \n     eligible for the credit may be set too high. Nevertheless, \n     recent research shows that the EITC still provides a large \n     net positive work incentive. One recent estimate shows that \n     if market entrants work only 400 hours annually, the expanded \n     credit will increase the labor supply of low-income workers \n     by 20 million hours per year. Since the average EITC \n     recipient worked 1,300 hours in 1993, the final net benefit \n     is probably much larger.\n       Suggested Reforms. We can get people to move from welfare \n     to work only if work pays, and the EITC ensures that it will. \n     This is why many Republican governors insist that the EITC is \n     an indispensable part of welfare reform. Yet, the program is \n     not perfect. Sensible reforms include:\n       Adjusting the phase-in and phase-out ranges to maximize the \n     number of families in the former and minimize the number in \n     the latter. These changes will place more families in the \n     work incentive range of the EITC without increasing its total \n     cost. (Shortening the phase-out will increase the marginal \n     tax rate within the range, but it will affect fewer families. \n     Texas Republican Rep. Bill Archer's tax proposal--which \n     passed the Ways and Means Committee last Tuesday--does \n     shorten the phase-out range.)\n       Implementing further policies designed to cut down on \n     fraud, such as requiring valid Social Security numbers for \n     all applicants to prevent undocumented workers from claiming \n     the credit.\n       Finally, requiring firms to notify their low-wage workers \n     that the credit can be applied to each paycheck, rather than \n     collected at year's end. Less than one percent of EITC \n     recipients utilize this option. Since firms have an incentive \n     to verify hours worked (or else they will overpay payroll \n     taxes), such a requirement could further reduce fraud.\n       At a time when phrases like ``shared sacrifice'' and \n     ``welfare-to-work'' are wielded on both sides of the isle, \n     the EITC stands as an item that should unite both parties. \n     The program needs some changes, but it has been one of our \n     most successful social policies. If conservatives are serious \n     about promoting work and ensuring that full-time workers \n     escape poverty, they will help improve and preserve this \n     program--not cut it simply to reach a budget target.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, this bill includes a measure directing \nthe sale and transfer of the federally owned Collbran Project, located \nnear Grand Junction, Colorado. The provision is similar to S. 1109, \nwhich I introduced earlier this year with Senator Brown.\n  Since the introduction of this legislation I have worked with the \ncitizens of the Plateau Valley, with Mesa county officials, with \nvarious departments of the State of Colorado, and with the local and \nnational staff of the Federal Reclamation, Forest Service, and BLM.\n  In that process I have agreed to make dozens of changes to the bill; \nhowever, at the request of my colleagues on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee I will not take up the Senate's time and will \ninstead have the changes made during conference on the budget bill.\n  I do want to take a moment to describe the changes to the Collbran \nbill that I intend to make in conference.\n  From the start I have wanted to make sure the bill protects the \nlongstanding commitment to provide top quality public recreation at \nVega Reservoir. I have worked with the State to make sure that the \nFederal commitment to make major improvements at Vega is retained, and \nto provide for State ownership of the recreation facilities and open \nspace at the reservoir.\n  The Forest Service and BLM wanted to make sure the bill would not \naffect recreation or any other multiple use of the national forest, and \nthe agencies also wanted to avoid the creation of private inholdings \nwithin the Federal lands. In response, the bill will provide for \neasements to the water facilities, and provide a specific role for the \nForest Service in preparing the annual operating plan for the project.\n  The State asked, and I have agreed, that money contributed by the \ndistricts toward the recovery of endangered fish be spent on recovery \nefforts in Colorado.\n  Many folks in the Plateau Valley have raised a concern with me that \nthere will be insufficient opportunity for the public to be involved \nwith the operation of the project. I understand this concern, it is \nlegitimate, and I have tried to address it in various ways. The issue \nis ``To what extent will the Ute and Collbran Water Conservancy \nDistricts be publicly accountable in their operation of this Federal \nwater project?''\n  First, the bill states that ``the power component and facilities of \nthe project shall be operated in substantial conformity with the \nhistoric operations of the power component and facilities.'' That will \nbe the law. The language is plain.\n  Second, the bill requires annual reporting to the Secretaries of the \nInterior and Agriculture as to the operating plan for the project in \nthe coming year. The purpose of this provision is for full public \ndisclosure of annual operations.\n  I will amend that provision to increase accountability by requiring \nfull consultation with the Mesa County Commissioners and with the \nForest Service in preparation of the annual operating plan. This will \nallow the public to raise issues through the Commissioners and through \nthe Forest Service and get action on those issues through the annual \nplanning process.\n  Part of the concern that has been raised involves the extent to which \nthe bill can affect the disposition of water between the Plateau Valley \nand the Grand Valley, and this is an issue on which I have broadly \nconsulted with state officials and water lawyers. There are several \nreasons that federal legislation on this point would be unworkable. \n\n[[Page S 16060]]\n\n  First, all changes in water use are subject to state water law and \nare adjudicated through the state water court process. The water court \nis charged with protecting the interests of all associated water users \nwhen a change in use is considered or requested.\n  Second, the holding of a water right is a private property right and \none in which I frankly would oppose Federal interference.\n  And third, the Ute and Collbran Water Conservation Districts are \npublicly accountable organizations created in accordance with Colorado \nlaw. Colorado Law includes a number of provisions providing for public \naccountability, including the ability to elect board members. It would \nbe inappropriate for the Congress to interfere with that structure.\n  I will, however, amend my bill to prohibit any out of state \ntransaction involving water from this project.\n  I have appreciated the willingness of citizens and agency staff to \nwork with me on the development of this legislation. I am open minded \nabout making further changes to the bill, in addition to the many that \nhave already been made.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         HORMONAL CANCER DRUGS\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss Senator Olympia \nSnowe's amendment that I and my colleagues sponsored and the Senate \npassed last night as part of the Budget Reconciliation bill.\n  With prostate cancer striking 1 out of every 11 American men and \nbreast cancer attacking 1 out of every 8 American women, we have an \nobligation to do everything we can to ensure that the best, most \neffective treatments are available to as many patients as possible.\n  The amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that Medicare should \ncover oral hormonal cancer drugs. Oral hormonal drug therapy is \ncritical in treating cancers that have spread beyond the prostate and \nin treating estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer tumors. These \ndrugs can play a vital role in the postsurgical treatment of this type \nof breast and prostate cancer because they help prevent the recurrence \nof these tumors and improve the quality of life for thousands of cancer \npatients each year.\n  In the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, we directed Medicare to \ncover some oral cancer drugs. However, the statute requires that those \ndrugs be chemotherapeutic in nature and have been available in \ninjectable or intravenous form. Oral hormonal cancer drugs do not fall \nwithin this category. I believe this is an unintended result of a well-\nintentioned provision.\n  The result is that Medicare currently discriminates against half of \nall women afflicted with breast cancer by denying coverage for \npostsurgical drug treatments to those with estrogen receptor positive \ntumors. Because estrogen-sensitive tumors are more likely to strike \npost-menopausal women, this type of cancer disproportionately afflicts \nMedicare beneficiaries. Denying Medicare coverage for orally \nadministered hormonal therapy is an obvious case of being penny-wise \nand pound-foolish. Hormonal therapy is a less expensive treatment \noption when measured against the risk of treating new tumors which can \nresult in the absence of such therapy.\n  This relatively simple and straight-forward amendment puts the Senate \non record in support of correcting this oversight from the 1993 \nreconciliation bill. I believe that the conference report on the 1995 \nreconciliation bill should include a provision to cover oral cancer \ndrugs used in hormonal therapy. I am glad that the Senate passed this \namendment, and I am glad to have been an original cosponsor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am delighted to learn the Finance \nCommittee adopted a provision that would allow tax exempt organizations \nto be eligible to maintain pensions under section 401(k). It is my \nunderstanding that tribal governments would be allowed to sponsor \n401(k) plans under the budget reconciliation proposal reported by the \nFinance Committee.\n  In order to ensure that I am clear that tribal governments would, in \nfact, be included under this provision I would like to ask the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee a question to clarify \nthe Finance Committee's budget reconciliation proposal.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank Senator Campbell. I would be happy to answer his \nquestion.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Is my understanding correct that tribal governments are \neligible to sponsor 401(k) plans under the Finance Committee budget \nreconciliation proposal?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes; that is a correct statement.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I note the presence of the chairman of the Indian \nAffairs Committee, Senator McCain, and ask if he would have any \ncomments.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Senator Campbell, has long been a great advocate for \nIndian people. I would also like to extend my thanks to Senator Roth \nfor his efforts to clarify this portion of the pension simplification \nproposal included in the budget reconciliation measure.\n  I also wish to take this opportunity to thank Chairman Roth for \nincluding language affecting section 403(b) plans in the pension \nsimplification section of the bill that will remove a very difficult \nproblem that arose from a misunderstanding about earlier authority \nprovided to tribal education organizations. Several years ago some \ntribal governments began to purchase plans provided under section \n403(b) of the code and promoted by insurance companies only later to \nfind that such plans were not expressly intended for the use of \ngovernment employees involved in activities other than education. Those \nretirement funds, affecting several tribes and the retirement savings \nof thousands of tribal employees, are now in jeopardy. I introduced S. \n1304 to fix this problem. Chairman Roth included a similar provision in \nsection 12941 of the bill, and I thank him for that.\n\n\n                        mfn status for cambodia\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. For the past 2 years, I have been involved in an effort \nto grant most favored nations [MFN] trade status to Cambodia. Today, I \nintended to accomplish this by offering an amendment identical to the \nlanguage already approved by the House. The chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth, has informed me, however, that he would prefer \nthat trade provisions not be included in the reconciliation bill. In \ndeference to his opinion and his responsibility for guiding this bill \nthrough the process, I have decided to withhold my amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the Senator from Arizona. I know that this is a \nvery important issue for him. It is among a number of trade issues \nwhich must be dealt with by the committee in coming months. The Senator \nfrom Arizona has my assurance that the Fiance Committee will take up \nH.R. 1642--the House-passed bill dealing with this issue--the next time \nit meets to deal with trade issues, and that I will make every effort \nto have it reported out favorably.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the chairman for his cooperation and for his \ninterest in the issue. Cambodia has come a long way from the dire \nsituation it faced just a few years ago. We can help the Cambodian \npeople overcome the remaining challenges they face by empowering them \nto help themselves through economic development. This is what makes MFN \nsuch an important issue. An economically developed, prosperous Cambodia \nwill be better able to create the foundations for democracy and \ncontribute to the stability of Southeast Asia.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, this is a historic moment in the history of \nour country. Over the past several weeks, we have heard vicious attacks \non the balanced budget bill that is before the Senate today. The \nRepublican balanced budget has been called immoral and irresponsible. \nThe American people have been warned of devastating cuts in spending. \nTo the casual observer, it might appear that the sky is about to fall.\n  The truth is quite different. In fact, the budget before the Senate \ntoday is the only chance to save our country from an immoral, \nirresponsible, and devastating future. We are acting now only because \nprevious Congresses have failed the American people.\n  At the end of this year, our national debt will exceed $5 trillion. \nWe are adding to the debt at the rate of $9,600 per second. Right now, \nevery man, woman, and child in America is more than $18,000 in debt. \nThe current trends are not sustainable.\n\n[[Page S 16061]]\n\n  Mr. President, our balanced budget plan is not perfect. If there was \nan easy solution to our fiscal problems, you can rest assured that \nCongress would have found it along ago. I do not agree with every \nprovision in the bill before the Senate. If I could pick and choose, \nthere are many priorities that I would change. On the balance, however, \nI think the product is a good one. It gets the job done. To my \ncolleagues who disagree, I would say the following: you can't beat \nsomething with nothing. If you do not like our balanced budget, you \nhave an obligation to produce an alternative. President Clinton's plan \nwas recently rejected by the Senate, 96 to 0.\n  The benefits of a balanced budget far outweigh any temporary pain. \nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that a balanced budget will \nresult in a reduction of long-term interest rates between 1 and 2 \npercent. On a typical student loan, that reduction would save American \nstudents $8,885. On a typical car loan, it would save the consumer \n$676. On a 30-year, $80,000 mortgage, lower interest rates would save \nthe homeowner $38,653 over the life of the mortgage.\n  The bill before the Senate will balance the Federal budget in 7 \nyears. That fact has been certified by the Congressional Budget Office. \nThe budget will save Medicare from bankruptcy, and strengthen and \nprotect the program for future generations. The legislation completely \noverhauls our broken welfare system. It transfers power away from \nWashington bureaucrats and returns it to State and local officials.\n  Mr. President, the Senate bill also provides significant tax relief. \nI know that many of my colleagues have expressed disdain at the idea of \ncutting taxes. They find it offensive to let American taxpayers keep \nmore of their hard-earned money. I would ask, is it offensive to \nprovide a $500 per child tax credit? Is it offensive to create a tax \ncredit for adoption expenses? Is it offensive to provide a tax credit \nfor interest paid on a student loan?\n  I certainly do not think so.\n  The critics of tax cuts think Members of Congress can spend money \nbetter than a family of four in Berlin, NH, or Cleveland, OH, or \nAtlanta, GA. I find that position arrogant, and I am not alone. As is \nnow well known, the President now regrets his decision to raise taxes. \nPresumably, the President realized that the Government in Washington \nhas enough tax dollars to spend. Those who oppose the tax cuts \ncontained in the bill before the Senate today should understand this \nfact: the budget before the Senate today would reduce taxes by $245 \nbillion. It does not even completely refund the Clinton tax increase.\n  Mr. President, we are witnessing the last gasp of air of big-\ngovernment, Washington-knows-best liberalism. It may come as a shock to \nmany, but Uncle Sam is not the solution to every problem in America.\n  I have held a good many town meetings in New Hampshire to talk about \nthe budget, taxes, welfare reform, and Medicare. Often, when I say that \nCongress intends to balance the budget in 7 years, my constituents ask \nwhy we are waiting that long. The danger is not going ``too far, too \nfast,'' as many would have us believe. The real risk to all Americans \nis the risk that we will not get the job done.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this budget. It is bold; it is real, \nand it stands alone as the only solution to our Nation's fiscal \nproblems. The time for talking is over. The time for acting is now.\n\n\n                           usec privatization\n\n  Mr. WARNER. In title V of the bill before the Senate there are \nprovisions that will provide for the privatization of the U.S. \nEnrichment Corporation. I understand the Energy Committee is also \nreporting this language out as a substitute to S. 755, a bill \noriginally introduced by Senator Domenici to accomplish the same \npurpose.\n  Mr. President, I commend Senators Domenici, Murkowski, Johnston, \nFord, and others for their efforts to produce legislation that balances \nour country's need for a private uranium enrichment company with a \nnonproliferation solution that assists Russia in its weapons \ndismantlement. However, I seek a few clarifications, as well as your \nassurance, that the language in the reconciliation bill will allow the \nRussian Federation an opportunity to be able to fulfill its obligations \neasily with options, perhaps those offered by U.S. private industry to \nassist where possible.\n  With regard to section 5007(c) of the reconciliation bill, the \nexclusion of U.S. Department of Energy facilities from production of \nhighly enriched uranium, I want to urge the U.S. Enrichment Corporation \nto make use of sector services and facilities prior to making any \ncontractual work agreements with the U.S. Government.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is true that our language allows \nUSEC to contract with existing DOE facilities for activities and \nservices other than the production of highly enriched uranium. To the \nextent that there is a longstanding government policy that the Federal \nGovernment not compete for work that the private industry can supply, I \nagree that the DOE should defer opportunities to the private sector.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator, I wish now for clarification of \nsection 5012(b), regarding Russian HEU. Does this language provide for \ncontingency private industry provisions to assist the Russians in \nmeeting their obligations in the government-to-government agreement of \nproviding the United States with low enriched uranium derived from \nhighly enriched uranium?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The government-to-government agreement for the 500 \nmetric tons of highly enriched uranium contemplates the participation \nof the United States private sector and Russian enterprises in \nimplementation of the agreement. Section 5012(b) facilitates this \nimplementation by providing mechanisms for private sector entities to \npurchase the natural uranium component of LEU derived from Russian HEU, \neither directly from Russia or in an auction process, in an open and \ncompetitive manner. The United States and Russia also have the ability \nto increase the quantities delivered in any given year and accelerate \nthe delivery schedule of this material to the United States, provided \nthat this material is introduced into the U.S. commercial fuel market \nin full accordance with this legislation.\n  Furthermore, neither this legislation nor the government-to-\ngovernment agreement limits the ability of Russia to sell additional \nquantities of enriched uranium, in excess of 500 metric tons called for \nby the government-to-government agreement, to third parties for \ndelivery to the United States, subject to the market restrictions as \nstated in the bill before us and other applicable law.\n  Overall, this legislation and its provisions will: First, advance the \nworld's nonproliferation goals; second, provide the Russian Federation \nimmediate hard currency and; third, assist the Russians in meeting \nfuture continuing obligations.\n  Mr. WARNER. My last question. Are there provisions in this bill to \nallow either the change of executive agent or nominating more than one \nU.S. executive marketing agent to help facilitate these uranium \ntransactions?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Our language recognizes and does not change the right \nof the U.S. Government under the government-to-government agreement to \nexercise its option of changing the U.S. executive agent or allowing \nfor more than one after consultation with and upon 30 days notice to \nthe Russian Federation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Again, I commend you on this legislation that will \npromote the United States and Russia's nonproliferation goals, offer \neach country an opportunity to use private industry to meet these \ngoals, and present to the world a concerted effort to denuclearize.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to set the record straight \non the need to reform the corporate alternative minimum tax.\n  What we have under current law is a nightmare for investment for \nbusinesses of all sizes. The AMT is not working as Congress intended \nwhen it was adopted in 1986. We never intended to so harshly penalize \ninvestment in equipment needed to modernize our factories; nor did we \nintend to force companies that have no profit to borrow money to pay \ntheir AMT. Yet this is precisely what current law does to some \ncompanies.\n  There is bipartisan agreement on the need to fix AMT. President \nClinton in \n\n[[Page S 16062]]\n1993 recognized the need to fix the AMT and proposed shortening AMT \ndepreciation recovery periods. To date, we have not adopted the \nPresident's proposal in full. For this reason, earlier this year, I \njoined with Democrats and Republican cosponsors of S. 1000, a \nreasonable piece of legislation, to help correct this antiinvestment \ntax system.\n  While I commend the Finance Committee for taking some action on this \nissue, that action falls short of what ultimately needs to be done. \nThere are two parts to AMT depreciation--method and recovery period. \nThis bill fixes the method of depreciation, but does not do enough for \nthe recovery period. Yet it is the unreasonably long recovery period \nfor most investments under the AMT that creates the severe penalty on \ninvestment.\n  S. 1000 fixes both parts of the AMT depreciation problem and I \nbelieve it is the right policy on AMT. I hope in conference and in \nnegotiations with the White House that we can come up with a bill that \nwill truly fix the antiinvestment nature of the AMT depreciation rules. \nThis can be done in a way that preserves the integrity of the tax \ncollection process by not letting truly profitable firms totally escape \ntaxation while at the same time encouraging economic growth and job \ncreation which I believe is essential to an improved standard of living \nfor all Americans.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I would like to confirm with my colleague from Alaska \nthe committee's intent with respect to part E, subpart III of S. 1357, \nwhich provides for the sale and transfer of the Collbran project \nlocated in western Colorado. This legislation directs the Secretary of \nthe Interior to transfer the Collbran project to the Collbran \nConservancy District and Ute Water Conservancy District in the last \nfiscal quarter of the year 2000 in return for the payment of $12.9 \nmillion by the districts to the United States. The transfer to the \ndistricts includes the listed facilities and other assets that comprise \nthe Collbran project, but excludes the Vega recreation facilities owned \nby the United States or the State of Colorado. Several questions have \nbeen raised regarding the legislation. First, some have raised a \nconcern that it may include or affect the Plateau Creek pipeline \nreplacement project which has been proposed independently by the Ute \nWater Conservancy District.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Committee carefully defined the scope of the \ntransfer so that this legislation will have no affect on the proposed \nPlateau Creek pipeline replacement project, which will be subject to \nall requirements of Federal and State law which would exist if the \ntransfer did not occur.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Another issue that has arisen is regarding the \nrelationship between the legislation and the Endangered Species Act. In \nparticular, questions have been raised regarding the effect of the \npayment of $600,000 by the districts for use as a part of the Colorado \nRiver Endangered Species Fish Recovery Program, and whether a section 7 \nconsultation will be required for the transfer. My understanding of the \nlegislation is that it has no effect on the Endangered Species Act, and \nthat no determination has been made regarding the existence of any \nobligation or liability of the Collbran project or other existing water \nsupply projects in the Colorado River Basin in Colorado with respect to \nspecies listed and critical habitat designated under the Endangered \nSpecies Act. In addition, because the transfer is mandatory, and will \nnot involve any change in project operations or additional review or \napproval by any Federal agency, there is no need for a section 7 \nconsultation on the transfer.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is correct. The legislation provides that, as a \ncondition of the mandatory transfer, $600,000 of the total payment of \n$12.9 million be provided to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service for use \nin the Recovery Implementation Program for the endangered fish apecies \nin the Upper Colorado River Basin, which is intended to serve as a \nreasonable and prudent alternative for water depletions from all \nexisting and future water projects in the Colorado River Basin in \nColorado. In the event that any such determination is made in the \nfuture, and if the Recovery Implementation Program no longer serves its \nintended purpose, the Collbran project will be treated the same as any \nother existing, similarly situated nonfederal project in western \nColorado, and the districts will be able to claim credit for this \ncontribution to the same extent as any other entities which have made \ncash contributions to the Recovery Implementation Program.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. The transfer of the Collbran project is based on the \nrequirement that the water and power resources produced by the project \nwill continue to be used for the purposes for which the project was \nauthorized for a period of 40 years from the date of enactment of the \nlegislation. This requirement ensures that the transfer will not cause \nany significant change in project operations or distribution of \nbenefits, and obviates any need for any further study or review of the \ntransfer. However, some have sought assurance that the legislation does \nnot interfere with the district's ability to negotiate a contract with \npreference power customers in the Salt Lake City Area Integrated \nprojects office of WAPA or their designee for operation and maintenance \nof the power features of the Collbran project.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The legislation does not affect the ability of the \ndistricts to obtain additional cost savings by contracting with third \nparties in order to achieve more efficient operation of the power \nfeatures of the project or for other purposes.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I would also like to confirm my understanding that the \ntransfer renders moot the pending litigation by the Department of \nJustice regarding water rights for Vega Reservoir.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is correct. The pending litigation initiated by \nthe Department of Justice for the purpose of obtaining water rights in \nthe name of the United States for the Collbran project should be \ndismissed in light of the mandatory requirement for the transfer of the \nCollbran project to the districts.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Finally, the legislation provides that the Vega \nrecreation facilities be transferred to the State of Colorado at a \nfuture date, which includes lands currently owned by the United States \nin sections 31, 32, and 33 of township 9 south, range 93 west, 6th \nprincipal meridian, and sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of township 10 south, \nrange 93 west, 6th principal meridian. Does the transfer of these \nfacilities to the State include any of Collbran project facilities, and \ndoes the transfer of the project provide the districts with any land \nthat could be sold in the future for residential development?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. No, the Collbran project facilities, and the lands \nupon which they are located, are to be transferred to the districts. \nHowever, the lands to be conveyed to the districts do not include the \nundeveloped lands surrounding Vega Reservoir, as these lands are to be \nconveyed to the State of Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank my colleague.\n\n\n            Tax Credit for Research and Development Projects\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of a \nbipartisan effort to extend the tax credit for research and development \nprojects engaged in by American industry. I want to commend the \nchairman of the Finance Committee for his excellent leadership on this \nmeasure because I wholeheartedly believe that this program is critical \nto the future of our economy. We are the world leader in research and \ndevelopment, and I believe that technology is the engine for economic \ngrowth. This measure helps keep our competitive advantage on the world \nR market. The bill before us today extends the R tax credit for 20 \nmonths, retroactive to July 1, 1995. Ideally, we wanted to extend the \ncredit permanently and thus remove the uncertainty that has \ncharacterized the credit in recent years. Unfortunately, due to limited \nresources, we have had to go with a temporary extension instead. \nHowever, this is still a significant step forward, and I am glad to be \na part of this effort.\n  I want to express my concern for the companies engaged in significant \nresearch and development activity in the United States that are unable \nto qualify for the current credit. Several of my colleagues share this \nconcern, and I would now like to engage Senator Baucus from Montana and \nSenator Lieberman from Connecticut on this \n\n[[Page S 16063]]\npoint. We support extending the R tax credit for another 20 months. \nWe also support providing those companies that currently do not qualify \nfor the R credit, and that are engaged in significant R activity, \nwith an elective alternative incremental research credit [AIRC], as \nprovided in the House tax bill. I look forward to my colleagues' \nremarks on this point.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, research and development keeps us \ncompetitive with our foreign trading partners. It supports high wage \nand high skilled jobs in the United States and enables us to compete in \ndeveloping products that increase our quality of life. We must support \nour American industry here at home or face losing our edge in research \nand development to our foreign trading partners. Other countries offer \nmuch more generous R tax incentives: for example, Canada has a 20-\npercent credit for all R expenditures; Japan and our European \ncompetitors all offer significant tax incentives to encourage research \nand development activity.\n  A strong R tax credit not only maintains research and development \nactivity here in the United States but it also contributes to the \ndevelopment of high-skilled jobs. It is my understanding that a \nsubstantial portion of the R credit is comprised of wages and \nsalaries paid to our research employees. We need to continue this \ntrend. In this age of global markets we need a research and development \nstrategy that is competitive and strong. R grows our economy, it \nraises our living standards and develops a high skilled work force.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I echo my colleagues' sentiments and \nadd that while our current R program supports many fine research and \ndevelopment activities, a number of significant R investors are \nineligible to use this credit under our current law. The alternative \nincremental credit approved by the House enables those companies to \ntake advantage of this resource, and while I am disappointed that the \nalternative credit is not part of the package before us today, I hope \nthat the conferees will look kindly on this proposal.\n  I am concerned that many U.S. companies engaged in high-technology \nresearch are unable to stay competitive in the global market due to \ndeclining Federal research dollars. By extending the tax credit for 20 \nmonths and offering the AIRC program, we can provide our industries \nwith some certainty in helping them plan their research and development \nstrategy.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. president, I hope that our colleague, the chairman of \nthe Senate Finance Committee, shares many of the concerns that we have \nexpressed. I would respectfully ask that he take a careful look at the \nalternative incremental credit in the House package when the bill goes \nto conference.\n\n\n                        Bipartisan Capital Gains\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wanted to express my concerns about \none provision that the Finance Committee was unable to include in its \nfinal tax package. It is a provision that was contained in the \nbipartisan capital gains legislation that Senator Hatch and I \nintroduced, S. 959. The provision would change current law in ways that \nwould be extremely helpful to families in my region of the country.\n  Under current law, when an individual or family sells its principal \nresidence for a gain, and for whatever reason, does not reinvest all of \nthe proceeds in another home, any gain from that transaction is \ngenerally treated as a capital gain, and is taxed at more favorable \ncapital gains rates. Special rules apply to individuals over age 55. \nThey are permitted to completely exclude from tax up to $125,000 of \ntheir gains from sales of their residences. By contrast, if an \nindividual or family sells a personal residence at a loss, that loss is \ntreated as a personal loss, and no part of the loss may be recovered. \nNo capital loss rules for losses on residences are provided under \ncurrent law. No way presently exists for a family to be made whole from \na genuine economic loss.\n  S. 959, a bipartisan bill that has 45 cosponsors, included a \nprovision to provide some relief to individuals who have experienced \nthese true losses. S. 959 would permit capital loss treatment for loss \non the sale of a principal residence. This proposal is fair, because it \nprovides that both losses and gains on sale will be treated as capital, \nnot ordinary.\n  Until the 1980's, the possibility of suffering a loss on the sale of \na principal residence was all but unthinkable. Then, starting with the \noil price shocks of the early 1980's, we have experienced a series of \nregional economic slowdowns and recessions that have caused the prices \nof housing to fall. These occurred first in the Southwest, and more \nrecently in California and New England.\n  Several things--all bad--can happen when the value of a residence \nfalls. In southern California and in New England in the early 1990's, \nhomeowners began to experience what came to be known as the upside-down \nmortgage. Homeowners found that the value of their homes had fallen so \nmuch that the home was worth less than the outstanding debt of the \nmortgage. Thus, if the homeowners were forced to sell, they would come \nout of the deal actually owing their lender more money than they had \nfrom the sale. Then, if the banker forgave some portion of the debt, \nthe homeowners actually owned income tax on the transaction. In 1992, \nit was estimated that 41 percent of the sales in California were in \nthis upside down position. The problem of upside down mortgages in \nresolving itself in California, but it is a disaster for people caught \nin that bind. In New England, the downward trend in home values \ncontinues; thus, the problem of upside down mortgages persists.\n\n  In my home State of Connecticut, many areas have experienced steep \nprice declines since 1989. For example, the median sales price for an \nexisting home in Hartford was $165,900 in 1989. The median home price \nhas since declined to $133,400. The purchaser of a median priced home \nin Hartford, in 1989, has lost, on average $32,500 or over 24 percent \nof their home value over a 5-year period. This represent a loss of \nroughly $6,500 per year.\n  Similarly, the median purchase price for an existing home in the New \nHaven-Meriden Metropolitan Area was $163,400 in 1989. The median home \nprice in New Haven-Meriden metro areas has since declined to $139,600. \nThe purchaser of a median priced home in New Haven-Meriden, in 1989 \nwould have lost $23,800 or slightly more than 17 percent of their home \nvalue by 1994. This represents an average annual decline in home equity \nof $4,760.\n  If people sell their homes at a loss, they have suffered a true \neconomic loss. Moreover, it is a loss that may represent the loss of \ntheir biggest source of savings. People who experience a loss on the \nsale of their home are often wiped out financially. The provision that \nSenator Hatch and I included in S. 959 permits capital loss treatment \nfor these painful situations. Because of the mechanical operation of \nthe capital loss rules, it may take many years for a family to recoup \nthe true losses they have experienced. Still, the relief in S. 959 is \nonly partial relief for some individuals. Because of the serious impact \non families of these losses, it is only fair that we provide at least \nthe capital loss relief as a form of rough justice so that these \nfamilies can have some relief from the true losses they have incurred.\n  This important provision is contained in the House bill. It is my \nhope that the chairman and the conferees will be able to accept this \nprovision during the conference. It would provide critical relief to \nfamilies that have sustained genuine losses, and is in the best \ninterests of fairness and family.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand the concerns of my friend and \ncolleague from Connecticut and am sympathetic to his position. This \nprovision is an important one and is the right thing to do. A home is \noften the biggest and most significant investment that most families \never make. It is only fair that an economic loss on that investment be \ntreated the same as economic losses on other investments. This is \nespecially so since we tax the gain from a sale of that home. Like \nSenator Lieberman, I urge the chairman and the conferees to adopt this \nprovision when it is considered in conference.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 297\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there are a number of good things in this \namendment, which was offered by my colleague from Arizona, John McCain. \nIf \n\n[[Page S 16064]]\nthe amendment were crafted differently and was more limited in scope, I \nwould support it.\n  For example, I have consistently supported efforts to eliminate \nfunding for the Market Promotion Program [MPP], a program that provides \nsubsidies to companies that advertise American agricultural products \nabroad. Such promotional activities are a reasonable and fundamental \ncost of doing business for any industry.\n  If the return on every dollar spent on export promotion is as good as \nMPP proponents suggest in terms of jobs and exports, then it would seem \nto be in the industry's own best interest to bear that cost itself.\n  I understand that the industry's resources are finite. One more \ndollar could always be spent on promotional activities, particularly if \neach dollar produces significant gains in sales. But at some point, the \nagricultural industry, like any other industry, decides that it cannot \nexpend any more; that the marginal gains do not justify the additional \ncost. Once the industry defines that point of diminishing returns, it \nis not appropriate to ask taxpayers to subsidize additional promotional \nefforts that the industry itself is unwilling to finance.\n  The amendment also eliminates funding for 266 highway demonstration \nprojects. I strongly support that. Earmarking scarce dollars for \npolitically well-connected projects is one of the most unfair, least \nefficient, ways of allocating scarce transportation dollars.\n  The earmarkings in the House version of last year's National Highway \nSystem bill totaled more than $2 billion--funds that would otherwise \nhave been allocated according to the more equitable distribution \nformula established by ISTEA. I am talking about the House version \nbecause I served in the House of Representatives when that bill arose, \nand I was 1 of only 12 who voted against it at the time.\n  The regular formula for distributing highway dollars is based on such \nobjective factors as population, miles of roads, and vehicle miles \ntraveled. Earmarking, however, is based largely on politics. For \nexample, last year's House bill, just 10 States got 55 percent of the \ntotal funds available. Not coincidentally, those States were \nrepresented by 36 of the 64 Public Works Committee members. California, \nhome State of the chairman of the House Public Works and Transportation \nCommittee which produced the bill, took 15 percent of the total, about \n$290 million, for 51 projects. Arizona, by contrast, got just three \nprojects, for a total of $15 million.\n  Had the earmarkings been eliminated and the funding been distributed \naccording to the ISTEA formula instead, Arizona would have gotten \nbetween $800,000 and $7.6 million more than it did under the bill. The \nthree Arizona projects would most certainly be funded under this \nalternative approach--they all have merit, and are all of high \npriority--but the State would have had more to devote to other worthy \nprojects as well. Twenty-seven other States would also have done better \nunder the formula than they did under earmarking.\n  The Senate refrained from such earmarking last year, and I am pleased \nthat both the House and Senate have refrained this year. I support the \nprovisions of the McCain amendment that would terminate 266 unstarted \nhighway demonstration projects that were authorized or appropriated in \nprior years.\n  The amendment also eliminates funding for the U.S. Travel and Tourism \nAdministration [USTTA]. Like the Market Promotion Program that offers \nsubsidies to the agricultural industry, the USTTA offers subsidies to \nthe travel industry for promotional activities that I believe the \nindustry ought to bear on its own.\n  There are other programs, however, that, in my opinion, should not be \na part of this package. They are not pork. They are not corporate \nsubsidies.\n  I am talking primarily about the B-2 bomber. This is a program that \nis in the national interest. This is not an Arizona project, so I am \nnot here to defend it because my State has a major economic interest in \nits production. I do not differ with my colleague from Arizona very \noften, but on this issue, I must.\n  Mr. President, the Nation's long-range bomber force consists \nprimarily of two aircraft: the B-52 and the B-1. The 95 B-52's are all \nover 30 years old, and their ability to penetrate modern air defenses \nis doubtful. The 96 B-1's were procured as an interim bomber until B-\n2's were available.\n  For 40 years, the United States relied on forward presence, or the \ndeployment of large forces in bases around the world engaged in almost \nconstant maneuvers or exercises. With the decline in defense spending \nand the withdrawal of U.S. forces for overseas bases, the United States \nwill rely increasingly on smaller military forces, operating \nprincipally from North America. In the past 6 years alone, the U.S. Air \nForce has reduced its major overseas bases from 38 to 15--a reduction \nof 61 percent.\n  Rather than forward presence, current strategy calls for American \npower to be projected abroad in response to aggression in regional \nconflicts. The combination of a bomber with stealthy low observable, \nlong-range, and precision strike capabilities provides the Nation with \na competency never before achieved. With its range and large payload, \nB-2's can penetrate enemy air defenses and disrupt enemy advances in \nthe critical early hours of conflict, before other forces arrive. Later \nin the conflict, B-2's can strike deep to interdict enemy follow-on \nforces or high-value strategic targets without fight escort.\n  I have two letters that I ask unanimous consent be printed in the \nRecord--one from seven former Secretaries of Defense, and the other \nfrom the former air commander of the Desert Shield/Desert Storm Air \nForces--that further expand on the vital importance of the B-2 bomber \nto the future Armed Forces of the United States.\n  For these reasons, I believe that the B-2 remains an integral \ncomponent of our future national security, and I must, therefore, \noppose the amendment.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing you to express our \n     concern about the impending termination of the B-2 bomber \n     production line. After spending over $20 billion to develop \n     this revolutionary aircraft, current plans call for closing \n     out the program with a purchase of only twenty bombers. We \n     believe this plan does not adequately consider the challenges \n     to U.S. security that may arise in the next century, and the \n     central role that the B-2 may play in meeting those \n     challenges.\n       At present the nation's long-range bomber force consists \n     primarily of two aircraft the B-52 and the B-1. The 95 B-52's \n     are all over thirty years old, and their ability to penetrate \n     modern air defenses is very doubtful. The 96 B-1's were \n     procured as an interim bomber until B-2's were available.\n       Even after all twenty B-2's are delivered, the inventory of \n     long-range bombers will total barely 200 aircraft. This is \n     not enough to meet future requirements, particularly in view \n     of the attrition that would occur in a conflict and the \n     eventual need to retire the B-52's. As the number of forward-\n     deployed aircraft carriers declines and the U.S. gradually \n     withdraws from its overseas bases, it will become \n     increasingly difficult to use tactical aircraft in bombing \n     missions. It therefore is essential that steps be taken now \n     to preserve an adequate long-range bomber force.\n       The B-2 was originally conceived to be the nation's next \n     generation bomber, and it remains the most-effective means of \n     rapidly projecting force over great distances. Its range will \n     enable it to reach any point on earth within hours after \n     launch while being deployed at only three secure bases around \n     the world. Its payload and array of munitions will permit it \n     to destroy numerous time-sensitive targets in a single \n     sortie. And perhaps most importantly, its low-observable \n     characteristics will allow it to reach intended targets \n     without fear of interception.\n       The logic of continuing low-rate production of the B-2 thus \n     is both fiscal and operational. It is already apparent that \n     the end of the Cold War was neither the end of history nor \n     the end of danger. We hope it also will not be the end of the \n     B-2. We urge you to consider the purchase of more such \n     aircraft while the option still exists.\n     Melvin Laird.\n     Donald Rumsfeld.\n     Caspar Weinberger.\n     Dick Cheney.\n     James Schlesinger.\n     Harold Brown.\n     Frank Carlucci.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    June 22, 1995.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Earlier this month I wrote to your \n     colleagues in the House of Representatives about the need to \n     continue \n\n[[Page S 16065]]\n     the B-2 program. The debate has now shifted to the Senate and my \n     concern with our future security compels me to share the same \n     thoughts with you. This is a difficult letter for me to write \n     as in more than thirty years of service in the Air Force, I \n     have always concentrated on military operations, and \n     refrained from commenting on issues such as whether or not to \n     purchase a specific aircraft. However, the Pentagon recently \n     released a study based on assumptions, constraints, and \n     methodology that can lead to the conclusion that the United \n     States can safely terminate B-2 stealth bomber production at \n     20 aircraft. As the former Air Commander of the Desert \n     Shield/Desert Storm Air Forces, I feel a duty to put the B-2 \n     debate in perspective, and sound a warning on any \n     recommendation to stop production of this aircraft. To put it \n     bluntly, halting this nation's B-2 production capability is \n     dangerously short-sighted and would lead ultimately to the \n     extinction of the long-range bomber force, at the very time \n     when bombers are emerging as America's most critical 21st \n     Century military asset.\n       Since B-2 is the only bomber in production or development, \n     and the Pentagon has no plans for a new bomber program in the \n     future, the B-2 program and America's bomber production \n     capability are one and the same. If this sole remaining \n     bomber capability is lost, replacing our aging bombers will \n     become unaffordable. Inevitably, the nation may lose its \n     manned bomber force, and the unique capabilities it provides. \n     A new bomber would take from 15-20 years to go from the \n     drawing board to the battlefield and cost tens of billions of \n     dollars just to design. With the current administration \n     balking at spending a fraction of this amount on a finished, \n     proven product, there is little likelihood of a future \n     government sinking many times that amount into a new program. \n     Even if a new program was initiated in the near term, most of \n     our existing bombers would be obsolete before the first ``B-\n     3'' entered service. The next Desert Storm Air Commander \n     could be sending Americans into war aboard a 70-year-old \n     bomber, an act I find unconscionable.\n       In my opinion, the B-2 is now more important than ever. \n     Heavy bombers have always possessed two capabilities--long \n     range and large payload--not found in other elements of our \n     military forces. As we base more and more of our forces in \n     our homeland, the bomber's intercontinental range enables us \n     to respond immediately to regional aggression with a rapid, \n     conclusive military capability. Just as important, this \n     capability may deter aggressors even as the bombers sit on \n     the air base parking ramps in the United States. In war, the \n     large bomber payloads provide a critical punch throughout the \n     conflict--just ask General Schwarzkopf what he wanted from \n     the Air Force when he was under attack in Vietnam, or \n     whenever our ground forces faced danger during Desert Storm.\n       When the B-2 adds to this equation are two revolutionary \n     capabilities not available in any other long-range bomber--\n     precision and stealth. The Gulf War showed how precision \n     weapons delivery from stealthy platforms provides a \n     devastating military capability. The F-117 stealth fighter \n     proved its effectiveness on the first day of the war when 36 \n     aircraft flew just 2.5 percent of the sorties, but attacked \n     almost 31 percent of the targets.\n       In the past, employing bombers for critical missions \n     against modern air defenses required large, costly packages \n     of air escort and defense suppression aircraft. The B-2's \n     unmatched survivability reduces the need for escorts and \n     defense suppression aircraft. As we found in the Gulf War \n     with the F-117, stealth allows the U.S. to strike any target \n     with both surprise and near impunity. Analysis of the Gulf \n     War air campaign reveals that each F-117 sortie was worth \n     approximately eight non-stealth sorties. To put B-2 \n     capabilities into perspective, consider that the B-2 carries \n     eight times the precision payload of the F-117, has up to six \n     times the range, and will be able to accurately deliver its \n     weapons through clouds or smoke. What does all of this mean? \n     It means that a single B-2 can accomplish missions that \n     required dozens of non-stealthy aircraft in the past.\n       Many may wonder why the Department of Defense would \n     advocate terminating the most advanced weapon system ever \n     developed. The B-2 program was cut by the Bush Administration \n     for budget-related political reasons, and some concern that \n     the program would not meet expectations. Since then, \n     delivered aircraft have demonstrated, without qualification, \n     that the B-2 is a superb weapon system--performing even \n     better than expected.\n       Yet, defense spending has declined, bomber expertise has \n     been funneled out of the Air Force, and people's careers have \n     been vested in other programs. Unfortunately, some in the \n     Army and Navy believe the B-2's revolutionary capability is a \n     threat to their own services' continuing relevancy. Just the \n     opposite is true, long-range, survivable bombers will \n     contribute to the effectiveness of the shorter range carrier \n     air by striking those targets which pose the greatest threat \n     to our ships. The troops on the ground have long recognized \n     the value of air support, especially the tremendous impact \n     that large bomb loads have on enemy soldiers. This was again \n     demonstrated by the B-52 strikes used to demoralize the Iraqi \n     Army. If anyone needs B-2s, it's our soldiers and sailors. \n     Some people harp on the issue of the B-2's cost. The Air \n     Force, at times, seems at odds about asking for this much \n     needed aircraft because they fear it could endanger their \n     number one priority program, the F-22. All miss the point. \n     True the B-2 has a high initial cost, but its capabilities \n     allow it to accomplish mission objectives at a lower total \n     cost than other alternatives. And keep in mind, the true cost \n     of any weapons system is how many or how few lives of our \n     service personnel are lost. The B-2 lowers the risk to our \n     men and women. The B-2 will allow us to accept lower levels \n     of overall military spending without compromising our \n     security.\n       As we approach this year's critical defense budget \n     decisions, it is important that we understand the long-term \n     national and international security ramifications of the \n     quantum leap in military capabilities offered by the B-2. If \n     we don't, it may disappear when we need it most, and can buy \n     it most cheaply. Make no mistake about this: the B-2 is \n     designed to extend America's defense capabilities into the \n     next Century. Can we afford to do less?\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Charles A. Horner,\n                                             General, USAF (Ret.).\n\n\n                     LOW-INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to express to my colleagues \nmy deep concern regarding the House Ways and Means Committee's proposal \nto sunset the low-income housing tax credit in 1997, pending a GAO \nreview of the management of the program.\n  The low-income housing tax credit is the Federal Government's \nprincipal rental housing production program that results in significant \nprivate capital for the development of affordable rental housing. Since \nits inception, as part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, the low-income \nhousing tax credit has enjoyed broad bi-partisan support in both the \nHouse and the Senate. In fact, that support became very clear when 75 \npercent of the House and nearly 90 percent of the Senate went on record \nas recently as 1992 in support of legislation to make the credit \npermanent. It was made permanent in 1993.\n  Since 1986 the credit has mobilized private capital for public \nbenefit, attracting more than $12 billion in private investment. Nearly \n800,000 units of rental housing for lower income working families and \nthe elderly have been constructed or rehabilitated with the low-income \nhousing tax credit. This has lead to the creation of 90,000 jobs each \nyear and resulted in $2.8 billion in wages and $1.3 billion in \nadditional tax revenues.\n  According to the New York State Housing Finance Agency, in 1994, in \nour home State, over 6,100 units of rental housing were made possible \nbecause of the credit. Over 77 percent of those units, 4,700, were for \nlow-income families, and the production of those units directly \nresulted in an estimated $520 million of housing investment in the \nState of New York.\n  That being said, does the Senator from New York find it as puzzling \nas I do that the Way and Means Committee would propose to terminate the \nlow-income housing tax credit without benefit of hearings; without any \nauthoritative evidence that the program is not working in an effective \nmanner, and, especially before any review or study?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I agree with the comments of my friend \nand colleague, Senator D'Amato, and I share his concern of the proposed \nsunset of the low-income housing tax credit.\n  The credit is a principal incentive which Congress makes available to \nindividuals and corporations to invest in apartment construction and \nrehabilitation devoted to low-income renters. In fact, when the credit \nbecame permanent in 1993, it attracted many new, high quality \ndevelopers to the construction of lower income rental housing. Today, \nthe credit accounts for one out of every four apartments constructed \nnationwide and virtually all of the production of affordable rental \nhousing.\n  More importantly, State agencies, acting under Federal guidelines, \nmanage the low-income housing tax credit program with a minimum of red \ntape. Under current law, the credit is limited to $1.25 per capita per \nState and is administered by the States on behalf of the Federal \nGovernment. Investors provide equity to projects in exchange for the \ncredits to facilitate the development of affordable units. For 1995, \nbased upon our Nation's current population, the States will allocate \n$325 million in credits, resulting in about $1.85 billion of private \nequity being invested in affordable housing. I could not agree more \nthat to sunset one of the best examples of public-private \n\n[[Page S 16066]]\npartnership and Federal-State partnership would be a grave error.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to express to Chairman Roth \nand Senator Moynihan my hope that when we go into Conference on this \nmatter, that the Senate will be firm in its resolve not to recede to \nthe House on any proposal that would sunset the low-income housing tax \ncredit.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I certainly understand and sympathize with \nthe concerns raised by Senators D'Amato and Moynihan. I have received a \nnumber of letters from Members on both sides of the aisle that reflect \nthe concerns you have voiced today. In addition, I have received many \nletters from Governors noting their strong opposition to terminating \nthe low-income housing tax credit.\n\n\n                                  anwr\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I strongly support the provisions of \nthis legislation opening the coastal plain of the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge in Alaska for oil and gas leasing, exploration and \ndevelopment.\n  Mr. President, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge [ANWR] is seen by \nmany as a place of great beauty. It is a place of vastness, a place \nwhere the land stretches farther than the eye can see. It provides \nimportant habitat for muskoxen, brown bears, polar bears, wolverines \nand a multitude of migrating and other birds. It is a place where, in \nthe summer months, the porcupine caribou herd roams, and rainbows arch \nover the Beaufort Sea.\n  But a different kind of national treasure is thought to underlie the \nsurface of a small portion of ANWR. That national treasure is oil--huge \nquantities of oil. Simply put, the coastal plain of ANWR represents the \nmost highly prospective onshore oil and gas region remaining in the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, if developing the large quantities of oil thought to \nunderlie the coastal plain would, as some suggest, destroy the 19 \nmillion-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, then the question of \nproceeding would be much more difficult. But that is not the issue. The \ncoastal plain can and should be developed in an environmentally sound \nand sensitive way that does not despoil the wildlife and other \nenvironmental values of ANWR.\n  Mr. President, the case for authorizing oil and gas leasing in ANWR \nis as compelling as it is straightforward.\n  First, oil and gas activity would be limited to only a small portion \nof the refuge--the 1.5 million-acre coastal plain--also known as the \n``1002 area--'' an area some 30 miles wide by 100 miles long. \nAbsolutely no oil and gas activity would take place on the remaining \n17.5 million acres that comprise the refuge. In fact, approximately \neight million acres of ANWR, have already been designated as \nwilderness, including 450,000 acres of the coastal plain region between \nthe Aichilik River and the Canadian border.\n  In addition, the technology and the environmental sensitivity of oil \nfield development in the Arctic have evolved steadily in the 25 years \nsince the oil and gas facilities at Prudhoe Bay, which are located \ndirectly west of ANWR, were designed and constructed. Given these \nadvances, and with the environmental safeguards that are currently \napplicable to all oil and gas activities in the Arctic, development can \ntake place on the coastal plain in an environmentally sound manner \nwithout lasting effects.\n  It is a serious misconception that oil and gas development would \ndestroy the habitat functions of the coastal plain. In reality, full \nleasing, development and production from three oil fields, for example, \nwould affect less than 1 percent of the area's land surface by both \ndirect habitat alteration and by indirect effects such as road dust or \nlocal impoundments of water along a road. Ninety-nine percent of the \narea would remain untouched; and the area's habitat will not be altered \nsufficiently to affect the size, growth rate, or regional distribution \nof fish and wildlife populations. The area will continue to be used by \ncaribou for calving and will continue to provide habitat for polar \nbears, brown bears, wolves, muskoxen, and millions of birds.\n  The only significant change on the coastal plain would be aesthetic. \nIf oil is discovered, widely spaced roads, pipelines, drilling \nstructures, and support facilities would be visible on the coastal \nplain. Of course, even these facilities would be removed and graveled \nareas rehabilitated when production ceased. During the years of \nexploration and production, the coastal plain region will still support \nwildlife, provide recreational opportunities, and be home to the \nInupiat Eskimo.\n  Mr. President, the vegetation and wildlife inhabiting the coastal \nplain are well adapted to the extreme Arctic environment. Biological \nevidence does not support the popular notion that wildlife and plants \nin the region are fragile things, living on the edge of survival. After \na decade of study, there is no evidence that oil development at Prudhoe \nBay had an adverse effect on significant numbers of wildlife. The \ncentral arctic caribou herd uses Prudhoe Bay and the surrounding area \nfor calving. This herd has grown from 3,000 to 18,000 animals since oil \ndevelopment activities began at Prudhoe Bay in the early 1970's. The \ncaribou live alongside the structures related to oil and gas activity, \nsuch as roads, pipelines, and drilling pads, with no ill effects.\n  While it is true that the porcupine caribou herd uses a portion of \nthe coastal plain for 6 to 8 weeks each year, it is not true that this \narea contains core calving areas critical to the survival of the \n150,000 animals which currently comprise the herd. In the first place, \nthe herd calves throughout a huge expanse of territory in Canada and \nAlaska, including portions of ANWR. In some years, probably as a result \nof snow conditions or the presence of predators, only a very few \ncaribou calve in the coastal plain at all. In other years, there is a \nhigher concentration of calving in certain areas of the coastal plain. \nThe widespread and annually variable distribution of calving strongly \nsuggests that no one small portion of this huge calving area is \ncritical to maintaining the viability of the porcupine caribou herd.\n  Finally, the human activity resulting from oil production would not \nbe new to the coastal plain. Although human presence in the coastal \nplain region has been relatively light, there has been, and continues \nto be, evidence of man in the area. There have been three DEW. line \nstations--one of which is still active--there is a Native village, \nKaktovik, which has been relocated in the area three times in recent \nhistory, and there have been, and continue to be considerable \nsubsistence activities in the area.\n  Mr. President, let me now turn to the crucial importance to our \nNation of the oil thought to underlie the coastal plain. For the \nforeseeable future, oil will remain a critical fuel for the United \nStates and other industrialized nations. Currently, the United States \nconsumes approximately 17 million barrels of oil per day. The \nDepartment of Energy projects that under current policies, this may \nwell increase to almost 23 million barrels per day by the year 2010. At \nthe same time, domestic production will decline, resulting in a \nsignificant increase in foreign oil imports. DOE projects that domestic \nproduction of crude oil will fall from today's level of 6.8 million \nbarrels per day to 5.4 million barrels per day in 2010, a decrease of \n21 percent.\n  Imports of foreign oil are projected to increase substantially by the \nyear 2010, making our Nation dependent on foreign oil for more than 60 \npercent of our oil needs. This level of import dependence is extremely \ndangerous for our country.\n  More significantly, as the Persian Gulf war tragically demonstrated, \noil is an important strategic resource, and the struggle to control \nthat region's vast oil reserves can disrupt the delicate balance of \npeace in the Middle East.\n  United States oil imports are so massive, and the use of oil is so \ningrained in our economy, that a substantial demand for oil will exist \nfor the foreseeable future--certainly well into the early decades of \nthe 21st century. This conclusion remains firm in the face of even the \nmost optimistic assumptions about increases in energy efficiency and \nthe substitution of alternative fuels. These policies alone will not \nsuffice. Unless domestic oil production is encouraged and pursued, oil \nimports will continue to rise, and rise significantly.\n  By any measure, the coastal plain of ANWR represents the primary \nprospect \n\n[[Page S 16067]]\nfor domestic onshore oil and gas exploration in the United States. The \nopponents of opening the coastal plain argue that the amount of oil at \nstake is not significant, that it is only a 200-day supply. However, a \nsingle field large enough to supply this country with all of the oil it \nconsumes for 200 days represents a huge reservoir of oil. Eighty \npercent of all onshore oil fields discovered in the lower 48 States \nover the last 100 years have contained less than 1 day's supply.\n  According to the BLM, the mean estimate of oil thought to be \neconomically recoverable from the coastal plain of the ANWR is 3.2 \nbillion barrels. The range of estimated economically recoverable \nreserves runs from 400 million barrels to over 9 billion barrels. The \nprobability of discovering economically recoverable oil has been \nestimated by that agency at 46 percent. The oil industry routinely \nconsiders probabilities of discovery in the range of 10 percent worth \nthe payment of substantial bonuses for the right to explore for oil.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the USGS has recently completed its \n1995 assessment of onshore oil and gas resources for the United States. \nIn general, the assessment shows an increase in the amount of natural \ngas thought to be present in northern Alaska and a decrease in the \namount of oil thought to be present in that area. The USGS has prepared \na preliminary analysis of the oil potential of the coastal plain and \nhas concluded in a draft memorandum that the mean estimate for oil in \nthe 1002 area is slightly less than a billion barrels, with a 1 in 20 \nchance that some 4 billion barrels are present. The agency is currently \nin the process of gathering more information from the 1002 area to \nrefine its very preliminary estimate. The BLM, it should be noted, \ncontinues to have confidence in its earlier mean estimate of 3.2 \nbillion barrels for the 1002 area.\n  Since 1980, when we began to debate the issue of opening the coastal \nplain of ANWR, there have been numerous studies and estimates of the \namount of oil likely to be found if the area is opened to leasing. \nThese estimates have been made by the BLM, USGS, the Energy Information \nAdministration, the GAO, the State of Alaska, the American Association \nof Petroleum Geologists, and others. These estimates vary considerably \ndue to different methodologies employed, different interpretations of \ngeologic data, and differing geologic engineering and economic \nassumptions that are made relative to the methodology.\n  As a result, it is very difficult to directly compare these \nestimates. However, two important conclusions can be drawn from these \nestimates.\n  First, they all reflect a wide range of uncertainty, which is \nexpected for an area that has not been drilled. Until we have reliable \nwell data from the 1002 area, we simply have no way of knowing how \ngreat the potential of the area is. Second, all these estimates show a \nvery large potential for oil and gas, with even the lowest estimates \nthat have been made having an upside potential of at least 4 billion \nbarrels.\n  In addition to the benefits to the country provided by the oil \nitself, the Federal Treasury will also benefit. Under the ANWR \nprovisions contained in the bill currently before the Senate, the CBO \nestimates that two lease sales in the coastal plain will occur between \nnow and the year 2000 which will result in bonus bids totalling $2.6 \nbillion. The legislation requires a 50-50 revenue split with the State \nof Alaska--the same as other western States--which will mean that the \nFederal Treasury will receive $1.3 billion in new revenue during the \nnext 7 years if the coastal plain is leased. Should oil be discovered \nand produced from ANWR in significant amounts, a steady stream of \nroyalty income will also accrue to the Federal Treasury for many years \nto come.\n  In addition to the direct budget plus for the Treasury, this measure \nprovides that the Federal share--50%--of bonus bid revenues in excess \nof $2.6 billion will be made directly available for maintenance, repair \nand rehabilitation projects at our Nation's national parks and refuges. \nThis provision will provide a significant funding source for our parks \nthat so desperately need more money.\n  Mr. President, oil and gas development on the coastal plain is a step \nthat must not be postponed any longer. Most experts agree that it will \ntake up to 10 or 15 years before commercial production could begin if \nthe area is leased this year. Sometime between 2008 and 2014, the DOE \nestimates that production from Prudhoe Bay and adjacent fields, which \ncurrently account for nearly 25 percent of our domestic oil production, \nis projected to decline to approximately 300,000 barrels per day, the \nminimum level needed to operate the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System \n[TAPS]. If we continue to delay exploring for oil on the coastal plain \nand developing what we find there, the TAPS could be forced to shut \ndown, and we will have lost our ability to transport billions of \nbarrels of Alaskan oil to waiting consumers.\n  When Congress enacted the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation \nAct in 1980, we declined to designate this portion of ANWR as \nwilderness and specifically reserved for ourselves the decision on \nwhether that area should be made available for oil and gas leasing. We \ndirected the Secretary of the Interior to study the area and to make \nrecommendations on whether to allow oil and gas development. In 1987, \nthe Secretary recommended that oil and gas development be allowed to \ntake place. Since that report was issued, the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee alone has conducted 11 hearings and built a solid \nand thorough record on this issue. Our committee has voted on three \nseparate occasions, on a bipartisan basis, to proceed with oil and gas \nleasing.\n  It is now time for the Senate to exercise its responsibility and make \na decision with respect to oil and gas development on the coastal \nplain. Our Nation can have the benefit of the oil from ANWR, the \nrevenues leasing will generate, and still preserve the beauty and the \nvastness of the Refuge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/27/senate-section/article/S16014-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16067-S16084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n  THE BUDGET RECONCILIATION BILL--A Missed Opportunity to Make Smart \n                                Choices\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, during the past few days, we have had \nextensive debate on the Senate floor about what this budget \nreconciliation package will mean for the Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms. Now, as we reach the conclusion of this debate, I want to \nexplain some of the reasons why I must oppose it.\n  I want to say right off that I am deeply committed to ensuring that \nthe Medicare and Medicaid programs will be here for the millions of \nolder Americans, children, and individuals with disabilities who have \ncome to rely on the services they provide. Thanks to Medicare, 99 \npercent of senior citizens, who have paid into the program during their \nworking years, now have affordable, guaranteed health care coverage. \nLikewise, Medicaid provides a much-needed safety net for 36 million \nlow-income elderly nursing home patients, the disabled, and pregnant \nwomen and children.\n\n\n                       What is this Debate About\n\n  The debate on Medicare and Medicaid has centered not so much around \nwhether projected spending for these programs should be reduced, \nbecause Members of both parties agree that this should be done. Instead \nthe focus has been on how much spending should be cut. I believe we \nshould limit the rate of growth of both of these programs to a more \nsustainable level so that they will continue to be here for the \nbeneficiaries who depend on them.\n  However, I am convinced that the bill before us--which will cut \nprojected Medicare spending by $270 billion and Medicaid spending by \n$182 billion--goes far beyond what should be done to achieve this goal, \nand instead will jeopardize the very programs the reductions are \nintended to protect. This drastic level of cuts would require that \nMedicare spending per beneficiary be held to a growth rate of 4.9 \npercent, while private health insurance will continue to grow at a rate \nof 7.6 percent per person. It is just not reasonable to expect Medicare \nto grow by such a small amount, especially when you consider that \n200,000 Americans become eligible for the program each month. Just \nwithin the 7 years covered by this budget reconciliation bill, Medicare \nwill insure 3.7 million more people than it does today.\n  We have been told repeatedly by the majority that these $450 billion \nin cuts are necessary, particularly to save the Medicare program from \ninsolvency. \n\n[[Page S 16068]]\nBut according to Medicare actuaries, only $89 billion is needed to \nextend the Medicare trust fund for 10 years.\n  So why does this bill cut Medicare by $181 billion more than the \nexperts say is necessary--and cut Medicaid by $182 billion? Because \nthis budget reconciliation bill also contains $245 billion in new tax \nbreaks, which will largely benefit the wealthiest in our country.\n  It is wrong to be making an unprecedented level of cuts to Medicare, \nMedicaid, and other critical programs while granting tax relief to \npeople making over $100,000 per year and to large corporations taking \nadvantage of tax loopholes.\n\n\n                   The Impact of This Bill on Seniors\n\n  Under this bill, older Americans will be asked to pay more for their \nhealth care but can expect to get less for their money. The premiums \nthat seniors pay out of their Social Security checks for their \nphysician services will double and could exceed $100 per month in the \nyear 2002. On top of that, their deductible would also increase from \n$100 to $220.\n  I fear that these premium and deductible increases could make \nMedicare coverage out of reach for some seniors. Most older Americans \nhave very modest incomes. Seventy-five percent of seniors on Medicare \nlive on less than $25,000 a year. And in North Dakota, older Americans \nget by on even less: 70 percent of our state's seniors have incomes of \nunder $15,000.\n  Already, seniors spend 21 percent of their income for health care. In \n1994, the average older American spent $2,500 for medical care, \nprescription drugs, and other health care expenses not covered by \nMedicare--and this figure does not even include the cost of long-term \nnursing home care, which averages nearly $40,000 a year.\n  In addition to costing more, the quality of health care older \nAmericans receive could very well decline. That is because the portion \nof the cuts that do not fall directly on beneficiaries will be borne by \ndoctors, hospitals, and other health care providers, who even now are \nreimbursed at only 68 percent of the amount they get from private \npayors. As a result, these cuts could create a second-class health care \nsystem for the elderly.\n  This budget bill, with its $182 billion cut in projected Medicaid \nspending, could force hundreds of thousands of middle-income seniors \nand their families to shoulder the substantial burden of nursing home \ncosts also. It turns the Medicaid program over to the states in the \nform of a block grant and repeals the Federal guarantee for nursing \nhome care for the 60 percent of nursing home patients who qualify for \nMedicaid--many of whom have already used up their life savings in \npaying for their care.\n\n\n         Consequences of Medicaid ``Block Grant'' for the Needy\n\n  Our Nation's seniors are not the only ones who are being asked to pay \nthe bill for tax breaks for wealthy individuals and corporations. \nChildren will also lose under this plan to turn Medicaid over to the \nStates as a block grant. One in five children currently receive their \nhealth care through Medicaid. Their care is not expensive--they \nrepresent 50 percent of all Medicaid beneficiaries but receive only 15 \npercent of the benefits--but it is important. The immunizations and \npreventive care that these kids receive help them to grow up to be \nhealthy, productive adults. I think it is also worthwhile to note that \nfully half of the kids now covered by Medicaid are members of working \nfamilies.\n  Under the block-grant plan, North Dakota will receive 22 percent less \nMedicaid funding over the next 7 years than our State is projected to \nneed. Cutting provider reimbursement rates and enrolling more \nbeneficiaries in managed care simply will not generate enough savings \nto offset the loss in Federal funding, so States will have no choice \nbut to terminate coverage for some current recipients or to reduce the \nbenefits offered.\n\n\n                    Impact on the Health Care System\n\n  I believe cuts of the magnitude called for under this bill will also \ndevastate the health care system, particularly in rural areas. The \nmajority of the savings achieved in Medicare will come through reducing \npayments to hospitals, home health care providers, and other health \ncare professionals.\n  One-quarter of all rural hospitals are already operating at a loss \nand are in danger of being shut down if their payments are reduced \nfurther. Rural hospitals are dependent largely on Medicare and Medicaid \npatients for their livelihood. Between 1983 and 1993, the number of \nrural hospitals dropped by 17 percent, compared to a 2 percent drop in \nurban hospitals. Rural residents already suffer from a lack of access \nto medical care, and additional hospital closings in rural areas will \nfurther exacerbate this problem.\n  Cuts of this magnitude cannot be absorbed within the Medicare system \nalone, so health care providers may have no choice but to shift the \nburden for their uncompensated costs onto their other patients in the \nform of higher fees. I do not think it makes much sense to force higher \ncosts for medical bills and health insurance onto the rest of the \npopulation, thereby pricing health care out of reach for even more \nAmericans.\n\n\n                   A Responsible Medicare Alternative\n\n  I believe it is possible to balance the budget and protect Medicare \nat the same time, and I supported Senator Rockefeller's amendment that \nwould have accomplished this goal. Under Senator Rockefeller's \namendment, Medicare's projected spending would have been reduced by $89 \nbillion, ensuring the solvency of the Medicare trust fund through 2006. \nThis $89 billion is a far more reasonable reduction and could have been \nachieved without new increases in costs for people who simply cannot \nafford to pay more for health care and without damaging our world-class \nhealth care system.\n  Senator Rockefeller's amendment would have been paid for by scaling \nback the tax breaks provided in this bill for wealthy Americans. I \nthought that was the responsible course of action, but unfortunately, a \nmajority of my colleagues did not agree, and the Rockefeller amendment \nwas rejected by a 53-46 vote.\n\n\n                      A Better Choice for Medicaid\n\n  As with Medicare, I agree that we must control Medicaid's rate of \ngrowth, but I cannot support the block grant approach provided for in \nthis bill. As an alternative, I voted for Senator Bob Graham of \nFlorida's amendment to reduce Medicaid's projected spending by a more \nreasonable $62 billion over seven years. This amendment would have \nmaintained the guaranteed safety net that Medicaid provides for more \nthan 36 million needy older Americans, the disabled, and pregnant women \nand children. At the same time, the Graham amendment would have \nrestrained the rate of growth of the Medicaid program by placing a cap \non federal funding based on per person spending, rather than by a flat \nblock grant. But, as with the Rockefeller amendment for Medicare, \nSenator Graham's amendment was defeated by a narrow 51-48 margin.\n  I am very disappointed that a majority of my colleagues have let \nthese opportunities for responsibly controlling Medicare and Medicaid \nspending pass them by, and I simply cannot support the more drastic, \nand unnecessary, cuts to spending still called for in this bill.\n  President Clinton has indicated that he will veto this bill unless \nthese severe cuts are moderated before it reaches his desk. It is my \nsincere hope that, after this bill is vetoed, Congress and the \nPresident will be able to work together to achieve a reasonable \ncompromise that will provide the fiscal discipline the American people \nwant from the Federal Government without sacrificing the health \nsecurity they deserve.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, in my view, every United States \nSenator will be making a statement about their fundamental priorities \nas they cast their vote on this reconciliation package. While each and \nevery vote cast on this floor is key, today's vote on the \nreconciliation bill is a pivotal one about the future of our country, \nand the role that our Federal Government can and should play in the \nlives and well-being of American families.\n  While most of our debates have focused on budget numbers, I have \ntried to talk about the families and the real people who depend on \nMedicare, Medicaid, student loans and all the other major programs \naffected by this legislation in many serious ways. The provisions of \nthis bill will have enormous impact on children, families, and seniors \nin West Virginia and every State \n\n[[Page S 16069]]\nin this Nation. We should be mindful of them as we cast our votes.\n  I want to be clear. I believe we can and should balance the Federal \nbudget and eliminate the Federal deficit. This is a vital goal, but it \nis equally important to ensure that the burdens of achieving a balanced \nbudget are responsibly and fairly shared among all Americans. I \nstrongly feel that we should not balance the budget on the backs of \nseniors, poor children, and working families.\n  The programs that would be drastically cut and changed by this \nreconciliation bill often are the difference between security and \ninsecurity, health and illness, and sometimes life or death for seniors \nand American families who depend on Federal programs for their health \ncare security.\n  I was proud to take the lead in offering the first major amendment to \nthis budget, designed to save Medicare, a historic program that has \nprovided seniors with health care security since 1965, giving them \npeace of mind and a higher quality of life. While some may cast \naspersions on Medicare, I believe it is one of America's proudest \nachievements.\n  Our amendment was not to retain the status quo. We know we must make \nchanges in the system to restore the solvency of the Medicare trust \nfund. But the solvency of the trust fund does not require cutting \nMedicare by $270 billion. Such extreme cuts will threaten health care \nfor 30 million seniors--330,000 of them living in West Virginia--and \nfurther erode our health care system.\n  For seniors, the reconciliation package means that their Medicare \ndeductibles will double and their premiums will skyrocket. When the \naverage income of seniors citizens is $17,750, and they pay 21 percent \nof their income on health care, they are incredulous and petrified to \nhear that their Medicare is being used to pay for tax breaks and tax \ngive-aways to far, far wealthier Americans and every imaginable kind of \ncorporation.\n  I cannot go back to West Virginia and hold town meetings in senior \ncenters as I often do, and justify a vote to slash Medicare by $270 \nbillion in order to finance tax breaks for the wealthy. West Virginians \nbelieve in fairness and common sense, and this attack on Medicare \nflunks that test.\n  Seniors will not be the only ones hurt by the budget's Medicare cuts. \nWest Virginia hospitals are threatened with the possibility of losing \n$25 million in 1996 and more than $681 million over the next 7 years, \nand I fear that some of our hospitals may not survive such cuts.\n  For real people in West Virginia who depend on Medicare for their \nhealth care coverage, the Republican rhetoric about Medicare reform \nrings hollow.\n  And Medicare is not the only health care program slated for harsh \ncuts under this Republican plan. This reconciliation package also seeks \nto cut Medicaid funding by a whopping $187 billion over 7 years.\n  People need to understand what such harsh cuts mean. Medicaid covers \npoor children, pregnant women, the disabled, and low-income seniors who \nneed nursing home care. What happens to these people and their families \nwhen we slash Medicaid funding?\n  Coming from West Virginia, when I think of a family, I think about \nchildren, parents and grandparents. What happens to parents struggling \nto balance raising children and caring for aging parents?\n  If a working family gets a new child tax credit but loses Medicaid \nnursing home coverage for an aging parent, what is the overall effect \non that family? The child tax credit is $500 a year for ``some'' \nfamilies lucky enough to qualify, but the loss of Medicaid nursing home \ncoverage will cost those same families $16,000 to $30,000 a year.\n  For example, Julie Sayres of Charleston, WV cared for her mother who \nsuffers with Alzheimer's Disease as long as she could at home. But as \nher mother's illness got worse, she had to move to a local nursing home \nwhere Julie can visit her daily. Julie may get a partial child tax \ncredit of $500 under this package, but if she cannot get Medicaid \ncoverage for her mother in the nursing home when her mother's meager \nsavings are exhausted, Julie and her family with be much, much worse \noff. That child tax credit will not cover even a month of nursing home \ncare for her mother.\n  This is real story about a family hurt, not helped by drastic health \ncare cuts in this package. In my State of West Virginia, over 21 \npercent of our residents rely on Medicaid so their are countless more \nstories and fears about what will happen to aging parents.\n  And it will not just be individual families hurt by the Medicaid \ncuts. The health care system in my State is fragile, rural hospitals \nare already closing, and West Virginia cannot absorb more than $4 \nbillion in cuts without cutting necessary health care services, \nincluding basic issues like infant mortality. A recent newspaper \narticle made this point, clearly with a headline: ``[Medicaid] Cuts may \naffect infant mortality.'' The article reports that my State, thanks to \nMedicaid-funded programs, has reduced its infant mortality death rate \nfrom 18.4 deaths per 1,000 in 1975 to 6.2 deaths per 1,000 in 1994 \nwhich is even better than the national rate of 8.0 deaths per 1,000 \nbirths. As Governor, I helped start the effort to reduce infant \nmortality, and I must protest any action that turns back the clock.\n  We should not tolerate backwards steps on basic health care \nobjectives like reducing infant mortality.\n  I understand that Medicaid needs reform and Democrats offered an \namendment that suggested reducing the growth in Medicaid spending in a \nresponsible way with a per capita cap. I truly want meaningful reform \nof health care, but I do not believe that creating a Medicaid block \ngrant is serious reform, it is merely passing the buck--or actually \npasses far fewer dollars and far greater problems onto States. This is \nnot fair to states or to the Americans who desperately need health care \nfrom Federal programs.\n  The assault on families in this budget package is not limited to the \nattacks on federal health care programs. Republican rhetoric claims \nthat this legislation will help families, because of its $500 child tax \ncredit.\n  As chairman of the National Commission on Children, I am clearly on \nrecord in support of a child tax credit, but it must be a refundable \ncredit so that children in all families can benefit. Unfortunately, the \nchild tax credit in this legislation is not refundable, and every \namendment offered to make it even partially refundable was rejected. \nConsequently, over 20 million children are excluded from this child tax \ncredit, and I do not think this is fair. These children are in families \nearning less that $30,000 a year and their parents clearly need and \ndeserve a tax break.\n  To add insult to injury, not only do Republicans deny the credit to \nsuch hard working, low-wage families, Republicans are paying for the \ncredit by imposing a tax increase on working families by cutting $43 \nbillion from the earned income tax credit (EITC).\n  There has been much debate about the EITC, and I want to clearly \nstate that EITC is tax relief only available to working families, and \nit is designed to offset payroll taxes, which often are a greater tax \nburden for low wage families than personal income taxes.\n  The Republican leadership dismisses these arguments, saying that \ntheir tax package helps middle class American families. And this sounds \ngood, but I want to know how they define the middle class?\n  In my State of West Virginia, we believe that parents who go to work \nevery day and struggle to raise their children are middle class, \nadmirable and deserving of support and encouragement. More than 65 \npercent of our taxpayers are working hard but earn less--less than \n$30,000. For many of these families, they will worse off, not better, \nunder this bill.\n  Just 2 years ago, these working families were promised tax relief. \nNow Republicans are reneging on that deal and raising taxes on families \nearning less than $30,000. For families with two or more children, \ntheir taxes will go up an average of $483. For families with one child, \ntaxes will keep an average of $410. This will hit more than 77,000 \nfamilies with children in my state of West Virginia alone.\n  But such numbers can be numbing. We need to get beyond the rhetoric \nand look at real families.\n  A real family, like the Helmick family of New Milton, WV, will be \nworse off, not better. The Helmick family has 6 children, ranging in \nage from 15 to four. Mr. Helmick works full-time as a \n\n[[Page S 16070]]\ntruck driver for a local construction company, and Mrs. Helmick is a \nfull-time homemaker. In the past, they have used their EITC for baby \nfurniture and to buy a used truck so Mr. Helmick has reliable \ntransportation to get to work. Mr. Helmick will not get to claim the \nfull tax credit for his children, and he will lose EITC benefits under \nthe Republican plan.\n  This is a real working family that will be hurt, not helped.\n  Families like the Helmicks cannot claim all of the child tax credit, \nand they will be hurt by the cuts in EITC; and I doubt that they will \nbe claiming capital gains tax breaks either. For them, this package \ndoes little more than renew their cynicism since it reneges on promises \nmade just two years ago when we told families to play by the rules, go \nto work instead of on welfare, and we will offset your payroll taxes so \nthat you do not have to raise your children in poverty.\n  Mr. President, I am not against the idea of tax cuts. In fact, I \nwould support a limited tax cut for the most needy families and some \nrelief from burdensome taxes for companies that need it. But when you \nlook at this bill, while it was artfully crafted to appear to have \nsomething for everyone, it is really a farce. It is full of tax pork \nfor the wealthy and goodies for those who do not really need it.\n  On the surface, how can anyone oppose tax relief for families? The \nRepublican rhetoric is, as always, good--tax relief for families, and \nhelp for companies to create jobs. It sounds so tempting to give \nhundreds of billions of dollars away, but when you look at what \nRepublicans are reality doing, and how they are doing it, you say \n``wait a minute.'' Their rhetoric is one thing, but reality is another.\n  They say they are balancing the budget, but they will add nearly a \ntrillion dollars to our national debt in the next seven years. They say \nthe tax cut is ``paid-for'' by an economic dividend of balancing the \nbudget; but the truth is, they are adding $224 billion to our \naccumulated debt over the next 7 years. In fact, if you add interest, \nthe total is more like $268 billion. Republicans are borrowing money \nfrom the middle class they claim to be championing in order to give \nmoney away to their fat-cat friends.\n  Think of it as a new credit card with a credit line of $1,000. Every \nmonth you take home $1,500 after taxes and spend $1,600. You can do \nthat because you have the credit card. You are charging $100 every \nmonth to your credit line. Well, after 5 months, you owe the $500 you \nborrowed on your credit card, plus interest. Then you decide, you don't \nlike spending more than you are making, so you force yourself to spend \nless. For the next 7 months, you bring your spending down from $1,600 a \nmonth to $1,585 a month, then $1,570 a month, then $1,570 a month, and \nso on until at the end of the year, you are spending $1,500 a month. \nYou have a Balanced Budget. You are making $1,500 a month and spending \n$1,500 a month. Then you look at your balance you owe on your credit \ncard, and guess what--you owe $800, plus interest. How did that happen? \nYou went on a path to balance in June when you owed $500 plus interest, \nbut in December you owe more than $800. It is because every month on \nthe way to balance, you borrowed more to cover your over spending. You \nborrowed $85 dollars one month, $70 the next, $55 the month after that, \nand so on.\n  That is what this bill does. Sure, it gets us to balance by 2002, but \nalong the way, we are going to overspend what we take in by nearly $1 \ntrillion. Every year between now and 2002 we spend more than we take \nin. We borrow more to pay for this tax cut. That is $1 trillion added \nto our accumulated debt. And of that $1 trillion added to the debt, \n$224 billion is this tax cut ($268 billion, if you add the interest). \nIf we got rid of this tax cut, or reduced the tax cut down to size of \nthe real economic dividend, our deficit every year would be less, and \nthe accumulated debt, the amount the American people owe, would be \nless.\n  This debate is about priorities. Do we want to run up the bill on all \nof us in order to give money to the wealthy to buy goodies? We are \nrunning up our national credit card so the richest Americans--those who \nearn more than $350,000 a year--get a tax cut of $5,600. Do we want to \nspend $40 billion on capital gains tax cuts for the richest Americans \nand recklessly slash health care for the most needy and the elderly? Do \nwe want to cut taxes by more than $1.7 million on estates worth over $5 \nmillion by raising taxes on the working poor?\n  Again, West Virginians have a basic sense of fairness. How can I tell \nthem that families are helped, when the result of this whole bill will \nmean that poorest fifth of Americans would shoulder fully half of the \nprogram cuts with an average loss of nearly $2,500 per family in 2002.\n  At the same time, the Treasury estimates that almost two thirds of \nthe proposed tax breaks would go to the wealthiest fifth of the \npopulation, who would gain almost $1,400 per family.\n  In fact, the top one percent of families--those with incomes greater \nthan $350,000 per year, would get an average tax break of $5,600. The \ncapital gains tax break will benefit taxpayers with incomes between \n$20,000 and $30,000 by about $5 on average. Those making more than \n$200,000 will receive an average cut of nearly $1,500. How is that \nfair?\n  How can the authors of this bill look at themselves in the mirror, \nlet alone look into the faces of the most needy in America, and say \nthey are doing the right thing? I cannot go to town meetings in my \nstate and tell West Virginians that I supported such an unbalanced, \nunfair deal.\n  I could support tax cuts that were honestly paid for. I could support \ntax cuts that are fair. But I am not going to support tax cuts paid for \nby raising the money from those least able to pay. I even think we \nshould consider giving some limited tax relief to American companies \nthat need it. In fact, I am proud to be the author of a bill that helps \ncapital intensive industries such as steel, chemicals and wood-paper \ncompete in the international market place. That bill fixes something \ncalled the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) by changing the way companies \ncalculate the value of their property. Unfortunately, even in this bill \nof tax goodies, and big corporate give-aways, the Republicans could not \ndo it right, they only did a half measure.\n  The problem these companies have is that under the AMT, the tax code \ndoes not recognize in any real-world way, how to depreciate their \nassets. Steel, chemicals, wood-paper, any capital intensive industry, \nwhere the costs are high and the margins are low, these companies need \nto change the length of time they have to depreciate their assets. This \nis known as lives. Under the current tax law, after 5 years, a US steel \nmaker under AMT recovers only 37 percent on its investment in new plant \nand equipment, versus 58 percent in Japan, 81 percent in Germany, 90 \npercent in Korea, and 100 percent in Brazil. This is largely a result \nof the AMT. It is my strong hope that conferees will look at this with \nan understanding eye. I am hopeful that they will. When you look at how \nthe AMT puts our companies in such a competitive disadvantage, I think \nthe need for corrective action is clear.\n  Another disturbing provision tucked into this package is the proposal \nto eliminate the 50 percent interest exclusion on loans to purchase \nemployees stock ownership plans (ESOPs). As Governor of West Virginia, \nI worked closely with the workers of Weirton Steel to establish an ESOP \nthat kept the mill open, and the community alive. Weirton officials \nquestion if they could have secured the financing necessary in the \nearly 1980's to create this ESOP without this tax incentive. Weirton \nSteel is the largest private employer in West Virginia in my State. \nDespite the rocky roads that the American steel industry has faced, \nWeirton Steel has not only survived, it has invested almost half a \nbillion dollars in modernization so that it will be internationally \ncompetitive into the next century--and it remains an ESOP with involved \nemployee owners. There are other successful ESOPs in West Virginia, and \nI hope there will be more in future. We should not slam the door shut \non such future ESOPs by eliminating the incentives for start-up loans, \nin my view.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is nearly 2000 pages long--I shudder \nto think about other provisions tucked quietly into this bill. It was \npresented to the Senate on October 23, 1995, and \n\n[[Page S 16071]]\nwe are expected to vote on the legislation with only four days of \nreview. There has not been time to carefully analyze this massive \nlegislation or to learn what is on each and every page--much less \nunderstand the complicated interactions of the policies and programs.\n  I do know that on page 1851 there is a proposal that I cannot \nsupport. It is a secret deal in the Republican budget that \nfundamentally breaks the promise of lifetime health benefits to retired \ncoal miners and their widows--nearly 30,000 of whom live in the State \nof West Virginia. More than 60,000 more older miners and their widows \nare living in almost every other State in this union.\n  I am obligated to expose the secret and to call it what it is--a pay-\noff for a set of greedy corporate interests that will not stop until \nthey have bled the miners' health trust fund of every last dollar \nneeded to protect miners benefits. Republicans say they will restore \nthe miners' trust fund--the miners' only real guarantee that their \nhealth care will be there for them when they need it. I am not willing \nto gamble with the health security of 92,000 miners and their widows.\n  I cannot abide such a tawdry provision in this or any reconciliation \npackage. I appeal to whatever sense of justice my Republican colleagues \nhave. I ask them to give up this corporate pay-off before any more \ndamage is done.\n  This cruel little provision might have escaped the notice of many. In \na package that gives away billions, this provision only deals with tens \nof million of dollars. But these millions mean security to the older \nminers and their widows. This small trust fund is all they have, and it \nstands between their health security and a peace of mind, and financial \nruin and destitution when illness strikes these aging miners.\n  This is a complicated issue with a long history, and I could go into \nexcruciating detail. But the bottom line is that Republicans want to \nhand over the money that is keeping the retired miners' health trust \nfund solvent to a group of special interests represented by high priced \nlobbyists.\n  As I have said earlier, I want my colleagues to think about the real \nfamilies that could be truly hurt by this package.\n  The day after the Finance Committee reported out their handiwork that \ndemolishes the health security of more than 92,000 miners and their \nwidows for the sake of a few of the biggest and most profitable \ncompanies in this country, I went back home to West Virginia. I went \nback to tell miners and their wives what happened.\n  The miners I met with were reserved, as many miners are, especially \nolder ones who have seen it all, strikes and cave-ins, shut-downs and \nlay-offs. They have learned to accept a lot in life. They have seen \ntheir coworkers killed, or mangled, or dismembered. They have suffered \nthe loss of their own lungs and limbs. They do not have a lot to pass \nonto their families in temporal terms, but they have good hearts and an \nincomparable work ethic. They have the values they hold dear--their \nemphasis is on community and family and caring. And until the Senate \nFinance Committee action, they had their UMW health card to get their \nhealth benefits and knew that it would protect their wives when they \ndied too hard and too soon.\n  One miner who worked for decades in the mines told me starkly, \n``We're worried to death.'' He said, ``Now it seems like the company is \nthe one running the whole show. They want to do away with us when we \nwere the ones that worked and built everything else.''\n  His question was this, ``What's going to happen to me if I lose my \nbenefits?'' And he answered his own question with, ``They'll probably \nput me in my grave before my time.''\n  Another miner, characteristically, worried about his wife who is a \ndiabetic. ``Gosh, if I had to buy her medicine, I do not know what \nwould happen.'' Today retired miners' health benefits pay for \nprescription drug medication after they meet a modest deductible.\n  Under this reconciliation package, on page 1851, we are taking away \nthe health care security of these miners, and we are reneging on a \npromise made more than 40 years ago by President Truman and reaffirmed \njust 2 years ago and signed into law by an act of Congress.\n  If this Senate and this society renege on this promise to a group of \nold frail miners, their wives and their widows, what are we worth?\n  Does a promise have no meaning? Does a contract not matter? Can a law \nbe repealed when it becomes inconvenient for a profitable, influential \nbusinesses?\n  Promises do have meaning for me.\n  When I was elected by the people of West Virginia, I made promises to \nWest Virginians. I vowed to fight for their priorities and do my best \nto serve them and respond to their concerns.\n  This reconciliation bill simply does not respond to the real needs of \nWest Virginia families, or even West Virginia businesses.\n  The Republican rhetoric is good, but the reality is that this bill \nwill undermine health care for seniors, raise taxes on working \nfamilies, and jeopardizes the health care for retired coal miners and \ntheir families.\n  This is a harsh package that hurts real people, and I strongly oppose \nit. With this legislation, we are walking away from basic commitments \nto some of the most needy individuals in our society, and the debate \nover this package has saddened me greatly. We can, and we should, do \nbetter as public servants. I will vote no, and continue to fight \nagainst such unfair legislation.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, before we vote on final passage of S. 1327, \na historic piece of legislation, I wanted to submit for the Record \nmaterials presented to me by the United States Chamber of Commerce. The \nChamber of Commerce is an ardent supporter of S. 1327 and believes that \nthe time is now to balance the Federal budget, streamline Government \nprograms and, importantly, save the Medicare Program. Included in these \nmaterials is a study prepared by the Chamber of Commerce regarding the \neconomic impacts of Medicare. I commend this study to my colleagues and \nthank the chair.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     [From the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Economic Policy Division]\n\n          The Medicare Crisis: The Tax Solution Is No Solution\n\n       The only solution detailed by the Medicare Board of \n     Trustees for achieving financial balance in Medicare Part A \n     is to raise taxes. Unfortunately, this is no solution at all. \n     Higher taxes will rob working individuals of their hard-won \n     dollars, significantly increase costs on small and large \n     businesses alike and bring the economy to the brink of \n     recession.\n       The Trustees calculate that balancing the Medicare trust \n     fund for the next 75 years requires us to immediately hike \n     the Medicare payroll tax from 2.90% to 6.42%. While the tax \n     increase may seem to amount to only a few percentage points, \n     it amounts to hundreds of dollars to the typical worker, \n     thousands of dollars to the small business, and billions of \n     dollars for the economy. Analysis by the Economic Policy \n     Division of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce suggests the \n     following impacts on individuals, businesses and the economy:\n       For a worker making $30,000 a year, total Medicare payroll \n     taxes paid would jump to $1,926 from the current $870.\n       A small business employing 25 such workers would be liable \n     for an additional $13,200 tax payment per year.\n       When aggregated across the entire economy, the effect would \n     be to lower real GDP by $179.4 billion within two years and \n     hold GDP about $95 billion lower 10 years later. This amount \n     to a 3.1% decline in GDP in the short run. With economic \n     growth projected to average less than 3% over the next five \n     years, this decline could easily result in a recession.\n       These results are even more startling when you consider \n     that they represent an optimistic evaluation, not a worst-\n     case scenario.\n\n             overview of medicare: why reform is necessary\n\n       Medicare is a nationwide health insurance program for older \n     Americans and certain disabled persons. It is composed of two \n     parts: Part A, the hospital insurance (HI) program, and Part \n     B, the supplementary medical insurance (SMI) program.\n       Part A covers expenses for the first sixty days of \n     inpatient care less a deductible ($716 in 1995) for those age \n     65 and older and for the long-term disabled. It also covers \n     skilled nursing care, home health care and hospice care. The \n     HI program is financed primarily by payroll taxes. Employees \n     and employers each pay 1.45% of taxable earnings, while self-\n     employed persons pay 2.90%. In 1994, the HI earnings caps \n     were eliminated, meaning that the HI tax applies to all \n     payroll earnings.\n       Part B is a voluntary program which pays for physicians' \n     services, outpatient hospital services, and other medical \n     expenses for persons aged 65 and over and for the long-term \n\n[[Page S 16072]]\n     disabled. It generally pays 80% of the approved amount for covered \n     services in excess of an annual deductible ($100). About a \n     quarter of the funding comes from monthly premiums ($46.10 in \n     1995); the remainder comes from general tax revenues and \n     interest.\n       Medicare is not a means-tested program. That is, income is \n     not a factor in determining an individual's eligibility or, \n     for Part B, premium levels. Age is the primary eligibility \n     criteria, with the program also extending to qualified \n     disabled individuals younger than 65.\n       Over the years, tax revenues for Medicare Part A have \n     exceeded disbursements, and so the remaining revenues have \n     been credited to the Medicare HI Trust Fund. At the end of \n     1994, the trust fund held $132.8 billion.\n\n                       conclusion of the trustees\n\n       Each year, trustees of Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust \n     Fund analyze the current status and the long-term outlook for \n     the trust fund, and their findings are published in an annual \n     report. The 1995 edition, issued in April, demonstrated that \n     the Medicare system is in serious financial trouble. The \n     program's six trustees--four of whom are Clinton appointees \n     (cabinet secretaries Robert Rubin, Robert Reich and Donna \n     Shalala, and commissioner of Social Security, Shirley \n     Chater)--reported the following conclusions:\n       Based on the financial projections developed for this \n     report, the Trustees apply an explicit test of short-range \n     financial adequacy. The HI trust fund fails this test by a \n     wide margin. In particular, the trust fund is projected to \n     become insolvent within the next 6 to 11 years. . . (HI \n     Annual Report, pg. 2)\n       Under the Trustees intermediate assumptions, the present \n     financing schedule for the HI program is sufficient to ensure \n     the payment of benefits only over the next 7 years. (pg. 3)\n       The program is severely out of financial balance and \n     substantial measures will be required to increase revenues \n     and/or reduce expenditures. (pg. 18)\n       . . . the HI program is severely out of financial balance \n     and the Trustees believe that the Congress must take timely \n     action to establish long-term financial stability for the \n     program. (pg. 28)\n       The Trustees believe that prompt, effective and decisive \n     action is necessary. (pg. 28)\n       The same set of Trustees also oversees the Medicare Part B \n     program. In their 1995 Annual Report, they wrote: ``Although \n     the SMI program (Medicare Part B) is currently actuarially \n     sound, the Trustees note with great concern the past and \n     projected rapid growth in the cost of the program. . . Growth \n     rates have been so rapid that outlays of the program have \n     increased 53% in the aggregate and 40% per enrollee in the \n     last 5 years.'' (SMI Annual Report, pg. 3).\n       ``The Trustees believe that prompt, effective and decisive \n     action is necessary.'' (pg. 3)\n       Obviously, the Trustees believe that the Medicare program \n     deserves our careful, immediate attention. The following \n     pages present the figures that led the Trustees to their \n     conclusions.\n\n                      where medicare stands today\n\n       Medicare is a huge federal program. In 1994: Medicare \n     expenditures reached $160 billion, just over half the size of \n     Social Security; Expenditures grew 11.4% from 1993; Eleven \n     cents of every dollar spent by the federal government went to \n     Medicare; Medicare represented one-fifth of total entitlement \n     spending.\n       Between 1990 and 1994, Medicare grew at a 10.4% average \n     annual rate, almost three times the 3.6% average inflation \n     rate over the same period and twice the 5.1% average annual \n     growth of the economy as a whole.\n\n                    medicare and the federal budget\n\n       Medicare spending must be addressed as part of the solution \n     to balancing the federal budget. That's because spending on \n     federal entitlements--such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social \n     Security--soared 8.4% annually on average between 1990 and \n     1994. Spending on discretionary, annually appropriated \n     programs--such as defense, education and infrastructure--\n     increased 2.2%, which is less than the rate of inflation. \n     Coming decades will see even more pressure for entitlement \n     growth, as the leading edge of the Baby Boom generation \n     reaches 65 in 2011.\n       Entitlements are not only the fastest growing portion of \n     the federal budget, they're already its largest component, as \n     shown in the accompanying chart. Just over half of all \n     federal expenditures is spent on entitlements; only a third \n     go to discretionary programs. If we are going to balance the \n     federal budget--and keep it in balance over the long term--\n     entitlement reform must be part of the solution.\n\n               where medicare is headed if we do nothing\n\n       Under current law, Medicare is projected by the \n     Congressional Budget Office to grow at a 10.4% average annual \n     rate over the next seven years. In 2002, the CBO projects \n     Medicare spending will reach $344 billion, claiming almost 16 \n     cents of every dollar spent by the federal government.\n       Moreover, beginning next year, Medicare HI expenditures \n     will exceed the program's revenues. The HI Trust fund, which \n     at year-end 1994 held $132.8 billion, will have to be tapped \n     to cover the projected $867 million difference.\n       However, according to the Trustees' Annual Report, this \n     shortfall isn't temporary. Instead, it will balloon to be \n     about seven times larger in 1997, which is just the following \n     year, and more than twenty times larger by 1999. Under \n     assumptions reflecting the most likely demographic and \n     economic trends. 1996 will be the first year of hemorrhage \n     that will deplete the entire trust fund by 2002--just seven \n     years away. The optimistic set of assumptions buys us only a \n     little time, with trust fund depletion projected in 2006. \n     Under the pessimistic scenario, the fund is exhausted as \n     early as 2001. In other words, within the next 6 to 11 years, \n     it's virtually certain that Medicare will be insolvent--\n     unless we take action.\n       The danger of inaction was made clear last winter when the \n     President's Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax \n     Reform, chaired by Sen. Bob Kerrey and then-Sen. John \n     Danforth, issued its final report. The focus of the report \n     was to look not years ahead, but decades ahead to assess the \n     impact of federal budget trends. The report is sobering: \n     Under current trends, virtually all federal government \n     revenues are absorbed by entitlement spending and net \n     interest by 2010, as shown in Chart 2. Deficit-financing will \n     be required to cover almost all of the discretionary \n     programs, including defense, health research, the FBI, \n     support for education, and the federal judicial system.\n       Ten years later, the situation is worse. Growth in \n     entitlements is so explosive that not only would the \n     government have to borrow to pay for discretionary expenses, \n     it would have to borrow funds to pay the lion's share of \n     interest payments on the national debt.\n\n                   medicare's impact on the pay stub\n\n       In addition to detailing the projected dissipation of Trust \n     Fund under current law, the Trustees' Report also describes \n     the measures that would be necessary to shore up the trust \n     fund over the next 25, 50 and 75 years. If the expenditure \n     formulas are not altered, then preserving the trust fund can \n     only be done through increases in the payroll tax or \n     additional subsidies from general revenues. Table 1 \n     illustrates the payroll tax increases that would be necessary \n     to balance the trust fund.\n\n                              current law\n\n       Currently, the combined (employee and employer) Medicare \n     tax rate is 2.90%, applied to all payroll earnings. A worker \n     earning $30,000 a year in salary or wages, for instance, is \n     directly taxed 1.45%, or $435 annually, for Medicare Part A, \n     the hospital insurance program. Employers then match that \n     payment with another $435, resulting in $870 of tax revenue \n     earmarked for the Medicare HI trust fund generated by having \n     that worker on the payroll.\n       The Medicare contributions from both the worker and firm \n     don't stop there, however. Because two-thirds of Medicare \n     Part B (SMI) is financed through general revenues (the other \n     third coming from Medicare premiums and interest), a portion \n     of the worker's and the firm's general income taxes are also \n     financing Medicare. The Trustees reported that $36.2 billion \n     of general funds were used to pay Medicare Part B claims in \n     1994.\n\n                               TABLE 1.--MEDICARE HOSPITAL INSURANCE PAYROLL TAXES                              \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         To balance the HI trust fund over the next--           \n                                   Current  --------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     law            25 yrs.                50 yrs.                75 yrs.       \n                                   employee --------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     plus    Additional   Total HI  Additional   Total HI  Additional   Total HI\n                                   employer      tax        tax         tax        tax         tax        tax   \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTax rates (pct.)................       2.90        1.33       4.23        2.68       5.58        3.52       6.42\nPct. increase over current law..  .........  ..........       45.9  ..........       92.4  ..........      121.4\nPayroll earnings:                                                                                               \n  $10,000.......................       $290        $133       $423        $268       $558        $352       $642\n  20,000........................        580         266        846         536      1,116         704      1,284\n  30,000........................        870         399      1,269         804      1,674       1,056      1,926\n  40,000........................      1,160         532      1,692       1,072      2,232       1,408      2,568\n  50,000........................      1,450         665      2,115       1,340      2,790       1,760      3,210\n  60,000........................      1,740         798      2,538       1,608      3,348       2,112      3,852\n  70,000........................      2,030         931      2,961       1,876      3,906       2,464      4,494\n  80,000........................      2,320       1,064      3,384       2,144      4,464       2,816      5,136\n  90,000........................      2,610       1,197      3,807       2,412      5,022       3,168      5,778\n  100,000.......................      2,900       1,330      4,230       2,680      5,580       3,520      6,420\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource (for all tables): 1995 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees. Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund.   \n  Table 1.D3, page 22, Calculations and macroeconomics simulations by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.             \n\n\n[[Page S 16073]]\n\n       To Balance the Medicare HI Trust Fund for the Next 25 Years \n     (through 2019): According to the Trustees' analysis, the \n     hospital insurance payroll tax would have to rise from 2.90% \n     to 4.23% (a 46% increase) to keep the HI trust fund in \n     balance for the next 25 years. Further, the increase would \n     have to be made immediately and maintained through the entire \n     25-year period.\n       For our $30,000/year worker for whom $870 is currently \n     provided to Medicare HI, this increase means an additional \n     tax of $399, bringing total annual hospital insurance payroll \n     taxes to $1,269. And that's before any other federal and \n     state payroll taxes (such as unemployment insurance and \n     Social Security) or federal and state income taxes.\n       However, even this increase in payroll taxes still leaves \n     the trust fund exhausted in 2019, with the oldest of the baby \n     boomers just shy of reaching their life expectancy. Because \n     of this demographic bulge, balancing the HI trust fund over a \n     longer period would require even higher payroll taxes.\n       To Balance the Medicare Trust Fund for the Next 50 Years \n     (through 2044): Balancing the trust fund over the next fifty \n     years--a span long enough to see most of the Baby Boomers \n     through their lifetimes--would require virtually doubling the \n     hospital insurance payroll tax from 2.90% to 5.58%. The \n     increase would have to be made immediately and remain \n     permanent through the entire 50-year period. Again, for the \n     worker earning $30,000 a year, the total HI payroll tax rises \n     from $870 to $1,674, an increase of 92.4%.\n       To Balance the Medicare Trust Fund for the Next 75 Years \n     (through 2069): Balancing the trust fund over the next \n     seventy-five years--roughly through the life expectancy of an \n     individual born this year, and the usual period for long-term \n     fiscal solvency--would require an immediate boost in the \n     Medicare tax rate of 121.4%, from 2.90% to 6.42%. Total HI \n     payroll taxes for a worker earning $30,000 a year would rise \n     from $870 to $1,926.\n\n\n                     medicare's impact on business\n\n       Because it's levied on employment levels, not income, the \n     payroll tax due remains the same through both good and bad \n     economic times. This feature accentuates the pain of a \n     downturn on employers, who need to pay the tax regardless of \n     profitability. Consequently, relative to the income tax, a \n     payroll tax can be particularly punishing to start-up firms \n     or companies trying to weather a drop in business.\n       Table 2 shows the liability for Medicare HI payroll taxes \n     that would be faced by firms of various sizes. Total \n     liability is shown under current law and under the three tax \n     rates computed by the Trustees to bring the HI trust fund in \n     balance over periods of 25, 50 and 75 years.\n       For instance, a 25-person firm where the average worker \n     earns $20,000 per year is currently liable for a $7,250 tax \n     payment for the Medicare HI program (for their contribution, \n     the workers themselves would be taxed an identical amount). \n     To balance the trust fund over the next 25 years, the \n     combined employee and employer tax rate would have to rise \n     from the current 2.90% to 4.23%. Assuming that the liability \n     continues to be evenly split between the employee and \n     employer, the firm will face an HI payroll tax of about 2.11% \n     per worker. For our 25-person firm, the total HI payroll tax \n     would rise from $7,250 to $10,575 per year.\n\n                 TABLE 2.--MEDICARE HOSPITAL INSURANCE PAYROLL TAX ANNUAL EMPLOYER TAX LIABILITY                \n                                                  [In dollars]                                                  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Number of employees--                           \n                                    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         5          10         25         50        100        500       1,000  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAverage salary: $20,000:                                                                                        \n  Current law......................      1,450      2,900      7,250     14,500     29,000    145,000    290,000\nTo balance Medicare HI over the                                                                                 \n next:                                                                                                          \n  25 yrs...........................      2,115      4,230     10,575     21,150     42,300    211,500    423,000\n  50 yrs...........................      2,790      5,580     13,950     27,900     55,800    279,000    558,000\n  75 yrs...........................      3,210      6,420     16,050     32,100     64,200    321,000    642,000\nAverage salary: $30,000:                                                                                        \n  Current law......................      2,175      4,350     10,875     21,750     43,500    217,500    435,000\nTo balance Medicare HI over the                                                                                 \n next:                                                                                                          \n  25 yrs...........................      3,173      6,345     15,862     31,725     63,450    317,250    634,500\n  50 yrs...........................      4,185      8,370     20,925     41,850     83,700    418,500    837,000\n  75 yrs...........................      4,815      9,630     24,075     48,150     96,300    481,500    963,000\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                    medicare's impact on the economy\n\n       Raising payroll taxes to keep the Medicare Hospital \n     Insurance trust fund afloat imposes substantial burdens on \n     both workers and firms. To measure what that means for the \n     economy as a whole, we conducted several policy simulations \n     using the highly respected Washington University Macro Model \n     from Laurence H. Meyer & Associates of St. Louis, MO.\n       The results are striking: The economy would suffer through \n     sharply slower economic growth and higher unemployment in the \n     near term. Over a longer period, the economy is saddled with \n     a permanent loss of production and employment. As shown in \n     Tables 3 and 4, the degree of severity for GDP and employment \n     depends upon the increase in Medicare taxes enacted.\n       The tables compare each of three alternative tax \n     simulations specified in the Trustees' Annual Report to \n     LHM's June 1995 baseline forecast. To demonstrate the \n     policy change working its way through the economy, we display \n     the results for three of the ten years of our simulation: \n     1997, 2000 and 2004. This gives us snapshots of the short-\n     term, intermediate-term and long-term impacts on economic \n     output and employment. In each case, the imposition of the \n     Medicare payroll tax increase takes place in the fourth \n     quarter of 1995.\n\n                                   TABLE 3.--IMPACT ON GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT                                   \n                         [Balancing the HI Trust Fund Through Raising Payroll Tax Rates]                        \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Difference from baseline in        Percent difference from    \n                                      Required    given year, billions of 1987        baseline in given year    \n   Years to balance HI trust fund     Medicare              dollars             --------------------------------\n                                      tax rate ---------------------------------                                \n                                       (pct.)      1997       2000       2004       1997       2000       2004  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n25 Years...........................       4.23      -68.4      -30.1      -36.1       -1.2       -0.5       -0.5\n50 Years...........................       5.58     -137.1      -60.5      -72.1       -2.4       -1.0       -1.1\n75 Years...........................       6.42     -179.4      -79.4      -95.6       -3.1       -1.3       -1.4\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       As shown in Table 3, if the government imposed the most \n     modest payroll tax increase--enough to keep the Medicare \n     trust fund in balance for the next 25 years--production in \n     the economy would be 1.2%, or almost $70 billion, lower in \n     1997 than it would have been otherwise. By 2000, the \n     percentage-point gap between the alternative closes to within \n     0.5% of the baseline level of production, but that distance \n     is maintained even ten years after the tax increase took \n     effect.\n       The short-term loss in output translates into 1.2 million \n     fewer jobs relative to what we would have had otherwise, as \n     shown in Table 4. While this decline, amounting to about 1% \n     of the economy's jobs, moderates over time, the economy \n     appears to have lost over 0.5% of its jobs permanently.\n       Of course, all of this economic turbulence puts the \n     Medicare HI trust fund in actuarial balance for only the next \n     25 years. To generate long-term actuarial balance for the \n     full 75-year period, the Medicare payroll tax rate would have \n     to jump from 2.90% to 6.42%, triggering even stronger \n     economic impacts than those described above. Production in \n     the economy would be about 3% lower in 1997 than it would \n     have been otherwise, with the long-term loss in output \n     projected at 1.5%. Over 3 million jobs would be eliminated in \n     1997 relative to the baseline, with a projected permanent \n     loss of about 1.5% of total employment over the long term.\n\n                                         TABLE 4.--IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT                                         \n                         [Balancing the HI Trust Fund Through Raising Payroll Tax Rates]                        \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      Required    Difference from baseline in        Percent difference from    \n                                      Medicare    given year, millions of jobs    baseline in given year (pct.) \n   Years to balance HI trust fund     tax rate -----------------------------------------------------------------\n                                       (pct.)      1997       2000       2004       1997       2000       2004  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n25 Yrs.............................       4.23       -1.2       -0.6       -0.8       -0.9       -0.4      -0.6 \n\n[[Page S 16074]]\n                                                                                                                \n50 Yrs.............................       5.58       -2.4       -1.2       -1.6       -1.9       -0.9       -1.2\n75 Yrs.............................       6.42       -3.2       -1.5       -2.2       -2.5       -1.2       -1.5\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n       As dramatic as these figures are, there's good reason to \n     believe that they are optimistic estimates. Because the macro \n     model used in these simulations treats the Medicare payroll \n     tax like the Social Security payroll tax, the increases in \n     the tax rates apply only to the first $61,200 earned (in \n     1995, and rising afterwards). That is, the model is not \n     picking up the economic impact of applying the higher tax \n     rates to incomes over the taxable base. Thus, these results \n     should be considered a minimum measure of the economic impact \n     of raising Medicare payroll taxes. Attempts to account for \n     this problem yield significantly greater job loss and lower \n     GDP. These results are available from the Economic Policy \n     Division of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n       It is important to note that, even with the set of numbers \n     presented here with its inherent bias toward underestimating \n     the economic impact, we can see that using payroll taxes to \n     balance the Medicare trust fund imposes severe costs on the \n     U.S. economy. These results clearly indicate that the \n     Medicare problem must be solved by fundamental program \n     reform, not tax increases.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n          U.S. Chamber of Commerce--Medicare FAX Poll Results\n\n       On October 11, 1995, the U.S. Chamber surveyed 9,700 \n     business, chamber and association members on their attitudes \n     concerning Medicare reform and specific reform elements. \n     Responses to the Chamber survey (nearly 10 percent responded, \n     68.9% of which employ fewer than 50 workers) indicated strong \n     support for market-oriented Medicare reform comparable to the \n     House and Senate Majority plans for Medicare reform. The \n     complete survey and results are provided below.\n       Medicare is ``severely out of financial balance and the \n     Trustees believe that . . . prompt, effective and decisive \n     action is necessary.''\n       Medicare reform has become a focal point of the budget \n     debate. Medicare--the national health insurance program for \n     seniors--will run out of money in seven years, according to \n     the system's trustees. Spending on Medicare and other \n     entitlements threatens to crowd out all other budget \n     priorities and increase the budget deficit.\n       Previous approaches to Medicare reform have failed to slow \n     Medicare's growth. Worse, these approaches have increased the \n     burden on businesses and their employees through higher \n     payroll taxes and higher insurance premiums.\n       Since 1970, Congress has raised payroll taxes over 20 times \n     and the Trustee's Report pointed out that payroll taxes would \n     have to be raised by another 1.3 to 3.5 percentage points to \n     bring the system into balance. When you consider that many \n     small and medium size businesses already pay more in payroll \n     taxes than income taxes and that payroll taxes must be paid \n     regardless of economic conditions, it becomes clear why \n     Medicare requires solutions other than tax increases.\n       We need your help. Please review the following questions on \n     Medicare reform and FAX back your answers by close of \n     business October 16.\n       1. Medicare should be modernized by adopting the market-\n     based strategies private employers and health plans are using \n     successfully to improve health care quality and control \n     costs. These strategies include improving the quality of care \n     provided to enrollees, increasing enrollee choice by \n     expanding health plan options, and reducing the rate of \n     growth of Medicare spending.\n       Agree, 98.9 percent; Disagree, 0.6 percent.\n       2. Two competing approaches to Medicare reform have emerged \n     in Congress. One more limited approach addresses the Medicare \n     Part A trust fund, delaying insolvency for an additional two \n     years through $89 billion in Medicare savings, primarily from \n     reducing the rate of growth in Medicare payments to \n     providers. A second approach is more comprehensive in nature, \n     addressing both Medicare part A (hospital bills) and Part B \n     (doctors bills). Medicare Part A would be protected at least \n     an additional 10 years through $270 billion in Medicare \n     savings achieved through increased competition and reducing \n     the rate of growth in Medicare payments to providers. Which \n     approach would you favor?\n       Limited, 4.3 percent; Comprehensive, 94.6 percent.\n       3. Do you favor or oppose the following elements of \n     Medicare reform?\n       a. Provide seniors choices between competing health plans \n     including existing fee-for-service benefits.\n       Favor, 97.4 percent; Oppose, 1.6 percent.\n       b. Contain Medicare spending by increasing competition and \n     reducing the rate of growth in Medicare payments.\n       Favor, 97.4 percent; Oppose 2.0 percent.\n       c. Increase managed care options for seniors.\n       Favor, 93.8 percent; Oppose, 4.3 percent.\n       d. Provide seniors a medical savings account option.\n       Favor, 88.2 percent; Oppose, 7.3 percent.\n       e. Allow provider groups (i.e., doctors and hospitals) to \n     offer health coverage (similar to managed care networks) \n     directly to seniors--a new proposal known as provider \n     sponsored networks or PSNs.\n       Favor, 91.9 percent; Oppose, 5.7 percent.\n       f. Require managed care plans to provide out-of-network \n     benefits at a higher cost to the beneficiary.\n       Favor, 72.4 percent; Oppose, 18.2 percent.\n       4. For purposes of tabulation: Type of Organization: \n     Business, 93.2 percent; Chamber, 4.3 percent; Other, 2.0 \n     percent.

Medicare--the national health insurance program for \n     seniors--will run out of money in seven years, according to \n     The Board of Trustees. Spending on Medicare and other \n     entitlements threatens to crowd out all other budget \n     priorities and increase the budget deficit.\n       Previous approaches to Medicare reform have failed to slow \n     Medicare's growth. Worse, these approaches have increased the \n     burden on businesses and their employees through higher \n     payroll taxes and higher insurance premiums.\n       Since 1970, Congress has raised payroll taxes over 20 times \n     and the Medicare Trustees 1995 Report pointed out that \n     payroll taxes would have to be raised by another 1.3 to 3.5 \n     percentage points to bring the system into balance. When you \n     consider that many small and medium-sized businesses already \n     pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes and that payroll \n     taxes must be paid regardless of economic conditions, it \n     becomes clear why Medicare requires solutions other than tax \n     increases.\n       The House and Senate Majority has proposed market-oriented \n     alternatives to traditional Medicare reform, an approach that \n     modernizes the 30-year old Medicare program by increasing \n     competition while restraining the growth in spending. Key \n     elements include:\n       New choices for Medicare beneficiaries.--Beneficiaries will \n     have the right to choose traditional Medicare, as well as the \n     right to choose from a range of private health plan options \n     including managed care and medical savings accounts. These \n     options will provide beneficiaries access to expanded \n     benefits--such as prescription drugs, preventative care, \n     vision and hearing care.\n       Restrained growth in Medicare spending.--Increases in \n     Medicare spending are inevitable, given the growing Medicare \n     population and the advance of medical technology. However, \n     controlling the rate at which Medicare spending increases is \n     as important to our nation's future financial health as \n     Medicare itself is to seniors' health care. Introducing \n     competition to Medicare through beneficiary choice of health \n     plans will help control costs and allocate resources more \n     fairly and efficiently than Washington bureaucrats.\n       Accountability.--The Republican plan allows seniors to take \n     responsibility for making their own health care decisions. \n     Instead of relying on a bureaucratic, one-size-fits-all \n     approach, seniors will decide which health plans are best for \n     them. Doctors and hospitals are also held accountable. The \n     bill rewards beneficiaries who report incidences of waste, \n     fraud and abuse, and strengthens penalties for anyone who \n     defrauds Medicare.\n       By passing this legislation Congress will have taken \n     timely, critical action that will avert the program's \n     bankruptcy and preserve and protect it for current recipients \n     and future generations.\n\n                            Medicare Reform\n\n\n                            myths vs. facts\n\n       Myth. The House and Senate Republican Medicare reform plans \n     will cut $270 billion from Medicare in order to finance a tax \n     cut for the wealthy.\n       Fact. The Medicare Trustees' 1995 Annual Report urged \n     Congress to take ``prompt and decisive action'' to address \n     the solvency of the Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) \n     Trust Fund and the continued growth of Medicare Part B \n     (supplemental medical insurance).\n       The House and Senate Majority has proposed market-oriented \n     alternatives to traditional Medicare reform, an approach that \n     modernizes the 30-year-old Medicare program by increasing \n     competition while restraining the growth in spending. Under \n     the Republican plan, spending per beneficiary will still \n     increase 40% by 2002 ($4,800 to $6,700).\n       Tax cuts provided for in the budget resolution were \n     considered and passed independent \n\n[[Page S 16075]]\n     of Medicare. Whether or not taxes are cut, Medicare will still go broke \n     in 2002.\n       Myth. It's not fair for Congress to take away benefits from \n     seniors who have faithfully paid into the system.\n       Fact. The average Medicare beneficiaries receive far more \n     than they put in. The average two-earner couple receives \n     $117,200 more in benefits than it contributes to the program. \n     The average single-earner couple receives $126,700 more.\n       By encouraging competition among private health plans based \n     on quality and innovation, the Republican plan may lead to \n     increase benefits.\n       Myth. The business community is a latecomer to the Medicare \n     debate.\n       Fact. Medicare's influence is felt throughout the business \n     community--from payroll taxes paid to finance the system to \n     insurance premiums inflated by consistent shortfalls in \n     Medicare reimbursements to providers who in turn shift the \n     cost to private health plans.\n       Myth. Medicare is in trouble because doctors and hospitals \n     charge too much. The Republican plan fails to address this \n     problem.\n       Fact. Solving the Medicare crisis will require the \n     participation of all--doctors, hospitals, seniors and other \n     taxpayers--particularly the business community. Just as no \n     one factor led to the Medicare crisis, a single-minded focus \n     on providers won't get us out. Further, cost controls have \n     failed miserably whenever they have been tried--particularly \n     in the context of health care.\n\n\n           economic activity and job creation in puerto rico\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as the Congress moves toward final action \nnon budget reconciliation legislation for this year, I want to call \nspecial attention to an initiative by Gov. Pedro Rossello of Puerto \nRico which seeks to establish a wage credit-based economic program as \nan alternative to the current law section 936 tax credit.\n  Neither the House nor Senate was able to give the Governor's proposal \nan extensive examination before either body adopted revisions to the \nsection 936 credit. Together with my colleague from New York, Senator \nD'Amato, I was pleased to ensure that the Senate version more \nappropriately recognizes the positive impact that many U.S. companies \nhave on the Puerto Rican economy and the jobs they provide.\n  I commend Governor Rossello's efforts to enhance economic opportunity \nin Puerto Rico through the creation of new jobs, and I would hope that \nthe Congress will continue to give serious consideration to the \nRossello program as an alternative to programs such as under section \n936. It is important to ensure that any program focused on Puerto Rico \nwill create new jobs and encourage self-reliance and economic growth.\n\n\n                                  ANWR\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has \nbeen managed as one of the great wilderness systems on this continent \nsince the Eisenhower administration. It is on par with other great \nplaces in our natural history, including the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, \nJackson Hole, the Badlands, Glacier Bay, Denali, and others. Opening \nthe Arctic Refuge to oil and gas development violates our stewardship \ncommitment to future generations, fails to use common sense about \nbalancing the budget, and destroys a highly threatened piece of our \nAmerican heritage. This is a unique and treasured land that must serve \nour entire Nation for the next century, not just a few for the next few \nyears.\n  Unnecessary development of significant Federal lands like the Arctic \nRefuge is not the way to balance the budget. The amount of oil that can \npotentially be recovered from the Arctic Refuge is simply too small to \naffect our energy security, and too destructive to the environment, to \nbe worth it. The U.S. Geological Service estimates a 95-percent chance \nof only 148 million barrels of oil in the refuge. The Congressional \nBudget Office assumed 3.2 billion barrels in its budget scoring of oil \nand gas leases, more than 20 times this recent USGS estimate. Worse \nyet, CBO assumed oil prices of $38.60 in 2000, compared to Energy \ninformation administration estimates of only $19.13--less than half.\n  And, it is possible that 90 percent of the lease revenues could go to \nAlaska instead of balancing the Federal budget. Under the most \nfavorable scenario, only 50 percent of the revenues go to balancing the \nbudget.\n  Clearly, the $1.3 billion we have been promised by CBO in return for \ndeveloping this pristine area is a massive fiction, like so many other \nbogus asset sales in this budget. The OMB has estimated oil and gas \nrevenues more realistically to be between $750 million and $850 \nmillion, assuming Alaska does not sue for a 90-percent split. If the \nState does, these revenues fall another 40 percent.\n  We all hope for another strike like Prudhoe Bay. But the simple \nreality, based on the very best geological science and economics \navailable today, is that the next Prudhoe Bay is expansion of Prudhoe \nBay itself, and the continued implementation of national energy \nconservation programs. The next major source of energy is not a long-\nshot wildcat strike in an undeveloped Alaskan wilderness area, and it \nis incorrect to suggest otherwise. And it is ironic that we would \nconsider opening this refuge to oil drilling now that the oil export \nban will be lifted, as the House and Senate have voted to do. If the \nban is lifted, a substantial percentage of the oil that is recovered, \nif any, would be exported to Asia, according to the Cato Institute, the \nCongressional Research Service, and others. The Arctic Refuge oil \nsupplies would do almost nothing to help our energy security.\n  Make no mistake, environmental impacts to the refuge would be severe \nand irreversible. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge includes the \ncalving grounds for one of the largest caribou herds in North America, \nthe porcupine herd of 152,000. It supports several thousand native \nAmericans whose hunter-gatherer culture depends directly on it today as \nit has for 20,000 years. Over 200 species of plants and animals thrive \nin the refuge, including Muskoxen, Snow Geese, Arctic Foxes, Arctic \nGrayling and Arctic Char. It is the only natural area in the United \nStates with all three species of North American bears--the black bear, \nthe grizzly bear, and the polar bear. It is one of the most pristine \nareas in our Nation, untouched by development, and the last of its \nkind. Environmental studies repeatedly show that oil development is not \ncompatible with the protection of these resources. Biologists from \nFederal and State agencies and universities conclude that oil \ndevelopment will harm the calving success of the caribou herd, and \nreduce its long term numbers very significantly.\n  The remaining 90 percent of the Alaskan North Slope is already open \nto oil and gas leasing. Is it too much to protect what little we have \nleft? Let us honor our history of conservation, and the future of \ngenerations to come, by protecting this last Arctic Refuge.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the President on this \nsubject be printed in the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Washington, October 26, 1995.\n     The Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Joe: Thank you for your letter today seeking my views \n     on striking the provision in the reconciliation bill that \n     would open the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge [ANWR] to oil and gas drilling.\n       Because you stated that the Senate is expected to vote on \n     that motion in the near future, let me be clear: I will veto \n     any reconciliation bill that opens ANWR to drilling. \n     Consequently, I strongly support your and your colleagues' \n     efforts to remove this provision from the bill. In my view, \n     this is one of the most significant environmental votes \n     facing Congress, posing a clear choice between protecting a \n     unique, biologically-rich wilderness and pursuing a misquided \n     energy policy.\n       I appreciate and support your efforts to preserve ANWR.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                             Bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I voted against the combined Harkin and \nDorgan amendments. The constraints imposed by the rules under which the \nbudget reconciliation bill is being considered create an absurd \nsituation in which important, complex, and difficult amendments are \ndecided without debate. In addition, because a long stack of votes are \noccurring at 7\\1/2\\ minute intervals, there is little time to properly \nconsider each provision. This is exacerbated when amendments are \nquickly patched together with little warning on the floor.\n  In this case, I oppose the capital gains portion of the Dorgan-Harkin \ncombined amendment. While I do favor capital gains reform, focused on \nlong-term capital gains investment, in my view, the provision goes too \nfar by imposing a lifetime limit of $250,000 on capital gains \ndeductions. The Tax Code \n\n[[Page S 16076]]\nis complex enough without adding a restrictive difficult to administer, \nlifetime provision such as this.\n  I do support the Harkin portion of the amendment which attempts to \nfurther restrict the so-called Benedict Arnold loophole.\n  Because the two amendments were joined together on the Senate floor, \nI could not vote on one and against the other. Therefore, I voted no on \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly in support of \nthe antitrust reform provisions of section 15021 of the House Medicare \nbill. While these provisions are not in the Senate Medicare bill, they \nare important, because they permit doctors to form Provider Service \nNetworks without having to go through an institutional intermediary \nsuch as another HMO or an insurance company. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the provisions when this bill goes into conference, as they are \nmodest antitrust law reforms that will improve the quality and lower \nthe cost of our health care system.\n  I would first like to discuss how the House Medicare bill defines a \nProvider Service Network (or, as it is more commonly known, a ``PSN''). \nIn the House Medicare bill, a PSN is one of the new organizations that \nprovides Medicare beneficiaries with an option called MedicarePlus. \nThat option allows a beneficiary to select a health plan called a \nMedicarePlus Product that would be offered by a MedicarePlus \nOrganization. A MedicarePlus Organization is a private sector \norganization, such as an HMO, that offers a health plan that meets \nFederal Medicare standards. A Provider Sponsored Organization is a type \nof MedicarePlus Organization which is owned and operated by affiliated \nproviders, such as hospitals and physicians. A PSN is an organization \nowned and operated by providers that contract with a Provider Sponsored \nOrganization to provide services to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Current antitrust law effectively makes it automatically illegal for \na group of physicians to set up a PSN or Provider Sponsored \nOrganization, yet permits insurance companies, HMO's and other \nnonphysicians to do so. This does not make sense.\n  Why do we want to reform the antitrust restriction so that physicians \ncan form PSN's and directly compete with insurers and HMO's for \nMedicare beneficiaries? Because permitting physicians to do so will \nbring physicians to the table and will encourage increased competition \nthat will provide Americans with better quality health care at a lower \nprice. By permitting physicians--rather than just accountants--to \noversee the treatment systems, Medicare beneficiaries will receive \nbetter quality care. By removing an insurance company's significant \nadministrative costs from the picture, Medicare beneficiaries will \nlikely see more of their health care premium dollars go to patient care \nand less to overhead.\n  It should be made clear that section 15021 of the House bill does not \nexempt physician networks from antitrust law. I, for one, would oppose \nit if it did. I too believe that physicians must be held accountable \nunder the antitrust laws if they in any way engage in anticompetitive \nprice fixing.\n  Under the House Medicare bill, physician networks would remain \nsubject to all of the antitrust statutes that currently exist. The only \nlimitation on antitrust enforcement is that physician created networks \nwhich meet the standards for PSN's (as set forth in section 15021(b)(6) \nof the House bill) would not be considered automatically unlawful. If \nthe formation or operation of these networks can be shown to harm \ncompetition, then the DOJ, FTC, or a private party could challenge \nthem. This is precisely the same rule which applies to the formation \nand operation of joint ventures in other industries in America. This \nprovision does not exempt physician networks from the law. It holds \nthem accountable for their actions, while giving them the opportunity \nto compete.\n  I again urge all of my colleagues to support the antitrust provisions \nof section 15021 of the House Medicare bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, while we are considering the manager's \namendment to S. 1357, the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act, I want to \ntake this opportunity to comment on the health provisions contained \nwithin the bill and on some of the changes made therein.\n  First of all, I know there is a great deal of consternation about the \nimpact of the reductions in spending growth for Medicare and Medicaid \ncontained within this bill.\n  Medicare and Medicaid have been tremendously successful programs by \nanyone's measure, providing life-saving and life-sustaining services to \nliterally millions of persons over the last three decades. These \nprograms need to be continued.\n  What we cannot continue, though, is the high rate of growth in these \nentitlement programs. This growth, quite simply, is contributing \nsignificantly to the deficit situation which is bankrupting our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, there is no disagreement on either of these points.\n  As I see it, the question before us today is not whether to act but, \nrather, how to act.\n  The question is not ``Why?,'' as some assert, but rather the more \ncritical ``Who, what where, when, and how?'' we bring these programs \nunder fiscal control while preserving vital services for the people who \nneed them.\n  It is clear that we are poised to act on a bill with very far-\nreaching ramifications. This is not a responsibility I take lightly.\n  Indeed, the prospect of reforming programs which have become such an \nintegral part of America's health care delivery infrastructure over the \npast 30 years is a daunting one. The implications are enormous--\nenormous for all participants in the health care system, be it patients \nor those who provide services to patients.\n  Consider how intertwined the Medicare and Medicaid programs have \nbecome with our health care delivery system.\n  A whole generation of facilities has been built based on funding from \nthe Federal Government. A whole generation of health care professionals \nhas been trained with funding from the Federal Government, with many \nacademic health institutions continuing to rely heavily upon Medicare \ngraduate medical education funds for their viability. Facilities \nproviding care to the underserved in both rural and urban areas count \non Medicare revenues to keep from closing their doors. And, coverage \npolicy in many private health care plans and our military health care \nsystem have been designed around Medicare policy.\n  Viewed from another perspective, more than a generation of Americans \nhas come to rely on the vital services provided under Medicare and \nMedicaid. This is true for our seniors and disabled who are eligible \nfor Medicare, and for the pregnant women and children, the aged, the \nblind, and the disabled who receive services under Medicaid.\n  The prospect of the reforming this system can be threatening to all I \nhave mentioned, because it represents a change, a change from the norm \nwe have all come to accept.\n  But I ask you to consider how different the America of 1995 is from \nthe America of 1965. The health care of today is very different from \nthat of 30 years ago. We have come a long way. Life expectancy has \nimproved dramatically thanks to the fruits of medical research and \ntechnology. Fee-for-service medicine is no longer the only option for \ndelivery of services.\n  But we have paid a heavy price for those improvements. Continued \nincreases in health care costs run rampant have fueled the deficit, and \nhave priced health care out of the reach of many, with a concomitant \nimpact on the Medicaid roles and the States' ability to provide \nservices.\n  I implore my colleagues to see the changes in this bill today as an \nopportunity to make the system better and more responsive to our \nnational needs, needs which extend beyond health care services to, \nindeed, the health of our country as a whole.\n  The deficit situation cannot be ignored any longer. It is unfair to \nour children, and to their parents and grandparents.\n  The alternative to change is foreboding. The costs of these \nentitlement programs is running out of sight, endangering the future \nviability of the programs as well as the Federal and State budgets. By \nall recognition, Medicare's hospitalization trust fund could go \nbankrupt, starting as early as next year. The work of the Medicare \n\n[[Page S 16077]]\nTrustees, reinforced by testimony the Finance Committee heard from the \nformer Chief Actuary of Medicare, Guy King, indicates that we will need \nat least $165 billion for the hospitalization fund alone to stave off \nbankruptcy by 2002. Payment for physician services under Medicare, \nfunded 68.5 percent from tax revenues, is rising in double digits.\n  Medicaid spending also remains troublesome.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the Federal share \nof Medicare will grow over 10 percent a year between now and 2002, \nabout three times the projected rate of inflation.\n  The changes made in S. 1357 are a good start to resolve these \nproblems.\n  For Medicare, the bill provides greater opportunity for seniors and \nthe disabled to participate in innovative coordinated care programs, \nmany offering the possibility of benefits beyond the traditional \nMedicare package such as preventive services, eyeglasses, and \nprescription drugs.\n  It is clear that the health care marketplace has been undergoing \ndramatic changes over the last several years and that further changes \nwill occur.\n  As new types of provider organizations and reimbursement practices \nhave evolved over recent years, many observers note that the \ntraditional doctor-patient relationship is being redefined.\n  There are complex and novel issues presented by the introduction of \nmany new nonphysician decisionmakers in the care of patients.\n  Tensions often are apparent between the twin goals of providing high \nquality care and providing this care at reasonable costs. That became \nevident in our consideration of S. 1357, as we struggled to make \ncertain that the bill afforded Medicare beneficiaries the opportunity \nto participate more in the medical marketplace, while still maintaining \na marketplace which allows doctors, nurses and other health care \nprofessionals to continue to practice traditional medicine.\n  There is no doubt that coordinated care offers abundant opportunities \nfor our citizens, including those who participate in the Medicare and \nMedicaid programs, to receive quality health care services in the most \ncost-effective setting.\n  On the other hand, as we enter this new era in which managed care \nbecomes the norm, it is imperative that the overriding goal be to save \nlives, not dollars.\n  What I am saying is that managed care is an important option in the \nhealth care delivery continuum, but so is traditional medicine.\n  Fee-for-service medicine must be maintained as an option for patients \nwho are more comfortable with that kind of care, as well as for \nproviders who do not wish to join the managed care environment.\n  One of the major innovations in this reconciliation bill is that it \nwill encourage the further participation of Medicare enrollees in \nmanaged care plans. A key feature of the legislation is that it allows \nindividuals to choose the type of health care delivery system which \nbest meets their needs. This bill allows American citizens, not the \nFederal Government, the freedom to make this choice.\n  I think it critical that Medicare beneficiaries be allowed to choose \nthe provider of their choice, if this is important to them. In fact, \nthe bill contains a provision I authored which will make certain that \nbeneficiaries are provided with the information they need to gauge \nwhether the Choice plan they contemplate joining allows them this \nfreedom.\n  At the same time, I do not think it is fair for the Congress to \nrequire that all plans mandate this option, since participants in \nMedicare do have flexibility under the current bill.\n  I also want to note, in turn, that health care providers will face \nindividual choices with respect to which type of health care delivery \nsystem best meets their career plans. Some will prefer a managed care \nenvironment, while others will not. They, too, must have the freedom to \nmake that choice.\n  And that freedom must not be in name only.\n  For some time, I have been concerned that we are destroying the \nincentives providers have to practice good medicine in America. \nLiability concerns, cost constraints, regulations which impede \ntechnology development, change in medical education reimbursement--all \nthese can have a stifling effect on the ability of health care \nprofessionals to be satisfied with the work environment.\n  That is one reason I was so pleased about the House inclusion of a \nmedical liability reform proposal. Medical liability reform is \nsomething I have been fighting for for some time, and I am pleased at \nthe House action.\n  We had a good deal of debate about this ``creative tension'' in the \nhealth care delivery system during development of the physician service \nnetwork (PSN) provision contained in this bill. Doctors and hospitals \nwere rightly concerned that because of time-consuming state \ncertification requirements, they would not have the ability to form \nnetworks to compete as providers under the new choice plans.\n  On the other hand, insurers were equally concerned that we not create \na system which put them on an uneven footing, by allowing certain \norganizations to escape the solvency requirements and antitrust \nrequirements in current law.\n  The challenge we face is to find the right balance between two \ncompeting interests--our intention to provide seniors with real health \ncare choices, especially in rural areas, and our interest in making \nsure that those who provide that care have the incentives to do so, but \nto do so with accountability. I am satisfied that the bill before us \nmeets these goals, but I will be monitoring its implementation \ncarefully to see that it continues to measure up.\n   The bill before us today also provides beneficiaries with the option \nof establishing medical savings accounts, something I have long \nfavored.\n  Under the proposed legislation, Medicare recipients would have new \noptions, including the choice to remain in the traditional Medicare \nprogram, enroll in a health maintenance organization or select a high-\ndeductible health insurance plan with a Medical Savings Account [MSA].\n  I support the MSA provisions in the pending bill and hope they will \nremain in the final measure as signed into law.\n  MSA's are personal, individual accounts used to pay for routine and \npreventive health care and are combined with high-deductible, \ncatastrophic health insurance that pays for major expenses. \nBeneficiaries pay all medical bills up to the deductible with the MSA \nand out-of-pocket funds. Catastrophic insurance pays all expenses above \nthe deductible.\n  Among the benefits of MSA's for seniors will be that they will have \nfirst-dollar coverage for such services as primary and preventive care, \nin contrast to Medicare, which has deductibles and copayments. Seniors \ncould use their MSA's for items not covered by Medicare, such as \neyeglasses and prescription drugs. In addition, patients would have \nincentives to make prudent choices because they would have a larger \nvoice in deciding how their health care dollars were spent.\n  Medical Savings Accounts incorporate sound economics while \nencouraging individual responsibility and choice.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out that, contrary to many reports, \nthe Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act does not cut Medicare spending. \nIt does not reduce benefits. It does not breech our contract on \nMedicare.\n  And contrary to the assertions of many, Medicare spending will \nincrease each year under this budget. It will rise from $181 billion \nthis year, to $277 billion on fiscal year 2002, a $96 billion or 53 \npercent increase. Expressed differently, Medicare benefits will \nincrease from an average of $4,800 per person this year, to $6,700 in \nfiscal year 2002, hardly a cut.\n  For Medicaid, S. 1357 allows a 5 percent rate of growth over the next \n7 years, with the program rising from $157 billion this year to about \n$220 billion in 2002. I don't believe this increase of 40 percent can \nbe termed a ``cut'', either.\n  Many of my constituents have visited with me, offering both praise \nand criticism about the provisions in this bill.\n  On a positive note, I have received much positive feedback about the \nprovisions in this bill which inject a greater measure of private \nmarket competition in Medicare. I have received warm endorsement of the \nprovisions in the bill which allow the States to tailor \n\n[[Page S 16078]]\ntheir Medicaid programs to their own individual needs. In particular, \nmany in my home state are pleased about the opportunity to work \ncooperatively together with our Governor to craft a Medicaid program \nwhich meets the needs of Utahns, not the needs of those in states \nacross the Nation.\n  I have been troubled for some time about the inflexibility of the \nMedicaid program, and the innumerable, burdensome requirements placed \non the programs at the Federal level. This has served to drive up \ncosts, as well as to hamstring innovators such as our Governor, Mike \nLeavitt, who have some wonderfully creative ideas on how to deliver \nservices in a cost-efficient manner.\n  I recall the story Governor Leavitt related to me about the Medicaid \nwaiver he was trying to submit to the Health Care Financing \nAdministration. Utah had determined that it could provide services to \nmore citizens if it restricted the dental benefit to children and adult \nemergencies. HCFA turned him down cold.\n  Later, at a briefing with my staff, HCFA said they had not turned any \nstates down on coverage requests such as this. When queried, they \nadmitted that they had told the state not even to submit the request, \nbecause it would be turned down.\n  This bureaucratic gamesmanship is a prime example of why Utah should \nnot have to seek approval from Washington of its State Medicaid plan. \nThe changes made in this bill, which will allow Utah to design its own \ncoverage program without a federal waiver--with continued coverage for \nthe aged, disabled, and pregnant women and children--are in important \nstep and a needed step.\n  That being said, I want to acknowledge openly and frankly my \nunderstanding of the tremendous unease the prospects of major change \ncast upon our citizenry.\n  This is a natural reaction to change.\n  I make the pledge that if we receive evidence that these reforms are \nnot working, I will do everything I can to seek an immediate \nlegislative solution in this Chamber.\n  I want to make that perfectly clear.\n  I, too, am not completely satisfied with each and every provision, as \nI will discuss in a moment. I am hopeful that in the conference we can \nimprove these provisions.\n  But first of all, I want to discuss how the changes in this bill \naffect Native Americans. This is a subject in which I have a great \ninterest.\n\n\n                            NATIVE AMERICANS\n\n  Mr. President, I am especially pleased that the pending legislation \ncontains needed provisions, which I sponsored in the Finance Committee, \nrelating to the impact of Medicare and Medicaid reform on Native \nAmericans.\n  As we debate this important legislation, I want to be sure that we do \nnot lose sight of how these reforms will affect Indian Country.\n  And, I would point out to my colleagues that Congress has recognized \nthe severely depressed health conditions existing among Native \nAmericans. But there is a need to do more.\n  The current health status of Native Americans and Alaska Natives \nremains disproportionately low compared to the rest of the population. \nThe Native American (IHS Service Area) age-adjusted mortality rates \nremain considerably higher than for the rest of the U.S. population.\n  Between 1989 and 1991 the mortality rates for Native Americans were \n440 percent greater for tuberculosis; 430 percent greater for \nalcoholism; 165 percent greater for accidents; 154 percent greater for \ndiabetes mellitus; and 46 percent greater for pneumonia and influenza.\n  These rates are simply unacceptable. The bottom line is this: per \ncapita spending for Indian health care is approximately one-half that \nof the national average. In 1992, the U.S. National Health Expenditures \nper capita was $3,155 compared with an IHS Health Expenditures per \ncapita of $1,489.\n  The Native American provisions contained in this bill serve to \nreaffirm our Nation's commitment with respect to Medicare and Medicaid \nreimbursement for Indian Health Service programs.\n  In effect, these provisions will help ensure that Indian health care \ncontinues to improve even as the Medicare and Medicaid programs undergo \nreform. Given the limited budget within which the Indian Health Service \n(IHS) and tribes must operate their health care programs, third-party \nincome such as Medicare and Medicaid collections allow the IHS to \nsupplement their already limited Federal appropriation.\n\n  The IHS estimates that it will collect $54,250,000 in Medicare and \n$120,750,000 in Medicaid reimbursements in fiscal year 1995. These \ncollections allow the IHS and tribal programs to improve the conditions \nof their facilities and free-up financial resources to provide critical \nhealth care services which they could not otherwise provide.\n  In fiscal year 1995, Medicaid funds were used to pay the salaries and \nbenefits for 1,379 FTEs. These staff positions include physicians, \nnurses, pharmacists, lab technicians, and support staff. The loss of \nMedicaid funds would mean that these health care providers would have \nto be laid off due to a lack of money to pay salaries and benefits.\n  The impact of the loss of this money would be tremendous because \nthese funds supplement direct clinical care to Native Americans and \nAlaska Natives. It would result in the closure of critical inpatient \nservices in some of the most remote parts of the country. The outcome \nwould be truly devastating to the already poor health status of Native \nAmericans.\n  Under existing law, IHS facilities like other health care providers \nare eligible to receive Medicaid and Medicare payments for services \nprovided to eligible Indians. The provisions I sponsored will ensure \nthat these arrangements remain in place in the new world of reformed \nMedicaid.\n  In addition, my language expands coverage to tribally owned and \noperated health care facilities as well as urban Indian organizations \nthat serve Medicaid eligible Indian patients.\n  Approximately 1.4 million Native Americans receive health care \nservices from the IHS and from Indian owned and operated health care \nfacilities.\n  In an effort to address the poor health conditions of Native \nAmericans and because of the fact that Indian health programs are \nalmost entirely dependent upon Federal appropriations, Congress made \ntwo exceptions to allow the IHS and tribal health facilities to \nparticipate in the Medicare program and use their reimbursements to \nimprove facility conditions.\n  First, Congress made an exception to the general ban against payments \nto Federal providers of services for IHS and tribal health providers \npursuant to Section 401 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and \nSection 1880 of the Social Security Act.\n  Second, Congress made an exception to the requirement that the IHS \nand tribal health facilities meet all of the conditions and \nrequirements for participation in the Medicare program, as long as \nthose facilities provided the Secretary with a plan for achieving \ncompliance.\n  Pursuant to Section 1880 of the Social Security Act, hospitals and \nskilled nursing facilities owned by the IHS may receive reimbursement \nfrom Medicare for services provided to eligible Indians.\n  Pursuant to Section 1861(aa)(4)(D) of the Social Security Act \noutpatient facilities that are owned by the IHS are eligible to be \nFederally Qualified Health Centers and participate in the Medicare \nprogram but only if those facilities are operated by tribes or tribal \norganizations under the Indian Self-Determination and Education \nAssistance Act, or by urban Indian organizations.\n  Tribally-owned health care facilities are able to participate in the \nMedicare program subject to the same conditions and requirements as any \nother provider in the State in which those facilities are located.\n  As this bill moves through the legislative process, I hope these \nprovisions can be maintained, because I believe we should do all we can \nto enhance the level of health care provided to Native Americans \nthrough the Medicare and Medicaid programs. I thank my colleagues on \nthe Finance Committee and the Committee on Indian Affairs for their \nsupport and assistance in developing these important provisions.\n  Another issue in which I have a great interest is the Federal effort \nto prevent health care fraud.\n\n\n                            FRAUD AND ABUSE\n\n  The problem of health care fraud and abuse is certainly one of the \nmost troubling aspects in our Nation's health care delivery system. By \nmost estimates, the costs of health care in the \n\n[[Page S 16079]]\nUnited States approach $1 trillion annually. By the turn of the \ncentury, the figure will exceed $1.5 trillion annually, consuming up to \n16 percent of the Nation's gross domestic product.\n  Even by most conservative estimates, billions of dollars are lost to \nwaste, fraud and abuse. Health insurance experts, the FBI and other \nagencies agree that fraud and abuse account for as mush as 5 to 10 \npercent of total health care expenditures. As much as $27 billion \ntaxpayer dollars are lost to fraud and abuse in the Medicare and \nMedicaid programs. These losses are clearly not insignificant.\n  Clearly, the Federal Government must take steps to put a halt to the \ndeliberate and unscrupulous act of defrauding individuals, health care \nproviders, and State and Federal Governments in the provision of health \ncare.\n  The anti-fraud and abuse provisions contained in this legislation \nessentially represent the provisions contained in S. 1088, which was \ndeveloped by our colleague from Maine, Senator Cohen.\n  I am extremely pleased that the final compromise addressed my \nconcerns about provisions in S. 1088 which would have authorized the \nuse of health care fraud related fines and penalties to finance \ninvestigative and enforcement efforts of the HHS IG's Office and \nefforts at the Justice Department.\n  I have long opposed this so-called bounty hunter provision, as I \nstrongly feel it would create an incentive for Federal investigators to \nforgo prosecution or exclusion where warranted in favor of large civil \npenalties that would provide additional funding for investigators.\n  Under the new language as contained in the bill, all penalties, fines \nand damages collected will be deposited into the Medicare trust fund. \nUnder this arrangement, the original purpose to strengthen the \nfinancial solvency of the Medicare program is further achieved. I \nstrongly believe this approach serves to address my concerns as well as \nensuring the integrity of the anti-fraud and abuse provisions.\n  I do have remaining concerns, which I will work to address in \nconference.\n  First, I would note that the bill does not uniformly punish those who \nwould attempt to defraud a health care plan or provider or those who \nwould conspire with others to do so. Nor does it appear to criminalize \nattempts or conspiracies to embezzle.\n  I think it is vitally important that those who conspire with others \nto cheat our health care plans should be punished to the full extent of \nthe law. Otherwise, a conspiracy to defraud or embezzle will be \nuncovered before the crime is actually completed. Those situations \nshould be addressed by this statute.\n  Second, while we provide for the forfeiture of property, real or \npersonal of persons convicted of health care fraud, it is unclear \nwhether the bill would also permit the forfeiture of the fraudulently \nobtained proceeds. While it is certainly important to obtain \nfraudulently obtained property, it is even more vital to divest \ncriminals of their unlawfully obtained proceeds. We must be careful to \ncraft legislation that will destroy the financial incentive for \ncriminals to abuse our health care system.\n  In the same vein, the bill only permits forfeiture of property from \npersons actually convicted of a crime. Thus, if someone perpetuates a \nfraud against a health care plan or provider, and then flees outside \nthe jurisdiction of the United States, it may be difficult to obtain \ntheir ill-gotten gains remaining in this country unless we permit the \ngovernment to bring a civil forfeiture action.\n  Civil forfeiture must be available even if a conviction cannot be \nobtained. This is an important, complex issue. Indeed, I am currently \nworking on legislation that would affect forfeiture law, and want to be \nable to craft responsible language.\n  I also have several technical concerns with the fraud and abuse \nprovisions. For example, section 7141 punishes those who commit health \ncare fraud with a maximum 10-year penalty. If serious bodily injury \nresults, the criminal can be punished for any term of years.\n  Unfortunately, the statute does not appear to address a crime leading \nto someone's death. Serious bodily injury is not defined to include \ndeath, so the possibility of a death occurring as a result of the crime \nmust be taken into account.\n  Finally, we need to ensure that this bill does not improperly extend \nFederal criminal jurisdiction and that it conforms to accepted \ninvestigative demand procedures. In light of the Lopez decision issued \nby the Supreme Court last term, we must be careful to draft legislation \nthat contains the proper legislative nexus to the Constitution's \ncommerce clause. We must put an end to the days of federalizing crime \nwithout giving any thought to the legitimate prosecutorial interests of \nthe States.\n\n  We must also guarantee that appropriate, established, investigative \ndemand procedures are followed. The administrative subpoena is a \npowerful tool that should not be used unless accepted procedures are \nfollowed.\n  In addition, I have continuing concerns about the provisions relating \nto the anti-kickback statute. I have been concerned about the discount \nexception to the statute as currently interpreted, and the discount \nsafe harbor regulation which is, in effect, impeding the implementation \nof commercially reasonable and non-abusive marketing practices.\n  One such practice is the combining for discount purposes of various \nproducts and/or services supplied by a company to a provider. Another \nexample involves the provision of discounts based upon the volume \npurchased during a fixed time period.\n  Hospitals and health plans purchase medical devices, pharmaceutical \nproducts and other health care products and services from one \nmanufacturer, and thereby receive a percentage price discount on the \ntotal products purchased. The discount is allocated on a flat across-\nthe-board basis for all products. Similarly, hospitals and health plans \nroutinely purchase all products used for treatment of a particular \ndisease from a supplier, at a fixed rate for all products.\n  In addition, manufacturers want to be certain that they can lawfully \nbundle products into a single procedure kit which contains all items \nneeded to perform a specific procedure or treatment, and to offer the \nkit for purchase at a discount. Without the discount exceptions, such \narrangements can be construed as a sale of one product tied to another \nand, therefore, a kickback under Medicare law, even when practiced \nlawfully in the treatment of patients.\n  These arrangements are appropriate and create no potential for abuse \nso long as there is adequate disclosure of the financial parameters of \nthese arrangements so that the Medicare and State health care programs \nare able to ascertain cost data for purposes of revising payment rates \nand are able to evaluate the impact of these arrangements.\n  While these arrangements may differ from pure time-of-sale price \ndiscounts on a single item or service, they are appropriate in the \ncurrent health care environment.\n  Discount arrangements are, in fact, commonplace in the private sector \nand have resulted in substantial savings to hospitals, managed care \ncompanies and, most importantly, consumers.\n  Unfortunately, current Medicare law is vague in this area and implies \npotential illegality of certain innovative purchasing practices common \nin the private sector. These types of purchasing arrangements enable \nhospitals and managed care companies to purchase medical supplies and \ndrugs at a discount when they are sold as a package or in volume.\n  The success of Medicare reform relies heavily on the ability of \nhealth plans to replicate successful private sector practices--\nincluding innovative arrangements between providers and drug and device \nmanufacturers that result in savings to beneficiaries and ultimately to \nthe Medicare trust fund.\n  Accordingly, it is my desire to clarify that these innovative \npurchasing arrangements are allowable under the existing Medicare \nantikickback rules. Although we have made some progress in this respect \nin the bill as reported by the Finance Committee, it is my desire to \npursue clarifications in all these areas as the bill moves forward.\n\n\n                         CHIROPRACTIC SERVICES\n\n  During consideration of the reconciliation bill an the Finance \nCommittee, I offered an amendment to allow chiropractors to practice \ntheir profession \n\n[[Page S 16080]]\nunder Medicare to the full extent of the scope of practice permitted \nunder State law. The Committee agreed to accept this amendment subject \nto working out the financing provisions with the Congressional Budget \nOffice. However, due to the press of business, it has not yet been \npossible to complete the task of fine tuning a mechanism that would \nachieve this goal without significantly increasing the cost to the \nMedicare program.\n  This is unfortunate because I believe that the time is ripe to \ndiscard the antiquated restrictions on chiropractors that permeate \ncurrent law. Today, chiropractic is recognized by the medical \nprofession, and, indeed, a recent government report concluded that \nchiropractic treatment is among the most effective for the treatment of \ncertain type of ailments. Many of us in this Chamber did not need a \ngovernment study to tell us what we already know.\n  I am committed to work with my colleagues on the Finance Committee to \neffectuate a change in the limitations on chiropractors. I believe--and \nI am confident that a majority of my colleagues both on the Finance \nCommittee and in this chamber agree with me--that chiropractors should \nbe allowed to be reimbursed under Medicare as long as the service they \nprovided is an existing covered service, and that they are operating \nwithin the scope of their license as defined by State law.\n\n\n                    ORTHOTIC AND PROSTHETIC SERVICES\n\n  I wanted to take this opportunity to mention another amendment I \nauthored in Finance Committee, which was approved but later dropped \nbecause we could not find a suitable offset. That amendment would have \nallowed a 1 percent update in the reimbursement rate for orthotics and \nprosthetics providers, in particular for artificial limbs and braces.\n  Orthotics and prosthetics providers design, fit and fabricate custom \northopedic braces and artificial limbs for a wide variety of persons \nwith physical disabilities.\n  I understand that the O fee schedule has been frozen for a number \nof years, resulting in only a 1 percent update factor per year since \n1985. The bill freezes the update.\n  I am sympathetic to concerns which have been raised about the growth \nin reimbursement for this industry, and I would only note that this is \na highly specialized segment of the health care industry; where \nutilization controls should not be an issue. In addition, while the \nCongressional Budget Office cites large growth in O since 1990, part \nof this growth is due to parenteral and enteral nutrition [PEN], \nurological supplies and other non-custom devices which would have not \nbeen covered by my amendment.\n  I am hopeful that the final bill can include the one percent update.\n\n\n                          ABSTINENCE EDUCATION\n\n  Providing education to young adults about the value of abstinence is \nextremely important and I applaud the effort that this bill makes in \nthis area. Many of us share the belief that abstinence is the best and \nhealthiest method for our young people to avoid the risks associated \nwith early sexual activity--dangers that have both physical and \npsychological manifestations.\n  I am concerned, however, that the language defining abstinence \neducation in section 7445 of S. 1357 may be interpreted by some as \nbeing so restrictive that some excellent abstinence-based programs, \nincluding some programs operating in my state, would not be eligible \nfor funding. This issue turns on the interpretation of the term \nexclusive purpose in section 7445(c)(5)(A) and whether this will be \nread as encompassing programs, such as operated by the Community of \nCaring in Utah, for which abstinence is a primary goal. This program \nexists in 50 schools in Utah and has been successful in achieving \nabstinence by teaching and reinforcing it within the values of caring, \nrespect, responsibility, trust and family. I would hope that a family \nvalues-based program this effective would not be excluded from funding.\n\n\n                       PRESCRIPTION DRUG REBATES\n\n  Many of us opposed the Medicaid drug rebate program when it was first \nenacted in 1990, although I recognize that it has provided a valuable \nsource of revenue for financially strapped State Medicaid programs. The \ntheory behind this program is that it would constrain the costs of \npharmaceuticals by guaranteeing State Medicaid programs the best price.\n  Because of the growing move toward Medicaid managed care, with its \ninherent cost containment strategies, the importance of the rebate \nprogram is now overstated.\n  I have been concerned that rebates are anticompetitive and constrain \nthe ability of hospitals, HMOs, and other private sector purchasers of \nprescription drugs to negotiate discounts from pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers. In addition, overly high rebates can act as a \ndisincentive to provider participation in Medicaid, as well as to the \npharmaceutical research and development necessary to foster \nbreakthrough drug products.\n  Under the current Medicaid program, states receive a manufacturer's \nbest price for a drug, plus an additional rebate reflecting any \ndifferences between price increases and inflation--as measured by the \nConsumer Price Index. Under the original Finance bill, the Federal \nrebate program would have been retained for 3 years, after which the \nStates could choose whether to implement programs on their own. An \namendment adopted in committee removed that sunset.\n  I believe it is important to clarify what was intended by an \namendment that I offered at the Senate Finance Committee on the topic \nof prescription drug rebates.\n  Currently, several States require rebates from prescription drug \nmanufacturers over and above what is required under the Federal \nMedicaid program. The bill that we will ultimately send to the \nPresident will also be likely to retain the authority for States to \ncontinue to collect rebates. My personal belief, and I think that most \nof my colleagues on Finance would concur, is that this authority should \nbe along the lines of the original Finance Committee bill which \nincluded a transition period of 3 years allotted to States to integrate \ndrug rebate programs into their overall health care programs.\n  At the Finance Committee there was discussion as to whether the \nlanguage adopted would preclude States that choose to opt out of the \nMedigrant Program from collecting supplemental or additional rebates on \ntop of the rebate amount authorized under the program. The Senate \nFinance Committee voted that States would be precluded from collecting \nunlimited rebates. At the committee level the point was made that the \npharmaceutical industry is expected to spend about $15 billion on \nresearch and development in 1995 alone. States may choose to opt out of \nthe drug rebate program but will be prohibited from collecting \nunlimited rebates from this research and development-intensive \nindustry.\n\n\n                               FDA EXPORT\n\n  I was pleased to learn this morning that the House adopted as part of \nits reconciliation bill legislation I authored with Representative Fred \nUpton and Senator Judd Gregg (H.R. 1300/S. 597) a bill which would \ndramatically expand export opportunities abroad for American \nmanufacturers of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. That bill, the \nFDA Export Reform and Enhancement Act of 1995, will both create jobs in \nthe United States, as well as provide incentives for us to enhance our \ntechnological capacity to develop new medical products.\n  I intend to work concertedly to ensure that this provision becomes \nlaw, and I commend my colleagues in the House, especially \nRepresentative Upton, for their work in this area.\n\n\n             REIMBURSEMENT FOR EXPERIMENTAL MEDICAL DEVICES\n\n  On June 22, 1995, Senators Gregg, Frist, Kennedy, Kassebaum, Grams, \nWellstone, Chafee, Hutchison, D'Amato and I introduced the Medical \nDevices Access Assurance Act of 1995. A companion measure, H.R. 1744, \nwas introduced in the House by Chairman Bill Thomas, the first in \nCongress to step forward in this area.\n  This legislation addresses two serious threats to our health care \nsystem: restricted access for our senior citizens to the most advanced \nexperimental medical technologies and our country's loss of clinical \nresearch activities to overseas facilities. This bill helps harmonize \nour reimbursement policies for experimental medical devices with those \ngoverning payment for experimental drugs. This is good policy that is \nfair and advances the public health. \n\n[[Page S 16081]]\n\n  Because of ``Byrd rule'' considerations we are not able to pursue \nthis matter in the bill today, even though the measure is included in \nthe House-passed bill. It is my intention to pursue this legislation \nvigorously throughout the remainder of this congressional term, either \nas part of the reconciliation bill, or on the Medicare/Medicaid \ntechnicals bill which I understand the Chairman intends to consider \nlater this year.\n\n\n                             OXYGEN THERAPY\n\n  As part of the Medicare reform legislation, the Finance Committee \nreported a 40 percent reduction of the home oxygen benefit payment. In \ncontrast, the House Ways and Means Committee reported a 20 percent \nreduction.\n  While I recognize that these provisions, to a certain extent, mirror \nHealth Care Financing Administration efforts under an inherent \nreasonableness proceedings, nevertheless I am concerned about the \nimpact of such a significant reduction on patients in Utah who require \na higher level of service, particularly those patients in rural or \nremote areas of the State.\n  In addition, I have met with numerous small home oxygen providers who \nbelieve that with their slim profit margins they cannot possibly \nsustain a 40 percent payment reduction. And for many patients, the \nsmall provider may be the only nearby source of home oxygen therapy.\n  As the legislative process moves forward, I hope that we can \nreexamine this proposal.\n\n\n                              HOSPICE CARE\n\n  I would also like to mention my deep interest in making sure that \nFederal support for hospice care remains as strong as possible.\n  Hospice care provides palliative care for terminally ill individuals \nwith a life expectancy of 6 months or less if the terminal illness runs \nits normal course. Specifically, hospice care provides relief of pain \nand uncomfortable symptoms through a specially qualified \ninterdisciplinary group of medical, psychosocial and spiritual \nprofessionals. Besides being certified as terminally ill, an individual \nmust be entitled to part A of Medicare in order to be eligible to elect \nhospice care under Medicare. Under the Medicare hospice benefits, a \nterminally ill individual can receive comprehensive high-quality care \nat a lower cost.\n  While I recognize the need to hold back the growth in spending for \nall components of the Medicare program, I am concerned that the \neffective and efficient service of hospice care currently available to \nMedicare beneficiaries may be compromised by the proposed 2.5 percent \nbudget reduction.\n  Hospice care is in effect comprehensive managed care for a \nspecialized population, the terminally ill, since the current Medicare \nhospice benefit is reimbursed on a fixed, all-inclusive per diem basis.\n  As a recent Lewin-VHI study indicated, ``efforts to control Medicare \nexpenditures [that] discourage hospice providers from offering their \nservices to Medicare beneficiaries, Medicare expenditures would likely \nincrease.'' We must monitor this situation closely to assure that the \nbenefits of hospice care are not undermined by this proposal.\n  In addition, I also think we need to clarify how the hospice benefit \nwill interact with the managed care opportunities provided in both the \nHouse and Senate bills. The House language is explicit in stating that \nMedicare contractors will assume full financial liability for services \nother than hospice care. The Senate language is silent on this point \nand I am hopeful this can be addressed in conference.\n\n\n                            HOME HEALTH CARE\n\n  I am also concerned about the impact of this legislation on the \nprovision of home health care.\n  As my colleagues are aware, home health has long been a personal \npriority of mine. I have seen time after time how gratified Utah \nfamilies are to be able to care for their loved ones in the home. This \ncompassionate, caring alternative to institutionalization can make all \nthe difference in the lives of those who are ill.\n  At the same time, I recognize that the rapid growth of these services \nin recent years attests to the fact that patients prefer home health \ncare over traditional institutional care.\n  I have had the opportunity to talk to patients and their families who \nreceive these services. Almost without exception the family setting \nenhances the patients morale and serves as a positive influence in \nspeeding recovery or sustaining the critical nature of an illness.\n  Accordingly, as we reform Medicare we should be careful not to limit \naccess artificially.\n  The legislation before us today proposes significant changes to the \nhome health care industry. One provision will require that home health \ncare services be paid on a prospective pay system. This is something I \nhave favored for a long time; I think this provision will serve to \naddress concerns regarding costs as well as to promote cost efficiency \nand effectiveness among providers without compromising the quality of \ncare.\n  While I support the enactment of a PPS for home health, I do have \nconcerns about some of the provisions contained in the Senate and House \nproposals which could have unintended consequences of erecting barriers \nto care for several categories of the elderly.\n  For instance, the greatest deficiency in the respective House and \nSenate plans, and one which will cause the greatest financial hardship \nto agencies as well as impact on patients, is the treatment of extended \ncare/outlier cases; that is, patients who require more than 120 days of \ncare.\n  According to some industry sources who have contacted me, as much as \n30 percent of the national caseload falls into this category. The \ndiscrepancy between the per episode cap--based on the average regional \ncost of providing 120 days of care--and the per agency limit based on \n165 days of care--must be addressed and eliminated.\n  If the episode cap is limited to 120 days, then additional payments, \nwhere warranted and approved by the fiscal intermediary, should begin \non day 121. Or, alternatively, the per episode cap should be based on \nthe regional average costs of providing 165 days of care.\n  The financial impact on providers of the discrepancy is obvious. The \nimpact on patients is no less obvious. In the first place, the plan \neffectively--albeit certainly unintentionally--discriminates against \npatients with certain medical needs and conditions. While Medicare will \npay providers the full cost of furnishing care to some patients whose \nneeds fall within the arbitrarily day limits, it will pay for only part \nof the care for patients who are either more acutely ill or have \nchronic conditions.\n  Additionally, it is reasonable to assume that agencies with large \ncaseloads of patients needing care beyond 120 days--but less than 165--\ncannot long operate under this system. The logical result will be \nlimited access to care in some areas as agencies close.\n  With respect to the home health market basket updates, payment rates \nshould be based on actual reasonable costs. The provision which would \nadjust payments by the home health market basket minus 2 percent is \nclearly unreasonable. Per visit payment directly affects per episode \nlimits, so the limitation has a compounded effect.\n  Also punitive, particularly in light of the 45-day window of \nvulnerability/discrepancy, is the limitation of the savings share to 5 \npercent of an agency's aggregate Medicare patients. I think this is \nsomething we may need to examine, especially since the limitation \nserves as a disincentive to bring overall costs to a level that will \nyield savings greater than 5 percent.\n  The limitation could ultimately hurt the Medicare program, whose \nlevel of savings would increase if real incentives were in place for \nhome health agencies to work to produce saving beyond the 5 percent \nlimit.\n  Another issue regards the break in care between a particular illness \nor episode. Any required break in the delivery of home health services \nbefore a new episode can begin would, by definition, be arbitrary. A \n60-day break seems to be unnecessarily long, given the nature of the \nMedicare home health care population. I think that 45 days might be \nmore reasonable.\n  Another question I have about our proposal is that it leaves open the \nquestion of what responsibility, if any, a home health agency would \ncarry for a patient who is discharged--for example at 120 days--and \nthen who needs services for another condition 50 days later. This issue \nneeds to be clarified. If patients cannot receive the care they \n\n[[Page S 16082]]\nneed through home health, it is reasonable to assume they will obtain \nit in a more costly institutional setting.\n  Finally, I note that the House bill extends the waiver provision \nuntil the implementation of the PPS system on October 1, 1996. I hope \nthis is something we can reexamine.\n\n\n                           CHILDREN'S HEALTH\n\n  Nothing can be more important to our future than the health of our \nchildren. Too often that fact is left out of our debate on entitlement \nprograms.\n  This debate has underscored that there is obvious disagreement over \nwhether Medicaid should remain an entitlement, but I am certain there \nis no disagreement that children should be a primary focus no matter \nhow we reform Medicaid.\n  In particular, children with special health care needs--those with \nserious chronic conditions or disabilities such as those with cerebral \npalsy, cystic fibrosis, cancer or heart conditions--are fortunately \nvery small in number. In fact, they represent only 2 percent of all \nchildren. But, it will take special attention to make sure their needs \nare being met.\n  For example, managed care can offer these children and their families \nbetter access to care and better coordination of services, but--as the \nmanaged care industry's own National Committee on Quality Assurance has \nrecognized--managed care has little experience with children with \nspecial needs.\n  The bill we have before us today contains an amendment which would \nhave States outline in their plans how they will serve children, and in \nparticular, how they will serve children with special health care \nneeds. While I am certain the Governors will devote appropriate \nattention to children with special needs, I think that outlining how \nthis will be accomplished in the State plans will give us all the peace \nof mind that these very vulnerable children will not fall through the \ncracks.\n  In addition, the bill contains a provision I coauthored with Sen. \nGraham to clarify that States are required within their Medigrant plans \nto describe the methodology to be used to continue disproportionate \nshare payments to hospitals. An explicit methodology is important for \nhospitals such as Primary Children's in Salt Lake City, which receives \n7 percent of its Medicaid revenues from disproportionate share \npayments.\n\n\n                             NURSING HOMES\n\n  One of the reasons I have introduced S. 1177, the Quality Care for \nLife Act, is that I firmly believe we need to adopt a national policy \nfor long-term care. That policy need not be a Federal-only solution. \nIndeed, any plan to provide comprehensive long-term care services for \nAmericans citizens must embrace a mix of private and public solutions, \nincluding incentives for long-term care insurance development.\n  There are 17,000 nursing homes in this country, who serve 1.7 million \nresidents. The care of two-thirds of these residents, some 1.13 \nmillion, is paid by Medicaid, and the care of 100,000 is paid by \nMedicare.\n  The impact of this bill on the provision of long-term care services \nis immeasurable, since we are reforming the Medicaid system which \nprovides a good deal of the long-term care services in this country, as \nwell as making substantial changes to Medicare reimbursement for \nskilled nursing facilities [SNF's].\n  There is no doubt that savings from SNF reimbursement should be \nincluded in a reconciliation bill; I think that all involved --\nproviders, patients, and policymakers--recognize that fact. However, I \nhave had some concerns about the way the provisions were crafted in the \nproposal that we considered in Finance Committee.\n  I have very much appreciated the willingness of Chairman Roth, and \nhis most capable staff, to work with me to address my concerns.\n  Two weeks ago, I received a letter from 28 organizations, \nrepresenting a broad spectrum of companies and health professionals \nproviding care to 1 million Medicare beneficiaries. These \norganizations, which include nursing homes, subacute facilities, \nancillary service providers and health care professionals serving \nnursing home patients, were opposed to the committee proposal which \nwould have established a flat, per-stay reimbursement rate for all \nancillary services based on a blend of a facility-specific and a \nnational average rate.\n  The basis of concern was that the move toward a national average \ncould cause wide shifts in reimbursement, which could jeopardize \npatient care especially for those with severe illnesses. In addition, \nthe funding mechanism could jeopardize the trend toward using subacute \ncare as a cost effective alternative to hospital care.\n  I also think that, despite the Health Care Financing Administration's \nlack of priority in developing a prospective payment system for SNF's, \nthere is consensus that future payment must be made on a prospective \nbasis. The only practical solution to the funding problem for nursing \nhomes under the fee-for-service sector of the Medicare Program is to \nimplement a prospective payment system that contains the necessary cost \ncontainment incentives. This will take some time to develop. Under the \nmost rosy scenario, such a PPS system could not be implemented before \nOctober 1, 1997.\n  To me, the goals in developing a SNF reimbursement proposal should be \ntwofold. We must make certain that any proposal we approve maintains \nappropriate incentives for high quality services. At the same time, it \nmust also provide reimbursement in the most equitable way, especially \nduring the transition period as we move to a PPS system.\n  The key to designing a new system is to get a handle, not only on the \nprice the Medicare Program is paying for the nursing home service \npackage, but also on the amount of services provided in the coverage \npackage. Control over the latter can only be accomplished by paying \nSNF's prospectively on a per episode, per case, or per spell of illness \nbasis--as opposed to the per diem or per day approach that has been \ntraditionally employed in the nursing home industry.\n  Faced with prospective per episode payments, skilled nursing \nfacilities will be able to economize on the amount of services provided \nduring each Medicare covered stay by adjusting the intensity of \nservices provided during each day of the patient's stay in the facility \nand by making sure that the Medicare covered stay is no longer than \nnecessary. Of course, other mechanisms outside of the payment system \nmust be relied upon to control the number of Medicare covered \nadmissions, but I expect we will be addressing these concerns through \ncontrols on coverage decisions, shifts to managed care, and \nmodifications in eligibility rules.\n  These prospective episodic payments should cover all of the \nreasonable costs that skilled nursing facilities incur when providing \nMedicare covered services, including both operating costs (both routine \nand non-routine) and property costs. The prospective episodic payments \nunder this system are intended to cover the entire cost of services \nprovided during the period of Medicare part A coverage. This means that \nthe payments are to cover both part A and part B services that are \nprovided to the patients during their Medicare part A covered stays.\n  Additionally, the prospective episodic payments need not be the same \nfor all patients in all facilities. For example, the prospective \npayments should be case-mix sensitive so that patients with varying \nservice needs are associated with varying levels of payments. Skilled \nnursing facilities operating in different labor markets also should \nhave their prospective payment schedules adjusted to account for these \nmarket differences. Finally, special consideration should be given to \nthe prospective payments for patients in skilled nursing facilities \nwith very low volumes of Medicare activity so as to preserve the access \nto SNF services that these providers afford. This can be done either by \npreserving the current low volume prospective per diem Medicare SNF \npayment system or by adjusting the prospective episodic payment levels \nfor these facilities to recognize their higher costs of operation. No \npayment adjustments should be authorized other than those just \ndescribed.\n  With this kind of approach to prospective Medicare SNF payment, we \ncan expect to finally get a handle on one of the most rapidly expanding \nsectors of the Medicare Program.\n  I am extremely appreciative of the efforts that Senator Roth and his \nstaff have made to work with me to address \n\n[[Page S 16083]]\nconcerns I have had about the SNF provisions in the bill.\n  There is one other SNF issue I wish to address. The Finance Committee \namendment we considered today differed somewhat from an earlier draft I \nreviewed with respect to section 7037. In the previous draft, the \nlanguage made it clear that the Secretary of HHS should establish \nsalary equivalency limits based on ``recent and accurate data relevant \nto the specific types of therapists and providers, subject to the \nsalary guidelines.'' This language also specified that the existing \nguidelines for physical therapy and respiratory therapy would be \nupdated to conform to that guidance. As my colleagues may be aware, the \ncurrent guidelines for physical therapy and respiratory therapy are \nbased on 1981 data and they are outdated.\n  This language was not included in the draft of this morning. I am \nhopeful that we can work to clarify this section during conference to \nmake certain that the Secretary shall use accurate, timely, and \nrelevant data in developing occupational therapy and speech language \npathology guidelines and to assure that the Secretary will rebase the \nexisting guidelines for physical therapy and respiratory therapy based \nupon timely, accurate, and relevant data.\n\n\n                         CLINICAL LABORATORIES\n\n  Another provision about which I have some concern is the provision on \nreimbursement of clinical labs contained within this bill. I have no \nobjection to reducing the level of spending under this category, and I \nam very appreciative of the fact that the bill does not contain the \nunwise proposal from 1993 to impose a copayment on lab services.\n  In committee, I had suggested a provision similar to the Ways and \nMeans bill which would only freeze updates for lab payments and include \nmuch-needed administrative simplifications which could provide \nefficiency and cost-effectiveness in the delivery of lab services, a \nkey regulatory reform goal of this Congress.\n  We were not able to work out the scoring on this proposal, but I am \nhopeful the issue of lab reimbursement, and especially administrative \nsimplification, can be reexamined in conference.\n\n\n                   FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS\n\n  During Finance consideration of this bill, the committee adopted \nwithout objection a provision I authored with Senators Chafee and \nGrassley which would allocate one percent of Federal Medicaid spending \nfor the preservation of what I believe is really the Nation's primary \ncare infrastructure--community health centers and rural health clinics. \nSince the bill rewrites title IX of the Social Security Act, Medicaid, \nit eliminates the cost-based reimbursement they would have received \nunder Medicaid as Federally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs).\n  Let me make perfectly clear that I am extremely sensitive to the \nconcerns that our Nation's Governors' have raised about using a \nMedicaid set-aside as a funding source for this amendment; I want to \nwork to address these concerns as the process moves forward.\n  Under our amendment, one half of the amount allocated would be used \nfor payments to community health centers, and the other half for rural \nhealth clinics. The Secretary of HHS would determine the methodology \nfor determining payments to these centers and would make payments \ndirectly to the centers. Payments made to centers by the Secretary \nwould be in addition to any other revenues the centers receive from \nMedicaid, either directly from States or from managed care plans.\n  Mr. President, over 1000 community health centers and 2500 rural \nhealth clinics play a unique role in the health care system. In inner-\ncity areas, community health centers are often the only providers of \ncare to Medicaid patients and the uninsured. In rural areas, community \nhealth centers and rural health clinics are often the only providers \nfor the residents of the area, whether they are on Medicaid or \nMedicare, have private insurance, or are uninsured.\n  Community health centers and rural health clinics serve over 16 \npercent of Medicaid patients nationwide. My colleagues might be \nsurprised to know that 36 percent of community health center patients \nare on Medicaid; 44 percent are uninsured; 8 percent are on Medicare; \nand 12 percent have private insurance.\n  For rural health clinics, 27.7 percent of the patients are on \nMedicaid; 29.4 percent are on Medicare; 14.4 percent are uninsured; and \n28.5 percent have private insurance.\n  The current Medicaid Program recognizes the unique role of these \ncenters, and provides them with cost-based reimbursement, in order to \nassure that the payments are sufficient to meet the health care needs \nof Medicaid patients they serve.\n  Unlike providers with large numbers of privately insured patients, \nthese centers do not have reserves or available capital, and do not \nhave the ability to cost-shift losses from insufficient payments under \npublic programs.\n  Under many current Medicaid managed care programs, these centers have \nnot received sufficient payments from managed care plans to meet their \ncosts of caring from Medicaid patients.\n  Some of my colleagues may ask why these centers need special \nconsideration. A major reason is that many will be forced to close \ntheir doors or reduce services if their reimbursement is not \nmaintained.\n  Centers are committed to serve all in their communities. Without a \nsufficient flow of funds to meet the needs of their Medicaid patients, \ncenters will be forced to substantially reduce their patient loads, and \nmany will go out of business. Other providers will not enter these \nunderserved communities because the economic base will not support \nthem, and the community will be left with no remaining health care \ninfrastructure.\n  Another reason is that Medicaid patients (particularly those seen by \ncenters) often are more difficult to treat than the privately insured \npatient enrolled in a managed care plan because Medicaid health center \npatients have more serious health conditions and poorer overall \nindicators of health status.\n  In addition to traditional medical services, centers provide other \nservices (such as outreach, transportation, health education, and \ntranslation) which enable Medicaid patients to better utilize care and \ncomply with medical direction. These services are not generally \nincluded in a capitated payment which a health center receives from a \nhealth plan.\n  There are many benefits which would result from this legislation.\n  Since these centers must be located by law in underserved areas, \naccess to cost-effective preventive and primary care services will be \nassured.\n  These centers deliver health care which is one of the best bargains \nanywhere. For example, the total annual cost of community health center \ncomprehensive primary and preventive care is, on average, less than \n$300 per patient.\n  I would also like to reassure my colleagues that this provision could \nresult in substantial savings for State Medicaid Programs. Several \nrecent studies have found that Medicaid patients who regularly use \nhealth centers have lower total annual health care costs than Medicaid \npatients who use other primary care providers, such as HMOs, hospital \noutpatient units, or private physicians. These studies show that health \ncenter patients were 22 percent to 33 percent less expensive overall \nand had between 27 percent to 44 percent lower inpatient costs and \ndays.\n  Other providers could also benefit from this provision. These centers \nserve disproportionate numbers of high-risk patients, and adequately \ncompensating the health centers for their care can make risk levels \nmore reasonable for other providers in communities with more than one \nprovider.\n  As we prepare to vote on this landmark legislation, I want to express \nmy deep personal appreciation to the Finance Committee health staff, \nwho have labored long and hard under the most difficult circumstances \nto bring us a solid piece of legislation. In particular I want to cite \nthe hard work of Julie James, Roy Ramthun, Alec Vachon, Susan Nestor, \nand Donna Norton. I would be remiss if I did not also mention the \nmonumental efforts of Lindy Paull, Rick Grafmeyer, and last, but not \nleast, Gioia Bonmartini.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, unfortunately, there is no easy nor \npainless way to effect reductions in the growth of Medicare and \nMedicaid. But it has to be done.\n  My message is simple. I wish we lived in a world in which we had \nunlimited \n\n[[Page S 16084]]\nresources so that all--aged, disabled, poor--could have the services \nthey desire. But such a world does not exist.\n  We must be fair to our Nation's disabled, to our seniors, and to the \nlow-income. But we must also be fair to our children, and their \nchildren. In short, we just have to do the best we can and this bill is \na good start.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/27/senate-section/article/S16067-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16084-S16099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BALANCED BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to be voting today for the \nBalanced Budget Reconciliation Act. For the first time in a generation, \nthe United States Senate will be voting to end fiscal irresponsibility. \nToday, we have the opportunity to leave the next generation not \nmountains of debt, but the prospect of a stronger economy and a better \nstandard of living.\n  Many of us have fought this battle to end runaway deficit spending \nfor decades. I have done what I can. I have kept my votes within a \nbalanced budget. I have cosponsored constitutional amendments to \nbalance the budget, and measures to grant the President line item veto \nauthority. When I assumed the chairmanship of the Committee on \nCommerce, Science and Transportation, I voluntarily reduced my staff \nbudget by 15 percent. Those of us who believe in common sense budgeting \nfought tenaciously to reverse years of liberal excess and largess that \nhas left the United States a debtor nation. For years, the only things \nI have had to show for my efforts to balance the budget are awards from \ngrassroots, fiscal watchdog organizations. Today, with passage of this \nlegislation, I have my eyes on the ultimate prize: a balanced federal \nbudget. It is about time.\n  Of course, the people who deserve most of the credit are the American \npeople. As they have done in so many instances throughout our nation's \nhistory, the American people made the difference. Last November they \nsaid enough is enough. They sent home many liberal caretakers of a run-\ndown, bloated federal government, and sent to Washington a new corps of \nmembers that share my common sense approach to government. American \nfamilies, working hard to provide for their children's future, knew \nthat the federal debt stood as an ominous threat to their efforts and \ntheir way of life.\n  The people of South Dakota long ago made clear they do not tolerate \nwasteful deficit spending. South Dakotans believe that the federal \ngovernment should live within its means--just like every family, every \nfarm, and every business large and small. They are absolutely right.\n  No single act this Congress can take could have a more positive \nimpact on more Americans than a vote to balance the federal budget. The \nfacts are clear. A balanced federal budget and a lower debt free up \ninvestment dollars that have gone toward financing the debt or making \ninterest payments on the debt. In practical terms, a balanced budget \nwould mean three key things: First, it would mean lower interest rates \nby up to two percent, making loans for new businesses, a new home or \ncar, or a college education more affordable; second, it would mean at \nleast 6.1 million new jobs; and third, it would mean a higher standard \nof living. In fact, a balanced budget would result in per-family \nincomes rising on average by $1,000 a year.\n  With all the clear benefits, it is no wonder that the American people \nstrongly favor a balanced budget. Americans recognize that fiscal \nirresponsibility has been a stifling barrier to progress--a barrier \nthat gets larger, more onerous and more oppressive unless we act. \nToday, we are acting. A balanced budget is not just a restoration of \ncommon sense government. It is nothing less than economic liberation \nfor every American family and business.\n  The balanced budget bill we pass today maintains our commitment to \nvital programs, such as student loans and national security. It also \npreserves and improves outdated, costly social programs that threaten \nto spiral our country into bankruptcy. Chief among them is Medicare.\n  Medicare reform is critical. I support Medicare. It provides \nessential hospital and health care services to 37 million Americans, \nincluding 113,000 South Dakotans. My mother depends on Medicare for \nbasic health care.\n  As all of us know, earlier this year, we received troubling news from \nthe trustees in charge of Medicare. They said that Medicare would be \nbankrupt in seven years. Without action by the year 2002, there would \nbe no money to pay senior citizens' hospital bills. Seniors would be \nstuck for the entire bill because Medicare would not be around to help. \nThat must not happen. If we enact the Medicare reforms contained in S. \n1357, that will not happen.\n  This bill would save Medicare by making a number of key reforms. \nFirst, the bill would slow the rate at which Medicare is spending our \ntax dollars. At present, Medicare is growing at an annual rate of 10.4 \npercent. That is too fast. It is like forcing a person to run a \nmarathon at a sprinter's pace. If allowed to grow at this pace, \nMedicare will burn out and run out of money in seven years. Like the \nmarathon runner, we need to slow the pace of Medicare growth so it can \nrun longer. That is just what this bill would do. It would slow \nMedicare growth to a more manageable 6.4 percent--still twice the rate \nof inflation, but at a pace that would enable Medicare to stay solvent \nfor years to come.\n  In terms of dollars and cents, total Medicare spending would increase \nfrom $178 billion this year to $274 billion by the year 2002--that is a \ntotal of $1.6 trillion invested in Medicare and an increase of 54 \npercent over seven years. This growth rate is faster than any other \nmajor government program. Spending per South Dakota Medicare \nbeneficiary would increase as well, from $4,816 this year to $6,734 in \nthe year 2002--an increase of $1,918.\n  This bill would improve Medicare as well. The Republican Medicare \nreform plan rests on three basic principles: First, every senior would \nbe able to choose the same fee-for-service Medicare plan they have now, \nwith all of Medicare's benefits. Second, senior citizens would continue \nto be able to choose their own doctor. Third, seniors would have a new \noption--the option to choose from a variety of health plans, as do \nyounger Americans and Members of Congress. Seniors could stay on \nMedicare, or opt for a health plan offered by a Health Maintenance \nOrganization (HMO), a Provider Sponsored Network (PSN), or even a \nhealth plan sponsored by a pool of physicians.\n  For the first time, seniors would be given a greater choice over \nhealth care options. They would have leverage as health care consumers \nin a newly competitive health care market. This option of choice would \noffer senior citizens more benefits, such as eyeglasses, prescription \ndrugs and hearing aids, at a lower cost.\n  In short, Republicans intend to improve Medicare by preserving its \nbest elements, and empowering senior citizens, not the government, to \nchoose the health plan that suits them best.\n  This legislation also contains much-needed reforms in the Medicaid \nprogram. Like Medicare, the Medicaid program is growing at an excessive \nrate that threatens funding levels for other vital social programs. The \ncore element of Medicaid reform is to slow the rate of growth in the \nprogram, from 10.5 percent to just under 5 percent We further reform \nMedicaid by giving the States greater authority to administer the \nprogram, while maintaining our traditional commitments to cover \npregnant women and children, as well as the disabled.\n  The balanced budget legislation also maintains our commitment to \nyoung Americans who need financial assistance for college. Much \nmisinformation has been circulated by the liberals, but the reality is \nstudent financial aid enjoys wide bipartisan support. This was made \nevident just yesterday, when the Senate overwhelming approved an \namendment I cosponsored to provide an additional $5 billion for student \nfinancial aid. This amendment would preserve the in-school interest \nsubsidy for both undergraduate and graduate students. It also would \nprevent any increases in the interest rate on PLUS loans for parents \nand it eliminated a misguided .85 percent fee on student loan volume on \ncolleges and universities.\n  I am very pleased the Senate adopted this amendment. During the \nSenate Labor Committee's consideration of its provisions in the \nbalanced budget legislation, I contacted Chairman Kassebaum to express \nmy opposition to any \n\n[[Page S 16085]]\nnew fees on higher education institutions as a way to preserve our \ncommitment to Federal student loan programs.\n  Frankly, we could do even more for our financial aid programs by \nrepealing the wasteful direct lending program. This bill takes a step \nin that direction by capping the direct lending program at 20 percent. \nThis program is a very inefficient and costly attempt to remove the \nprivate sector from the student loan process. The Congressional Budget \nOffice [CBO] estimated that the elimination of direct lending would \nsave taxpayers $1.5 billion over 7 years. In addition, students and \nfamilies are better served by their local banks than faceless \nbureaucrats in Washington.\n  I have heard from many young South Dakotans on the importance of \nfinancial aid for higher education. I personally identify with their \nconcerns. I relied on student loans to get through college. Let me \nassure them and their parents that the balanced budget bill before us \ntoday is a winner in two respects --first, it maintains the Federal \ncommitment to federal student loan programs; second, by balancing the \nbudget, young South Dakotans will inherit an American economy and a \nstandard of living second to none.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the balanced budget bill brings much-needed \ntax relief to the American people--tax relief that is balanced, \nreasonable and fair. We need tax relief for a number of reasons. First, \nthe current tax code is unfair to working Americans. Since 1950, the \ntax burden has risen dramatically. Today, average Americans see up to \n40 percent of their hard-earned income go toward taxes. In a nation \nwhere the average family has both parents on the job, Americans are \nworking harder than ever before. Yet, they have less and less to show \nfor it. That is not right. A heavy tax burden stalls economic growth, \nprevents savings and investment, and hinders a family's ability to \nprovide for the well-being of their children.\n  Second, we need tax relief to reverse the adverse affects of the 1993 \ntax increase--the largest in American history. This tax increase is the \nmain reason why the current economic recovery has been much slower than \nprevious recoveries. As I stated, a balanced budget provides our \neconomy a much-needed boost. Tax relief would empower working Americans \nwith the means to further boost our economy. Indeed, this tax relief \nbill is good for all Americans--families, small businesses, farmers and \nseniors.\n  We have carefully crafted a bill that takes a big step toward \nfairness and empowers Americans to contribute to the health of our \ncountry, our communities and our families. And we do so without leaving \na Federal deficit.\n  The largest component of this tax package would provide a $500 per \nchild tax credit for low- and middle-income families. This is money \nthat can go where it can do the most good--in family budgets to serve a \nnumber of purposes, ranging from child care to saving for a college \neducation.\n  This tax credit is great news for tens of thousands of South Dakota \nfamilies. Specifically, more than 84,000 South Dakota families would \nbenefit from the tax credit. Of that number, more than 31,000 South \nDakota taxpayers would have their tax liability eliminated completely. \nThis is a true middle class tax cut. In fact 84 percent of the tax \nrelief in this bill would go to Americans making less than $100,000 a \nyear.\n  The bill would provide even more tax relief for the middle-class by \ncreating a student loan deduction for up to 20 percent of interest--up \nto $500--paid on a student loan.\n  The bill would create an adoption credit to encourage and reward \nthose who reach out to open their hearts and homes to a child in need \nof a home. And we have strengthened our commitment to families by \nrelieving the unfair burden of the marriage tax penalty.\n  The bill would encourage middle class families to save and invest by \ncreating a new Individual Retirement Account. Current use of tax-\ndeductible IRAs would be expanded through an increase in the income \nlimits, which would encourage Americans to save more and secure their \nfutures. Homemakers would be allowed participation in IRAs. Finally, \npenalty-free withdrawals would be allowed for first time home \npurchases, medical expenses, periods of unemployment and higher \neducation expenses. I have long been a strong advocate for making IRAs \nmore flexible for families. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of the \noriginal legislation, which was incorporated in S. 1357.\n  Our economy would be further stimulated by the capital gains tax cut \ncontained in this bill. More often than not, capital gains taxes hurt \nmiddle income families. The vast majority of capital gains is realized \nfrom those individuals who have held a family home or farm for decades \nor even generations, and are severely punished by the tax code when \nthey finally sell their primary assets to pay for retirement. This bill \nwould cut the capital gains tax rate by 50 percent for individuals. \nThis would allow individuals who now are holding assets for fear of the \ncapital gains tax to put those assets to a more productive use.\n  Our small businesses--the true engines of our economy--would benefit \nfrom the capital gains reforms, but also from other specific items in \nour bill that were created for their benefit. Many small businesses do \nnot offer pension plans to their employees due to the administrative \ncosts and unnecessary paperwork that is required. For those businesses \nwith less than 100 employees and limited resources, the bill would \ncreate a simple 401(k) plan where employees can contribute up to $6000 \nof wages, and employers must match up to 3 percent of the employee's \npay.\n  One portion of this bill that I am particularly proud of is estate \ntax relief for family farms and businesses. Too often, people work \ntheir entire lives to build a successful farm, ranch or other small \nbusiness, with the hopes of passing it along to their children. \nUnfortunately, the estate tax laws take away the fruits of their labor \nby imposing a tax of up to 55 percent upon the family estates. This \nfrequently forces the family to sell all or part of the business simply \nto pay estate taxes. Earlier this year, after months of preparation, \nChairman Roth, Senator Dole, Senator Pryor and I introduced legislation \nthat would exempt the first $1.5 million of qualified family-owned \nbusiness assets from estate taxes, and then to provide a 50 percent \nrate cut beyond that.\n  The continuation of family-owned businesses is critical to the \nstrength of our communities. This is true in South Dakota, where family \nfarms and businesses have been the heart and soul of our economic \ndevelopment since statehood. Family-owned businesses give our kids \nsomething to work toward--and it helps our towns and neighborhoods by \nproviding an active business commitment to their stability. The estate \ntax reforms in this legislation would end the imposition of estate \ntaxes for virtually every family-owned family farm and small business \nin South Dakota.\n  I also worked to include in the bill a modest, but much-needed change \nto the Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax laws that would free up more \noptions for contributing estate assets to charity.\n  I am pleased that this bill would retain the ethanol tax credit and \nextend the recently expired ethanol blenders tax credit, which is very \nimportant to South Dakota corn farmers and ethanol blenders. Both \nprovisions are important for rural America and farm income. These kinds \nof credits are essential in order to provide new market opportunities \nfor farmers. Ethanol is a fuel source that is cleaner for the \nenvironment, reduces dependency on foreign oil and strengthens our \nagricultural sector.\n  This tax package is a solid, reasonable approach to tax relief. It \nstimulates the economy and helps those who are trying to make a better \nlife for themselves. Having the ability to plan ahead for retirement \nand other, unexpected, life changes benefits the society as a whole.\n  In order to assist those who seek to provide for their long-term \nhealth needs, the bill would clarify the treatment of long-term care \ninsurance so that it would be treated like medical insurance and \nreceive favorable tax treatment. The more we can encourage people to \nplan ahead for themselves, the stronger all of our futures will be. We \nhave created Medical Savings Accounts [MSAs] so that everyone can plan \nfor medical crises. The earnings on these accounts would be tax-free as \nare the withdrawals for certain purposes. \n\n[[Page S 16086]]\n\n  Mr. President, the driving principle behind this entire legislation \nis fairness--fairness to hard-working Americans and particularly to our \nchildren, who stand to inherit this country. Without this legislation, \nAmericans would be subjected to egregious forms of unfairness on many \nfronts. Unless we balance the budget, young Americans will inherit a \nnation submerged in debt. A child born today already owes $187,000 just \non interest on the Federal debt. That is more than $3,500 in taxes \nevery year of her working life--a lifetime tax rate of 84 percent. This \ndebt stands to threaten the very foundations of our economy and our \ncountry.\n  Without this legislation, Medicare will go bankrupt in the year 2002. \nAmericans not yet of retirement age, who are contributing a significant \nportion of their pay to Medicare, deserve to know that Medicare will be \nthere for them when they retire.\n  Without this legislation, hard-working Americans would be saddled \nwith a tax system that punishes their ability to save, invest and \nprovide for their families.\n  This legislation restores fairness to fiscal policy, seniors' health \ncare and tax policy. Most Americans play by a common sense set of \nvalues. Americans work hard. They obey the law. They look out for their \nfamily and community. They try to provide for their future and their \nchildren's future.\n  For more than a generation, the Federal Government has stood in stark \ncontrast to these values. The Federal Government taxes far too much and \nspends even more. It does not live within its means. It stifles \nindividual initiative and ingenuity. This liberal tax and spend \nphilosophy stands to threaten the livelihoods and the values that \nembody them of future generations.\n  Today, we take a significant step to right the wrongs of an \nirresponsible legacy of tax and spend. It is a historic occasion. \nToday, we set the stage for a new legacy of fiscal responsibility and \nfairness to American families. The American people made history last \nNovember by giving the Republicans control of Congress for the first \ntime in more than a generation. They called for fair, common sense \ngovernment. Tonight, for the first time in more than a generation, we \nin the Republican party will give the American people what they asked \nfor: A fair, common sense government that lives within its means.\n\n\n                        naval petroleum reserves\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there was a point of order sustained \nagainst the provision in the bill providing for the sale of the naval \npetroleum reserves [NPR], it is a technical violation of the Byrd rule.\n  The budget resolution included a reconciliation instruction based on \nthe gross proceeds from the sale of the naval petroleum reserves. For \nreconciliation purposes, the Senate Budget Committee has scored the \ngross proceeds to the Armed Services Committee consistent with the \nbudget resolution.\n  Under reconciliation scoring, there is no violation under the Byrd \nrule.\n  For the purposes of scoring under sections 302 and 311 of the Budget \nAct and determining whether the budget is balanced we do take into \naccount the forgone receipts from the sale of the naval petroleum \nreserve. So, under that scoring there would be a net outlay increase in \nthe out-years.\n  Even so, no one should be under the impression that the sale of the \nNPR will lose the Government money.\n  Under CBO's scoring, the sale of the naval petroleum reserves [NPR] \nleads to three budgetary impacts: $1.6 billion increase in gross \nproceeds to the Government from the sale of the NPR; $2.5 billion in \nforgone receipts over the next 7 years from the sale of the reserves; \nand at least $1.0 billion in discretionary spending savings associated \nwith the fact that the Government no longer will need to spend money to \noperate and maintain the reserves.\n  None of these figures take into account the interest savings the \nGovernment will earn or the tax revenues that will be generated by the \nprivate operation of this oil venture. Even without these additional \nsavings, the sale still generates savings to the Federal Government \nover a 7-year time period.\n  The point of order against this provision is clearly a technical \nviolation. I will work to ensure the sale of the NPR's is incorporated \ninto the conference report and there is no Byrd rule violation.\n  The irony here is that a Democratic point of order will defeat the \nPresident's proposal to sell the naval petroleum reserves. If we don't \nsell it, the President's plan is even more out of balance.\n  Mr. President, the NPR has outlived the original purpose for which it \nwas established around the turn of the century--a fuel reserve for the \nNavy.\n  Since 1976, the Department of Energy has been operating NPR as a \ncommercial oil venture. The quality of oil produced from the NPR is not \nsuitable for use by the modern Navy and instead is sold to the private \nmarket.\n  There is no national security rationale for the Federal Government to \ncontinue managing NPR oil production, either in terms of military or \ndomestic energy requirements. The private sector can run NPR more \nefficiently than the Federal Government.\n\n\n                      International Simplification\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I would like to state my support for \nincluding several international tax simplification measures in the \nconference report. There is an urgent need to address certain issues \nnow before businesses make operational decisions that may negatively \nimpact the growth of those industries for years to come, and, as a \nresult, harm the U.S. economy. I know that Senators Hatch, D'Amato, \nChafee, Grassley, and Mack also have strong concerns in this area, and \nI hope we can all work together to see that these issues are addressed \nin the conference report on this bill.\n  The provisions to which I refer include various international \nsimplification measures, some of which are in the House bill, including \na measure that would permit foreign tax credits to be applied to taxes \npaid by fourth-, fifth and sixth-tier controlled foreign corporations \n(CFCs), as well as the repeal of Section 956A of the Internal Revenue \nCode, the clarification of the application of the foreign sales \ncorporation (FSC) rules with respect to software exports, and a \nreevaluation of the deferral rules for foreign shipping income of \nCFC's.\n  One of the provisions on which I believe we should act is section \n956A, which was one of the tax increases included in President \nClinton's 1993 tax bill. Contrary to the stated reason for enacting \nthis provision, in many cases it has created an incentive for U.S. \nmultinationals to invest overseas rather than in the United States. \nThis is because by having its foreign subsidiary invest in active \nforeign assets, a U.S. multinational reduces its tax liability. Thus, \nsection 956A essentially provides a 35 percent investment tax credit \nfor foreign investment by U.S. companies. Similar problems arise from a \nprovision that today could cause a CFC to be treated as a PFIC because \ncurrent law generally does not recognize the value of a company's \nintangible assets. These and other international tax simplification \nissues should be addressed in the conference agreement to this bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I share the concerns expressed by the \nmajority leader regarding the need to repeal Section 956A and the \napplication of the PFIC rules to CFC's in connection with intangible \nassets. I would also like to express my concern about the problem of \nthe overlap between subpart F and the PFIC provisions in general. I \nlook forward to working together with the leader to correct all of \nthese problems in the conference report on this bill. These provisions \nhave the effect of hindering competitiveness of U.S. multinationals and \ndistorting investment decisions that properly should be governed by \neconomic considerations alone. Thus, they put at risk U.S.-based jobs. \nThe 956A and PFIC rules have an especially harsh effect on research-\nintensive companies, which tend to accumulate capital before making \nmajor investments. As a result, I am particularly concerned that \nresearch activities may be moved overseas in order to avoid the impact \nof these rules. I believe this Nation may gradually lose its \ncompetitive edge in the technology field if through ill-conceived tax \nrules we provide incentives for this technology to be developed and \nowned outside the United States. As you know, technology industries are \nvery important to my State of Utah, and I am concerned about Tax Code \n\n[[Page S 16087]]\nprovisions that have the effect of causing those industries to move \ntheir high-paying jobs out of the United States. For that reason, I \nwould like to ask the leader's support for addressing in conference a \nproblem that has arisen because of a narrow and ill-conceived IRS \ninterpretation of the foreign sales corporation (FSC) provisions as \nthey apply to exports of software, which I fear could also result in \nthe movement of software development jobs overseas.\n  The FSC rules were enacted to address competitive disadvantages faced \nby U.S. exporters vis-a-vis exports from other countries that have more \nfavorable tax systems, particularly those that effectively exempt \nexport sales from home country tax. The goal of the FSC provisions was \nto remove an incentive to move manufacturing and production jobs out of \nthe United States. Unfortunately, a narrow IRS interpretation of these \nrules could preclude exports of software copyrights from qualifying for \nexport treatment under the FSC rules when those exports are accompanied \nby a right to reproduce the software overseas. I am very concerned \nbecause software companies are already examining opportunities to move \nhigh-paying software development jobs overseas where highly skilled \nlabor is available at much lower wages. FSC benefits help offset higher \nU.S. labor costs by providing benefits on the export of products \ndeveloped in the United States. I believe it is very important to \nclarify these rules to reflect the Congress' intent with respect to \nsoftware, not only to protect U.S. software development jobs, but also \nto preserve ownership of this technology in the United States.\n  The narrow IRS interpretation of the application of the FSC rules to \nsoftware was included in 1987 temporary and proposed regulations, which \nwere never finalized. The Treasury Department has broad authority under \ncurrent law to implement congressional intent by providing that a \ncopyright on software qualifies as export property even if the software \nis accompanied by a right to reproduce. I believe that the Treasury \nDepartment should take action on its regulations to so provide this \nresult. However, Treasury has indicated that it prefers congressional \naction to resolve this issue. In any event, 8 years is too long to wait \nfor Treasury to take action on its temporary regulations, especially \ngiven the fact that the software industry regularly receives \nsolicitations to move their software development to other countries, \nsuch as Ireland and India. Therefore, I hope that the majority leader \nwill support legislative clarification of this issue in the context of \ninternational tax simplification measures that will be considered by \nthe conference committee. This clarification of the FSC rules is an \nimportant simplification measure because it will implement the intent \nof Congress and help taxpayers and the IRS avoid years of litigation \nover the current regulations and help to avert complicated \nrestructuring activities.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I, too, am concerned about the Treasury \nDepartment's interpretation of the FSC rules with respect to computer \nsoftware and do not believe that the FSC statute precludes the \napplication of the FSC provisions to computer software in the case \ndescribed by the Senator from Utah. Given the Treasury's unwillingness \nto resolve this issue, I agree that we should address this issue in \nconference.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I share the views of the majority leader \nand the Senator from Utah with respect to the urgent need to provide \nlong-overdue improvements to our international tax system, especially \nwhen existing law hampers our industries as they expand their \noperations in the global marketplace.\n  The need for simplification and reform is illustrated by section 956 \nof the Internal Revenue Code--a section introduced in the 1960's and \ndesigned to prevent taxpayers from avoiding taxation on the \nrepatriation of foreign earnings through disguised dividends in the \nform, for example, of loans to affiliates. In general, ordinary course \nof business financing transactions appropriately were exempted from \nthis provision. Since section 956 first was introduced, however, the \nscope and complexity of international business have expanded rapidly, \nbut the ordinary course of business exceptions to section 956 have not \nbeen updated.\n  For example, U.S.-based securities firms typically had negligible \nforeign earnings at the time section 956 was introduced, and therefore \nthe ordinary course of business exceptions to that provision did not \nreflect standard commercial practices in that industry. In recent \nyears, however, many U.S.-based securities firms have transformed \nthemselves into global institutions by developing substantial \ninternational operations (just as many foreign-based institutions now \ncompete in the United States). Section 956 has never been updated to \nreflect this surge in the international activities of the U.S. \nsecurities industry, thus forcing the industry into complex uneconomic \ntransactions.\n  This is just one example of how U.S. taxation has not kept up with \nthe political, economic and technical changes that have created new \nopportunities and broken down old barriers as national markets are \nreplaced with global markets. Our tax laws should reflect and support \nthese changes in a similar fashion, or they will force undue complexity \non U.S.-based companies.\n  I join with the Senators from Kansas and Utah in supporting the \nprincipal of tax reform in the international area and the inclusion of \ninternational simplification and reform in the conference report.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I agree that we should try to address these \nmeasures in conference.\n\n\n                        baucus motion to strike\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there is a stretch of coastal plain in \nnortheastern Alaska which has been called North America's Serengeti. \nNestled between the towering 10-thousand foot peaks of the Brooks Range \nand the frigid Arctic Ocean on the North Slope of Alaska, lies the \nArctic Coastal Plain, the 1\\1/2\\-million-acre crown jewel of the 19-\nmillion-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. According to the Fish and \nWildlife Service, the coastal plain area is the biological heart and \nthe center of wildlife activity in the refuge. This pristine and \ncomplex Arctic ecosystem is habitat for a complete spectrum of \nwildlife, including polar and grizzly bears, wolves and snow geese. A \n160,000-member porcupine caribou herd has used the coastal plain as a \ncalving area for centuries. In all, more than 200 animal species call \nthe refuge home.\n  Tragically, the bill before us today threatens to permanently mar \nAlaska's Coastal Plain by permitting destructive oil and natural gas \nexploration. Under a broad pretext of jobs, economic development, and \ninternational security, some want to enable gigantic energy interests \nto irreparably harm the sanctity of this area. What will be taken can \nnever be replaced, and we ought not allow exploration to occur.\n  The State of Alaska has been blessed with abundant natural resources, \nand on the whole we, as a nation, are stronger for much of the enormous \ndevelopment which has occurred there.\n  Depending on who you ask naturally, the prospects for a substantial \noil find on the coastal plain vary. Nineteen percent, Forty percent, \nthe estimates, by definition, are inexact. Proponents of development \nbelieve that under the tundra lies the next Prudhoe Bay discovery, the \nnext North Sea field. Fueled by projections of a skyrocketing demand \nfor oil by the developing world, energy interests are waiting with \nbated breath.\n  Yet, of the more than 1,100 miles of northern Alaska's coastline, the \ncoastal plain is the only 125 miles closed to development. Isn't this a \nsmall, justifiable sacrifice. Isn't there a point where we draw the \nline and protect a unique area because there is value beyond the price \nper barrel.\n  Let us assume for the moment that perhaps there is some merit in \ndevelopment, and let us further use Prudhoe Bay as a case study of \nlikely consequences. Though for the most part drilling in the bay is \nreasonably managed, oil spills still average 500 annually--that is \nnearly 10 spills per week. This activity seems to also be having an \nimpact on the surrounding wildlife. An article in the October 21 \nedition of the Anchorage Daily News noted that a new State caribou \nsurvey has found a sharp decline in the central Arctic caribou herd \nindigenous to the area. The cause is unknown, however, recent research \nby the University of Alaska has found that caribou living near the oil \n\n[[Page S 16088]]\nfields have far fewer calves than those away from the facilities.\n  If this is in fact the case, the adverse effects of oil activity \nwould be magnified in the coastal plain. What will exploration bring? \nHundreds of miles of roads and pipelines leading to dozens of oil \nfields, blocking wildlife migration. Toxic wastes leaking into the \nsoil. Rivers and streambeds robbed of millions of tons of their gravel \nto construct roads and runways.\n  According to Interior Department estimates, oil exploration would \nlikely result in a decrease or change in distribution of 20 to 40 \npercent in the caribou population, 50 percent in the numbers of snow \ngeese, and 25 to 50 percent in the muskox populations.\n  And after the oil has dried up, after the companies have gone, what \nwill be left? The footprint of industrial development: abandoned \ndrilling equipment scarring the landscape; toxic contamination; lost \nwildlife; a horizon permanently altered.\n  I have heard proponents argue that opening the coastal plan is a \ncritical step toward decreasing our growing dependence on foreign oil. \nYet, many of these same proponents are now moving a bill through the \nCongress to start exporting the oil presently extracted from Alaska's \nNorth Slope.\n  Mysteriously, this concern about our dependence on foreign oil also \nseems to evaporate when it comes to investment in research and \ndevelopment of alternative fuels, such as solar and wind energy.\n  Protection of our wilderness should not be a Democratic issue, or a \nRepublican issue. In fact, the entire National Wildlife Refugee System, \nor which the Arctic Refuge is a part, was begun in 1903 by one of the \ngreatest conservationists in our history, President Teddy Roosevelt, a \nRepublican. The coastal plain was part of the original wildlife refuge \nestablished by President Eisenhower in 1960. Regrettably, red ink \nbleeding from Alaska's budget and the power of a few special interests \nhave polarized this debate.\n  Every American has a stake in our National Wilderness Areas, in the \npreservation of the environment in which we all live, Every acre \noffering the possibility of oil ought not be drilled, every mountain \noffering the possibility of gold ought not be mined, every mile of \nwilderness ought not be stripped bare just because its value can be \nquantified, just because revenue can be raised.\n  Due to the fragile and complex interconnection of ecosystems, our \nfuture is inextricably linked to nature's vitality. If the scale is \ntipped too far by overdevelopment and we lose our balance, no amount of \nmoney will enable us to restore what we have lost.\n  We must remember that we are but visitors in this land, existing by \nthe good grace of Mother Nature--a lasting, sustainable society for all \nfuture generations depends upon it.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I have enormous respect for my Republican \ncolleagues for producing this historic budget. For the first time in a \ngeneration the Senate is presented with a plan that actually balances \nthe budget.\n  Earlier this year, opponents of the balanced budget amendment charged \nthat the amendment was a gimmick designed to allow Members to say they \nsupport a balanced budget without having to explain exactly how to \nachieve this.\n  I am proud that these critics have been proven wrong. Despite the \nloss of the balanced budget amendment, this Republican Congress has \npersevered in producing a specific plan to balance the budget in 2002--\nthe same year called for in the balanced budget amendment.\n  The spending cuts called for in this plan are significant, and many \nof them are well overdue. My concern is with the tax cuts. I do not \nthink we should be cutting taxes at the same time we are trying to \nbalance the budget.\n  Trying to do both at once is like driving with one foot on the gas \nand the other on the brake.\n  I think the tough cuts proposed in this plan would be more easily \njustified without the tax cuts.\n  Any way you look at it, because of these tax cuts, the Federal \nGovernment will have to borrow $245 billion more over the next 7 years \nthan it otherwise would. This is particularly troubling in light of the \nfact that, if no changes are made in the Federal budget, children born \ntoday will face a lifetime tax burden of 82 percent. Such a tax burden \nis clearly unsustainable and intolerable.\n  Paying for tax cuts with borrowed money is really more of a tax \ndeferral than a tax cut. At some point, future taxpayers will be forced \nto pay back the $245 billion and their tax burden will be higher than \nit otherwise might be.\n  If the effect of borrowing money for tax cuts today is to increase \nthe tax burden on future generations, the entire purpose of balancing \nthe budget is undermined. We will still be asking our children to foot \nthe bill. Balancing the budget is itself a tax cut in that it would \nrelieve families of the hidden taxes associated with servicing the \nnational debt. Interest on this debt costs the average household over \n$800 a year. Balancing the budget more quickly and forgoing a deficit-\nfinanced tax cut would ease the burden of these hidden taxes. Balancing \nthe budget more quickly would also lower interest costs for mortgages \nand student loans--saving families thousands of dollars.\n  Congress must focus on increasing the national savings rate. The \nsurest way to achieve this goal is by reducing the deficit and by \nfundamentally reforming the tax code. The tax cuts proposed in the \npending bill would frustrate both of these goals. The Tax Code would be \ncomplicated further and the deficit would be $245 billion larger.\n  Let me be clear. If not for the budget deficit, I too would support a \nbroad-based tax cut. I am no fan of higher taxes. I opposed President \nClinton's deficit plan because it relied too heavily on tax increases \nand not enough on spending cuts. It is one thing to oppose further tax \nincreases. It is quite another, however, to support large tax cuts in \nthe face of looming deficits.\n  While the size of the tax cuts prevent me from voting for this \nbudget, I appreciate the willingness of the majority leader, Senator \nDomenici and Senator Roth to work with me and other Senators to make \nsome important changes to the bill affecting the education and Medicaid \nprograms. In addition, important Federal nursing home standards were \nmaintained. While these improvements were substantial, they could not \noffset my overarching concerns with cutting taxes by $245 billion at \nthis time.\n  I am confident that the Senate will have an opportunity to consider \nanother balanced budget plan this year. The budget in its current form \nwill almost certainly be vetoed by the President. Subsequent to this \nveto, I look forward to working with my colleagues to craft a new plan \nthat maintains the goal of balancing the budget without cutting taxes \nby $245 billion.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am voting in favor of final passage of \nthe budget reconciliation bill because I believe the prospective \nbenefits of balancing the budget outweigh the concerns expressed in my \nfloor statement of October 24, 1995. As indicated by that statement and \nmy votes on individual amendments, I believe the bill would have been \nfairer with more funding for Medicare, education, and Medicaid without \nthe tax cuts. OK, the tax cuts should have gone to deficit reduction. \nBut, on balance, the bill should be passed.\n  At the insistence of our group of centrist Senators, this bill has \nbeen materially improved by floor amendments which did add some \nsignificant supplemental funding for Medicaid, Medicare, and education.\n  It is my expectation that further improvements are likely in the \nHouse-Senate conference with additional funding for Medicare and \nrecipients of the earned income tax credit, because the House of \nRepresentatives has higher figures in those accounts.\n  After the House-Senate conference and the expected Presidential veto, \nit is likely that the ultimate legislation will better address the \nfairness issue and provide better assurances that tax cuts will not \nundermine a balanced budget.\n  Passage of this bill by the Senate today will move the process \nforward and promote the primary objective of balancing the federal \nbudget by the targeted year of 2002.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, a nation's budget reveals its fundamental \nvalues, its priorities, the problems that most concern its people. A \nbudget can tell us a lot about how a nation's resources will be \nshared--which people, what activities will bear the tax burdens, and \n\n[[Page S 16089]]\nwhich people, which activities will be encouraged and rewarded.\n  We are debating here today perhaps the most important budget plan in \nmy public career. This is the first time we have committed ourselves to \na 7-year budget plan, and the first time we have committed ourselves to \na path which ends in a balanced budget. If--and this is a big if--we \nstick to it, this budget will control our actions through the end of \nthis century and beyond.\n  What statement does this document make about our country? What does \nthis reconciliation bill say about our concerns, what does it say about \nour values?\n  Mr. President, as we debate this bill we face a number of fundamental \nproblems in our country. High on the list of worries of the middle-\nclass men and women I talk to in my State of Delaware is the need to \nrestore faith in the American dream--a belief that their own hard work \nwill earn them a decent living today, that their mothers and fathers \nwill enjoy a secure and dignified retirement, and that there will be a \nbetter world for their sons and daughters.\n  And just as high on that list of Americans' concerns is a need to \nrestore Americans' sense of fairness--a sense that we have a system \nthat gives the average guy a fair shake, that does not turn its back on \nthose who are less fortunate, a system in which the most fortunate meet \ntheir obligation to contribute to our shared needs.\n  This is a value increasingly at risk today.\n  How does this budget respond to those concerns, Mr. President? How \ndoes it reflect those middle-class values?\n  I am sorry to say that this budget will give middle-class Americans \nmore reason to worry about the future. It weakens the foundation of \nfuture growth by making it harder for our children to get the education \nthey need to become part of a high wage, high productivity, world class \nwork force.\n  The lower, slower growth that is the inevitable result of this \nreconciliation bill will contribute to a further hollowing out of our \nmiddle class--an expanding gap between the few whose families can \nafford a more expensive ticket to a better future and those who cannot.\n  A weakened middle class increases social instability, and leads to \nthe very real concerns about the future that we now see in the polls, \nand in our streets.\n  It threatens Americans' ability to control their own fate--no matter \nhow hard they work, a weaker, slower growing economy will mean smaller \nwages and salaries, a bleaker future.\n  As unwise, as reckless as this bill is in its threat to our current \nand future standard of living, Mr. President, it is unconscionable in \nits abandonment of our commitment to our parents' generation.\n  It raises the cost of getting old in America, Mr. President. This \nreconciliation bill is a dark cloud over what should be the golden \nyears of the generation that made us into a world power, that passed on \nto us the richest, most powerful country in the history of the world. \nHow do we repay their hard work and sacrifice on our behalf?\n  This bill raises the cost of Medicare and Medicaid, and removes \nnursing home standards that demand basic human decency. It cuts more \nthan $270 billion from Medicare over the next 7 years. Already today, \nseniors pay an average of 20 percent of their income for health care. \nThis plan, will increase the premiums of a senior couple an additional \n$2,800 over the next 7 years.\n  This reconciliation bill continues to dump the burden on a middle \nclass that is already getting clobbered. For more than a decade and a \nhalf, the median income in this country has been stuck in neutral--\nalong with housing, the costs of education and health care are \nsqueezing everything else out of middle-class budgets.\n  This bill increases health care costs of the retired parents of hard-\nworking middle-class families. What are they going to do when grandma \nand grandpa come home and tell them that they will have to pay more out \nof their own fixed incomes to visit their own doctor? Will they turn \ntheir parents away? We all know the answer to that question, Mr. \nPresident--thank God, those middle-class families are going to remember \ntheir parents' sacrifices for them and for this country, and they are \ngoing to reach into their pockets and cover the new costs imposed by \nthis bill.\n  At the same time, they are going to have to pick up the tab for more \nexpensive college loans. It is the old squeeze play, Mr. President, and \nguess who is in the middle?\n  The saddest thing about this reconciliation bill may well be the \nmissed opportunity it represents. I voted for the balanced budget \namendment. I support not one, but two different budget resolutions that \ncould have brought us to a balanced budget by the year 2002, the same \ntarget at which this reconciliation bill is aimed.\n  So I wish I could vote for a plan that would reach that goal. There \nare many possible plans, many possible paths to that goal. Some of \nthose paths to a balanced budget would leave us a stronger, more \ncompetitive, and fairer country.\n  This one will not.\n  The question is not whether we should balance the budget. The \nquestion is not whether there must be sacrifice and change in the way \nwe do business here. And for me, there is no question that we should \nmake room for tax cuts, though more carefully drawn and targeted than \nthose here before us today.\n  The question is how should we share the burden of the necessary \nsacrifice among the American people, and how should we allocate the \nnecessary spending cuts to assure stronger, faster economic growth in \nthe future.\n  This reconciliation bill has the wrong answers to those questions, \nMr. President. It dumps the burdens of deficit reduction on those least \nable to bear it--deepening, not healing, the growing rifts in our \nsociety. And its short-sighted priorities--raising the cost of \neducation, reducing health care and nutrition to the poorest children--\nweaken our ability to respond with a healthy, smarter workforce to the \nchallenge of international economic competition.\n  I tried, along with a lot of my colleagues, to fix this bill. I \noffered an amendment that would give a $10,000 tax deduction to help \nmiddle-class families pay for the rising costs of a college education. \nI tried to reduce the fraud in the Medicare system--to save money that \ncould have prevented some of the worst cuts this bill will impose.\n  I supported many other attempts to restore some fairness, some common \nsense, some more balanced priorities to this bill. Those attempts were \ndefeated.\n  We are left with this fatally flawed bill.\n  And a final point, Mr. President. As someone who voted for the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment, I might be moved to overlook \nsome flaws in a plan that offered real promise of bringing the Federal \ndeficit down to zero. Unfortunately, this plan uses a bunch of budget \ngimmicks too long to list here to maintain an appearance of budget \nbalance that may well never become a reality.\n  Most disturbing to me is the fact that only by counting the surplus \nin the Social Security System will this plan bring the deficit to zero \nin the year 2002. Without counting Social Security funds as part of the \nFederal Government's everyday income, something that is not permitted \nunder our current budget laws, the Republicans' own Budget Office has \ntold them that this budget will be out of balance by $105 billion in \n2002.\n  But there are other problems, Mr. President--such as the heavy ``back \nloading'' of the spending cuts. This budget saves the real pain for the \n6th and 7th years of this plan--a point when virtually no one here \ntoday would have to face the need to cut over $200 billion each of the \nlast 2 years. Let us hope there will be more enthusiasm for those \nchoices then, than there appears to be now.\n  This bill's gimmicks include asset sales--to make the books look \nbetter in the short run, but that will leave us poorer in the future. \nAgain, this is a practice that should not be allowed under budget law, \nbut it is in here nonetheless.\n  So this reconciliation bill does not express the values of the \nAmericans I know, the values of the people of Delaware. It does not \nembody the principles of mutual obligation, of family continuity that \nthe Americans I know share. It is an affront to any notion of family \nvalues.\n  It does not address middle-class Americans' valid concerns about the \n\n[[Page S 16090]]\n  future of our economy, and it does nothing to help us build the well-\npaid, high-productivity work force that will allow us to take control \nof our destiny.\n  Because I know we can do better, Mr. President, and because the \nAmerican people deserve better, I will vote against this bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this reconciliation bill is the \nculmination of the congressional budget process. It provides for a \nbalanced budget within 7 years, a truly remarkable feat.\n  The next step will undoubtedly be direct negotiations between \ncongressional principals and the President to reach a final budget \naccord. However, that cannot occur until this legislation has been \npassed in final form, and sent to the President. And the quicker, the \nbetter, in my view.\n  While I do not agree with every aspect of this reconciliation bill, \nthe objective of achieving a balanced budget far outweighs any \nmisgivings I have about various of its provisions. We do not always get \neverything we want in the legislative process. Achieving the greater \ngood must also be a consideration; and, here, the greater good is to \nobtain a balanced budget.\n  For 33 straight years this Government has spent more than it has \ntaken in. The cumulative consequence of our annual budgetary sins is an \nincredible $5 trillion national debt--literally, a mortgage on the \neconomic future of our children and grandchildren. This is immoral, and \nmust stop.\n  Every week, the Treasury Department must issue debt securities to \nkeep the Government afloat. This past Monday, for example, Treasury \nborrowed $27 billion to cover maturing securities, and to raise needed \ncash. The Department must hold monthly, quarterly, and annual auctions \njust to maintain solvency. If we make no changes to the course we are \ncurrently on, we will run $200 billion deficits each year well into the \nnext century. Fully 15 percent of our annual Federal budget--$235 \nbillion--must now go to paying the interest on this massive debt, \nwithout a penny of that going to reduce the principal. Within 10 years \nannual interest costs will jump to $400 billion.\n  This must stop.\n  Those of us in Congress, who have struggled over the years to reverse \nthis ruinous course, are rightfully frustrated. In 1985, we passed the \nEmergency Deficit Control Act, also known as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. \nThat law was supposed to deliver a balanced budget by 1991. It did not \nhappen. In 1990, we passed the Budget Enforcement Act, establishing the \ndiscretionary spending caps and the pay-as-you-go rules for entitlement \nspending and tax cuts. The results are barely measurable. Despite our \nbest efforts, deficit control continues to elude us.\n  Regrettably, we cannot balance the budget this year or next. However, \nwith the bill before us, we will balance the budget by the year 2002. \nAnd, from there, we can hopefully go on to commence retiring the \nstaggering national debt that will remain.\n  Is this bill perfect? No, it is not. I am not aware of any Senator \nwho is satisfied with every aspect of this 1,900-page bill. In my view, \nat a time when we are struggling to reduce the deficit and asking \npeople to sacrifice, the tax cuts are ill-timed. Earlier this year, \nduring the debate on the Budget Resolution, a number of moderate \nRepublicans--myself included--sought to discourage the tax cuts. That \neffort was complicated by the fact that the President's own budget \ncalled for tax cuts totaling more than $105 billion. During the Finance \nCommittee deliberations last week, I was the lone Republican voting to \neliminate or scale-back the tax cuts. Unfortunately, my view did not \nprevail.\n  I have also been clear in my objections to block granting the \nMedicaid Program. I took steps in the Finance Committee to ensure that, \nat a minimum, pregnant women and children with incomes below the \npoverty level, as well as the disabled, retain some minimum guarantee \nof services.\n\n  In that regard, I am pleased my amendment to clarify the definition \nof ``disability'' passed the Senate yesterday by a vote of 60-39. \nSimilarly, I am gratified the Senate this morning rejected, by a vote \nof 21-78, an amendment to strike my guarantee provisions for low-income \npregnant women and children, as well as the disabled. These votes place \nthe Senate squarely on record in support of requiring states to \nguarantee services to these vulnerable populations.\n  As a result of negotiations with the majority leader, moderate \nRepublicans have been able to obtain a number of other improvements to \nthe Medicaid package over the past several days. These include \nretaining Federal standards for nursing homes, a set-aside for low-\nincome Medicare beneficiaries, and requiring that the same solvency \nstandards a state applies to private plans must also be applied to \nMedicaid plans. We were also able to obtain a provision to permit the \nintegration of services for elderly and disabled individuals who are \nboth Medicare and Medicaid-eligible. Finally, we also won inclusion of \nan additional $10 billion in funding to the States under the revised \nMedicaid Program, and $2 billion more in Medicare payments to teaching \nhospitals.\n  I am also pleased that we were able to reach an agreement with the \nmajority leader to eliminate the proposed reductions in Federal student \nloan programs that most directly effect students, parents, and schools. \nThis occurred yesterday with the passage of the Kassebaum amendment, \nwhich restores the interest exemption ``grace period'' for newly \nguaranteed students, retains the current interest rates on ``plus'' \nloans to parents, and drops the new fee based on student loan volume \nthat schools would be required to pay. We must not burden families \nfurther by making student loans more costly.\n  Despite these improvements, I still have some serious objections to \nS. 1357. Nonetheless, I will vote for this reconciliation measure. \nMoreover, I will vote against any amendments which I believe will delay \nor prevent this legislation from reaching the President's desk at the \nearliest possible time.\n  The new fiscal year started over 3 weeks ago, numerous appropriations \nbills remain outstanding, and the short term continuing resolution we \npassed last month will soon expire. My objective is to expedite getting \nto the endgame--to the bargaining table with President Clinton--where \nthe real negotiations and work can commence on the terms of a final \nagreement to balance the budget.\n  While one may or may not agree with this package, it definitely does \nnot represent business as usual. In fact, it is a bold, politically \nrisky initiative, without precedent in my memory. This is the first \nserious attempt to constrain the explosive growth of Medicare and \nMedicaid; to cap and reform farm subsidies; and to delay the cost of \nliving adjustments for Federal retirees. These deficits are a cancer, \nand this bill is the chemotherapy. It's painful medicine, but it is \nnecessary.\n  During hearings earlier this year in the Finance Committee, a number \nof distinguished economists testified on fiscal policy and the state of \nour economy. Nearly every one of these witnesses, including Federal \nReserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, said that balancing the budget \nis the single most important step we in Congress can take to help the \neconomy. The benefits that flow from balancing the budget include \nincreased employment and wages, greater investment and productivity, \nand lower long term interest rates.\n  Once we get on a glide path to a balanced budget, which can only come \nfrom hard negotiations with the President, our economy will begin to \nsee some of these improvements. As interest rates drop, borrowing to \nbuy a house, or to finance a college education will become more \naffordable. With less government borrowing, there will be more capital \navailable for small businesses to expand, and to hire more people. Real \nwages, now stagnant, will begin to grow again, and our standard of \nliving will gradually begin to improve.\n  In summary, Mr. President, we must take bold steps now. We cannot \ncontinue to pile ever greater debt burdens on our children and \ngrandchildren. Thank goodness we finally have a legislative proposal \nthat will reverse this ruinous course.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the 2000 page reconciliation measure \nthat the Senate passed is deeply flawed.\n  It is a massive work, and difficult to comment on in any serious, \ndetailed way because making an assessment of the reconciliation bill \nreally amounts \n\n[[Page S 16091]]\nto assessing the individual components of the measure, as well as the \nproposal as a whole.\n  On both counts, this bill is troubling.\n  Mr. President, last May, during consideration of the budget \nresolution, I shared my own perspective about the direction we should \npursue to balance the budget.\n  I argued that part of our effort should include changes to Medicare, \nand I identified areas where some savings could be realized.\n  I also noted that some in the Majority party were undermining our \nability to make these reforms by failing to play straight with the \nAmerican people, implying that cuts to Medicare are needed solely to \nkeep the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund solvent.\n  That portrayal was, and is, entirely misleading, as, of course, it \nwas meant to be.\n  For though some changes are needed to keep the Hospital Insurance \nfund solvent, that trust fund is not the entire story.\n  Savings in Medicare must also be found as part of the broader effort \nto reduce the deficit and balance the Federal budget.\n  Mr. President, I made this point last May, and I make it again today \nbecause I fear that the political spin doctors who have chosen to \ndepict Medicare cuts as being apart and separate from the rest of the \nbudget are doing a great disservice to the cause of deficit reduction.\n  In an effort to minimize the political fallout that is inevitable if \nCongress cuts Medicare, they may undermine any chance for a budget \npackage that will achieve the consensus it must have if we are to make \nthe politically tough decisions needed to balance the Federal budget.\n  Mr. President, we need to be honest with the American people.\n  The Hospital Insurance Trust Fund does need to be shored up, but that \nis not the only reason we need to find savings in Medicare.\n  Nor is the impending insolvency of the trust fund something new.\n  The Hospital Insurance Trust Fund has been within a few years of \ninsolvency every year since 1970.\n  Mr. President, Congress has been dealing with that problem off and on \nfor 25 years now. I understand that it will take about $90 billion in \nsavings over the next 7 years to extend the trust fund's solvency to 10 \nyears, about one third of the total reduction proposed by the majority \npart.\n  But the trust fund solvency is not the whole story, despite what some \nwant the American people to believe.\n  Medicare clearly has an impact on the budget, and part of the reason \ncuts are being proposed stems from our Federal budget deficit. And \nrightly so.\n  Mr. President, Medicare is not Social Security. It should be on the \ntable with other areas of Federal spending.\n  Mr. President, I have sponsored legislation that includes Medicare \nchanges. Medicare changes were part of the 82+ point plan to reduce the \ndeficit I offered during my campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1992.\n  More importantly, I have voted for legislation that contained \nsignificant, specific changes to Medicare twice during the 103d \nCongress.\n  The reconciliation legislation we passed as part of the President's \ndeficit reduction package included nearly $60 billion in Medicare cuts.\n  I also voted for, and was proud to co-sponsor, the bipartisan Kerrey-\nBrown deficit reduction package which also included significant, \nspecific Medicare cuts.\n  And, Mr. President, I am willing to vote for Medicare cuts again. But \nnot the $270 billion in cuts that are proposed in this measure.\n  Mr. President, last May I laid out a number of specific areas in \nwhich I thought savings could be realized. I was pleased to see a \nnumber of those ideas included in the Medicare provisions of the \nreconciliation bills that have been made by the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  These included changes in the reimbursement of capital-related costs \nof inpatient services; repairing the flawed reimbursement formula that \nresults in overpayments for some outpatient services; and, establishing \na new prospective payment approach for home health care services.\n  I was pleased as well to see that the Finance Committee proposal \nincludes some improvement in the reimbursement formula for Medicare \nHMOs.\n  The current formula rewards inefficient health care markets and \npunishes efficient health care markets and those areas, like many rural \nareas, that have inadequate service capacity.\n  For Vernon County, WI, about an hour west of my home, the Medicare \nformula would reimburse an HMO about $211 per month per enrollee. That \nis just a little bit more than half of the national average of $400 per \nmonth.\n  Mr. President, it should not surprise my colleagues to know that \nthere are no Medicare HMOs in Vernon County. By contrast, in Miami, \nMedicare HMOs receive about $615 per month for every enrollee, nearly \nthree times as much as in Vernon County.\n  At triple the reimbursement of Vernon County, it is little wonder \nthat HMOs in places like Miami are able to offer the wonderful \nadditional benefits to which proponents of Medicare HMOs point when \narguing for expanded use of managed care in Medicare, benefits like \nprescription drugs, eye glasses, and dental services.\n  Though it remains to be seen whether or not the Finance Committee's \nchanges to the formula will be sufficient, the blended formula approach \nappears to move in the right direction.\n  I also want to commend the authors of the Senate proposal, and of the \nWays and Means plan, for asking higher income Medicare beneficiaries to \npay a larger share of the cost of their Medicare part B services.\n  I proposed that very reform in 1992, as part of my 82+ point plan to \nreduce the deficit and balance the budget, and am glad to see it \nincluded in the two proposals.\n  Mr. President, I endorse this change. It should be made in order to \nhelp reduce the deficit.\n  But those who have sought to avoid criticism of this and other \nMedicare changes have used the pretense of the impending insolvency of \nthe Medicare trust fund, and in doing so they have done no favors to \nthe cause of deficit reduction.\n  Far from it.\n  By misrepresenting the facts to the American people, they have \nundermined and jeopardized the already politically difficult, but \nnevertheless necessary task, of reforming Medicare.\n  Mr. President, the problems created by deliberately misleading people \nabout the real need for Medicare reforms are compounded by a number of \nflawed, even harsh provisions.\n  These include the across-the-board increase in part B premiums and \ndeductibles.\n  Unlike the means-tested premium increase on upper income \nbeneficiaries, which I support, the across the board increases in \npremiums and deductibles hits lower income seniors and disabled.\n  Mr. President, the median income of elderly households is less than \nhalf that of non-elderly households. And incomes for the oldest old are \nby far the lowest of any age group.\n  Households headed by someone aged 75 or older had annual median \nincomes of less than $13,622 in 1992--$4,000 lower than the next lowest \nincome group, those of households headed by people between age 15 and \n24.\n  And over one-fourth of the elderly households have incomes of less \nthan $10,000 per year.\n  Mr. President, while the elderly are disproportionately poor, they \nalso spend far more on health care as a group than anyone else, and \nthis should not surprise us.\n  What may be surprising to some, however, is just how much our seniors \ndo pay already even with Medicare. In 1995, the average older \nbeneficiary will spend about $2,750 out-of-pocket for premiums, \ndeductibles, copayments, and for services not covered by Medicare.\n  I might add, Mr. President, that these costs do not include the \npotentially crushing costs of long-term care which can total nearly \n$40,000 in some areas for nursing home care.\n  The across-the-board increases in premiums and deductibles will only \nadd to these already high out-of-pocket costs.\n  Mr. President, let me add that under the current protections in our \nMedicaid program for lower income Medicare beneficiaries, some of the \nimpact on the poorest of our elderly would be softened, but the \nreconciliation measure eliminates the guarantee of help for those \nbeneficiaries. \n\n[[Page S 16092]]\n\n  Mr. President, rural seniors are among the most at risk under this \nlegislation.\n  Because rural areas depend on Medicare to support an already \ninadequate health care service capacity, the massive Medicare cuts hit \nrural seniors and providers especially hard.\n  Making matters worse is the so-called Budget Expenditure Limit Tool, \nor ``BELT'' provision included in the bill which provides for automatic \ncuts in the traditional Medicare fee-for-service program if budget \ntargets are not met.\n  Despite the improvements made to the Medicare HMO reimbursement \nformula, rural beneficiaries will continue to rely much more heavily on \nthe traditional Medicare fee-for-service program than their urban \ncounterparts, placing them at special risk because of the BELT \nprovision.\n  Mr. President, as bad as the Medicare cuts are, the Medicaid cuts may \nbe even worse.\n  Again, reforms to the current Medicaid program are clearly needed, \nnot only to improve services for those lower income families needing \nhealth care, but also to reduce the pressure on our budget deficit.\n  But the $182 billion in cuts proposed in this bill are unacceptable, \nas is the loss of the current Federal protections that ensure safe \nnursing home care, guarantee help for the poorest Medicare \nbeneficiaries, and provide the critical safety net of health care \nservices to poor women, children, and the disabled of all ages.\n  Though spousal impoverishment protections were retained in the \nprovisions reported by the Finance Committee, I am extremely concerned \nabout the prospects for spousal impoverishment when this measure goes \nto conference.\n  Comments made by the Speaker indicate that spousal impoverishment \nprotections are very much at risk.\n  Mr. President, I am equally concerned about reports of a little known \nchange in the law that permits States to bill the adult children of \nthose elderly needing long-term care services.\n  This smacks of a return to the days of bills of attainder and \nworkhouses for the families of those unable pay their debts.\n  Much has been said on other protections that have been eliminated and \nI will not repeat the arguments that have been made.\n  But, Mr. President, it is apparent that those seeking to tame our \nMedicaid budget do not understand the underlying forces which \ncontribute to the bulk of Medicaid growth, namely the rapidly \nincreasing need for long-term care services.\n  Though the elderly and disabled make up about one quarter of the \nMedicaid population, they account for 59 percent of the Medicaid \nbudget, with the bulk of expenditures for them going to long-term care \nservices.\n  Pressure on the long-term care budget will only increase.\n  Our Nation faces a rapidly growing population needing long-term care \nservices, a population which is disproportionately poor.\n  The answer, Mr. President, is not to turn Medicaid into a block grant \nprogram, imposing a unilateral cut, and shoving responsibility for \nthose left without services onto the States.\n  The answer is fundamental long-term care reform.\n  Along with Senator Paul Simon, I introduced a comprehensive long-term \ncare reform measure, S. 85, that would be an important first step in \nhelping States deal with this growing problem.\n  It is based on the bipartisan reforms we made in Wisconsin during the \n1980's, where we established consumer-oriented and consumer-directed \nhome and community-based services that allow those needing long-term \ncare to remain in their own homes and communities.\n  Those reforms helped bring Wisconsin's Medicaid budget under control, \nand saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. Between 1980 and \n1993, while Medicaid nursing home use increased by 47 percent \nnationally, in Wisconsin Medicaid nursing home use actually dropped 15 \npercent.\n  This is the kind of national long-term care reform that is needed to \ntame the Medicaid budget, offered a version of that proposal as an \namendment to this bill, but that amendment was defeated.\n  Mr. President, other provisions of the reconciliation bill are \nsignificantly flawed.\n  According to the Treasury Department, the bill's cuts to the Earned \nIncome Tax Credit amount to nothing more or less than a tax increase on \n17 million low-income, working Americans.\n  In my own State of Wisconsin, some 206,000 families will experience a \ntax increase of $330 on average in 2002, according to Treasury figures.\n  The assault on the Student Loan Program is also troubling.\n  The new limitation on direct lending programs adds real injury to \nthis insult, making it even more difficult for families to send their \nchildren to college.\n  Mr. President, as disturbing as the provisions contained in the \nmeasure are those which are not such as the lack of effective change to \nthe Federal Milk Marketing Order system.\n  Mr. President, the provisions in this bill with respect to dairy \npolicy could not be any worse for the Upper Midwest. The provisions \nreported by the Agriculture Committee dramatically reduce the support \nprice for milk, cutting the dairy price support program more than any \nother commodity on a proportionate  basis. The dairy program which \naccounted for less than two percent of commodity program spending in \n1994, took 9% of the cuts made by the Agriculture Committee in this \nbill. Those cuts could have been acceptable, Mr. President, if the \ninequities and market distortions of the Federal Milk Marketing Order \nsystem that have discriminated against the Upper Midwest had been \naddressed by the Committee.\n\n  Unfortunately, the Agriculture Committee abdicated their \nresponsibility on Market Order reform and left the system intact, \nleaving in place a bill that pulled the rug out from under \nmanufacturing prices for the Upper Midwest, and leaving in place the \nexcessive subsidies for fluid milk in other regions of the country.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, this bill did not stop there. Instead, \nduring floor action, the Senate granted its approval to the Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact which will allow six northeastern states to \nset artificially high prices for milk paid to their producers. Mr. \nPresident, to my knowledge, this is the first time that Congress has \ngranted approval to a price-fixing Interstate Compact. The Compact \nerects walls around the Compact states, preventing lower cost milk \nproduced outside the Compact region from entering those six states. It \nis protectionism in its worst form. This compact also provides a \nsubsidy to Compact-state processors who are forced to pay this higher \nprice for milk, in order to allow them to ship their products outside \nthe compact and remain competitive. Those compact products, produced \nand exported with the subsidy, will then compete with products produced \nby processors and producers in other states that have not been granted \nthis special privilege.\n  The Compact, Mr. President, is inherently market distorting, \nregionally discriminatory, and overly regulatory. I think this body \nwill regret providing its approval to this arrangement.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate included another provision during floor \ndebate that further worsens the inequities of the current system. The \nSenate approved a Class IV pricing scheme for inclusion in Federal Milk \nMarketing Orders which taxes all producers nationwide to support the \noverproduction of a couple of West Coast states. The Upper Midwest \ndairy producers and processors overwhelmingly oppose this provision \nbecause it adds just another layer of regulation to the already \ndiscriminatory milk marketing order system. It will reduce prices for \nall producers nationwide in order to pay for the surpluses produced on \nthe west coast. Wisconsin producers, while being denied an opportunity \nto share in the benefits of the highest class of milk, Class I milk, \nwill now be required to suffer the loss of the lowest priced class of \nmilk, even though they are not responsible for its production.\n  Mr. President, this bill represents the worst possible outcome for \nthe Upper Midwest dairy industry, and in particular, for Wisconsin \ndairy farmers. In short, Mr. President, the Senate approved some very \nbad policy which appears inconsistent with the principles of many \nmembers of this chamber and which is completely out of step with \n\n[[Page S 16093]]\nthe dairy marketing conditions of the 1990's.\n  Another area in which this bill remains far too silent relates to the \nlack of discipline imposed on our U.S. tax code. I am particularly \ndisappointed at the weak effort made to address the rapidly growing \nspending done through the tax code.\n  Along with tax cuts and defense spending, these tax loopholes are \nsacred cows in this budget.\n  At $400 billion and growing, these tax expenditures are among the \nmost important areas of Federal spending, and they are hardly touched \nin the reconciliation bill before the body.\n  Mr. President, many of the tax expenditures are certainly worthy, but \nothers are hard to justify.\n  Just like the inappropriate subsidies made through direct \nappropriations, many tax expenditures not only put pressure on the \nbudget deficit, they also distort the market place, lowering overall \neconomic efficiency of the Nation.\n  But, despite the clear need for careful scrutiny in this area, made \nall the more timely by our common goal of reducing the deficit, tax \nexpenditures are largely given a free pass.\n  Mr. President, it is obvious to all that the massive cuts to Medicare \nand Medicaid--nearly a half trillion dollars over the next 7 years--are \nfar more than are necessary to address our budget deficit, and in fact \nmake it more difficult to enact a budget plan that will balance the \nFederal books.\n  Nor can the health care system that provides care for the most \nvulnerable in our Nation be safely and prudently sustained with this \nkind of revenue loss.\n  The question occurs--why are these harsh cuts being proposed to the \nhealth care programs for our most vulnerable?\n  Mr. President, the inescapable conclusion is to fund a fiscally \nirresponsible quarter of a trillion dollar tax cut.\n  Mr. President, this tax cut not only jeopardizes the fundamental \nmissions of Medicare and Medicaid to provide health care for retirees, \npoor women, children, and the disabled of all ages, it also jeopardizes \nefforts to balance the Federal books.\n  Mr. President, if there were no quarter of a trillion dollar tax cut, \nwe could develop a bipartisan budget plan, including reductions in \nMedicare and Medicaid, that would balance the Federal books by 2002 or \neven sooner.\n  Mr. President, if there were no quarter of a trillion dollar tax cut, \nMedicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, and others, would be far more \nreceptive to calls for sacrifice, especially if they are told, honestly \nand straightforwardly, that those sacrifices are intended not just to \nbolster the Trust Fund, but to help get our Federal budget out of the \nred.\n  More importantly, Mr. President, if there were no quarter of a \ntrillion dollar tax cut, we could fashion a budget plan that would be \npolitically sustainable for the time it takes to reach balance and \neliminate the Federal budget deficit.\n  I have no doubt that the deep flaws in the reconciliation measure \nbefore us jeopardize the very goal the supporters of that measure \nprofess--a balanced Federal budget.\n  Mr. President, I find similar fault, though to a much lesser degree, \nwith the President's original budget as well as his later offering, \nboth of which retain a fiscally reckless tax cut, though one which, \nadmittedly, is much more modest than is being proposed by the \nRepublican leadership.\n  We cannot afford either the Democratic tax cut or the Republican tax \ncut, and we could go a long way toward reaching a politically \nsustainable budget agreement that would balance the Federal books by \n2002, and even sooner, if both parties scrapped their tax cut proposals \nand instead focused on eliminating the deficit.\n  Mr. President, contrary to the image portrayed by the spin doctors, \nit is the Senate that has produced the most significant reform in this \nCongress.\n  Bipartisan efforts in the area of gift ban, lobbying reform, and the \nbeginnings of campaign finance reform all have their roots here, in the \nUnited States Senate.\n  I earnestly hope this body will eventually put together the kind of \nsustainable, bipartisan deficit reduction plan that will balance the \nFederal budget before 2002, and do so without harming the most \nvulnerable in society. The key is to eliminate the absolutely \nirresponsible quarter of a trillion dollar tax cut.\n  If we can agree to do that, restrain the growth of tax loopholes, and \nput the Defense budget back on the budget table, we will have moved a \nlong way toward establishing a responsible glidepath to a balanced \nFederal budget, and elimination of the Federal budget deficit.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the bill. Along \nwith many Ohioans, I oppose the large Medicare cuts contained in the \nreconciliation bill and am concerned about their impact on all \nAmericans.\n\n\n                         Medicare and Tax Cuts\n\n  This bill calls for a $270 billion cut to the Medicare program yet \ngives away $245 billion in tax breaks--which disproportionately benefit \nwealthy Americans. I find it alarming that in order to achieve a $245 \nbillion reduction in taxes, we will slash services for seniors who \nchoose to keep their current Medicare coverage.\n  This enormous Medicare cut will not balance the budget because it \ngoes for a $245 billion tax break. To keep its Contract with America, \nRepublicans will break our thirty-year contract that has successfully \nhelped older Americans. The lesson here is the old story so often \nreflected in Republican economics: those who have, get; those who do \nnot, get stuck.\n  The tragedy here is that this massive Medicare cut is unnecessary. We \nall know the 1995 Medicare Board of Trustees report projected that the \nMedicare Part A Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund will run out of \nreserves in the year 2002. However, the Trustees also reported that \nonly $89 billion in savings are necessary to restore the trust fund's \nsolvency through 2006.\n  The budget plan before us, which was drawn up behind closed doors, \nachieves much of its $270 billion in Medicare savings by cutting \nspending in the areas of inpatient and outpatient services, home \nhealth, hospice and extended care, physician and ambulatory facility \nservices, and diagnostic test and durable medical equipment. For the \npeople in my home state of Ohio, this means there will be $8.9 billion \nfewer dollars for health care. For beneficiaries, this cut will mean \nincreased premiums, deductibles and co-payments for Medicare Part B \nservices--which include many of the services I just mentioned.\n  And how are we paying for it? We are going to cut taxes. We squeeze \n$270 billion from the elderly so that we can turn around and give $245 \nbillion of it away in tax cuts.\n  Now we have heard a lot of talk about how this side of the aisle is \njust engaging in demagoguery and class warfare. They tell us their bill \nis not slanted toward the wealthy. They say that this bill distributes \ntax cuts equally, regardless of your income.\n  But, the American people know better. They know that just because \nsomeone says it is so, does not make it so.\n  The real horror story of this reconciliation bill lies in the \nnumbers. And the numbers the other side has produced just do not add \nup. The numbers do not add up because not only does this proposal cut \nmedical care for America's seniors, but it raises taxes on the working \npoor by gutting the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). So you need to \nfactor in the Republican EITC tax increase when making any \ndistributional comparisons.\n  When you do that, you will find that people with less than $30,000 \nwill actually be worse off, come tax time, under this plan. But very \nwealthy taxpayers would be big winners. The wealthiest 13 percent of \ntaxpayers--those with incomes above $75,000--would receive 53 percent \nof the Senate tax cut. So the wealthiest 13 percent get 53 percent of \nthe benefits. Those making more than $200,000 would gain an average of \n$5,088 per taxpayer in the year 2000. By contrast, those with incomes \nbetween $20,000 and $75,000 would receive an average tax cut of only \n$320.\n\n\n                                Medicaid\n\n  The budget reconciliation's treatment of Medicaid is truly alarming. \nRepublicans would repeal the current Medicaid program and turn it over \nto the states as a fixed dollar amount block grant--eliminating the \nsafety \n\n[[Page S 16094]]\nnet for more than eight million pregnant women, children, disabled and \nelderly Americans, and weakening federal nursing home regulations that \nprotect the indigent and their families.\n  The federal government and the State of Ohio currently share in the \nfunding of the Medicaid program and provide more than 1.85 million \npoor, elderly and disabled Ohioans with physician, hospital and nursing \nhome care. Under the Republican proposal, Ohio would lose nearly $8 \nbillion in federal Medicaid dollars over the next seven years. To \noffset these cuts, Ohio would be forced to slash or eliminate health \nservices for low-income families and seniors, divert resources from \nother important programs, or raise taxes.\n  Many people do not realize that nearly 70 percent of Medicaid \nspending goes toward long-term care for the elderly and disabled. These \nrecipients are mostly middle-class Americans who are not aware that \nMedicare and most private insurance policies do not cover long-term \ncare. Many become eligible for Medicaid when they quickly deplete their \nincome and assets after entering a nursing home where costs average \n$3000 per month. Republican proposals would have abolished laws that \nprotect spouses from having to sell their homes and assets to pay for \nnursing home bills, but due to widespread opposition both the House and \nthe Senate wisely voted to retain spousal impoverishment protection.\n  However, the House version of the Republican Medicaid reform bill \nrepeals federal standards for nursing home and institutional care. This \nplan repeals such essential standards as quality assurance systems, \nstaffing requirements, restrictions on physical and chemical \nrestraints, and nutrition guidelines. I was pleased to support a \nsuccessful Senate amendment which provides for the continuation of \nfederal nursing home regulations and I will urge conferees to maintain \nfederal standards.\n   I support efforts to control the growth of federal health care \nspending, but I do not believe that Republicans should balance the \nbudget, and give tax breaks, at the expense of our nation's most \nvulnerable citizens. Reform of Medicare and Medicaid should concentrate \non strengthening and improving these important programs, not on \nsqueezing out the maximum amount of budget savings. Today, when \nmillions of Americans face limited access to medical care and live with \nthe fear that an illness or loss of a job will leave them without \nhealth care coverage and expose their families to financial ruin, I \nfeel it is essential to expand, rather than limit, access to medical \ncare.\n  There has been a great deal of debate about priorities in the Senate. \nI am not convinced the plan before the Senate is a fair reflection of \nAmerica's priorities. In fact, it is Robin Hood in reverse. This plan \nto take from the poor and give to the rich might make the Sheriff of \nNottingham proud, but it will not balance the budget.\n\n\n                                Education\n\n  The Republican budget cuts student loans by $10.8 billion. This makes \nit much harder for working families and their children to finance a \ncollege education. If these cuts became law, the school house door will \nbe closed for many students willing but unable to afford a college \neducation. Other students and their families will see their choices for \nan education narrowed.\n  The Republican proposal increases the interest rate on PLUS loans \ntaken out by parents. The interest rate on parental loans would \nincrease by 1 percent. Families considering PLUS loans are mostly \nworking middle-income who make too much to qualify for full \nscholarships but not enough to write a check for tuition.\n  The six-month grace period for graduating students would be \neliminated. Interest would pile up during that period and would be \nadded to the loan balance. The bill also charges schools a 0.85% fee on \nloans taken out by their students. This new tax on student loans will \nbe passed on to students and their families, either financially or \nthrough cuts in school programs and services.\n  I supported the amendment offered by Senator Kassebaum which restored \nsome of the cuts in the student loan program, but it is only a step in \nthe right direction and does not go far enough to ensure that working \nmiddle-income families can afford to provide higher educational \nopportunities for their children.\n\n\n                               Environment\n\n  I oppose the provision to allow oil and gas leasing of the coastal \nplain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).\n  The coastal plain of the ANWR is one of our remaining ecological \ntreasures, containing 18 major rivers, and providing habitat for 36 \nspecies of land mammals and more than 30 fish species. This pristine \nwilderness cannot be replaced. The impact of oil and gas leasing would \nforever alter this region. While proponents of leasing the ANWR argue \nthat America's oil dependency requires this resource, they also \nadvocate lifting the ban on exports of Alaska North Slope oil which is \ncontained in this legislation.\n  Americans are committed to protecting national parks and public \nlands. This commitment extends to protecting the ANWR even if the \nrevenues from leasing the area would be dedicated to deficit reduction. \nThe U.S. Geological Survey recently reduced its estimate of the \npotential oil yield from this area; therefore, the revenue assumptions \nin this bill may be grossly overstated. However, Mr. President, the \nenvironmental value of this natural area is far greater than any short \nterm economic gain from oil and gas development. I am also opposed to \nprovisions in the bill that will override existing environmental laws \nand cripple public health and environmental protections.\n  At the same time, this measure contains provisions that continue to \nprovide millions in annual federal subsidies to timber, mining, and \nranching industries. These subsidies not only lack economic \njustification but often cause environmental damage. Several of these \nprovisions have been previously defeated or have delayed consideration \nof other bills. Yet, in an effort to escape the notice of the American \npeople and circumvent the legislative process these dangerous measures \nhave been inserted into this massive reconciliation bill.\n  Although this bill contains provisions regarding the Mining Law of \n1872, it fails to ``reform'' the patenting process and continues to \nallow the taxpayers of this country to lose millions in revenues from \npublicly owned lands. In contrast to federal coal, oil, and gas leases \nfor which the government receives substantial royalty payments, \nhardrock minerals are virtually given away under a law that has not \nbeen significantly revised since 1872. This situation is \nunconscionable.\n  This measure also contains provisions from a federal grazing bill \nunder consideration in the House. These provisions codify grazing \nregulations that were in place prior to Secretary Babbitt's proposed \ngrazing revisions. Again, the American taxpayer and our nation's \nenvironment are the losers.\n  For all these reasons Mr. President, I have concluded that I cannot \nsupport the passage of this legislation and I urge my colleagues to \noppose the bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, this debate has been lengthy, and I will not \ndelay a final vote much longer. But I do want to take a minute or two \nto comment on what is a very historic day for the U.S. Senate.\n  I have cast over 12,000 votes during my years in the Capitol. Many of \nthose didn't have a great deal of impact on Americans, and are hard to \nrecall. But some votes you remember forever--they are the votes that \ntouch the life of every American, and that change the course of \nhistory.\n  I remember the vote on President Reagan's historic tax cut bill--and \nthe vote against President Clinton's historic tax increase bill.\n  I remember the vote which made Martin Luther King's birthday a \nFederal holiday--and I was pleased to lead the debate in favor of that \nbill.\n  And I vividly recall the vote authorizing President Bush to send \ntroops to the Persian Gulf.\n  And no doubt about it, the vote we will cast in just a few minutes is \none we will remember forever.\n  It is a vote for putting America on a path to a balanced budget.\n  It is a vote for low interest rates, so more Americans can own a \nhouse, buy a car, and send their children to college.\n  It is a vote that will give new life to the 10th amendment, because \nwe are \n\n[[Page S 16095]]\ntransferring power out of Washington, and returning it to the people, \nwhere it belongs.\n  It is a vote for cutting taxes, and allowing American families to \nkeep more of their hard earned money, and to make their own decisions \non how best they can spend it.\n  It is a vote for securing, strengthening, and preserving the Medicare \nProgram, on which so many of our seniors depend.\n  It is a vote for real, meaningful, and fundamental change.\n  And, above all, Mr. President, it is a vote for America's future. For \nour children and grandchildren--and their children and grandchildren.\n  It is a vote for the teenager who was in my office a few years back \nwith a group of high school students from across the country. And this \nyoung man said to me, ``Senator, everyone has someone in Washington who \nrepresents them. Someone speaks for labor, for the farmers, for \nbusiness . . . but no one speaks for us. No one speaks for America's \nfuture.''\n\n  I do not know where that young man is today, but if he happens to be \nlistening, I want to tell him that at long last, someone is speaking \nfor you, some one is speaking for American's future. This Republican \nCongress had the courage to look beyond the next election, and ask what \nis best for the next generation.\n  But I would also tell this young man that our battle on behalf of the \nnext generation is far from over. President Clinton will veto the final \nreconciliation bill that will be reported out of conference, the forces \nof the status quo will do all in their power to return to business as \nusual.\n  President Clinton says he wants change. But his actions speak much \nlouder than his words.\n  He says he wants to balance the budget, and at various times, he says \nhe can do it in either 5 years, 10 years, 8 years, or 7 years--but each \nbudget he has proposed doesn't balance the budget in 100 years.\n  He says he wants to cut taxes for the middle class, but he inflicted \nthe largest tax increase in history on the American people.\n  He says he wants to save Medicare from its impending bankruptcy, but \nhe has refused again and again to join in a bipartisan effort to do so.\n  Instead of providing leadership, the President has been content to \nsit on the sidelines and use increasingly harsh rhetoric to scare the \nAmerican people.\n  And that rhetoric reached new lows yesterday with the sad remarks of \nthe President's press secretary, which I will not dignify by repeating.\n  And there is no doubt that these past few days of debate on the \nSenate floor have created quite a few sound bites for the nightly news.\n  Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle would have you \nbelieve that each and every Republican Senator has it out for Americans \nin need.\n  I just wish that each time the media reported one of these phony \naccusations, they would follow it up by reporting the truth.\n  And the truth is, the Republican plan reins in government spending \nby slowing its rate of growth. The truth is, more than 70 percent of \nour tax cuts go to working families making less than $75,000 per year. \nThe truth is, the Republican budget allows Medicare to grow by an \naverage of 7 percent per year. Medicare beneficiaries will receive more \nmoney next year than they do this year, and they will keep on receiving \nmore year after year after year.\n\n  It truly shows you just how ingrained the status quo is here in \nWashington, how accustomed the liberals have become to spending \nAmerican's money, when they attack us for wanting to slow the budget's \nrate of growth.\n  I remember a few years back, when we were having a serious national \ndebate on the proposal by former Senators Rudman and Tsongas--one a \nRepublican and one a Democrat--to freeze the Federal budget. Just think \nwhat the rhetoric would be like if we had proposed a freeze. But we \nhave not. Instead, we've proposed limiting Government's growth to $350 \nbillion over the next 7 years.\n  So I say to my friends in the media: You have a duty to report the \ntruth to the American people. Report that Medicare will grow, not get \ncut. Report that Republicans are giving working families a tax cut, and \nnot a giveaway to the rich.\n  Let me close by saluting Senator Domenici for the outstanding job he \nhas done throughout this debate. I know how much time and energy he has \ninvested over the years in the quest for a balanced budget, and I like \nto think that I know how much this vote means to him.\n  Congratulations, as well, to Senator Roth, for his leadership in \nachieving the historic tax cuts contained in this budget, as well as \nthe Medicare provisions, which involved a tremendous amount of work.\n  Mr. President, it's no secret this vote is not the end of the budget \nprocess. We have repeatedly said that if President Clinton has \nconstructive ideas to offer, we are ready to listen. But, with or \nwithout the President's help, we're determined to deliver the change \nthe American people voted for, determined to move America forward, and \ndetermined to continue speaking for America's future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask for third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the \nconsideration of H.R. 2491, the House-passed reconciliation bill; that \nall after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 1357, as \namended, be inserted in lieu thereof. Further, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the bill be read for the third time, and the Senate then vote on \npassage of the bill, with the above occurring without any intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me just indicate to my colleagues there \nwill not be a session on Monday. If there is, it will be pro forma \nonly. Let me thank my colleagues for their cooperation. This has been a \nvery important, very historic vote. There is a lot taking place here on \nthis vote. I hope we can have a unanimous vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Midnight.\n  Mr. DOLE. Midnight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass? The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 556 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings \n\n[[Page S 16096]]\n\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n  So, the bill (H.R. 2491), as amended, was passed.\n  Mr. EXON.

I ask unanimous consent that S. 1537 be returned to the \ncalendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I want to take a moment, if I might, to \nthank all Senators on both sides of the aisle, especially my friend and \ncolleague, the chairman of the committee, for his consideration all the \nway through this process. We have had a great deal of help from the \nleader, from Senator Dorgan, Senator Kerrey, Senator Ford; the whole \nDemocratic leadership has been very helpful and supportive all the way \nthrough this most difficult process.\n  In the end, though, as we always do, and should, I will take time out \nto thank the very dedicated staff. I have been on the Budget Committee \nfor the 17 years that I have been in the U.S. Senate. I think we have \nbeen particularly well blessed with excellent staff on both sides of \nthe aisle that work very, very well together.\n  So I congratulate the chairman of the committee, whom it is my \npleasure to work with. We will be working together in the future on a \nwhole series of matters.\n  I want to end up tonight by taking a moment to thank the Democratic \nstaff members of the Budget Committee for the truly outstanding job \nthey did during the consideration of the reconciliation bill and \nthrough all of the procedures that we had in the Budget Committee. I \nwould like to extend my appreciation, therefore, on our side to the key \nmembers of our staff: Amy Abraham, Andy Blocker, Kelly Dimock, Tony \nDresden, Jodi Grant, Matt Greenwald, Joan Huffer, Bill Dauster, Jim \nKlumpner, Nell Mays, Sue Nelson, John Rosenwasser, and Jerry Slominski.\n  Mr. President, these were outstanding people that do an outstanding \njob. I thank them for their dedication, talent, and for all the help \nthat they give not only to the ranking Democrat but all Democratic \nmembers of the committee. I thank them very much.\n  If I did, I did not leave out Phil Karsting intentionally. The leader \nof that group, of course, is Phil Karsting, who has been there for \nseveral years now as the central director of everything that we do on \nthe Budget Committee. He has been sitting here advising Members of the \nDemocratic side and working closely with many people on the other side \nof the aisle. I have always been particularly impressed with the good \nworking relationship that Bill has with the Bill on that side. That is \nwhat makes things work in the end. I am very proud of all of the staff.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I just want to thank all Members, as I did \nbefore. I thank the Democratic leader. We were able to work together. \nWe had 58 votes. We were on the bill 42 hours. As the Senator from West \nVirginia pointed out, we had a record number of votes today--39. So we \nexceeded both records that the Senator from West Virginia talked about \nearlier.\n  I particularly thank the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, \nSenator Domenici, his staff, my staff, and all the staff on this side. \nAlso, a special thanks to the Senator from Alaska, who has been \npresiding much of the day. We appreciate the way he has handled the \nduties of the chair. It has made it much easier for all of us.\n  Also, I thank my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Lott, who has \nactively been working on a daily basis to find out how many votes we \nwould have on these various amendments, and for all the cooperation we \nhave had on this side of the aisle.\n  This is a historic vote. We have to go to conference, and it is not \ngoing to be easy. We need to pass the conference report. There is an \nindication that the President may veto the bill. I hope that is not the \ncase. Any way you look at it, this is a historic vote. We watched the \nHouse yesterday sail through theirs in about 6 or 8 hours. It took us a \nlittle longer, but the results were the same.\n  Mr. President, 52 out of 53 Republicans have voted for this historic \npackage, which is going to mean a lot of things to a lot of people, \nwhether it is preserving and strengthening Medicare, or reforming \nwelfare, or cutting taxes for families with children--not the rich, but \nfamilies with children and, most importantly, balance the budget by \n2002. I do not care where you are, who you are, what your politics are, \npeople want to balance the budget. That is precisely the reason we have \ngone through this effort day after day, week after week, in all the \ncommittees, and that is why all the chairmen and all the others have \nbeen working so hard.\n  Now it becomes a special responsibility for the Budget Committee \nchairman in the conference, working with Republicans and Democrats. We \nare not going to waste any time. We are going to start on Monday. We \nhave work being done this weekend by the staff. Monday, I will meet \nwith the Speaker, and we will be talking about how we can speed up the \nconference and how we can, if possible, meet the deadline by November \n13 to have a conference report. So we are working on the conference \nalready. We have had staff looking into some of the areas in sort of a \npre-conference effort. I believe we will be able to complete our work.\n  Again, I say to the President of the United States: If you want to \nmake some arrangement, or negotiate, whatever, I think both the Speaker \nand I have said, again this morning, we are prepared to meet. We think \nit would be a little presumptuous of us to call the President. But if \nhe wants to call us, obviously, we are more than willing to sit down \nwith the President of the United States to talk about what we are \ndoing, what he hopes to do and see if there is any common ground.\n  Again, I thank all my colleagues.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I thank Senator Dole for his kind \nwords, and might I say to more people than I can mention how much I \nappreciate their efforts. I say with a bit of pride that the Budget \nCommittee is frequently not liked around here. They seem to always be \ntelling somebody what to do. Those who serve on the Budget Committee \nknow that this all started there. Without that budget resolution and \nthis process, we would clearly not be changing the country from the way \nit is being run today, from the way Government is run to the way we \nwould like it. I am very proud of it.\n  I have been working at it about 22 years, and I never thought we \nwould get to this night. We still have some work to do, but there can \nbe no doubt that we have proven that using the procedures of the U.S. \nCongress, as onerous and difficult as they are, we can get a balanced \nbudget; that we can change programs to meet the goals and objectives of \nour people, and to do that which is best for America.\n  It is obvious to everyone that America cannot continue to spend $482 \nmillion a day more than it takes in. The real goal is to pay our bills \nas we accrue those bills, and let the adults take care of the problems \nof our country and not pass them on to our children and grandchildren. \nThat is the issue. Do we want strong money and a strong economy, lower \ninterest rates and our standard of living going up? Or do we want to \nwatch it dwindle away, little by little, as that gigantic deficit will \ndo? We have shown that we can change things enough to change the course \nof the economic history of our Nation, I think, for the better.\n  Obviously, none of this could be done without some fantastic staff \npeople. I do not have a list of all of ours, but I am going to just say \nthat without Bill Hoagland at our side, we probably would not be here. \nHe comes up with the ideas, and I get credit for it, or Senator Dole \ndoes, or even Sheila does. Everybody gets ideas from Bill Hoagland, and \nthey are right more times than not.\n  There are a few Senators to thank. Hard work was done in one \ncommittee, the Committee on Finance. I am sorry \n\n[[Page S 16097]]\nwe instructed you to save so many dollars and cut so many taxes. But \nthe Finance Committee, led by Bill Roth, did a magnificent job. That \nwas obvious here today. A special thanks to Spencer Abraham, a member \nof our committee, who worked hard. I asked him to do a special job for \nme, in a special way, and he did it very well. I thank him so much for \nthat.\n  With that, let me say one more time, as I have many times in the \npast, thanks to Senator Exon, who I frequently slip and call Governor, \nfor the wonderful job that he does in representing his side of the \naisle in getting this work done.\n  He and his staff also are nothing but quality and excellence, and to \nthe minority leader who is standing here now, I want to say thank you. \nIt was difficult at first to reach some accommodation.\n  It was sort of like we were shadowboxing maybe for the first 7 or 8 \nhours. In fact, you might have wondered whether we would ever get in \nthe ring. That was by design. Yet, you got much of what you wanted by \nway of votes for your people, and we got what we wanted: Final passage \nof a great bill.\n  I want to begin by thanking my colleagues. I wish to thank the staff \nand all members of the Budget Committee for their hard work. I would \nalso like to thank all of the committee chairmen who worked so \ndiligently to meet the terms of the budget resolution and add flesh to \nits bones.\n  Also, I would thank the able ranking member, Senator Exon, he is a \nfine friend and an able adversary. The Senate will be a poorer \ninstitution when he departs next year.\n  And, finally, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the \nconstant and determined leadership of the majority leader, Senator \nDole. We all know, he is a remarkable American. And his commitment to \nkeeping his promise to the American people--to give them the first \nbalanced Federal budget in 26 years--is the reason we are here tonight. \nAs always, he has kept his word and has provided this Nation the \nhonest, effective, and steadfast leadership that has defined his tenure \nin this body.\n  I speak about Senator Dole's leadership because that's what the vote \nwe are about to cast is all about. Leadership. Honest leadership that \nprotects America today, and tomorrow.\n  Leaders, it's been said, are the custodians of a nation. Of its \nideals, its values, its hopes and aspirations. Those things which bind \na nation, and make it more than a mere aggregation of individuals.\n  But governing for today is much easier than leading for the future. \nIt does not take a great deal of talent or courage to solve the \nimmediate need. It's not a lot harder to pave a pathway for the future.\n  Yet, we who serve in public office have a responsibility to protect \nthe future. We must work on behalf of those who will follow us, our \nchildren and grandchildren. We are the trustees of their future, of \ntheir legacy of their opportunities.\n  Leadership requires courage. It requires boldness and foresight to \nsafeguard a nation's ambitions and confront its challenges.\n  President John Kennedy put it this way when he said: ``To those to \nwhom much is given, much is required.'' And he reminded us that, as \npublic servants, we would be judged, at least in part, by our courage.\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  Eight months ago my Republican colleagues and I began a courageous \neffort to throttle runaway Federal spending and give the American \npeople the first balanced Federal budget in more than a quarter \ncentury.\n  We knew it would be difficult. We knew it would require determination \nand endurance. But we had promised the American people we would balance \nthe budget and put an end to the persistent deficit spending that has \nbeen bleeding our Nation dry.\n  A deficit growing by $482 million a day; $335 thousand a minute; and \n$55 hundred every second. Let me repeat that last figure again--our \ndeficit is currently growing at $5,500 a second.\n  Deficit spending is draining the economic lifeblood of our country.\n  It's heaping mountains of debt upon our children and which will drag \nthem down. We are irresponsibly shackling our kids with our bills. And, \nleft unchanged, they will be the first generation of Americans to \nsuffer a lower standard of living and less opportunity than their \nparents.\n  Yet, if we pass the budget before us, we can reverse this tide.\n  This budget will restore our Nation's fiscal equilibrium and preserve \nAmerica as the ``land of opportunity'' for this and future generations. \nIt reflects a commitment to fiscal responsibility, generating economic \ngrowth, creating family-wage jobs, and protecting the ``American \nDream'' for all our citizens--young and old alike.\n  This is not just rhetoric. A recent DEI study concluded a balanced \nbudget would boost America's yearly output by 2.5 percent over the next \n10 years. And it would mean 2.4 million more jobs by 2005.\n  Further, a recent GAO study suggests that an average family's income \nwill increase as much as $11,200 over the next 30 years. And the CBO \nsays interest rates will decline by as much as 1.7 percentage points by \n2002.\n  That means less debt for our children and more money in the pockets \nof working Americans today.\n  Opponents of this budget have employed every trick, every political \nmaneuver, and every scare tactic to halt our march to a balanced budget \nand forging a more efficient and more responsive Federal Government.\n  But here are the unvarnished facts:\n  Under our budget, Federal spending will continue to grow, We'll spend \n$12 trillion over the next 7 years. That's only $890 billion less than \nwe would otherwise spend.\n  We balance the budget without touching Social Security.\n  This budget shrinks the Federal bureaucracy, eliminating many Federal \ndepartments, agencies, and programs.\n  We move money and power out of Washington and back to citizens in \ntheir States and communities.\n  This budget reforms the welfare system while maintaining a safety net \nfor those in true need, especially children.\n  And it preserves, improves, and protects Medicare.\n  We began this debate by calling for unity in this effort. It was our \nhope that all of us, Republican and Democrat alike, would shoulder our \nbasic responsibilities. We asked colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto work together in the bipartisan spirit the American people are \nlooking for.\n  We only requested that we move swiftly, while we still have time, to \nconfront the debt crisis that threatens to suffocate our nation's \nvitality and snuff out its economic growth.\n  But rather than cooperation, we were met with confrontation. That's \ntoo bad. Because at every turn in this process, this Senator has tried \nto reach out to my Democrat colleagues and to the White House in hopes \nthey would work with us.\n  Yet, they declined. I believed they did so because they \nunderestimated Republicans stamina and the determination of the \nAmerican people on this issue. They didn't think we would do it. They \nthought we would fold.\n  Instead, we persevered. We did something rare in this town. We have \nkept out word, stuck to our objectives, and, despite the misleading \nrhetorical flack fired by the guardians of the status quo, kept our \nword.\n  So as we prepare to take the final vote on this package I want to say \nto my colleagues you may not agree with every item in this package. \nThere may be some portions you would like to change. That may happen.\n  But I want to also remind you that it is an honest, straightforward \nbalanced budget. No smoke. No mirrors. No rosy scenario. Just balance.\n  The President says he'll veto this budget. I wish he wouldn't but I \nthink I understand the game the White House is playing.\n  He says he has a kinder, gentler budget that somehow magically gets \nto balance while spending nearly $300 billion more in domestic \nprograms. He says he can get to balance by spending more and cutting \nless.\n  Sound phony? That is because it is. The President's so-called budget \nhides $475 billion in blue smoke and mirrors.\n  It's a political document, hastily thrown together last June in \nresponse to Republican determination and our passage of the budget \nresolution.\n  That is why if we don't pass this budget tonight, we will not have a \nbalanced budget. Because the reality is \n\n[[Page S 16098]]\nthat throughout this debate we have had to drag this White House \nkicking and screaming toward a balanced budget.\n  The chronology is clear. This White House opposed the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment, its first budget waved the white flag of \nsurrender at the deficit, and, as I said, it only offered a fig-leaf \nbalanced budget after Republicans passed the real thing.\n  I believe there is still hope. I am ready to meet with budget leaders \nat the White House anytime so they might join with us in fashioning a \nbudget that gets to balance in 7 years.\n  I'm ready to do it now. Tonight. This weekend. Yet the White House \nhas it's veto strategy and, apparently, feels we must go through this \nlittle mating dance before we get down to business.\n  But if we don't pass this budget tonight that will never happen. The \nborn-again budget balancers at the White House will quickly fall off \nthe wagon and deficits will continue.\n  So we can not be swayed by veto threats. We must continue to move \nforward.\n  Senators, this is a historic vote. I've waited years for this vote. \nIt is one more step toward the balanced budget the American people have \nbeen screaming for. It is a vote for responsibility. It is a vote for \naccountability. And it's a vote to stop this Government from borrowing \n$5,500 a second to buy everything it wants and begin considering what \nit can afford.\n  Admiral Halsey told us: ``There aren't great men. There are just \ngreat challenges that ordinary men like and me are forced by \ncircumstances to meet.''\n  Tonight this Senate faces a great challenge. Let us--ordinary men and \nwomen--have the courage to meet that challenge and, in doing so, \npreserve America's promise of opportunity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill that we passed be printed. We \ndo not have it printed yet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [The bill was not available for printing. It will appear in the \nRecord of Monday, October 30, 1995.]\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nebraska for the remarkable job that he did in representing our \nside during these very difficult days. He has worked with all of the \nMembers of this caucus, as he always does, with professionalism and \nleadership.\n  I personally appreciate the contribution that he has made, along with \nhis excellent staff. They have done all the work on this bill from our \nside in representing us and they have done an outstanding job. I \napplaud them as well.\n  Mr. President, the tragedy underlying the passage of this \nreconciliation bill is that it fails completely to reflect political \nconsensus. We all agree on the need to balance the budget, but there \nhas been no effort by the Republican majority to address Democrats' \nconcerns and the very real concerns of the American people.\n  We have stated time and again that we want to work with the majority \nto produce a bipartisan solution to the deficit problem. The President \nof the United States has held out his hand in an offer of cooperation. \nInstead of cooperation, we have been cut out, shut out, and our \nconcerns have been ignored.\n  Along with us, the American people have been shut out of this \nprocess, and their values have been trampled upon. As people are \nrealizing how they and their families will be affected in a real way, \nthey are increasingly rejecting the Republican budget plan.\n  The plain fact is that Democrats have a clear and successful track \nrecord of reducing the deficit. In 1993, we achieved $600 billion in \ndeficit reduction without a single Republican vote. The result is that \nthe deficit, as a percentage of the economy, is this year at the lowest \nlevel since 1979.\n  The deficit has fallen for 3 years in a row for the first time since \nHarry Truman was President. In fact, the 1993 economic plan is working \nbetter than even the Administration or the Congressional Budget Office \nhad projected. That is because the economy has performed better than \nprojected since 1993 due to the success of the President's economic \nplan.\n  While we seek to balance the budget, we also understand that there is \na right way and a wrong way to do it. The budget plan before us is the \nwrong way. Unlike the Republicans in 1993, this year we offered to \ncooperate in good faith so long as our basic concerns were on table.\n  We said $270 billion in Medicare cuts to pay for $245 billion in tax \nbreaks for the wealthy was unacceptable. And we asked that the \npriorities in this budget be changed to protect children, the elderly, \nthose with disabilities, working families, rural America, and the \nenvironment. This debate is about people: seniors who need Medicare, \nyoung people who need an education, families who need a fair income--\nand greater stability, and rural people who want to preserve their way \nof life.\n  That is why we are here. It is what unites us as Democrats. It is why \nwe have fought so hard and so long against the harmful provisions of \nthis bill.\n  None of our concerns was addressed. The majority did not budge one \ninch on any of the extreme proposals they made.\n  As a result, this budget is ``DBA''--dead before arrival--and is \ncertain to get the veto it so richly deserves.\n  This is a ``reconciliation'' bill in name only. Certainly there was \nno reconciliation with Democrats. There were no hearings, no \nconsultation with Democrats, and virtually no time for debate.\n  Senate Republicans held a private markup in the Finance Committee, \nlocking out committee Democrats for the first time in history. The \ncongressional majority has exercised rigid party discipline, forcing \nevery one of its members to march in lockstep even if they disagree \nwith the fundamental direction of their leadership.\n  The Senate received its first look at this package only one week ago. \nIt was not printed and available to all Senators and the public until \nthis Tuesday. The result is a 2000-page abomination we are only now \nbeginning to understand.\n  This far-reaching, extreme package is being rushed through Congress \nbefore public opposition can bring it down. The authors of this budget \nhave not built a consensus with anyone, except themselves. They claim a \nmandate for their radical course--as if wishing would make it so.\n  This budget does not reflect the hopes and needs of most Americans. \nNor have we reconciled our problems with the deficit.\n  Under this budget, in the year 2002, there will still be a deficit of \nover $100 billion, and we will use Social Security money to pay it off. \nMaybe that is why 80 percent of the American people, in a recent poll, \nsaid they believe this bill will not balance the budget. They know it, \nand we know it.\n  The only reconciliation that has taken place has occurred in the \nSpeaker's office--in backroom deals between the right and the far \nright--and between the Republican leadership and a line of special \ninterests that just keeps getting longer. And longer.\n  Mr. President, our country deserves better than this. This is not \nwhat the American people voted for last year.\n  The American people did not vote last year to cut $457 billion in \nhealth benefits to give tax handouts to those who do not need them. \nThey did not vote last year to cut education to millions of students so \nthat some of America's largest and wealthiest corporations could pay no \ntaxes at all. The American people did not vote last year to raise taxes \non American families making less than $30,000 so the richest Americans \ncould pay $6,000 less. Nor did they vote not to have a farm bill for \nthe first time in 80 years.\n  They did not vote for this budget plan then, and they do not support \nit now.\n  Mr. President, this bill is not a product of the reconciliation \nprocess. It is an abuse of the reconciliation process.\n  What is in this monstrous package? It contains the largest health \ncare cuts in American history. Two hundred seventy billion dollars in \nMedicare cuts alone. The mask is off those who have argued that their \nintention is to ``save'' Medicare. Their real purpose is to dismantle \nMedicare.\n  Three days ago the Republican leaders of both Houses of Congress made \nclear their real intentions. One stated that creating Medicare was a \nmistake in the first place, and the other said that Medicare as we know \nit will ``wither on the vine.'' Their recent \n\n[[Page S 16099]]\nstatements help explain why they insist on cutting $270 billion from \nMedicare, when only $89 billion is needed to restore its solvency for \nthe next eleven years. As a first step toward abolishing the program, \nthey are cutting Medicare three times more than necessary to pay for \ntheir ``crown jewel'' offering to the special interests: $245 billion \nin tax breaks.\n  Mr. President, this attack on Medicare reveals how far out of touch \nwith the American people the proponents of this bill have become. \nMedicare is one of the greatest success stories of our time. The \nAmerican people know that, even if some of their politicians have \nforgotten.\n  In 1965, before the creation of Medicare, 46 percent of seniors had \nhealth care coverage. Today, 99 percent are covered. Does the majority \nwant to bring us back to the ``good old days'' when only half of our \nsenior citizens had health insurance? It would be heartless to go back \nto the age when our older citizens suffered needlessly from disease and \neven premature death because they had no access to health care.\n  The consequences of these Medicare cuts will be severe. Hospitals \nwill be forced to close. Couples will be forced to pay an average of \n$2,800 more for health care by 2002. Clearly, Medicare is being used as \na piggy bank to fund tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, with no \nregard to the damage to the health care of senior citizens in America.\n  This bill dismantles Medicaid. At a time when we have unacceptably \nhigh numbers of Americans with no health care coverage, it would \ndeprive an additional 36 million Americans guaranteed health care \ncoverage under Medicaid.\n  A recent study by the Consumers Union and the National Health Law \nProgram estimates that 12 million Americans--half of them children--\nwould lose their health care coverage under this proposal. Surely the \nmajority doesn't think the American people voted last year to increase \nthe number of uninsured.\n  Older Americans and their families also have reason to fear the \ndestruction of Medicaid. One-half of the nursing home patients in the \nU.S., including over 1 million senior citizens, rely on Medicaid. What \nwill happen to the quality of their care under this bill? What \njustifies putting the spouses and adult children of nursing home \nresidents at risk of bankruptcy?\n  That is not what the American people voted for last year either.\n  The majority is telling these people and their families, ``You're on \nyour own.''\n  Republicans say, ``Don't worry about those details. Think about the \ntax relief in this bill.'' But there is no tax relief in this bill for \naverage Americans. There are only new tax burdens for them.\n  Despite the Republican promises, the typical family in this country \nearning less than $30,000 will see their taxes increase under this \nbill. And half of all families in the U.S. have incomes below $30,000.\n  This bill represents the biggest transfer of income from the lower \nand middle income levels to the wealthy that we have ever seen. In one \nfell swoop, it destroys 30 years of investment in our people.\n  Most of the pain in the budget--affecting seniors, children, working \nfamilies, rural America, and the environment--is driven by the \ninsatiable greed on the part of the congressional majority for tax \nbreaks that benefit the wealthiest Americans and large corporations. \nThe richest one percent of Americans--those earning over $350,000--will \nget an average tax break of $5,626.\n  Many large corporations will pay no taxes at all under this bill.\n  Not only do these generous handouts to the wealthy require huge cuts \nin education and health care and so many other areas, they are fiscally \nirresponsible. The tax breaks will add $293 billion to the debt over \nthe next seven years--$293 billion in added debt that our children will \nhave to pay off! The costs of those tax breaks will explode after the 7 \nyears covered in this budget. To those who profess that this effort is \nintended to save our children from the crushing burden of our debts, I \nwould ask them to explain this hypocrisy.\n  For all the talk we have heard about how this plan is intended to \nbenefit children and future generations, the actual provisions of the \nbill reveal a different story.\n  The bill launches an assault on education in this country. By cutting \nbillions for student loans, this bill closes the door on a college \neducation for many Americans.\n  Other children's priorities are savaged as well. By 2002, up to 6.5 \nmillion children could lose health coverage. Food stamps will be cut. \nFoster care payments will be capped, threatening to throw us back to \ndependence on the orphanages the Speaker proposes. Countless children \nthreatened with abuse may never benefit from investigations of their \nsituations. This bill plays a shell game with the $3 billion in child \ncare funds that were included in the Senate welfare reform bill. It \ncuts Title XX, the states' primary source of child care money, by $3.3 \nbillion. It is ``Home Alone II'' for children whose families are trying \nto work their way off welfare.\n  Another giant item stuffed into this package is the 1995 farm bill, \nwhich drops a bomb on rural America. For the first time in history, the \nfarm bill was included in the reconciliation package. There were no \nhearings on the Republican plan.\n  The bill cuts farm programs by 25 percent. Net farm income will \ndecline under this measure by $9 billion. This devastating blow comes \non top of the other hits on rural America in the bill --ravaging rural \nhealth care and closing hospitals, tax increases on working families, \nelimination of rural educational opportunities.\n  Taken as a whole, this package amounts to a raid on rural America \nthat will devastate our rural way of life--perhaps forevermore.\n  Have we learned nothing from our recent history?\n  This bill asks us to take another riverboat gamble, like the one \nRonald Reagan took when he called for huge tax breaks for the wealthy \nin 1981. We all lost that gamble when deficits soared in the 1980s as a \nresult. In fact, if it were not for the cost of interest payments on \nthe debt built up under Presidents Reagan and Bush, the budget would be \nbalanced today.\n  No wonder the American people fear another roll of the dice. \nAccording to a recent poll, the public rejects the tax break proposals \nin this budget by a margin of nearly 3 to 1. The American people have \nlearned a costly lesson from Reagan's riverboat gamble. Eighty-one \npercent said they believed that even if the Republican plan is enacted, \nthe budget will not be balanced by 2002.\n  We are saying no to another riverboat gamble, and we will do so with \none voice. Unlike 1981, every Senate Democrat will oppose this budget.\n  This budget is fundamentally flawed. It does not strengthen America. \nIt weakens America. It does not bring us together, it moves us apart. \nThe ``haves'' will have more, and the rest will have less.\n  Worst of all, this budget does not reflect the priorities of the \nAmerican people. The American people reject the idea of cutting taxes \nbefore the budget is balanced. They disapprove of the Republican \nMedicare plan. As the American people are learning whose side this \nbudget is on, they are demanding we change it.\n  Senate Democrats offered a series of amendments to correct these \ngross inequities in this bill, both in committee and on the Senate \nfloor. Virtually every one was defeated on a party-line vote. As a \nresult, the destructive, dangerous excesses contained in this bill will \nnot receive a single vote from our side of the aisle. This bill \ndeserves a veto by the President of the United States--and vetoed it \nwill be.\n  This budget is mean and extreme. It rewards the rich and ravages the \nrest. It punishes families who need our help most to pay for tax breaks \nfor those who need handouts the least.\n  It is the wrong plan, for the wrong reason, done the wrong way, to \nhelp the wrong people.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, much of what the minority leader just had to \nsay has been said over and over again. It, I think, has been answered \nsufficiently, but it is very hard to sit here and listen to that speech \nafter all that we have been through for the last three days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/27/senate-section/article/S16084-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S 16100]]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the critically \nimportant issue of United States aviation relations with the Government \nof Japan.\n  Last month, the United States commenced talks with the Japanese aimed \nat liberalizing the transpacific cargo market. This is a welcome \ndevelopment and I hope an agreement liberalizing cargo service \nopportunities can be reached by no later than March of next year--the \nmutually agreed upon timetable. Clearly, consumers of cargo services on \nboth sides of the Pacific would be the big winners if such an agreement \nis struck. Talks on more contentious passenger carrier issues have not \nbeen scheduled.\n  As should now be clear from the numerous floor statements I have made \nin this body in recent months, I have a keen interest in United States-\nJapan aviation relations. As Chairman of the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation, I will continue to make it a priority. At \nthe outset of my remarks today, let me emphasize several related \npoints. Although these remarks refer primarily to passenger carrier \nissues, they apply with equal force to cargo relations with the \nJapanese.\n  First, from a long-term perspective and due to its key strategic \nlocation in the Asia-Pacific aviation market, aviation relations with \nthe Japanese unquestionably are our single most important international \naviation relationship. At the same time service opportunities in Japan \nare expanding, air service markets in Asian countries best accessed \nthrough Japanese gateway airports are growing at an astounding rate.\n  Simply put, meaningful participation in the rapidly expanding Asia-\nPacific market is absolutely critical for the long-term profitability \nof our airline industry. For instance, the International Air Transport \nAssociation estimates that between 1993 and 2010 scheduled \ninternational passenger service in Vietnam will grow at an average \nannual rate of 17.3 percent. International air service opportunities in \nChina are expected to grow at an annual rate of 12.6 percent over the \nsame period. Overall, it is expected the Asia-Pacific market will \naccount for approximately 50 percent of world air traffic by 2010.\n  Second, geographic factors coupled with the limited range of \ncommercial aircraft make it essential that carriers seeking to \neffectively serve these rapidly expanding Asia-Pacific markets can \nprovide that service from Japan either directly or indirectly through a \nJapanese code-sharing partner. As distinguished from the bottleneck at \nLondon's Heathrow International Airport, overflight to markets beyond \nJapan is not an option since the distances to these markets from the \nUnited States are too great. Moreover, as shown by recent unsuccessful \nexperiences, serving the Pacific-Asian market through other gateway \ncountries does not appear to be a viable alternative.\n  Third, aviation relations with Japan are a very important national \ntrade issue and it is imperative they be treated as such. Indeed, \ndiscussion of air service opportunities to and beyond Japan is one of \nthe United States' most important trade issues being discussed with any \nof our trading partners. The stakes in these talks are enormous. For \nexample, the United States currently enjoys an approximately $5 billion \nnet trade surplus with Japan for passenger air travel in the Asia-\nPacific market.\n  I cannot emphasize strongly enough the importance of our current and \nfuture aviation negotiations with the Japanese. Handled properly, air \nservice negotiations with the Japanese could enhance the ability of our \npassenger and cargo carriers to participate in the rapidly expanding \nAsia-Pacific market. Handled poorly, the adverse trade consequences \ncould be colossal.\n  Fourth, what the Japanese are seeking in these negotiations is not to \nlevel the playing field as they suggest. Let there be no mistake, the \nJapanese are seeking no less than to tilt the competitive playing field \nin such a way as to enable their less efficient carriers to compete \nmore effectively against our carriers. Our passenger carriers serving \nthe Asia-Pacific market have operating costs approximately half those \nof their Japanese counterparts.\n  The Government of Japan claims the United States-Japan bilateral \naviation agreement is fundamentally unfair and is solely responsible \nfor the greater market share our passenger carriers enjoy on service \nbetween the United States and Japan. The facts do not support such a \nposition. Just 10 years ago, under the very same bilateral agreement \nthe Government of Japan now criticizes, Japanese carriers had a larger \nmarket share on transpacific routes than United States competitors. \nWhat is the truth? As a June 1994 report by Japan's Council for Civil \nAviation noted, the fact is our carriers became more competitive by \nlowering operating costs while Japanese carriers continue to be high \ncost carriers.\n  Similarly, the Government of Japan claims our carriers have abused \ntheir beyond rights and unfairly dominate beyond markets. Again, a \nclaim without merit. Currently, Japanese passenger carriers have a 34 \npercent share of the Japan-Asia market while United States passenger \ncarriers have just 13 percent of that market. Moreover, our cargo \ncarriers have only approximately 14 percent of the Japan-Asia market. \nThe facts speak for themselves.\n  Having made these points--points I believe are critical to the United \nStates-Japan air service relations debate--let me turn to the question \nof what our goal should be in current and future negotiations with the \nJapanese. Uncharacteristically, our carriers seem to speak with one \nvoice in saying we need to seek to liberalize passenger and cargo \ncarrier opportunities with the Japanese. There is disagreement, \nhowever, with regard to what strategy our negotiators should pursue to \naccomplish this goal.\n  In recent weeks it has become readily apparent the debate regarding \nnegotiating strategy will be shaped by two fundamentally different \nviews. To better understand these views, one must remember that our \ncarriers which currently serve Japan can be separated into two distinct \ngroups based on the types of service they are authorized to provide.\n  The first group of carriers are the so-called MOU carriers. These \ncarriers--American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Continental Airlines and \nUnited Parcel Service--are permitted by a Memorandum of Understanding \nsigned in 1985 to provide service from specific cities in the United \nStates to specific Japanese cities. MOU carriers cannot use Japan as a \nbase of operation to directly serve emerging Asian markets beyond \nJapan. They can, however, participate in those markets through code-\nsharing alliances with Japanese carriers. In fact, Delta's recently \nannounced alliance with All Nippon Airways will permit it to do \nprecisely that.\n  The second group of carriers, whose rights are derived from the \nUnited States-Japan bilateral agreement signed in 1952, are permitted \nto fly to Japan, take on and unload passengers and/or cargo, and to fly \non to cities throughout Asia. Unlike the MOU carriers, the so-called \n1952 carriers--Northwest Airlines, United Airlines and Federal Express \nCorp.--have beyond rights. Northwest was a party to the 1952 agreement. \nIn 1985, United Airlines purchased its beyond rights from Pan Am in a \n$750 million transaction and Federal Express acquired the beyond rights \nof Tiger International, Inc. in a 1989 transaction valued at more than \n$1 billion.\n  In a recent speech, Bob Crandall, the Chairman of American Airlines, \nset out a possible negotiating strategy for United States-Japan \naviation relations. I anticipate other MOU carriers will embrace the \nstrategy Mr. Crandall advocated and I therefore refer to it as the \n``MOU carrier approach.''\n  Recognizing the Japanese are unlikely to grant beyond rights to MOU \ncarriers, Mr. Crandall urged our negotiators to focus on increasing \ntranspacific opportunities between the United States and Japan. In \naddition to \n\n[[Page S 16101]]\ntapping expanding service opportunities in Japan itself, Mr. Crandall \nexplained such an approach would enhance the ability of United States \ncarriers to feed traffic into Asia-Pacific networks, including the \nplanes of Japanese code-sharing partners who serve markets beyond \nJapan.\n  What makes Mr. Crandall's speech notable is not so much his \ninsightful view of the focus our negotiators should take. Rather, it is \nthe strategy he recommends that is remarkable. In exchange for \nincreased transpacific routes, Mr. Crandall recommends our negotiators \nshould offer to cap the beyond rights of United Airlines and Northwest \nAirlines. As Mr. Crandall put it, ``[s]uch an agreement would trade \nbeyond-Japan rights that Northwest and United do not use, and may never \nuse, for authorities that American and other `have-not' U.S. carriers \nare prepared to operate today.'' I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nMr. Crandall's speech to which I have referred be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, not surprisingly, Stuart Oran, United \nAirlines' Executive Vice President for Corporate Affairs and General \nCounsel, recently offered a markedly different view of what our \nnegotiating approach should be with the Japanese. I predict other 1952 \ncarriers will endorse Mr. Oran's view and therefore refer to it as the \n``1952 carrier approach.''\n  According to Mr. Oran, it would be economic folly for the United \nStates to cap the 1952 carriers' beyond rights and thereby prevent them \nfrom growing within the rapidly expanding Asia-Pacific market. In fact, \nMr. Oran warned the United States would be playing into the Government \nof Japan's hands were we to follow the negotiating strategy Mr. \nCrandall recommends.\n  To illustrate the point that trading away the beyond rights held by \n1952 carriers would be tantamount to ceding the Pacific-Asian market to \nJapanese and other foreign carriers, Mr. Oran described a recent study \nby Booz Allen & Hamilton which United Airlines commissioned. That \nstudy, which assessed the value of beyond rights in Japan to the United \nStates economy, concluded ``the U.S. would suffer a trade loss in \nexcess of $100 billion over the next twenty years--the bulk of which \nwould be transferred to Japan'' if the United States agreed to \nsurrender our passenger carriers' beyond rights. Mr. Oran characterized \nthe approach Mr. Crandall recommends as a ``sucker deal that would put \nall U.S. businesses at a permanent disadvantage in the exploding Asian \nmarket.'' I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Mr. Oran's speech be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, as the debate between MOU carriers and \n1952 carriers intensifies, I look forward to learning more about each \nposition and urge my colleagues to do the same. For example, I am \nanxious to see economic analysis from the MOU carriers regarding their \nclaim that trading our passenger carriers' beyond rights in Japan for \nincreased transpacific opportunities would be in the best economic \ninterest of our Nation. I hope any such study or report would address \nthe findings of the Booz Allen study.\n  With respect to the 1952 carriers, I am particularly curious what \nleverage, short of trading existing rights, we have to offer the \nJapanese in exchange for new transpacific routes. For instance, as \nUnited States carriers form alliances with Japanese carriers, will the \nGovernment of Japan have a self-interested motive to increase \ntranspacific routes to maximize the feed of passengers originating in \nthe United States onto Japanese carriers who code-share with our \ncarriers?\n  Of course, the impact each approach has on consumers must be given \ngreat weight. I look forward to learning from MOU carriers and 1952 \ncarriers what effect the approaches they advocate will have on consumer \nchoice and the fares that consumers pay.\n  As I have said repeatedly, I believe our international aviation \npolicy decisions should be based on a careful weighing of national \neconomic benefits and costs. Simply put, the goal of international \naviation policy should be to maximize national wealth. In light of our \nmore than $65 billion trade deficit with Japan, it is absolutely \nessential that approach be the guiding principle in current and future \naviation negotiations with the Japanese.\n\n                                Exhibit\n\n                     Remarks by Robert L. Crandall\n\n       Thank you, Bruce, and good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen. \n     It's a pleasure to be here and as always, I am pleased to \n     have an opportunity to talk with you about the ever-changing \n     * * * and always challenging * * * business of international \n     aviation.\n       I'd like to spend our time together today on the subject of \n     bilateral negotiations, an aspect of our usually fast-paced \n     industry about which most of the news has to do with what's \n     not happening, as some either drag on, and on, and on, and \n     on--and others simply don't take place at all.\n       Bilateral aviation discussions between the U.S. and other \n     countries are invariably intense and difficult, for a variety \n     of reasons. One of the most important is that the United \n     States is a very large country, with many competing \n     airlines--which typically offer various competing agendas to \n     U.S. negotiators. Conversely, most other countries are, at \n     least by comparison to the U.S., relatively small and, in \n     most cases, have only one international airline.\n       The result is that in most bilateral situations, our \n     opponents have far more focused goals than we do.\n       With respect to Japan, a country with which the U.S. has \n     been unwilling even to launch passenger negotiations, the \n     situation is similar, but modestly different. Japan is a very \n     consensual society and although there are two international \n     airlines, both are willing to accept administrative \n     guidance--or something akin to it--from their government. In \n     the U.S., on the other hand, there is little consensus on any \n     aspect of international aviation and no agreement whatever as \n     to either the tactics or strategy our Government should \n     pursue with respect to Japan. Northwest and United, which \n     have extensive rights, are vehemently opposed to changes \n     while carriers like American, Delta and Continental, which \n     have few rights to Japan and little access to the rest of \n     Asia, think dramatic change is clearly called for.\n       And passions run high, for access to Japan, and the rest of \n     Asia, is critically important to every internationally \n     oriented U.S. carrier. To compete effectively here in the \n     United States, each such carrier seeks to build the strength \n     of its route network by maximizing the number of origination-\n     and-destination combinations it can offer its customers--and \n     each wishes to include as many international points as \n     possible.\n       From Americans' perspective, the U.S. Government's \n     unwillingness to open passenger negotiations with Japan, and \n     our consequent inability to gain any meaningful access to the \n     huge and fast-growing Asian market, is extraordinarily \n     frustrating. That is particularly so since we think \n     substantial progress could be made--if only our Government \n     would act in accordance with its own, very recently \n     articulated international aviation policy statement--a point \n     I'll come back to in a minute.\n       Let me take a moment first to examine the stakes of the \n     game. As I think everyone here probably understands, service \n     rights to Japan are the indispensable key to participation in \n     Asian markets, for several reasons:\n       One is that today's aircraft do not have the range to fly \n     from most major U.S. hubs to most Asian capitals. Thus, U.S. \n     carriers without the right to use Japan's airports as \n     intermediate hubs are simply unable to participate in the \n     U.S. Asia market.\n       While the Japanese probably will not grant U.S. carriers \n     like American and Delta the beyond rights we need to solve \n     this problem directly, it seems quite likely that if we had \n     adequate rights across the North Pacific, we could \n     participate in Asia by means of code-sharing agreements with \n     Japanese carriers. Thus, we think additional transpacific \n     rights and the key to broadened American participation in \n     Asia's aviation future.\n       Second, Japan is Asia's pre-eminent economic power, by a \n     wide margin. Given its dominance, a very high percentage of \n     those traveling to and from Asia want to include Japan in \n     their itineraries. As a consequence, Tokyo and Osaka are the \n     only cities that can effectively serve as intermediate points \n     between the major U.S. hubs and the principal cities of \n     Asia--a point with which even the incumbent U.S. carriers \n     agree.\n       In addition to being an essential component of any global \n     network, there is lots of evidence that Japan is woefully \n     underserved from the United States. Consider these facts:\n       Although Japan has a larger economy than Germany, the U.K. \n     and France combined, fewer U.S. cities have nonstop service \n     to Japan than to any one of those countries.\n       Fares between the U.S. and Japan--on a revenue-per-\n     passenger-mile basis--average 29% more than fares between the \n     same U.S. cities and the principal cities of Europe.\n       Despite being badly underserved, the U.S.-Japan market \n     numbers 1.0 million passengers per year and is the world's \n     second largest intercontinental market, exceeded in size only \n     by that between the U.S. and the U.K. one can only imagine \n     how large it will be when it is properly served!\n       Unfortunately, it is not clear it ever will be, for our \n     aviation relationship with Japan is prey to two severely \n     complicating factors:\n\n[[Page S 16102]]\n\n       The first is the unique route rights established by the \n     U.S.-Japan aviation bilateral, which dates from 1952 and \n     enables two U.S. carriers--Northwest and United--to exercise \n     virtually unrestricted authority to fly from almost anywhere \n     in the U.S. to Japan--and beyond Japan to other points in \n     Asia. To illustrate that point, let me point out that during \n     the last 18 months, Northwest has added more new flights to \n     Japan than American operates in total.\n       The beyond rights held by United and Northwest are \n     startlingly different from those granted by any other nation \n     to third-country carriers and have enabled Northwest and \n     United to build cohesive Asian networks and establish hubs on \n     both sides of the Pacific. Using this structure, the two \n     carriers can thus participate in all four types of network \n     traffic: First * * * between gateways--from Chicago to Tokyo, \n     for example: Second * * * from behind a U.S. gateway to the \n     foreign gateway--from Cleveland to Tokyo, via Chicago. Third \n     * * * from a U.S. gateway to beyond the foreign gateway--from \n     Los Angeles to Bangkok, via Tokyo.\n       And finally: From behind a U.S. gateway to beyond a foreign \n     gateway--as in from Boston to Singapore, via Detroit and \n     Tokyo.\n       Their fifth freedom rights also allow Northwest and United \n     to carry large amounts of traffic between Japan and other \n     points in Asia, thus depriving the Japanese carriers of \n     traffic they regard as theirs, and complicating Japan's \n     aviation relationships with some of its Pacific neighbors--\n     notably China, Thailand, and Australia.\n       Not surprisingly, both the Japanese Government and the \n     Japanese airlines regard these arrangements as unbalanced--\n     and by the standards of international aviation, they are, \n     indeed, unbalanced.\n       Other U.S. carriers have much more limited rights. While \n     the 1952 agreement permits both countries to designate \n     multiple airlines, Japan has essentially ignored that proviso \n     for nearly 20 years. Since 1982, Japan has consented to only \n     three very limited grants of additional routes, each \n     memorialized in a memorandum of understanding. The net effect \n     has been to create two classes of U.S. airlines serving \n     Japan:\n       The two so-called ``1952 agreement'' carriers, which have \n     very broad rights, and three other airlines--American, \n     Continental and Delta--known collectively as the ``M.O.U. \n     carriers''--each of which is subject to substantial \n     restrictions on routes and frequencies, and none of which can \n     operate beyond Japan.\n       Now as we all know, airlines are network businesses. To \n     optimize traffic flows, each of the major U.S. carriers \n     operates a number of hubs, which it uses to provide nonstop \n     service to as many places as economically feasible in order \n     to maximize the number of origin-destination markets it can \n     offer its customers. The fact that only two U.S. carriers can \n     offer customers in the United States a variety of Asian \n     destinations has significant, adverse competitive \n     consequences for those who can't.\n       The other factor complicating our aviation relationship \n     with Japan is the unwillingness of the U.S. Government to \n     apply its recently articulated statement of international \n     aviation policy to relationships with that country. Our \n     government's international air transportation policy \n     statement, issued last April, clearly enunciates the most \n     important U.S. policy objective as--and I quote--to \n     ``increase the variety of price and service options available \n     to consumers.'' A second objective is to--and here I am \n     quoting again--``provide carriers with unrestricted \n     opportunities to develop types of services and systems based \n     on their assessment of marketplace demand.''\n       Unfortunately, the U.S. has declined to pursue those \n     objectives in its aviation negotiations with Japan. \n     Apparently mesmerized by the notion that the beyond rights \n     held by Northwest and United are uniquely valuable, the U.S. \n     has adopted a civil aviation policy toward Japan that seems \n     intended to protect the economic interests of two carriers--\n     and let competition, competitors and consumers take the \n     hindmost.\n       In my view, ladies and gentlemen, that's bad policy--and \n     particularly so since it stands in sharp contrast to our \n     government's aggressive application of pro-consumer policies \n     in other negotiations.\n       Moreover, this pattern of protectionism is not new. \n     Successive U.S. Transportation Secretaries have pledged to \n     eliminate the disparity between the have-not carriers and the \n     Northwest/United duopoly.\n       In 1985, D.O.T. premised its approval for United's \n     acquisition of Pan Am's Pacific routes on United being made \n     ineligible for new Japan routes in future D.O.T. proceedings.\n       During the 1989 U.S.-Japan negotiations, then-Secretary Sam \n     Skinner gave as one of his objectives: ``The enhancement of \n     the operating rights of the so-called M.O.U.-carriers.''\n       When it instituted the 1990 U.S.-Japan route proceeding, \n     D.O.T. said it would base awards on--I am quoting now--``The \n     overall structure and level of competition in the U.S.-Japan \n     market,'' end of quote--and would also give weight, and again \n     I quote, ``To expanded service by those with only limited \n     U.S.-Japan authority''--unquote.\n       All those promises notwithstanding, our Government's \n     actions in recent years have only enhanced the market \n     domination of the United-Northwest duopoly. In the 1990 \n     proceeding, our Government granted the most important new \n     route--Chicago-Tokyo--to United, and then proceeded to give \n     two of the remaining routes to airlines unable or unwilling \n     to fly them--which promptly sold them to Northwest. The \n     bottom line: three of the six routes available in 1990 ended \n     up in the hands of the Northwest/United duopoly--despite \n     D.O.T.'s promise to strengthen the M.O.U. carriers.\n       So here we sit. Since deregulation--which sometimes seems \n     like just yesterday, but which actually occurred 17 years ago \n     this month--we have transformed American from a domestic \n     airline to a global competitor--but we remain shut out of \n     Asia. Delta and Continental have had equally little success.\n       It is time for a change--and if the U.S. will apply its \n     stated international aviation policy, we think change is \n     possible. For more than a year now, the Japanese Government \n     has been signaling a willingness to expand service between \n     the U.S. and Japan, and to work out arrangements to rebalance \n     our relationship. We believe Japan's Government recognizes \n     that it cannot realistically hope to withdraw the beyond \n     rights Northwest and United already operate--but that it does \n     want to constrain the further growth of their beyond \n     operations.\n       In our view, a U.S.-Japan agreement premised on limiting \n     the expansion of beyond operations by the duopolists, in \n     exchange for a substantial increase in operating rights \n     between various U.S. cities and Tokyo and Osaka, would be \n     good for consumers, good for competition within the U.S. and \n     across the North Pacific, good for the U.S. trade balance \n     with Asia overall, and fully consistent with the D.O.T's \n     international aviation policy statement.\n       Such an agreement would trade beyond-Japan rights that \n     Northwest and United do not now use, and may never use, for \n     authorities that American and other ``have-not'' U.S. \n     carriers are prepared to operate today. These new U.S.-Japan \n     services would have many favorable effects: (1) more \n     competition within the U.S., (2) more competition, and lower \n     prices, across the North Pacific, (3) more travel, by more \n     visitors, to and within the U.S., with all the attendant \n     increased employment and wealth creation such increases \n     create, (4) and more orders for U.S.-built aircraft.\n       In addition to seeking a rational accommodation with Japan, \n     which will provide more transpacific opportunities for more \n     U.S. carriers, the U.S. can--and should--act affirmatively to \n     optimize the value of its route rights with other Asian \n     countries. For example, the use of Japan as an intermediate \n     point has long been a bone of contention between the U.S. and \n     China--and thus, our negotiators have had little success in \n     modifying the U.S.-China bilateral.\n       China's Government wants nonstop service--which American \n     and others stand ready to provide--but has not been willing \n     to allow any new U.S. carriers to provide it so long as \n     Northwest and United insist on serving their country via \n     Tokyo.\n       By accepting China's position that a Japanese intermediate \n     point may not be used in U.S.-China service, the U.S. would \n     improve its aviation relationships with both Japan and China. \n     Bettering both flight links and other relationships with \n     China, with which the U.S. already has a huge and growing \n     trade deficit--and whose future seems limitless--is clearly \n     very important--and everyone wants a better relationship with \n     Japan.\n       Aviation disagreements do not defy resolution. Countries \n     that dislike bilaterals enough eventually renounce them--as \n     the U.K., France, Italy, Peru, Thailand, India and others \n     have done with respect to the U.S. at one time or another. In \n     a comparative sense, Japan certainly has a far more \n     legitimate complaint than the U.K. had in 1976, when it \n     renounced Bermuda I.\n       Japan has already begun to restrict various rights held by \n     U.S. carriers and the recently launched U.S.-Japan cargo \n     negotiations are making little if any progress. In my view, \n     the U.S. would be wise to initiate comprehensive negotiations \n     now. Although proceeding under provocation is not ordinarily \n     an advisable course, I do not see how U.S. interests are well \n     served by protecting doupolies at the expense of reason, \n     consumers and competition.\n       This is especially true since the Japanese Government \n     apparently seeks more comprehensive discussions, which would \n     lead us to believe that mutual accommodation is likely. \n     Assuming the U.S. is willing to adopt a stance consistent \n     with its international aviation policy statement, as it has \n     in other bilateral negotiations, we believe the time is right \n     for a settlement consistent with the best interests of all \n     parties.\n       A passage from Shakespeare's ``Julius Caesar'' says it far \n     more eloquently than I can:\n\n     There is a tide in the affairs of men,\n     Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;\n     Omitted, all the voyage of their life\n     Is bound in shallows and in miseries.\n     On such a full sea are we now afloat,\n     And we must take the current when it serves . . .\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                       Remarks by Stuart I. Oran\n\n       Good morning. It's a pleasure to be with you today.\n       I am delighted to have this opportunity to talk about \n     United's vision of aviation in the next century--global \n     networks providing seamless service for our customers.\n       Perhaps we can look to the telecommunications industry for \n     a model of our vision for the future of global aviation. \n     There, U.S. \n\n[[Page S 16103]]\n     companies have developed a truly global service network. You can pick \n     up your phone and call anywhere in the world, yet deal only \n     with one of a number of companies. This network, which we \n     take for granted, is the product of carefully integrated \n     systems, cross-border alliances, realistic government \n     regulation and forward thinking telecommunications companies.\n       We believe that consumers are entitled to that kind of ease \n     and convenience from airlines as well. A passenger should be \n     able to deal with a single carrier for an itinerary that \n     takes him anywhere in the world. To do this, we need a \n     network of alliances--of rights and beyond rights--for \n     carriers.\n       Everyone understand the importance of beyond rights of \n     networks today, but they didn't in 1976, when Bermuda II was \n     under discussion.\n       Ambassdor Alan Boyd of the U.K. offered testimony to the \n     House Subcommittee on Aviation on the need to renegotiate the \n     Bermuda I Agreement of 1952, calling it unfair to the U.K. He \n     told committee members that under the agreement, U.S. airline \n     revenues were twice those of the U.K. And he concluded that \n     the only way to rectify the disparity was to rewrite the \n     Bermuda Agreement substantially.\n       Ambassador Boyd was correct on one point--a significant \n     revenue imbalance did exist between the U.K. and the U.S. But \n     the reason for the imbalance had little to do with route \n     assignments or agreements. It had to do with competitive \n     market forces and the then inability of a bloated, protected, \n     government-owned British Airways to compete. How times have \n     changed.\n       Unfortunately, Congress and government regulators went \n     along with Ambassador Boyd.\n       The results, as we know too well today, was Bermuda II. \n     That new agreement created dramatic structural advantages for \n     the U.K. out of a growing European market. Since then, the \n     U.S. market share between the U.K. and the U.S. had dropped \n     25%. But even more important, that agreement effectively \n     locked the U.S. carriers out of the key connecting complex in \n     Europe--Heathrow. In effect, U.S. carriers were punished for \n     their efficiency. We've spent the past 19 years trying to \n     correct the Bermuda II mistakes.\n       I recount this today not to rub new salt into old wounds, \n     but to look at the lessons of the European market. We would \n     like to make sure that history does not repeat itself--this \n     time in Asia.\n       For nearly 25 years, the 1952 Japan Air Service Agreement \n     enabled competitive parity between U.S. and Japanese \n     carriers. It was not until 1986, when United acquired Pan \n     Am's rights in the Pacific, that the parity began to \n     dissolve. The reason was simple--United took the necessary \n     and often painful steps to becoming more efficient in the \n     newly deregulated U.S. market. Meanwhile, the Japanese \n     carriers, operating in a highly protected environment, \n     avoided similar changes. The result today is that Japanese \n     costs are considerably higher than those of their U.S. \n     competitors.\n       Let me underscore just how much higher those costs are. We \n     commissioned Booz-Allen & Hamilton to conduct a major study--\n     to be released today--on the value of Asian beyond rights to \n     the U.S. economy. Among their key findings was that Japanese \n     carriers' cost are now roughly double that of U.S. \n     carriers at comparable stage lengths.\n       The fact that the Japanese flights are more expensive is \n     not lost on the traveling public. Because of our efficiency, \n     we have developed fares and schedules preferred by the \n     Japanese consumers. As a result, the parity that long existed \n     between U.S. and Japanese carriers is gone. Today, U.S. \n     carriers provide 61% of the capacity serving Japan and the \n     U.S. enjoys a $4.8 billion net trade surplus with Japan for \n     passenger air travel in Asia.\n       Rather than respond to this competitive challenge by \n     restructuring their airlines--a change that is unavoidable at \n     some point and that will benefit the Japanese people in the \n     long run--the Japan Ministry of Transportation (MOT) has \n     chosen instead to vilify the 1952 Air Service Agreement. \n     Their claim is that the `52 agreement is unfair and gives the \n     U.S. a competitive advantage.\n       Does this sound familiar? Like the British did in the \n     `70's, the MOT is blaming the agreement rather than their own \n     protectionist aviation policies for their declining \n     transpacific market share.\n       So MOT has decided not to honor the `52 agreement. Most \n     recently, the MOT has denied a request by United Airlines to \n     begin flights between Osaka and Seoul, despite our right to \n     fly unlimited routes between Japan into Asia. By denying this \n     request, the MOT is abrogating the treaty, and attempting to \n     force the U.S. to negotiate for a right its carriers already \n     have. To add insult to injury, JAL is at the same time \n     seeking to expand flights from Sendai to Honolulu. We are \n     asking the Department of Transportation today to deny any \n     increase in JAL's service until our Osaka-Seoul business plan \n     has been approved by MOT.\n       MOT's position ignores an important lesson we learned with \n     British Air and Bermuda I. Competitive positions are not \n     static. Of course, the Japanese carriers will improve \n     efficiency over time as they continue to cut costs and \n     improve service. For the U.S. to overreact now, and surrender \n     critical U.S. carrier beyond rights, would be a sucker deal \n     that would put all U.S. businesses at a permanent \n     disadvantage in the exploding Asian market.\n       I can not underscore this important idea strongly enough. \n     Ultimately, this is not just about United. It's about trade \n     and MOT's approach to trade disputes in the aviation sector. \n     It's about Japan's drive to monopolize the U.S.-Asia and \n     Japan-Asia markets. In this case, MOT believes it can \n     unilaterally interpret or simply ignore agreements with \n     impunity when it suits them. And they have little regard for \n     the damage this strategy causes to international \n     relationships, or the havoc it wreaks on the marketplace.\n       And just how much havoc will MOT cause? According to Booz-\n     Allen, if the U.S. gives up its beyond rights as MOT wants, \n     Japan would receive a virtual monopoly on U.S.-Asian routs \n     through Japan; Japanese carriers would gain up to $5 billion \n     in present value from the earnings stream lost by U.S. \n     carriers, and the U.S. would suffer a trade loss in excess of \n     $100 billion over the next twenty years, the bulk of which \n     would be transferred to Japan--$100 billion.\n       Let me describe some more of the consequences of MOT's \n     strategy.\n       MOT's strategy will hurt the U.S. economy.--If MOT succeeds \n     in blocking U.S. beyond rights, the Booz-Allen estimates of a \n     cumulative trade loss of $100 billion dollars is actually \n     conservative. That impact would be compounded by the \n     multiplier effect on U.S. jobs and economic activity. As a \n     result, the entire U.S. economy would feel the sting of MOT's \n     aviation whip.\n       MOT's strategy will hurt consumers.--Booz-Allen predicts \n     that if the U.S. carriers lost all or any of their rights to \n     carry passengers beyond Japan to other Asian cities, capacity \n     will drop and fares will increase. Consumers will lose \n     service alternatives, not only between the U.S. and Japan, \n     but to other Asian cities as well. Travelers will pay more \n     and get less.\n       MOT's strategy hurts U.S.-Japanese relations.--Their plan \n     makes a mockery of the 1952 Air Service Agreement. If MOT is \n     allowed to dishonor the 1952 accord, how can it be trusted to \n     respect other bilateral agreements? And we certainly can't \n     expand their routes into and beyond the United States if they \n     won't honor existing treaties.\n       MOT's strategy will impose a stranglehold over Asian \n     aviation.--MOT is trying to position Japan as the gatekeeper \n     of Asia, by controlling traffic both into and out of the \n     continent. If it is successful in hobbling U.S. carriers, \n     it will then turn its attention to the other competition, \n     the Asian Carriers. In short order, we would see a steady \n     stream of Asian carriers--Chinese, Indonesian, Korean, \n     Malay, Taiwanese, Thai and Singaporean--forced to beg MOT \n     for beyond rights to North and South America. And without \n     the counterweight of U.S. competition, Asian carriers \n     would become prey in their home markets to the predatory \n     Japanese airlines.\n       MOT's strategy hurts U.S. carriers.--U.S. carriers will \n     lose the right to grow in Asia--the region projected to have \n     the highest growth in air passenger transportation over the \n     next 15 years.\n       How does United see the preferred course for the future?\n       Using Europe as a model, we see 4 or 5 major alliances \n     forming the core of services in Asia, with many niche players \n     finding important roles. There is no reason why this model \n     can't be a win-win situation for everyone in Asia. The \n     alliances into which United has entered are designed to \n     achieve a global network, including Asia. We have no problem \n     with others entering the same kind of alliances, for example, \n     the two principal Japanese carriers with U.S. carriers--\n     because we believe that when equitably administered, we can \n     beat the competition.\n       But first, MOT must honor the existing terms of the 1952 \n     accord. This must be a prerequisite for passenger talks.\n       Once all parties involved agree to respect the 1952 pact, \n     we would encourage the U.S. Department of Transportation to \n     develop a detailed economic analysis of Japanese aviation and \n     its relationship to U.S. carrier competitiveness in Asia. We \n     would urge that DOT use that analysis as a starting point for \n     negotiations with MOT.\n       Japan's carriers may today be overpriced and unresponsive \n     to consumers' needs just as British Airways was 20 years ago. \n     But the solution is not to lock up the skies and give Tokyo \n     the key. To do so would simply recreate the mistakes of \n     Bermuda II.\n       The solution to this dispute must respect the principle of \n     open competition. We see it working in Europe, where \n     competitive alliances provide a blueprint for global \n     aviation.\n       The solution must acknowledge that competitive position are \n     not static. One way or another, Japan's carriers will have to \n     modernize and those changes will affect their standing in the \n     air travel marketplace.\n       And above all, the solution to this dispute must honor \n     existing agreements before creating new ones.\n       Going back to our telecommunications analogy, we want to \n     provide a ``seamless'' journey for passengers. With a \n     progressive, sound, and resolute U.S. approach to \n     international aviation matters, we believe that this goal can \n     be achieved on a global basis. But as long as we allow one \n     nation to control international air space, there can be no \n     global aviation. Not today. And certainly not in the year \n     2010.\n       Thank you. I look forward to your questions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/27/senate-section/article/S16100-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16103-S16104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           U.S. SUGAR PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I agree that debate and open scrutiny of \nthe Sugar Program is important this year. I would like my position to \nbe clear. \n\n[[Page S 16104]]\n\nThough I accept that some level of reform to the program is inevitable \nand necessary, I do not believe emasculation or outright elimination is \nwise.\n  My grandfather and grandmother emigrated from Japan to work at \nMcBryde Sugar Co. on the Island of Kauai in 1899. In my office here in \nWashington I have a framed copy of the contract on which my \ngrandfather, Asakichi Inouye, placed his ``X.'' The contract includes a \nphotograph of this brave young man and his wife, and a little baby boy \nthey are holding. My father.\n  Nearly a century later, Asakichi Inouye's grandson is proud to be \nrepresenting the State of Hawaii in the U.S. Senate. McBryde Sugar is \nphasing over to coffee production, but sugar is still the biggest \nagricultural activity in Hawaii. Sugar is still the third biggest \nbusiness in Hawaii, trailing only tourism and defense spending.\n  I am proud to represent the 6,000 men and women in Hawaii who still \nwork directly or indirectly for the sugar industry, and their families. \nAll these people's livelihoods are at risk if the U.S. sugar policy is \neliminated.\n  I am proud to represent agricultural workers who are among the \nworld's most productive. Hawaii produces more sugar per worker, and per \nacre, than anywhere in the world.\n  Our workers have enjoyed collective bargaining for decades and are \nrewarded for their productivity with good wages, with some of the best \nhealth care benefits in the country, and with generous benefits for \ninsurance, retirement, and in many cases, housing. Their safety and \ntheir health are bolstered by some of the strictest worker protection \nrules and highest environmental standards in the nation, and possibly \nin the world.\n  These workers, many of whose families have been in sugar for three or \nfour generations, lead comfortable, but by no means extravagant lives, \ncan put their children through college, and can look forward to a \ndecent retirement.\n  Sadly, Hawaii sugar production has dropped nearly in half in just the \npast 7 years as half our sugarcane plantations have shut down. Why have \nthese farms closed? Because producer prices for sugar have been flat, \nor even declining, for the past decade. Despite their extraordinary \nproductivity, these farmers cannot reduce costs rapidly enough to cope \nwith inflationary prices for their inputs and flat or declining prices \nfor their output.\n  In the absence of U.S. sugar policy, an abrupt decline in U.S. \nproducer prices for sugar is a virtual certainty. If U.S. producer \nprices for sugar decline further, Hawaii's remaining sugarcane farms \nwill close. Thousands more of my constituents will lose their \nlivelihoods.\n  This sad situation will not be unique to Hawaii if we lose the Sugar \nProgram. Similar scenes will be played out in the many rural areas of \nthis country dependent on the sugar industry.\n  Let me say, however, that I would not object to the elimination of \nthe Sugar Program if other nations also eliminated any and all measures \nto favor their domestic sugar producers, processors and consumers. \nHowever, we must consider the realities of world market conditions such \nas the sugar price support in the European Union, which is 35 percent \nhigher than that of the United States. A U.S. Sugar Program is a \nnecessary response to generous production and export subsidy programs \nin other countries.\n  Opponents of the Sugar Program say that it costs Americans over a \nbillion dollars annually and point to the low world price of sugar, \nwhich hovers around $0.14 per pound, as the savior of the American \nsugar consumer. However, this fictitious world price is created by the \ndirect financial subsidies and export incentives provided to foreign \nproducers by their own governments, which in turn allow these producers \nto dump excess sugar on the supposed world market at substantially \nbelow production cost. If we think there is an endless supply of this \ndump-priced sugar, we are fooling ourselves into relinquishing control \nof our domestic market to foreign producers.\n\n  I believe that if we had a level playing field, we could play at the \nhighest level of competition with anybody. While the GATT, the NAFTA, \nand the Canadian Free-Trade Agreement are moving us in that direction, \nI do not believe we are there yet.\n  I would also ask, ``How has the U.S. Sugar Program fared as a \ndomestic public policy?'' While there are several dimensions to such an \nevaluation, I focus on three particular aspects: impact on the American \nconsumer, impact on the innovativeness of the producing and processing \ncomponents of the U.S. sugar industry, and impact on the Federal \nTreasury.\n  Under the U.S. Sugar Program, American consumers have enjoyed a \nretail price of refined sugar that is lower than that paid by consumers \nin other developed countries. On average, sugar prices paid by \nAmericans are nearly 30 percent lower than in other developed nations.\n  In April of this year, the average retail price of a pound of sugar \nin developed nations was $0.54; the price was only $0.39 a pound in the \nU.S., but over $1.00 in Japan and about $0.69 in France. Relative to \nother developed countries, U.S. consumers save approximately $2.6 \nbillion annually on purchases of sugar and products sweetened with \nsugar.\n  However, besides price, American consumers demand consistent quantity \nand quality. In other words, when consumers go to the grocery store to \npurchase sugar, they expect a high quality product that is safe and \ncontaminant free, and identical with every purchase. They also expect \nto find such products on the shelf whenever they want to buy them. This \nis exactly what the American consumer gets from the U.S. sugar \nindustry--so much so that we take it for granted. However, one need \nonly recall the shortages in the former Soviet Union to know that this \nis not a universal occurrence. Thus, from a consumer viewpoint, I give \nhigh marks to the sugar program as domestic public policy.\n  Another aspect of public policy is how well it stimulates innovation \nin the production and processing components of the industry. Simply \nlooking at the increasing productivity of domestic sugar producers and \nprocessors will clearly signal the fact that the sugar program has not \nstifled innovation.\n  You do not get the deserved reputation as one of the most efficient \nsugar producing nations in the world by suppressing innovation. Support \nof domestic sugar production and processing has been maintained at a \nlevel to protect against unfair competition, but not at a level to \npreclude fair competition. Thus, from the innovation-encouraging \nperspective, I give high marks to the sugar program as domestic public \npolicy.\n  Finally, Federal law requires that the sugar program operate at no \ncost to the Federal Treasury. U.S. sugar growers receive absolutely no \nsubsidy from the Government. The only payments are from the producers \nto the Government. In fact, through a congressionally mandated \nmarketing assessment, the U.S. sugar industry actually contributes more \nthan $30 million annually to the Federal Treasury. So, considering its \nbenefit to the Federal Government's economic condition, I again give \nhigh marks to the Sugar Program as domestic public policy.\n  Let me close by saying again that I am not opposed to necessary and \nuseful reform to the U.S. Sugar Program this year; though I do not \nthink that unilateral disarmament is the solution. The sugar industry \nhas committed itself to supporting an elimination of the Sugar Program \nif and when other sugar producing nations take the same action. I will \nmake this commitment as well. Until we reach that time, however, we \nmust protect our industry, our market, and our consumers from \nsubsidized competition from abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/27/senate-section/article/S16103-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16104-S16105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SOME SECOND THOUGHTS ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND CENSORSHIP\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' \nattention to a thought-provoking speech recently given by Judge Robert \nBork about the media, and our perceptions of the first amendment and \ncensorship.\n  Judge Bork, who is now a resident scholar at the American Enterprise \nInstitute, made these remarks at a forum sponsored by AEI entitled, \n``Sex and Hollywood: What Should Be the Government's Role?'', at which \nI had the privilege of speaking. As the title suggests, this forum \nsought to examine what effect the media's bombardment of sexual \nmessages is having on our children and our culture, and what \n\n[[Page S 16105]]\nsteps the Government can and should take to address the public's \ngrowing concern about the threat posed by these increasingly explicit \nmessages.\n  In his comments, Judge Bork argued that this threat puts not only our \nchildren at risk, but our civil society as well. If the entertainment \nindustry's standards continue to drop, he suggested, the Government \nwould be well within its constitutional bounds to take more active \nsteps to protect children by regulating lewd and indecent content. In \nmaking this argument, Judge Bork reminded the audience that the \nGovernment has regularly played the role of censor--albeit a limited \none--for most of our history, and that in recent years the general \nnotion of what forms of expression are fully protected by the first \namendment has, in Judge Bork's eyes, become distorted. Judge Bork's \ncomments remind us that our commitment to free expression must be \nbalanced by our commitment to protect our children and the moral health \nof our Nation.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nJudge Bork's statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Sex and Hollywood: What Should the Government's Role Be?\n\n     (Remarks at the Sexuality and American Social Policy Seminar, \n              Washington, DC, Friday, September 29, 1995)\n\n       Lionel Chetwynd is surely correct in reminding us that \n     motion pictures and television are not solely, perhaps not \n     even primarily, responsible for the social pathologies that \n     are rampant in America today.\n       An interesting fact that tends to bear out that conclusion \n     is that in both the United States and the United Kingdom the \n     rates of illegitimacy and violent crime, after long periods \n     of stability, began rising in 1960. That was well before \n     movies and television became as sex- and violence-drenched as \n     they are today.\n       It is also true that Hollywood's selling of sex has to be \n     seen in the context of all the sexual messages that flood our \n     culture.\n       That said, it is impossible to believe that Hollywood's \n     sexual messages have no significant impact on sexual \n     behavior. I find persuasive Jane Brown's and Jeanne Steele's \n     giving of a qualified ``yes'' to the questions whether the \n     sexual messages being sent promote irresponsible sexual \n     behavior, encourage unwanted pregnancies, and lead to \n     teenagers having sex earlier, more frequently, and outside of \n     marriage.\n       One of the most persuasive items of evidence is the effect \n     movies and television have had on levels of violence. Why \n     images and words would affect one form of activity and not \n     the other is unclear, particularly since one who contemplates \n     violence must also contemplate the possibility that he is the \n     one who will be hurt. There is no such deterrent to one \n     contemplating sex. The prospect of pregnancy is unlikely to \n     deter teenagers with a short time horizon.\n       I am unpersuaded by the argument that the market will take \n     care of the problem. We are told that there is more sex on \n     prime time TV this year than ever before. As for the movies, \n     we will have to wait to see whether ``Showgirls'' is \n     commercially successful. If it is, the market will ensure \n     that the floodgates open.\n       There is a major problem caused by the fact that Hollywood \n     must compete with other modes of delivering sexual messages, \n     messages that are increasingly perverted. Some of this is the \n     material on cable channels, which are, I suppose, part of the \n     generic term ``Hollywood.'' But there is also Internet, which \n     supplies prose and pictures of small boys and girls being \n     kidnapped, mutilated, raped, and killed, and even supplies \n     instructions on the best time of day to wait outside a girls' \n     school, how best to bundle a girl into your van, and the rest \n     that follows. Soon it will be possible to get digital films \n     of such materials on home computers.\n       The market will not take care of that problem. We already \n     have the evidence for that conclusion. The pornographic film \n     business exploded in profitability when it was no longer \n     necessary to go to an ``adult'' theater to see pornography. \n     It has been possible for some time to avoid the embarrassment \n     of being seen entering such a theater by renting pornographic \n     video tapes. The business is making billions of dollars \n     annually and is expanding rapidly.\n       But when pornographic and frequently perverted films are \n     available on home computers, the customer will not even have \n     to face a clerk in getting a videocassette or be seen \n     browsing the X-rated film racks. What we have learned is that \n     the more private viewing becomes, the more salacious and \n     perverted the material will be. On Internet, people are \n     downloading still pictures of pedophilia, sadomasochism, \n     defecation, and worse. Among the most popular pictures are \n     sex acts with a wide variety of animals, nude children, and \n     incest.\n       I don't think there is any doubt that competition from \n     pornographic digital films, which can be sent from anywhere \n     in the world, will pull Hollywood in the direction of more \n     and more shocking sexual films and television.\n       Is there a role for government? I think the answer is yes. \n     It may be impossible to do anything about Internet and films \n     on home computers. Technology, it is said, is on the side of \n     anarchy. But it is possible to do something about movies, \n     television, and rap music.\n       There are those who say the solution is rebuild a stable \n     and decent public culture. How one does that when the \n     institutions we have long relied on to maintain and transmit \n     such a culture--the two-parent family, schools, churches, and \n     popular entertainment itself--are all themselves in decline \n     it is not easy to say.\n       It is also no answer to say, ``If you don't like it, don't \n     go to the offensive movies, use the remote to change the \n     television channel, don't listen to rap.'' Whether or not you \n     watch and listen, others will, and you and your family will \n     be greatly affected by them. The aesthetic and moral \n     environment in which you and your family live will be \n     coarsened and degraded. Michael Medved put it well: ``To say \n     that if you don't like the popular culture to turn it off, is \n     like saying, if you don't like the smog, stop breathing. . . \n     . There are Amish kids in Pennsylvania who know about \n     Madonna.''\n       The cultural smog has several bad effects. I have mentioned \n     the ugliness of the aesthetic and moral environment, which \n     includes everything from the use in public of language that \n     used to be confined to the barracks and was sometimes frowned \n     upon there to attitudes about sexuality which must translate \n     into attitudes about fidelity and preserving marriages.\n       Stanley Brubaker argues that in a republican form of \n     government, where the people rule, it is crucial that the \n     character of the citizenry not be debased. The late \n     Christopher Lasch pointed out that democracy cannot dispense \n     with virtue. He said that we forget ``the degree to which \n     liberal democracy has lived off the borrowed capital of moral \n     and religious traditions antedating the rise of liberalism.'' \n     Those traditions are dissipated by the kinds of \n     entertainments we have been discussing.\n       There is, however, a third point. The attitudes and actions \n     expressed in rap lyrics, on Internet, and soon on home \n     computer movies are incitements to action. Do we really think \n     that a heavy diet of pornography, of rape scenes, of coercing \n     children to have sex cannot ever trigger action? If we do \n     not think that, then some form of regulation is called \n     for. The pleasure that a million addicts get from a \n     thousand depictions of rape is not worth one actual rape.\n       What, then, can government do? This brings us to the topic \n     of censorship. Almost everybody has been so influenced by \n     liberal ideology that censorship is considered unthinkable. \n     Irving Kristol, who also favors censorship, says it might be \n     more palatable if we spoke of the regulation of public \n     morals, but I don't think anybody would be fooled.\n       Somebody is bound to say that any regulation of pornography \n     would violate the First Amendment. That view is a recent \n     development and ignores the historical understanding. Until \n     very recently, not even pornographers thought the First \n     Amendment was relevant in prosecutions for producing and \n     selling the stuff. They raised no such defense.\n       As recently as 1942, a unanimous Supreme Court said in \n     Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire: ``There are certain well-defined \n     and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and \n     punishment of which have never been thought to raise any \n     Constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene, \n     the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or `fighting' \n     words--those which by their very utterance inflict injury or \n     tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. I has been \n     well observed that such utterances are no essential part of \n     any explosition of ideas, and are of such slight social value \n     as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from \n     them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order \n     and morality.''\n       That Supreme Court understood that the Amendment intended \n     to protect the expression of ideas and that lewd and obscene \n     were no necessary part of such expression.\n       We don't have to imagine what censorship would be like. We \n     lived with it for over three hundred years on this continent \n     and for about 175 years as a nation. And we had a far \n     healthier public culture. Ratings systems for recordings and \n     movies have proved a farce. The era of the Hayes office in \n     Hollywood was also the golden age of the motion pictures. And \n     maybe something like the Hayes office would be the way to \n     start. Government could encourage the producers of movies, \n     television, and music to set up such self-policing bodies. We \n     could see if those industries would comply. If not, or if the \n     modern version of Hayes offices proved ineffective, we could \n     contemplate the next step. That next step would be direct \n     government action, which is what we used to have.\n       One thing seems clear, however, if the depravity of popular \n     culture continues and worsens, we must either attempt one or \n     another form of censorship or resign ourselves to an \n     increasingly ugly and dangerous society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/27/senate-section/article/S16104-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16105-S16106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, Senator Grassley is not only an able and \ndedicated U.S. Senator, but he is also a progressive, scientific, and \noutstanding farmer. His colleagues in the Senate hold him in high \nesteem, not only for these qualities but also for his integrity, \ncourage, and ability. We are proud of him and the great service he is \nrendering our country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article contained in the Hill be \nprinted in the Record so that others will learn more about this fine \nAmerican.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Hill, Oct. 25, 1995]\n\n                        Senator Charles Grassley\n\n                           (By Albert Eisele)\n\n       You can't get much more grassroots than Sen. Charles \n     Grassley (R-Iowa).\n       Early this month, the 62-year-old crusader against federal \n     waste was at the wheel of an International Harvester 1450 \n     tractor, hauling a load of soybeans to a grain elevator near \n     his family farm in northeastern Iowa.\n       The only working farmer in the Senate, Grassley interrupted \n     his farming chores to issue a press release informing his \n     constituents he had regained his Agriculture Committee seat, \n     which he was forced to give up in January when committee \n     assignments were redistributed after Republicans took control \n     of the Senate.\n       But last week, Grassley was back in the Senate, behind the \n     closed doors of the Finance Committee helping Republicans \n     work out disagreements over their controversial $245-billion \n     tax cut package, and then defending that package from \n     Democratic criticism in full committee.\n       ``If you're concerned about balancing the budget, you'll be \n     for this program,'' Grassley declared as he and his GOP \n     colleagues sent their historic tax package to the Senate \n     floor as part of the even more historic budget reconciliation \n     bill.\n       Then, using a metaphor appropriate to his Iowa origins and \n     his parochial view of his role in the Senate, once described \n     by Congressional Quarterly as ``pigs and pork,'' Grassley \n     said, ``The people of this country are tired of living high \n     on the hog, and not worrying about our children or \n     grandchildren paying for it.''\n       For the man who is the philosophical heir of the late Rep. \n     H. R. Gross (R), the quintessential penny-pinching legislator \n     whom Grassley succeeded in the House in 1974, it was a \n     characteristic moment.\n       Never hailed as an intellectual giant or an inspiring \n     orator, the easy-going third-term senator has made his name, \n     and compiled a truly imposing campaign record, by balancing \n     the needs of Iowa farmers and small businesses with the \n     national yearning for fiscal discipline in government.\n       Despite one of the lowest profiles in the Senate, Grassley \n     has managed, by stint of sheer hard work, country-bred \n     political smarts and a low-octane ego, to place himself in \n     the middle of the Senate debate over the big ticket issues of \n     tax cuts, budget balancing and welfare reform at the heart of \n     the Republican revolution.\n       As a member of the Finance Committee, the number two \n     Republican on the Budget Committee behind Chairman Pete \n     Domenici (R-N.M.), and a member of the House-Senate \n     conference committee on welfare reform which holds its first \n     meeting today, Grassley is perfectly positioned to add to his \n     already impressive electoral achievements in Iowa, where he \n     has never lost a race.\n       Elected to the state legislature while studying for a \n     doctorate at the University of Iowa--he left school after he \n     was elected and never returned--Grassley took over his family \n     farm after his father died in 1960.\n       By 1974, when he won a narrow victory over a Democratic \n     opponent to replace the retiring Rep. Gross, Grassley had \n     bought additional acreage--It's now just under 600 acres--and \n     turned the farm over to his son Robin, who still farms it, \n     with weekend help from his father in the fall and spring.\n       Then, in 1980, after Iowa voters dumped liberal Democratic \n     Sen. Dick Clark in favor of conservative Republican Roger \n     Jepson two years earlier, Grassley took on Clark's liberal \n     Democratic colleague, John Culver, after winning 90 of the \n     state's 99 counties in the GOP primary.\n       His emphasis on pocketbook issues and his earnest demeanor, \n     which belied Culver's charges that he was a tool of the Moral \n     Majority and New Right, earned Grassley an unexpectedly \n     comfortable victory with 54 percent of the vote.\n       Amazingly, for someone whose name and accomplishments are \n     little-known outside of Iowa, and widely discounted inside \n     the Washington Beltway, Grassley has one of the best records \n     as a campaigner of anyone in the Senate. Of the 43 senators \n     who have run for three or more terms, Grassley is the only \n     one, other than John Warner (R-Va.) and two others who ran \n     unopposed, who has significantly improved his electoral \n     margin in each of the last three elections.\n       After winning 54 percent of the vote in 1980, he easily \n     disposed of his Democratic challenger in 1986 by taking 66 \n     percent of the vote, and crushed his opponent in 1992, highly \n     touted state Sen. Jean Lloyd-Jones, by winning 70 percent of \n     the vote.\n       The latter victory was one of historic proportions as he \n     carried every single county while winning by the largest \n     statewide margin in the country, and winning more votes than \n     any candidate in the history of the state--President \n     Eisenhower had the old record.\n       Grassley has an uncanny ability to translate national \n     issues, such as defense fraud, tax reform, out-of-control \n     government spending, congressional accountability, and \n     international trade--especially for Iowa farm and \n     manufacturing products--into issues of local appeal.\n       Grassley scored one of his major successes earlier this \n     year when the 104th Congress enacted its first piece of \n     legislation, the Congressional Accountability Act that made \n     Congress subject to the same labor and anti-discrimination \n     laws that apply to all Americans. Grassley has been pushing \n     for such a law since 1989.\n       But it was his attack on government waste and fraud that \n     first brought him public attention. In 1984, as chairman of \n     the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Practices, he \n     publicized the notorious $47,600 coffee maker bought by the \n     Air Force. Then, in 1990, he won headlines by uncovering \n     Pentagon purchases of $999 screwdrivers and $1,868 toilet \n     seats.\n       Grassley is proudest of two major achievements, passage of \n     the Congressional Accountability Act and his work with Rep. \n     Howard Berman (D-Calif.) in promoting the 1986 ``whistle \n     blower'' provisions, known as the ``qui tam'' amendments to \n     the False Claims Act, which enabled the Justice Department to \n     recover more than $1 billion in civil fraud cases since 1986.\n       Over breakfast in the Senate Dining Room last week, \n     Grassley, who had a very unIowa-like breakfast--a grapfruit \n     with honey and black coffee--commented, almost \n     apologetically, on the fact that very little major \n     legislation bears his name.\n       ``Sometimes I think the passage of legislation might not \n     necessarily be the best way to measure a person's most \n     important accomplishments,'' he said. ``Sometimes, it's what \n     you might do to stop a bad administrative action or get an \n     amicus brief before the Supreme Court on child pornography.''\n       Grassley has already signed on-to Senate Majority Leader \n     Bob Dole's (Kan.) presidential bandwagon, so it's no surprise \n     he predicts Dole will win the bellwether Iowa caucuses next \n     February. But he concedes that Dole will have to beat the 38-\n     percent figure he got in 1986.\n       And for those who want to bet a long shot, the most \n     successful politician in Iowa history offers this startling \n     advice: ``Keep an eye on Phil Gramm [R-Texas]. He's the one \n     to watch.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/27/senate-section/article/S16106-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16106-S16107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GAMBLING IMPACT STUDY COMMISSION ACT\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, legalized gambling in this country is \ngrowing at a phenomenal rate. In 1975, only one State allowed casino \ngambling. Today, 20 years later, 23 States have legal casino gambling. \nForty-eight States have legal gambling in some form. Gambling is a huge \nindustry, but we know very little about its economic and social \nimpacts.\n  As a result of my deep concerns, I have become a cosponsor of S. 704, \nthe Gambling Impact Study Commission Act. This bill, sponsored by \nSenators Simon and Lugar, will establish an 18-month commission to \nstudy the effects of legalized gambling and its impact on local \ncommunities. The commission would report its findings to the President \nand Congress, providing administrative recommendations and proposals \nfor legislation, if called for.\n  Mr. President, I am a strong believer in the free market and I \nbelieve the \n\n[[Page S 16107]]\nFederal Government's zeal to regulate business in this country must be \nreined in. The American people sent a clear signal with the 1994 \nelections. That is why many of us in Congress are working overtime to \ncut Government red tape that is stifling our businesses and industry.\n  But this national gambling commission is not about Government \ninterference. As I mentioned, 48 States have some form of legalized \ngambling, including 23 with operating casinos. There is even gambling \non the Internet. I am not opposed to State lotteries but I note that \ntoday, gambling is done on river boats, Indian reservations, and in \nwell-established downtowns. There are even proposals to put video \ngambling machines on airlines and to have gambling cars on passenger \ntrains.\n  According to a study by U.S. News & World Report, Americans in 1992 \nlegally wagered $330 billion in casinos, race tracks, lotteries, et \ncetera. This represents an 1,800 percent increase since 1976. Mr. \nPresident, I believe Congress must recognize that legalized gambling is \nnow a huge industry, and we must take steps to learn about this \nindustry and to provide credible and objective facts for our States and \ncommunities.\n  Many towns and cities are in tight budgetary situations and are \nlooking for new dollars without increasing local taxes. Legalized \ngambling has been seen by some as a panacea, not just as a means to \navoid tax increases, but as a means to provide new jobs and stimulate \neconomic growth.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, there is very little unbiased information \nabout gambling's true economic and social impact in America. The gaming \nindustry has produced its studies, which predictably paint a rosy \npicture for States and local governments. The opponents of gambling \nhave likewise produced reports about the problems legalized casinos and \nother forms of gambling have brought to communities. We do not know who \nto believe.\n  In short, there is a real lack of unbiased information. An \nindependent national gambling commission, as I envision it, will be \nfair-minded and provide information across a wide spectrum. It will \nexamine the social impacts of gambling, including the impact on crime \nrates, political corruption, and family life. It will also examine its \neconomic costs and benefits.\n  From the work of this commission, Congress will learn a great deal \nabout this relatively unknown industry. Moreover, Virginia and her \ncounterparts, and just as importantly local communities, will be able \nto use this information while making future decisions about creating or \nexpanding legalized gambling.\n  I look forward to Senate consideration of this bill, and will work to \nensure its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/27/senate-section/article/S16106-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN HONOR OF HENRY WINKLER'S 50TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, as a long-standing member and now \nChairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, I have \nbeen an outspoken critic of movie and television programs that have a \nnegative impact on our children. However, I do make a point to single \nout those who make a positive contribution to quality programming. \nToday I want not only to pay tribute to an individual who has worked \ndiligently to create programs that uplift and instruct our children, \nbut also to extend congratulatory birthday greetings. Henry Winkler, an \nindividual who already has established a milestone in television \nhistory, will celebrate another milestone on October 30, when he turns \na golden fifty years of age.\n  All of us know Henry Winkler as the ``Fonz'' on the long running TV \nshow ``Happy Days''. His famous motorcycle jacket is a permanent piece \nof the Smithsonian Institute's collection. As an actor, Mr. Winkler \ncreated a national icon. Today, he has established himself as one of \nHollywood's most respected producers of family-oriented entertainment, \nand has drawn attention to humanitarian and family causes. In the \n1970s, he won the prestigious Humanitas Award for his program ``Who Are \nthe DeBolts?'', a documentary on a family with nineteen children, many \nof them adopted with special needs. In the 1980s, Henry brought back \nthe ``Fonz'' to host the video ``Strong Kids, Safe Kids'', a widely \ndistributed cassette that addressed child abuse. His production \ncompany, ``JZM''--the initials derived from each first name of his \nthree children--produced children's specials addressing a variety of \nimportant issues such as divorce and teenage drunk driving. Families \nalso have enjoyed the exploits of ``MacGyver'', the story of an action \nhero who solved crimes with creativity and scientific knowledge, rather \nthan guns or brute violence. Henry also continues to act, portraying \ncharacters who invariably learn or teach a heartwarming lesson, \nincluding last year's ``Truman Capote's One Christmas'', in which Henry \nco-starred with the legendary Katherine Hepburn. As both actor and \nproducer, Henry has proven that good, clean programming can be \nentertaining, and as the ``Fonz'' would say, cool.\n  Henry Winkler's devotion and commitment to quality programming stems \nfrom clear fact: Henry Winkler is a quality human being. He has applied \nthis same energy to the welfare of all children. He is a founding \nmember of the Children's Action Network, dedicated to raising the \nprofile of children's issues through the media. He has been national \nchairman of the annual Toys for Tots campaign, honorary chairman of the \nEpilepsy Foundation of America, the Special Olympics, and numerous \nteenage alcohol and drug abuse programs.\n  In recognition of his many humanitarian efforts, Henry Winkler has \nbeen honored by the United Nations, B'nai B'rith, Women in Film, and \nCedars-Sinai Medical Center. Also honored by Hollywood, Mr. Winkler has \nhis own star on the ``Walk of Stars''. In both his personal and \nprofessional life, Henry Winkler set a positive and highly respected \nstandard for the entertainment industry. My wife, Harriett, and I join \nHenry's family and friends in wishing him a very happy birthday, good \nhealth and best wishes for another half-century of continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/27/senate-section/article/S16107-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/27/senate-section/article/S16107-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/27/senate-section/article/S16107-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:05 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2491.

A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to strengthen \nthe payment limitations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                     the farm fairness act of 1995\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the commitment we have made to \nbalancing the budget has forced each of us to reassess a wide variety \nof Federal programs. We are asking tough but necessary questions about \nwelfare, Medicare, funding for the arts, and so forth, all with an eye \ntoward determining whether we are truly doing right by the taxpayer, \nand whether we can afford to continue the status quo.\n  One corner of the budget that I believe deserves this kind of \nheightened scrutiny is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's farm \nsubsidy programs. Each year about $10 billion gets plowed into price \nand income supports for commodities, in the name of helping the \nstruggling family farmer. But there's substantial evidence to show that \nthese programs are not serving the interests of those small farmers, \nnor are they doing justice to America's taxpayers.\n  The current system for distributing commodity payments is too \ncomplicated, plagued by too many loopholes, and permits far too many \ntax dollars to flow to wealthy landowners, passive investors, and \nothers who the programs are not designed to serve. Perhaps worst of \nall, the system in place today actually encourages farmers to try to \ncircumvent the laws governing who is eligible for program payments and \nthe limits on how much they can receive. The resulting waste and abuse \nis not fair to the taxpayer, nor is it fair to the overwhelming \nmajority of hard-working farmers who are obeying the spirit as well as \nthe letter of the law.\n  That is why I rise today to introduce the Farm Fairness Act of 1995, \na plan to dramatically reform the payment limit and eligibility laws, \nand restore some basic fairness to the way subsidies are distributed. \nThis legislation would go a long way toward rooting out the waste and \nabuse in the commodity programs while strengthening our commitment to \nthe family farmer these programs are meant to support. What's more, it \nwould save hundreds of millions of dollars each year, which would \nenable us to significantly reduce the cuts in the commodity programs we \nare asking the small- and medium-sized farmer to absorb over the next \nbudget cycle.\n   Mr. President, the need for the kind of changes I am proposing has \nbeen well established by the USDA inspector general. Over the last few \nyears, the IG's office has produced dozens of investigative reports \ndocumenting widespread attempts to cash in on loopholes in the law. \nThese plans invariably involve the creation of shell corporations set \nup for the sole purpose of getting around the $50,000 cap on payments \nthat was set by Congress. These efforts have been effective, too: in \n1993, nearly 10,000 farms received payments above the $50,000 limit.\n  The law is so full of loopholes that these excessive payments are \ntechnically legal, even though they make a mockery of the $50,000 cap. \nIn fact, a U.S. Attorney's Office recently declined to prosecute a \nsubstantial fraud case against a big farming group because, in the \njudgment of the U.S. Attorney, the law seemed to sanction the group's \ndeceptive behavior. ``[T]he program rules are not simply complex, but \nactually invite the creation of complicated entities, and numerous \nfederal payments, that arguably do not correspond to a common sense \nnotion of farming,'' the U.S. Attorney wrote.\n  Perhaps the most notorious case of abuse is that of landowner \nprofiled a few years ago on ``60 Minutes,'' whose family exploited \nseveral loopholes in the eligibility laws to receive almost $3 million \nin USDA money over a 2 year period. He did it by creating an ornate \nownership structure that looked like a Christmas tree, but this tree \nwas trimmed with phony partners: among them were three churches and a \nlocal boy scout council that the landowner used to maximize his \npayments.\n  Like this landowner, many farmers are enticed by these loopholes to \nconcentrate more on farming the government than farming their land. \nThis trend of farming the government is so pervasive that one former \nAgriculture Secretary called it ``the principal problem'' in the \nfarming community today.\n  As a result of these flaws in the law, you don't have to be a farmer \nto receive farm subsidies. In fact, a recent study showed that at least \n$2 billion in crop payments have been made to individuals living in \nAmerica's 50 biggest cities over the last decade. We cannot think of \nany justification for crop subsidies going to Manhattan, Greenwich, and \nBeverly Hills.\n  More farm subsidies are going to nonfarming locales than any taxpayer \nwould ever guess. That's because, in spite of the rhetoric about the \nfamily farmer, these programs are disproportionately benefiting wealthy \nlandowners and off-farm investors: The richest 4 percent of program \nparticipants receive more than 40 percent of all payments.\n  If we are to justify a continued investment in the commodity \nprograms, I believe there must be some fundamental reforms. The \nlegislation I am introducing today would do just that. It is designed \nto restore some common sense to the administration of these programs, \nto remove the incentives for farming the government, and ultimately to \nbetter target the subsidies to those who were meant to receive them.\n  Among other things, this proposal would: Close the loopholes that \nallow huge sums of farm subsidies to flow to nonfarmers; eliminate the \nshell corporations the current rules encourage farmers to create; set \ntough penalties for cheating the Government to add a real deterrent for \nengaging in fraudulent behavior; bring some simplicity into a system \nthat is nearly unintelligible to anyone but a well-trained lawyer; and \nreduce the budget in a way that minimizes the pain for the small family \nfarmer who is playing by the rules.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Farm Fairness Act \nwould save approximately $1.8 billion over the next 7 years. I believe \nthat is a conservative estimate, and that if the reforms I am proposing \nare properly enforced, this legislation would reduce commodity payments \nanywhere from $2 billion to $3 billion over 7 years. That amounts to a \nsignificant chunk of the $13.4 billion in commodity program cuts called \nfor in the budget reconciliation package we are in the process of \nconsidering.\n  Without a proposal like this, those cuts will be made across the \nboard, meaning the small wheat farmer in Fargo will suffer as much as \nthe passive investor in Key Largo. To prevent that from happening, I \nintend to offer a version of the Farm Fairness Act as an amendment to \nthe budget reconciliation bill this week.\n  This proposal is called the Farm Fairness Act because it will restore \nsome fairness to the way we support farmers, by targeting payments to \nthe people who are actually plowing the fields and harvesting the \ncrops. And it will make sure that taxpayers finally get a fair return \nfor the tax dollars we spend on the commodity programs. It is a \nbalanced measure, one that Members from both farm and nonfarm States \ncan support, and I would urge my colleagues to do so.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this \nlegislation be included in the Record, along with a section-by-section \nsummary that I have prepared explaining the contents of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1367\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall become \n     effective on October 1, 1996.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n       The Farm Fairness Act of 1995--Section-by-Section Summary\n\n\n                               section 1\n\n       [Bill title.]\n\n\n                               section 2\n\n       Payment limits: This section would set a new, single \n     payment limit of $35,000 for any individual, corporation or \n     any other legal ``entity'' seeking to enroll in the USDA's \n     main crop subsidy programs. This limit would apply to all \n     commodity payments, but it would not include the various \n     conservation programs.\n       Under current law, there is a confusing multi-tier system \n     of various payment limits. An individual or corporation can \n     receive up to $50,000 in deficiency payments; up to $75,000 \n     in several other price support payments (marketing loan \n     gains, loan deficiency payments, and the sporadically-used \n     ``Findlay'' payments); and up to a total of $250,000 for all \n     payments.\n       In light of the fact that fewer than 2% of all program \n     participants receive more than $40,000 in deficiency \n     payments, creating a single $35,000 cap seems a reasonable \n     step that would impact very few family while producing \n     significant budget savings.\n       Direct attribution: One of the biggest problems with the \n     current system of payment limits is that it has established \n     different limit levels depending on how the farming operation \n     is structured. This makes it relatively easy for large \n     producers to receive payments several times the current \n     $50,000 and $75,000 limits.\n       This section would solve that problem by requiring the \n     attribution of all crop subsidy payments directly to \n     individuals, via social security numbers. For corporations, \n     payments would still be distributed to the legal entity, but \n     it would be attributed to the individual shareholders based \n     on their respective interests in the corporation.\n\n\n                               section 3\n\n       This section would close a widely-exploited loophole in the \n     existing rules by adding general partnerships and joint \n     ventures to the \n\n[[Page S 16110]]\n     list of business organizations that are subject to the payment \n     limitations.\n       Under current law, general partnerships and joint ventures \n     are not listed under the definition of legal ``persons'' and \n     are thus exempt from the payment limitations. This exemption \n     gives farming operations a heavy incentive to structure their \n     businesses under the aegis of a general partnership: the more \n     ``entities'' included in the partnership, the more payments \n     the operation can receive.\n\n\n                               section 4\n\n       This section would repeal the most flagrantly-abused \n     provision in the payment limit laws: the ``Three-Entity \n     Rule.''\n       This rule was passed by Congress in 1987 purportedly to \n     limit the number of sources from which a farmer could receive \n     payments. In reality, though, it has mostly been an \n     invitation for farmers to structure their operations in such \n     a way as to maximize payments.\n       This section would allow farmers to receive payments from \n     any number of sources. But because of the strict $35,000 \n     limit we establish, and the direct attribution system, there \n     will be few remaining incentives for farmers to form multiple \n     corporations and ``shell'' entities that exist only on paper.\n\n\n                               section 5\n\n       For any payment limitation reforms to work, the loopholes \n     in the rules defining who is ``actively engaged in farming'' \n     need to be tightened. Otherwise, significant dollars will \n     continue to flow to off-farm investors, and big operations \n     will continue to flout the payment limits.\n       This section contains several sensible changes in the \n     eligibility rules. Among others, it would:\n       Require any individual or majority shareholder(s) in a \n     corporation to make a significant contribution of ``active \n     personal management'' and ``active personal labor.'' Current \n     rules require only one or the other.\n       Require minority shareholders to contribute at least \n     ``active management'' or ``active labor'' on the farm. \n     Current rules allow too many passive stockholders to receive \n     payments just by making a contribution of capital, land or \n     equipment, i.e., money. If a minority shareholder does not \n     meet this threshold, the corporation's payments will be \n     reduced in proportion to that shareholders stake in the \n     venture.\n       Redefine ``active personal management'' to demand a regular \n     and consistent presence on the farm during the growing \n     season, to guarantee that payees are closely involved in the \n     day-to-day operations of the farming venture. The current \n     definition is exceedingly vague, requiring only that the \n     contribution be ``critical to the farm's profitability.''\n       Toughen the requirements on landowners. Under current law, \n     landowners are essentially exempt from the labor and \n     management contribution requirements, as long as they are \n     engaged in a true share-lease arrangement with a tenant. This \n     provision would require that the tenant actually be \n     ``actively engaged'' for the landowner to qualify for \n     payments.\n       Lastly, this section would expressly prohibit individuals \n     or shareholders from using their subsidy payments to account \n     for their required capital contribution. Under current rules, \n     farmers can apply their advanced deficiency payments toward \n     their capital contribution, which undercuts the legal \n     requirement that a recipient be at risk.\n\n\n                               section 6\n\n       This section would increase the penalties for engaging in a \n     ``scheme or device''--creating bogus corporations, etc.--and \n     defrauding the government.\n       Under current law, any individual or entity found by the \n     USDA to be engaged in a scheme or device is prohibited from \n     receiving payments for the rest of that crop year as well as \n     the next crop year. This provision would ban payments for the \n     succeeding five crop years. In addition, any individual or \n     entity participating in commodity programs that is convicted \n     of defrauding the government would be banned from receiving \n     payments for the next 10 years. (There is currently no \n     additional punishment for persons convicted of fraud.)\n       These steps are designed to create a real deterrent against \n     attempts to milk the system and deceive the government. The \n     existing penalties are clearly not having any impact.\n\n\n                               section 7\n\n       This section would establish the effective date of these \n     changes as October 1, 1996.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/27/senate-section/article/S16108-2", "month": "10",

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) The current Internal Revenue Code, with its myriad \n     deductions, credits and schedules, and over 12,000 pages of \n     rules and regulations, is long overdue for a complete \n     overhaul;\n       (2) It is an unacceptable waste of our nation's precious \n     resources when Americans spend an estimated 5.4 billion hours \n     every year compiling information and filling out Internal \n     Revenue Code tax forms, and in addition, spend hundreds of \n     billions of dollars every year in tax code compliance. \n     America's resources could be dedicated to far more productive \n     pursuits.\n       (3) The primary goal of any tax reform must be to unleash \n     growth and remove the inefficiencies of the current tax code, \n     with a flat tax that will expand the economy by an estimated \n     $2 trillion over seven years;\n       (4) Another important goal of tax reform is to achieve \n     fairness, with a single low flat tax rate for all individuals \n     and businesses and an increase in personal and dependent \n     exemptions, is preferable to the current tax code;\n       (5) Simplicity is another critically important goal of tax \n     reform, and it is in the public interest to have a ten-lined \n     tax form that fits on a postcard and takes 10 minutes to fill \n     out;\n       (6) The home mortgage interest deduction is an important \n     element in the financial planning of millions of American \n     families and must be retained in a limited form; and\n       (7) Charitable organizations play a vital role in our \n     nation's social fabric and any tax reform package must \n     include a limited deduction for charitable contributions.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should proceed expeditiously to adopt flat tax \n     legislation which would replace the current tax code with a \n     fairer, simpler, pro-growth and deficit neutral flat tax with \n     a low, single rate and limited deductions for home mortgage \n     interest and charitable contributions.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      GRASSLEY AMENDMENT NO. 2987\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill S. 1357, supra, as follows:\n\n       Before ``; and'' at the end of sec. 2111 (a)(1)(D), insert \n     the following: ``; however, the payment of burial and/or \n     funeral expenses of the individual shall be subject to 42 \n     U.S.C.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Enhanced Enterprise \n     Zones Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 12972. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Many of the Nation's urban centers are places with high \n     levels of poverty, high rates of welfare dependency, high \n     crime rates, poor schools, and joblessness.\n       (2) Federal tax incentives and regulatory reforms can \n     encourage economic growth, job creation and small business \n     formation in many urban centers.\n       (3) Encouraging private sector investment in America's \n     economically distressed urban and rural areas is essential to \n     breaking the cycle of poverty and the related ills of crime, \n     drug abuse, illiteracy, welfare dependency, and unemployment.\n       (4) The provisions creating empowerment zones that were \n     enacted in 1993 should be enhanced by providing incentives to \n     increase entrepreneurial growth, capital formation, job \n     creation, educational opportunities, and homeownership in \n     designated enterprise communities and empowerment zones.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this subtitle is to increase \n     job creation, small business expansion and formation, \n     educational opportunities, and homeownership in economically \n     depressed areas by providing Federal tax incentives, \n     regulatory reforms, school reform pilot projects, and \n     homeownership incentives.\n\n                   CHAPTER 1--FEDERAL TAX INCENTIVES\n\n     SEC. 12973.

Some six thousand refugees recently reached \n     Zenica and reported that nearly two thousand family members \n     from this group are still unaccounted for.\n       (5) The U.N. spokesman in Zagreb reported that many \n     refugees have been given only a few minutes to leave their \n     homes and that ``girls as young as 17 are reported to have \n     been taken into wooded areas and raped.'' Elderly, sick and \n     very young refugees have been driven to remote areas and \n     forced to walk long distances on unsafe roads and cross \n     rivers without bridges.\n       (6) The War Crime Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has \n     collected volumes of evidence of atrocities, including the \n     establishment of death camps, mass executions and systematic \n     campaigns of rape and terror. This War Crimes Tribunal has \n     already issued 43 indictments on the basis of this evidence.\n       (7) The Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights has \n     described the eye witness accounts as ``prima facia evidence \n     of war crimes which, if confirmed, could very well lead to \n     further indictments by the War Crimes Tribunal.''\n       (8) The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that \n     more than 22,000 Muslims and Croats have been forced from \n     their homes since mid-September in Bosnian Serb controlled \n     areas.\n       (9) In opening the Dodd Center Symposium on the topic of \n     ``50 Years After Nuremburg'' on October 16, 1995, President \n     Clinton cited the ``excellent progress'' of the War Crimes \n     Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and said, ``Those accused \n     of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide must be \n     brought to justice. They must be tried and, if found guilty, \n     they must be held accountable.''\n       (10) President Clinton also observed on October 16, 1995, \n     ``some people are concerned that pursuing peace in Bosnia and \n     prosecuting war criminals are incompatible goals. But I \n     believe they are wrong. There must be peace for justice to \n     prevail, but there must be justice when peace prevails.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Senate condemns the systematic human rights abuses \n     against the people of Bosnia and Herzogovenia.\n       (2) with peace talks scheduled to begin in the United \n     States on October 31, 1995, and with the President clearly \n     indicating his willingness to send American forces into the \n     heart of this conflict, these new reports of Serbian \n     atrocities are of grave concern to all Americans.\n       (3) the Bosnian Serb leadership should immediately halt \n     these atrocities, fully account for the missing, and allow \n     those who have been separated to return to their families.\n       (4) the International Red Cross, United Nations agencies \n     and human rights organizations should be granted full and \n     complete access to all locations throughout Bosnia and \n     Herzogovenia.\n       (5) the Bosnian Serb leadership should fully cooperate to \n     facilitate the complete investigation of the above \n     allegations so that those responsible may be held accountable \n     under international treaties, conventions, obligations and \n     law.\n       (6) the United States should continue to support the work \n     of the War Crime Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.\n       (7) the United States should ensure that any negotiated \n     peace agreements in former Yugoslavia, particularly with \n     respect to Bosnia, require all states of the former \n     Yugoslavia to cooperate fully with the War Crimes Tribunal \n     and apprehend and turn over for trial any indicted persons \n     found in their territories.\n       (8) ethnic cleansing'' by any faction, group, leader, or \n     government is unjustified, immoral and illegal and all \n     perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide \n     and other human rights violations in former Yugoslavia must \n     be held accountable.\n                                 ______\n\n                                 \n[[Page S 16119]]\n\n\n                 HEFLIN (AND SHELBY) AMENDMENT NO. 2995\n\n       Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Heflin, for himself, and Mr. Shelby) \n     proposed an amendment to the bill S. 1357, supra, as follows:\n\n       On page 1773, strike line 24, and insert the following:\n       (c) Special Rule for States in Which Only Punitive Damages \n     May Be Awarded in Wrongful Death Actions.--Section 104 is \n     amended by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (d) and \n     by inserting after the subsection (b) the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(c) Restriction on Punitive Damages Not To Apply in \n     Certain Cases.--The restriction on the application of \n     subsection (a)(2) to punitive damages shall not apply to \n     punitive damages awarded in a civil action--\n       ``(1) which is a wrongful death action, and\n       ``(2) with respect to which applicable State law (as in \n     effect on September 13, 1995 and without regard to any \n     modification after such date) provides, or has been construed \n     to provide by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a \n     decision issued on or before September 13, 1995, that only \n     punitive damages may be awarded in such an action.\n\n       This subsection shall cease to apply to any civil action \n     filed on or after the first date on which the applicable \n     State law ceases to provide (or is no longer construed to \n     provide) the treatment described in paragraph (2).''\n       (d) Effective Date.--\n                                 ______\n\n\n                       KENNEDY AMENDMENT NO. 2996\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY proposed an amendment to the bill S. 1357, supra, as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 469, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n       ``(g) Prohibition of Balance Billing.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law an individual who is enrolled in a \n     medicare choice plan under this part shall not be liable for \n     a provider's charges for items or services furnished under \n     the plan if such charges are in excess of the copayments, \n     coinsurance and deductibles required by such plan in \n     accordance with subsection (c)\n                                 ______\n\n\n                D'AMATO (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2997\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. D'Amato (for himself, Mr. Grams, and Mr. Shelby) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by them to the bill S. 1357, supra, \nas follows:\n\n       At the end of chapter 8 of subtitle I of title XII, insert:\n\n     SEC.--.

Any such process shall require the provision of \n     assistance to individuals who wish to apply but whose \n     disability limits their ability to apply. The initial \n     screening and the determination of disability (as defined \n     under section 7503(b)) shall be conducted by a public agency.\n       (C) Restrictions.--\n       (i) In general.--The plan may not limit the eligibility of \n     individuals with disabilities based on--\n       (I) income;\n       (II) age;\n       (III) residential setting (other than with respect to an \n     institutional setting, in accordance with clause (ii)); or\n       (IV) other grounds specified by the Secretary;\n     except that through fiscal year 2005, the Secretary may \n     permit a State to limit eligibility based on level of \n     disability or geography (if the State ensures a balance \n     between urban and rural areas).\n       (ii) Institutional setting.--The plan may limit the \n     eligibility of individuals with disabilities based on the \n     definition of the term ``institutional setting'', as \n     determined by the State.\n       (D) Continuation of services.--The plan must provide \n     assurances that, in the case of an individual receiving \n     medical assistance for home and community-based services \n     under the State medicaid plan under title XXI of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) as of the date a \n     State's plan is approved under this subtitle, the State will \n     continue to make available (either under this plan, under the \n     State medicaid plan, or otherwise) to such individual an \n     appropriate level of assistance for home and community-based \n     services, taking into account the level of assistance \n     provided as of such date and the individual's need for home \n     and community-based services.\n       (3) Services.--\n       (A) Needs assessment.--Not later than the end of the second \n     year of implementation, the plan or its amendments shall \n     include the results of a statewide assessment of the needs of \n     individuals with disabilities in a format required by the \n     Secretary.

as follows:\n\n       (a) The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Human rights violations and atrocities continue \n     unabated in the Former Yugoslavia.\n       (2) The Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights \n     recently reported that starting in mid-September and \n     intensifying between October 6 and October 12, 1995 many \n     thousands of Bosnian Muslims and Croats in Northwest Bosnia \n     were systematically forced from their homes by paramilitary \n     units, local police and in some instances, Bosnian Serb Army \n     officials and soliders.\n       (3) Despite the October 12, 1995 cease-fire which went into \n     effect by agreement of the warring parties in the former \n     Yugoslavia, Bosnian Serbs continue to conduct a brutal \n     campaign to expel non-Serb civilians who remain in Northwest \n     Bosnia, and are subjecting non-Serbs to untold horror--\n     murder, rape, robbery and other violence.\n       (4) Horrible examples of ``ethnic cleansing'' persist in \n     Northwest Bosnia. Some six thousand refugees recently reached \n     Zenica and reported that nearly two thousand family members \n     from this group are still unaccounted for.\n       (5) The U.N. spokesman in Zagreb reported that many \n     refugees have been given only a few minutes to leave their \n     homes and that ``girls as young as 17 are reported to have \n     been taken into wooded areas and raped.'' Elderly, sick and \n     very young refugees have been driven to remote areas and \n     forced to walk long distances on unsafe roads and cross \n     rivers without bridges.\n       (6) The War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has \n     collected volumes of evidence of atrocities, including the \n     establishment of death camps, mass executions and systematic \n     campaigns of rape and terror. This War Crimes Tribunal has \n     already issued 43 indictments on the basis of this evidence.\n       (7) The Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights has \n     described the eye witness accounts as ``prima facia evidence \n     of war crimes which, if confirmed, could very well lead to \n     further indictments by the War Crimes Tribunal.''\n       (8) The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that \n     more than 22,000 Muslims and Croats have been forced from \n     their homes since mid-September in Bosnian Serb controlled \n     areas.\n       (9) In opening the Dodd Center Symposium on the topic of \n     ``50 Years After Nuremburg'' on October 16, 1995, President \n     Clinton cited the ``excellent progress'' of the War Crimes \n     Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and said, ``Those accused \n     of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide must be \n\n[[Page S 16131]]\n     brought to justice. They must be tried and, if found guilty, they must \n     be held accountable.''\n       (10) President Clinton also observed on October 16, 1995, \n     ``some people are concerned about pursuing peace in Bosnia \n     and prosecuting war criminals are incompatible goals. But I \n     believe they are wrong. There must be peace for justice to \n     prevail, but there must be justice when peace prevails.\n       (b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Senate condemns the systematic human rights abuses \n     against the people of Bosnia and Herzegovena.\n       (2) with peace talks scheduled to begin in the United \n     States on October 31, 1995, these new reports of Serbian \n     atrocities are of grave concern to all Americans.\n       (3) the Bosnian serb leadership should immediately halt \n     these atrocities, fully account for the missing, and allow \n     those who have been separated to return to their families.\n       (4) the International Red Cross, United Nations agencies \n     and human rights organizations should be granted full and \n     complete access to all locations throughout Bosnia and \n     Herzogovenia.\n       (5) the Bosnian Serb leadership should fully cooperate to \n     facilitate the complete investigation of the above \n     allegations so that those responsible may be held accountable \n     under international treaties, conventions, obligations and \n     law.\n       (6) the United States should continue to support the work \n     of the War Crime Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.\n       (7) ethnic cleansing'' by any faction, group, leader, or \n     government is unjustified, immoral and illegal and all \n     perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide \n     and other human rights violations in former Yugoslavia must \n     be held accountable.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        KOHL AMENDMENT NO. 3016\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Kohl) proposed an amendment to the bill S. \n1357, supra, as follows:\n\n       At the end of chapter 8 of subtitle I of title XII, insert \n     the following new sections:\n\n     SEC. 12879.

Mr. President, on January 31, 1995, I introduced \nmy first bill as a U.S. Senator, S. 3004, the Commercial Aviation Fuel \nTax Repeal Act. We are now on the verge of passing a budget which, for \nthe first time in 26 years, will balance the Federal budget and \neliminate the Federal deficit. I am proud to note that S. 304 has been \nincorporated to a great extent into this historic budget. As a result, \nI wish to take this time to mention the thousands of workers and the \nmany unions and business professionals who have provided consistent \nsupport for this crucial piece of legislation.\n  First, I wish to submit for the record a resolution as passed by the \nNational Aerospace Workforce Coalition. Throughout the debate on the \naviation fuel tax issue, I worked closely with the National Aerospace \nWorkforce Coalition. This organization consists of local unions and \nworkforce associations. The coalition represents some 42 different \nunions in 29 States. Many of my colleagues have received letters and \nphone calls from coalition members in their States. The coalition \nbelieves, as I do, that a commercial aviation fuel tax will be \nextremely harmful to America's manufacturing base.\n  The resolution which I have submitted goes to the heart of the \nrelationship between a tax on jet fuel and commercial aircraft orders, \nnamely, that every increase in taxes on commercial jet fuel will be \nfollowed by more cancellations and deferred orders of American made \nengines and aircraft.\n  The labor unions supporting the repeal of this fuel tax include the \nspectrum of America's aerospace industrial base. This resolution has \nbeen passed by unions representing scientists and engineers, production \nworkers, as well as unions engaged in casting and fabricating the \nspecialized metals used in the production of modern aircraft.\n  Further, I wish to note that the International Association of \nMachinist and Aerospace Workers, District Lodge 141 passed a similarly \nworded resolution on October 24, 1995. This union represents 34,000 \nmembers at 13 airlines, and their delegates unanimously passed this \nresolution at their annual convention.\n  The balanced budget which the Senate will pass shortly relieves the \nairline industry from any unfair tax, but only for a limited time. \nCurrently, the House of Representatives has extended the aviation fuel \ntax exemption for 2 years and the Senate shall extend it for only 17 \nmonths. I am pleased that in these difficult budgetary times both \nChambers have recognized not only the unfairness of this unprecedented \ntax, but the critical need to avoid further hindering a struggling \nindustry. However, absent outright repeal, I strongly believe that any \nextension of the exemption must run for at least 2 years. I will work \nhard during the House-Senate conference on the budget to ensure that \nthe extension extends for at least this long. Further, it is critical \nfor the Congress to address broader taxation and fee issues with \nrespect to the airline industry during the next session of the 104th \nCongress. I will work to hold hearings on this issue in the spring of \n1996.\n  The reasons for at least a 2-year extension are clear. U.S. airlines \nhave lost money every year since 1990, with losses for the period \ntotaling almost $13 billion. Almost one-half of all major U.S. airlines \nhave filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection during the crisis, \nincluding America West, Continental, twice, TWA, twice, Eastern, Pan \nAm, and Midway. The last three have ceased operations altogether. \nCumulative industry debt since 1990 has increased from $9 billion to \n$46 billion, and the bonds of all major U.S. airlines are rated as junk \nbonds. Airlines are facing Government-mandated fleet replacement costs \nto upgrade fleets to quiet technology aircraft that will exceed $15 \nbillion a year through the rest of the decade. Imposing a fuel tax now, \nat a cost of $527 million a year, would wreak havoc on an industry \nstruggling to survive.\n  In addition, the airline industry has historically paid excise and \ncargo fees in lieu of any fuel tax. These fees will exceed $6.9 billion \nin 1995. Imposing a fuel tax absent any broader effort at reassessing \nthese other taxes would be both unprecedented and unfair.\n  Hence, for both fiscal and fairness reasons, an extension of the \naviation fuel tax exemption is greatly needed. While we in the Senate \nhave taken steps in the right direction by incorporating S. 304, in \npart, into this year's budget act, we must continue to ensure that the \nairline industry is taxed fairly. This industry is one of our Nation's \nlast great manufacturing gains, and its tens of thousands of workers \ndeserve the right to continue to uphold America's predominance in this \ncritical industry.\n  I ask that the National Aerospace Workforce Coalition resolution \nreferred to earlier be printed in the Record.\n  The resolution follows:\n\n                      Aviation Fuel Tax Resolution\n\n       Whereas our country's airline industry has suffered \n     enormous losses over the last five years, reducing airline \n     employment by more than 120,000 workers and forcing remaining \n     workers to accept reductions in wages and benefits;\n       Whereas several years ago government mandates required the \n     airline companies to pay excise taxes and fees in lieu of a \n     fuel tax, which today collectively amounts to more than 52 \n     cents per gallon of fuel and places our nation's airline \n     companies at a competitive disadvantage;\n       Whereas there is a direct relationship between a healthy \n     airline industry and a healthy aerospace industry, and that \n     only profitable airlines can modernize their fleets with \n     American-built engines and aircraft to help revive an \n     aerospace industry already devastated by drastic cuts in \n     defense; \n\n[[Page S 16157]]\n\n       Whereas over 1,000 commercial aircraft orders have been \n     canceled or deferred in the past five years, because of \n     losses in the airline industry resulting in a cost of 125,000 \n     airframe and aerospace jobs;\n       Whereas every increase in taxes on commercial airline fuel \n     will be followed by more cancellations and deferred orders of \n     American-made aircraft;\n       Therefore the National Aerospace Workforce Coalition urges \n     the Senate to repeal the aviation fuel tax as it will only \n     cause more hardship for American workers and further erode \n     our country's aerospace industrial base.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/27/senate-section/article/S16156-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CONSECRATION CELEBRATION\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to call to the \nattention of my colleagues the activities that are underway to \ncommemorate the consecration celebration of the St. Demetrios Greek \nOrthodox Church of Baltimore, MD. This indeed is a major achievement \nfor this community and culminates 25 years of dedication, hard work, \nand energetic involvement.\n  His Excellency Metropolitan Silas of New Jersey will join with Father \nErnest Arambiges, pastor of St. Demetrios, and the parishioners and \nfriends of the community to celebrate the ancient ceremony of \nconsecration. This signifies that the church is formally dedicated to \nits spiritual mission.\n  Founded in 1970, St. Demetrios is one of three centers of worship for \nthe Greek Orthodox community in Baltimore. Located in northern \nBaltimore County, St. Demetrios is a product of the love and labor of \nits parishioners. It took the 300 families of St. Demetrios almost 8 \nyears of fundraising before they had the means to build their church's \nedifice. Before that, they worshipped in the auditorium of Parkville \nHigh School. The community has worshipped in the present edifice for \nover a decade and has found itself a permanent and lasting home.\n  The consecration marks a new chapter in the history of Orthodoxy in \nMaryland as the St. Demetrios community is the first in the Baltimore \narea located outside the central city area. It is a focal point for \nwholesome community life where young and old can pray, learn, and grow \ntogether both socially and spiritually.\n  I want to congratulate the entire St. Demetrios family for their \ndedication and for enriching our Baltimore community with this \ninspiring church building.\n  Mr. President, I request that an article from the Baltimore Sun which \nrecords this important event be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                        [From the Baltimore Sun]\n\n               St. Demetrios Consecration Planned Sunday\n\n       In what Greek Orthodox clergy say is ``a once-in-lifetime \n     event,'' Baltimore County's St. Demetrios Church will be \n     consecrated this weekend by two of the denomination's revered \n     leaders, who will encase relics of three early Christian \n     saints in the altar table.\n       His Eminence Archbishop Iskovos and His Excellency \n     Metropolitan Silas will preside at the consecration service \n     at 9 a.m. Sunday, the culmination of a series of ancient \n     rites this week at the domed church at 2504 Cub Hill Road.\n       Construction of the church, decorated in the Byzantine \n     style, began in 1983 on a 30-acre site in the Cub Hill \n     section of the county north of Carney.\n       Bones of Saints Boniface, Cyril of Alexandria and \n     Panteleimon will be brought to the church tomorrow and set on \n     a paten. The relics will be covered with a veil until Sunday \n     morning, when they will be interred in a 1,600-year-old \n     ceremony.\n       During the services Sunday, Archbishop Iakovos, Primate of \n     the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America, \n     will be assisted by Metropolitan Silas, who has immediate \n     jurisdiction over the parish. They will carry the relics \n     around the church three times in a procession of the \n     congregation.\n       Water and oil will be used in the consecration service, \n     which will include the lighting of the vigil lamp before the \n     tabernacle.\n       The congregation's worship and celebrations this week began \n     with the St. Demetrios Feast Day Vesper Service and a \n     reception Wednesday evening, and continued with a Divine \n     Liturgy yesterday morning. The Great and Solemn Vespers of \n     Consecration at 7 p.m. tomorrow will be followed by another \n     reception in the church's Fellowship Hall.\n       The congregation has planned a third reception and a \n     dinner-dance beginning at 5 p.m. Sunday at the Sheraton \n     Baltimore North Hotel, 903 Dulaney Valley Road, Towson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/27/senate-section/article/S16157-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
