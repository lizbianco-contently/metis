Mr. President, today there will be a period for morning \nbusiness until the hour of 3:30 p.m., with Senator Kennedy or his \ndesignee in control of the time from 12:30 to 2 p.m., and Senator \nCoverdell or his designee in control of the time from 2 until 3:30 p.m.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will begin consideration of \nH.R. 3448, the small business tax package legislation. Under the \nconsent agreement reached, there are a limited number of amendments in \norder to that bill and all debate time will be used today. No rollcall \nvotes will occur during today's session. Therefore, any votes ordered \non the amendments will occur at 2:15 on Tuesday.\n  On Tuesday, following the completion of H.R. 3448, the Senate will \nbegin consideration of S. 295, the TEAM Act. As a reminder to all \nSenators, any votes ordered on amendments to the TEAM Act will occur \nduring Wednesday's session of the Senate. Senators should also be \nreminded that, under a previous order, the Senate will vote on passage \nof the Department of Defense authorization bill at 9:30 on Wednesday, \nalthough I should note that because of the likelihood of a signing at \nthe White House of the church burning legislation, we are working to \nsee if we might defer that vote until, I believe, 12 o'clock on \nWednesday. But we will make that official later on during the day, if \nwe get it all worked out.\n  Immediately following that vote, the Senate will proceed to the House \nof Representatives for a joint meeting of Congress to hear an address \nby the Prime Minister of Israel. Of course, if we do not have that vote \nat 9:30, we will assemble here and we will go right to the House for \nthat joint meeting.\n  Due to the joint meeting, it may be necessary to postpone the vote on \nthe passage of DOD until later in the afternoon on Tuesday, as I have \nalready announced. We will make that announcement as soon as possible \ntoday.\n  At noon on Wednesday, there will be a vote on the motion to invoke \ncloture on the motion to proceed to S. 1788, the National Right To Work \nAct.\n  Finally, I should say the appropriations process has to move forward. \nI anticipate we will take actions this week on appropriations measures. \nThe first will be the Department of Defense appropriations bill, to be \nfollowed by the foreign operations appropriations bill.\n  All Members should plan their schedules to anticipate votes, probably \ninto the early evening on Tuesday and on Wednesday, although we hope \nnot to go late. Then, on Thursday, depending on what progress we have \nmade on the DOD appropriations bill and the foreign ops appropriations \nbill, we could go late into the evening on Thursday.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/08/senate-section/article/S7345-4", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig).

Mr. President, tomorrow, July 9, is minimum wage day in \nthe U.S. Senate. The Senate will finally have an up-or-down vote on a \nfair increase in the minimum wage. The minimum wage has been stuck at \nits\n\n[[Page S7346]]\n\ncurrent level of $4.25 an hour for some 5 years. The increase that we \npropose to $5.15 an hour should have gone into effect at least a year \nago. But for 18 months Republicans refused to allow this Senate to \nvote.\n  Now the long overdue vote is about to take place, but the Republican \nobstruction has not ended. Opponents of the minimum wage have devised a \nshameless trick to prevent as much of the increase as possible, by \ndelaying it and by denying it to large numbers of deserving American \nworkers.\n  The Republican amendment is a sham. It purports to raise the minimum \nwage from $4.25 to $5.15 an hour, but in fact it will deny that \nincrease to most Americans who would otherwise receive it. To \nparaphrase the words of a country and western song, ``One step forward, \ntwo steps back, you don't get a raise with a trick like that.''\n  Under our Democratic proposal, more than 13 million Americans will \nreceive a raise when the minimum wage bill is passed. Under the \nRepublican amendment, most of these workers would never see that raise. \nFirst, the Republican amendment exempts more than 4 million workers, \nalmost half of all the minimum wage workers earning between $4.25 and \n$5.15 an hour, by creating a permanent subminimum wage for the first 6 \nmonths on the job.\n  Second, the Republican amendment exempts two-thirds of all workers \neligible for the increase by exempting the 10 million workers and \nbusinesses with annual sales of less than $500,000 a year.\n  Third, the Republican amendment exempts the 2 million employees in \nrestaurants and other establishments who rely on tips for part of that \nincome.\n  These three exemptions clearly overlap. Some workers will be caught \nby all three exemptions. The Republicans have left no stone unturned in \ntheir cynical attempt to find as many ways as possible to deny a fair \nincrease in the minimum wage to as many American workers as possible. \nBut Republicans are not even satisfied with these massive exemptions. \nThey also want to delay the increase in the minimum wage for anyone who \nstill qualifies to receive it.\n  As one more insult to American workers, the Republican amendment \nwould delay the increase by 6 more months, until January 1997. No \nincrease at all for anyone in 1996 is the last line of defense for \nRepublicans in their unseemly battle against the minimum wage.\n  So, President Clinton is correct to say, as he did in his veto letter \nof June 28, 1996, that he will veto a minimum wage increase that \ncontains any of these Republican tricks.\n  Make no mistake, a vote for the Bond amendment is a vote to kill the \nminimum wage increase for now and for the foreseeable future. That is \nthe strategy of the Republicans and their right-wing allies.\n  The National Retail Federation has mounted a campaign in support of \nthe Republican amendment. They sent out an action alert last week, in \nwhich they abandon any pretense that the Republican amendment is \nanything other than an attempt to kill the minimum wage increase. The \nRepublican amendment, they say, ``is our last chance and best hope for \nstopping the minimum wage increase this year.''\n  Mr. President, I will include it all in the Record. On page 1, the \nbottom of page 1, it says, ``It is our last chance and best hope for \nstopping the minimum wage increase this year,'' to support the Bond \namendment. Then it lists a number of the Senators who should be \ntargeted by their organization.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter and list be printed at this point \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       National Retail Federation\n\n\n                               memorandum\n\n     To: Government and Legal Affairs Committee, National \n         Association Executives.\n     From: John J. Motley III, Senior Vice President, Government \n         and Public Affairs.\n     Re action needed on minimum wage.\n     Date: July 1, 1996.\n       Attached for your review and use is an action alert \n     describing the current situation with the minimum wage \n     increase in the U.S. Senate.\n       The Senate will vote on the minimum wage increase on July \n     9. NRF is working to pass the Bond amendment and defeat the \n     Kennedy amendment.\n       For those of you with operations in the targeted states--\n     Arkansas, Colorado, Maine, Nebraska, New York, Pennsylvania, \n     South Dakota, and Vermont--any help you could lend getting \n     Senators to support the Bond amendment would be much \n     appreciated. NRF members and the state retail association \n     executives based in the target states have already received a \n     copy of the action alert.\n       The vote will be close. If more than two Republicans vote \n     against Bond and not one Democrat votes for it, we cannot \n     win.\n       Passing the Bond amendment is probably our best change to \n     kill the minimum wage increase.

Thanks so much for your help.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So the battle lines are clearly drawn.\n  I urge the Senate to stand with American working families, not \nagainst them. I urge the Senate to stand for the basic principle that \nthe minimum wage should be a living wage; that no American who works \nfor a living should have to live in poverty.\n  Tomorrow's vote will be one of the most important votes in the U.S. \nSenate this year. Millions of hard-working men and women are struggling \nto lift themselves out of poverty and provide a decent life for their \nfamilies. They are looking to us for hope and help, and it is time for \nthem to get a raise.\n  Our Democratic proposal would raise the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour \nin two 45-cent steps. The first step would take place as of July 4 this \nyear, and I mention, Mr. President, that is in the legislation, but, \nobviously, since that date has passed, with the passage of our \namendment, it is hoped that in conference we can delay the \nimplementation of that for 30 days after the President signs. That will \ngive a reasonable period of time for it to be implemented and \nreasonable notification to those who are going to have to pay it.\n  As of that date, the minimum wage would be $4.70 an hour. The second \npart of the increase, to $5.15, would take place on July 4 next year. \nRaising the minimum wage is critical for millions of low-wage workers \nwho are directly affected by it, and it is critical for the economy as \na whole.\n  The widening income gap is a worsening problem in the United States, \nand the declining purchasing power of the minimum wage is a significant \nproblem.\n  Mr. President, this chart shows how America grew from 1950 to 1978--\n``Growing Together, Real Family Income Growth by Quintile.'' What we \nsee is those at the bottom level of the economic ladder actually grew \n138 percent. They grew more than any other sector of our economy. The \nsecond quintile at 98 percent; the third at 106 percent; the fourth at \n111 percent; and the top 20 percent at 99 percent. All America grew \ntogether, and if there was any answer, it was that all Americans were \nplaying by the rules, working hard providing for their families, which \nwas part of the whole American growth pattern.\n  But look what has happened since. This first chart represents 1950 to \n1978. Now on this second chart, we have from 1979 to 1994. This chart \nreflects real family income growth by quintile, but it is growing \napart. The largest continuing growth has been on the top 20 percent, \nand if you went to the top 5 percent, you would see that percent of \ngrowth even higher. If you went to the top 1 percent, the wealthiest \nindividuals and corporations, you would see that those numbers would go \nup even higher.\n\n[[Page S7347]]\n\n  What has happened is, on the bottom 20 percent, you see the real \nfamily income had an actual decline of 11 percent from 1979 to 1994. \nThis does not represent what I think most Americans expect, hope for, \nand think is fair. What they expect is that all Americans will grow and \nparticipate in an expanding economy. Quite to the contrary. We see \nthose who are on the bottom 20 percent have seen the most serious \ndecline in family income. It is in this particular group that the \nminimum wage workers are most adversely affected.\n  Since 1979, 97 percent of the increase in real household income has \ngone to the wealthiest 20 percent of American families, while only 3 \npercent has gone to the other 80 percent. The real family income of \nmost American families has declined since 1979, while the real income \nof the top 20 percent of families grew by 18 percent. Part of the \ndecline in income for working families has been caused by the drop in \nthe purchasing power of the minimum wage, which has fallen almost 30 \npercent since 1979. It is worth 50 cents an hour less today than when \nit was last raised in 1991.\n\n  Mr. President, this chart reflects the declining real value of the \nminimum wage over the period from 1960 up to 1995. What we see is the \nreal purchasing value. It has been gradually increasing at the lower \nlevels, which I will get to in a few moments. But this chart represents \nthe real minimum wage, from 1960 to 1995, and going back to 1969, 1970 \nin purchasing power, it would be $6.45 today instead of $4.25. That is \na $2 spread in purchasing power for working families, not to families \nwho are on welfare, but working families who want to keep off welfare. \nThey are playing by the rules: 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year.\n  Effectively, they have taken a significant cut in their purchasing \npower, from $6.45 down to what it would be now at $4.25. This \nrepresents the declining value of the purchasing power for families. In \n1991, the last time the minimum wage was increased, we got a slight \nblip and now it has gone right back down, at the present time, even \nbelow where it was in 1989.\n  Incredibly, the economy today is a great deal stronger than it was in \n1989. Still, in 1989, we have had not only virtually all of the \nDemocrats voting for an increase in the minimum wage, but we had \nRepublicans as well. We had Republicans as well. Senator Dole voted for \nan increase. Speaker Gingrich at that time voted for the increase in \nthe minimum wage when our economy was not as strong.\n  Now we find the purchasing power is right back to where it was in \n1989. The economy is a great deal stronger, and we have been seeing the \ncomplete opposition by the leadership of the House of Representatives \nthat said we will not give an opportunity to vote on an increase in the \nminimum wage.\n  Finally, the American people spoke about that issue, and finally, \nreluctantly, the House of Representatives increased the minimum wage \nwith some courageous Republicans who supported it.\n  Now, after over a year of trying to get a vote on the minimum wage by \nattaching it, or threatening to attach it, to any of the different \npieces of legislation that came along, we are now in a position where \nwe will get an opportunity to vote on the minimum wage, not just to \nvote on increasing the minimum wage, which has been the tradition, \nhistoric tradition of the increases in minimum wage, but we will vote \non a proposal of our Republican friends that I described earlier that \non the one hand would appear to give the increase in the minimum wage, \nbut, on the other hand clearly takes it back.\n  So that, Mr. President, is how we find this debate, both today and \ntomorrow, and why we believe that it is so important that Americans \nwill let their Members of Congress know again that working families \nought to be entitled to an increase in the minimum wage to, not even \nbring the working families out of poverty, but at least give them about \n$1,800 more, which is a good deal more income for families. It would \nreflect about a 22- or 23-percent increase in their wages, enough to \nsupport groceries for 7 months of the year, probably pay for tuition \nfor 1 year for a son or daughter to attend the college in their home \nState, and so on, probably the premium for some health insurance \nprograms that they may be able to provide either for their children, \nperhaps for themselves. It represents a very significant and important \nincrease for those who are working.\n  Mr. President, as a nation, we are moving, as I mentioned, farther \nand farther away from the fundamental principle that honest work should \npay an honest wage, and full-time, year-round workers should be able to \nkeep their families out of poverty. Today a nurse's aide, a janitor, a \nchild care worker--Mr. President, that is what we are talking about, \nthose who are making the minimum wage.\n  We will have an opportunity to put some names and, hopefully, some \nfaces and some lives out here in the course of this debate in the next \ncouple of days. But basically they are teachers' aides, those who are \nworking with the children in our classrooms all over this country, \nincreasingly challenged by all of the challenges which are there in the \nschools of our Nation, trying to provide help and assistance to a \nteacher so a teacher can teach.\n  They are nurses' aides and health care workers. Some are in those \nschools. Health care workers are primarily, perhaps, in nursing homes \nwho are looking after parents to make sure that those parents are going \nto be treated fairly and decently, taking care of them, washing them, \nfeeding them, changing them, some of the most difficult, trying work \nthat anyone could ask for in this country. They do it and do it well \nand do it with a sense of respect and decency.\n  They are janitors who, long after men and women who are in the major \ncompanies and corporations in the buildings of this Nation go home for \nthe day, they are in there, after dark, and spend many long hours into \nthe evening cleaning up those buildings and may be lucky enough to get \nhome before their kids go out and go to school in the morning, to see \nthem for a few hours.\n  Mr. President, these are the men and women who are doing the tough, \ndifficult work that is out there in America to be done. They do it with \npride and dignity. They do it to provide for their families, for their \nloved ones. We evidently are coming to the point where we may have an \nopportunity to see some increase, and we are faced with Republican \nopposition to undermine the very modest increase.\n  This is a modest increase, Mr. President. When we first introduced \nwhat is the legislation that we will be voting on, we wanted it 3 years \nat 50 cents, and a cost-of-living increase. That does not seem to me to \nbe enormously radical. It would probably bring this back up to here in \nterms of the purchasing power of the minimum wage. But now we are back \nto 45 cents--45 cents--and for 2 years without the cost-of-living \nincrease. And we are facing opposition for that very, very modest, \nmodest increase.\n  So today, Mr. President, a nurse's aide, a janitor, a child care \nworker, anyone else who makes a minimum wage earns just $8,800 for 52 \nweeks of work at 40 hours a week, more than $6,000 below the poverty \nlevel for a family of four. According to the old saying, ``The rich get \nricher; the poor get poorer.'' But that should not be the Nation's \neconomic policy.\n  Today, one out of every nine families with a full-time worker lives \nin poverty without enough money to feed and clothe their children and \nkeep a roof over their heads. Rich America is getting richer. The stock \nmarket may be sputtering, but the increase has gone to more than 400 \npercent since 1992. Real wages have declined by 15 percent. As the \nvalues of Wall Street have soared, the values of Main Street have \nfallen farther and farther behind.\n  Mr. President, this chart indicates again the comparison, using one \nindicator, and that is what is happening on Wall Street. I know there \nare other indicators; we can get into those as well. But what we have \nseen is the enormous growth, adjusted to inflation, in what has \nhappened in the Dow Jones industrial average over the period from 1979 \nthrough 1995. What has happened to the minimum wage? Here are hard-\nworking workers who are doing the difficult jobs that need to be done, \nand here we see the Dow Jones industrial average going up and \ncontinuing to go up.\n\n  In the Senate, we have given ourselves three pay increases since the \nlast increase in the minimum wage in 1991. Congressional pay raises \nhave totaled $31,000, a 31-percent increase. The\n\n[[Page S7348]]\n\nbill before the Senate calls for 90 cents in the minimum wage over the \nnext 2 years, a 22-percent increase.\n  Mr. President, it is time to support those who work for a living \ninstead of living off welfare. I must say, Mr. President, that if you \nwant to talk about real welfare reform, it is increasing the minimum \nwage. Let us get people who can work and want to work back to work and \ngive them a livable wage. An interesting fact, Mr. President, is that \nif you get this increase in the minimum wage, you see the savings in \nthe safety net. You see significant, hundreds of millions of dollars of \nreductions in payments of AFDC, you see hundreds of millions of dollars \nof reductions in the Medicaid Program, in the Food Stamp Program.\n  You have more than 300,000 children who would come out of poverty; \nwell over 100,000 families coming out of poverty; they will not be \neligible for those expenditures. That is only with a very modest \nincrease in the minimum wage. Why should the Federal taxpayer be paying \nin to a fund that supports these safety-net programs to subsidize those \nwho are not paying a fair wage? That is what this is about, too; \nsubsidizing many of those companies that refuse to provide a livable \nwage. They are getting subsidization for their workers with the other \nsafety-net programs. Those safety-net programs were never devised for \nthat particular purpose. If you provide this modest increase in the \nminimum wage, you are going to be saving the taxpayers an additional \namount.\n  I believe the overpowering and overwhelming argument is that we ought \nto have a basic standard of fairness and justice in our economy. The \neconomy ought to move in a way that is not going to serve just the \nwealthiest individuals but is going to serve all Americans. That is \nwhat this country ought to be about and what it is about when it is at \nits best. These hard-working Americans deserve this kind of assurance \nthat they are going to be able to provide for their families.\n  But if you do not like that argument and you are only persuaded, as \nso many apparently are in this body, by what is going to be actually \nexpended in terms of the taxpayers, this is a good bargain for those \nindividuals as well.\n  Mr. President, what we are talking about here are 13 million \nAmericans who will receive a pay increase from this legislation--13 \nmillion Americans.\n  Mr. President, we hear often on this floor that the best way to get \nany increase for working Americans is to insist on the balanced budget \namendment. I support a balanced budget, not with the priorities that \nhave been outlined by our Republican friends. But that is a debate for \na different time. But the interesting fact remains, Mr. President, that \nif our Republican friends were able to get the balanced budget \namendment through, according to their own CBO, it would mean a one-half \nof 1 percent increase in the income of those 13 million workers who are \nworking at a minimum wage level--one-half of 1 percent.\n  This minimum wage program which we support will amount to a 4 percent \nincrease for the 40 percent of the lowest income American workers. We \ncan do that virtually by adopting this particular program that has \npassed the House of Representatives and will be before the U.S. Senate \ntomorrow. This can make an important difference--an important \ndifference--to the real income of working families as compared to what \nwe are asked to do by our Republican friends saying, ``Well, let's just \ngo ahead and balance the budget. That will reflect itself in greater \nopportunities for those workers.'' Even their own figures do not \njustify that position.\n\n  Mr. President, as many as 2.3 million children live in poor or near-\npoor families where workers will get a raise. This is a children's \nissue. This is a children's issue. Of this, 1.52 million are living in \nfamilies with just one breadwinner. We will probably even hear in the \ndebate that this really is not an important issue because it only \naffects the 10, 13 million Americans in a work force of 129, 130 \nmillion Americans. It is enormously important to those children, the \nmillion and a half of those children whose whole position is being \nthreatened now in the cuts in the Medicaid Program, the transfer, the \nreduction in immunization and all of the screening programs that are \nout there, when we know that two-thirds of the children on Medicaid \nhave parents who are working.\n  I do not understand what it is with our Republican friends, what they \nhave against children of working families. But that is the fact of the \nimpact of many of these cuts, both in the Medicaid Program, the \neducation program, and the opposition to the increase in the minimum \nwage. It is callous. It is wrong. But, nonetheless, we are faced with \nit. We will have an opportunity tomorrow to make a judgment whether we \nare going to stand with the children, the needy children, the poor \nchildren that did not, as a matter of choice, choose to grow up in a \nhousehold where their families are making the minimum wage at this \ntime.\n  Mr. KYL assumed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Now, Mr. President, this is not only children, but this \nis also about women in our society. The greatest percent are women; 64 \nor 65 percent of the minimum wage workers are women in our society. \nSeven million women and more than 5 million adult women will receive a \nfair raise if the minimum wage is increased.\n  Who are the 5 million adult women? Two million are single heads of \nhouseholds with at least one dependent. They are raising families, \ncaring for children, trying to get by on a poverty-level wage. It is \ntime for them to get a raise.\n  Mr. President, 60 percent of minimum wage workers are married. They \ncontribute an average of 51 percent of family earnings. We are not \ntalking about teenagers earning pocket money. We will hear talk about \nthat later this afternoon, I am sure. We are talking about people whose \nfamilies depend on them for their survival and well-being. It is time \nfor them to get a raise.\n  The large numbers of minimum wage workers who are women work in \nhospitals, food services, and restaurants, where they work as cashiers, \nclean hotel rooms and work in laundries. Their jobs are hard, but they \nperform them with dignity and commitment, and do the best they can to \nprovide for their families. It is time for them to get a raise.\n  An additional large number of minimum wage earners who are women work \ndirectly with children in child care and as teachers aides. They \ndeserve more respect for the care that they give the Nation's children, \nthe 52 million children, that are in our K through 12 across this \nNation. With all the challenges that they are facing, it is time they \nget a raise.\n  Another major industry that employs large numbers of women just above \nthe minimum wage is in the health care area, especially the occupations \nof nurses' aides, home care aides. They are some of the most difficult \njobs in our society, caring for the sick and the helpless, washing \nthem, feeding them, cleaning their bedpans. It is time they get a \nraise.\n  What will the minimum wage increase mean for a family living in \npoverty? We mentioned what it means in groceries, what it means in \nhealth care costs, including prescription drugs, out-of-pocket \nexpenses, utility bills or basic housing costs lasting for a period of \nsome 4 months. All of that has been mentioned.\n  Mr. President, a point that we will hear, I am sure, later this \nafternoon, ``We are opposed because they really are the wealthy \nteenagers that are involved in this program. They are not really people \ninvolved in the minimum wage.'' We will also hear, as I have already \nheard during the course of this debate, that question about whether \nthis increase in the minimum wage helps minorities in the workplace.\n  Based on census data of 1.5 million African-Americans between $4.25 \nand $5.15 an hour, 17 percent of all hourly African American workers \nare making that minimum wage. One million are women. Raising the \nminimum wage will provide a modest increase for the poorest African-\nAmericans raising children and struggling to survive. It is time for \nthem to get a raise.\n  I hope those opposed to our position will minimize the amount of time \nthey spend on this issue as being the great defenders of minorities. We \nheard that all the time in all the past debates.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record several \nexcellent letters referencing the minimum wage.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S7349]]\n\n\n         National Association for the Advancement of Colored \n           People,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 1996.\n     Re Fair Minimum Wage.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing to you today on behalf of the \n     National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \n     (NAACP), the nation's oldest and largest civil rights \n     organization, in strong support of a fair minimum wage. \n     Specifically, the NAACP seeks the swift passage of ``The \n     Working Wage Increase Act of 1995'' (S.413). We have been \n     informed that this bill may be scheduled for a Senate floor \n     vote later this week.\n       This important legislation provides for an increase in the \n     current minimum wage by 90 cents an hour, to $5.15, over two \n     years. It is clearly a step in the right direction to improve \n     the income and the quality of living for all Americans \n     through an increase in the minimum wage. This is particularly \n     true for African Americans, who disproportionately constitute \n     a large segment of minimum wage earners with below poverty \n     level incomes.\n       Legislation increasing the minimum wage is a measure long \n     overdue for hardworking Americans who are desperately trying \n     to make ends meet. The real value of the minimum wage is at a \n     forty year low. The minimum wage was first set at 25 cents an \n     hour in 1938 under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). \n     Moreover, Congress last raised the minimum wage with bi-\n     partisan support in 1989 from $3.35 an hour to $4.25 an hour \n     over two years.\n       In addition to the merits of arguments supporting an \n     increased minimum wage, the NAACP also believes that this \n     initiative fits squarely into the welfare reform debate. The \n     NAACP supports meaningful welfare reform. We believe that \n     meaningful welfare reform includes elements that encourage \n     and support work; that hold both parents responsible for the \n     economic support of their children; and that move poor \n     families from dependency to economic self-sufficiency.\n       The NAACP maintains that Senators who are calling for \n     welfare reform should back efforts to increase the minimum \n     wage since, as a practical matter, the current minimum wage \n     is a disincentive to working and an incentive to remaining on \n     welfare.\n       For all of these reasons, we strongly urge you to vote in \n     favor of S.413 when it advances to a Senate floor vote in the \n     next few days. Thank you for your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Wade Henderson,\n     Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                  National Urban League, Inc.,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: The National Urban League believes that \n     raising the minimum wage is an eminently sensible step. It \n     would mean affirming a pro-work, pro-family stance that \n     should be welcomed by all who believe work should be rewarded \n     and that ways must be found to boost the eroding incomes of \n     low-wage workers. The Senate can take immediate action by \n     passing the legislation that would raise the minimum wage \n     from its current level of $4.25 to $5.15 an hour over two \n     years.\n       The prevailing minimum wage has now reached its lowest \n     level in 40 years. Erosion of the minimum wage is a major \n     factor in the sharp decline in the living standards of the \n     poorest families. A person who works full time--40 hours per \n     week, 50 weeks per year--at the current Federal minimum wage \n     brings home only $8,500 for an entire year's work.\n       Contrary to the assumption that the prime beneficiaries \n     would be affluent teenagers, studies reveal that only a tenth \n     of minimum wage workers are teenagers in families with above \n     average incomes. The typical minimum wage worker is an adult \n     woman who works full time or more than twenty hours weekly. \n     Seventy-six percent of the benefits of the increased minimum \n     wage would go to families with below average incomes. And \n     over a fourth of those low wage workers are black and \n     Hispanic, therefore the impact of a higher minimum wage would \n     have an immediate impact on minority purchasing power.\n       Raising the minimum wage should get bipartisan support as a \n     way to help poor families raise their living standards and as \n     a way to close the income gap that threatens American ideals \n     of fairness and equality.\n       Sincerely,\n\n                                                Hugh B. Price,\n\n                                               President and Chief\n     Executive Officer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                  National Hispana\n\n\n                                         Leadership Institute,\n\n                                    Arlington, VA, March 18, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: The National Hispana Leadership Institute \n     represents over 200 professional Hispanic women from \n     throughout the United States who are leaders in their \n     communities. These women are directors of non-profit and \n     government agencies, political appointees, elected officials \n     and corporate employees.\n       I am writing on their behalf in support of the minimum wage \n     increase to $5.15 over the next two years. Statistics \n     indicate that: (1) six out of ten workers earning the minimum \n     wage or less are women, (2) overall, more than half of low-\n     wage women workers are mothers; of these nearly half are the \n     sole wage earners in their families, (3) in 1995, a single \n     mother with two children earning the minimum wage, full-time, \n     year round earned $8,840 annually, 27 percent below the \n     poverty line for a family of three. The statistics noted here \n     are even worse for Hispanic women.\n       It is time that this country began to take care of its \n     families and children. Corporate profits and the salaries of \n     CEO's continue to rise while Americans are laid off work, \n     employee benefits cut and government services curtailed. The \n     gap between the rich and the poor continues to increase; the \n     rich get richer and the poor get poorer. What does that mean \n     for the future of our country?\n       I urge you to vote in favor of the minimum wage increase.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                       Nancy Leon,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                             Leadership Conference\n\n\n                                              on Civil Rights,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a \n     coalition of 180 national organizations representing \n     minorities, women, persons with disabilities, older \n     Americans, labor, gays and lesbians, religious groups, and \n     minority businesses and professions, would like to express \n     its strong support for legislation that would raise the \n     minimum wage to $5.15 per hour.\n       As you know, Congress enacted the minimum wage to protect \n     working families against poverty. However, a single mother \n     with two children who works full time at $4.25 per hour will \n     find that her family remains trapped nearly 30 percent below \n     the federal poverty level. Thus, a permanent underclass is \n     maintained. It is incumbent upon the United States Congress \n     to raise the minimum wage and improve the quality of life for \n     low income workers.\n       A minimum wage increase would benefit many American \n     workers. More than 12 million workers would benefit directly \n     if Congress raised the minimum wage to $5.15 per hour, and \n     several million more who earn slightly more than $5.15 per \n     hour would experience an increase from the ripple effect that \n     results when the minimum wage is raised.\n       The last minimum wage increase in 1989 received strong \n     bipartisan support. The Senate passed the increase by a vote \n     of 89 to 8, and the House by a vote of 382 to 37. It was \n     signed into law by President Bush.\n       The Leadership Conference strongly urges you to vote for \n     legislation to raise the minimum wage to $5.15 per hour.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard Womack,\n       Acting Executive Director.\n     Dorothy I. Height,\n       Chairperson.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: The time has come to raise the minimum wage \n     to a living wage. On behalf of the Mexican American Legal \n     Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), I urge your support of \n     S. 413, a proposal to raise the minimum wage to protect the \n     nation's working families.\n       Today's minimum wage is at its lowest value in forty years. \n     During this time, the purchasing power of the minimum wage \n     has fallen to its second lowest level. The effect has been \n     devastating to many American families, but particularly worse \n     for Latinos. Because Latinos represent 17% of the minimum \n     wage work force, this decline in the value of work has a \n     severe impact on our community. Latino families are more \n     likely to live below the poverty line, and Latino children \n     are twice as likely to be living in poverty than non-Hispanic \n     children.\n       By moderately raising the minimum wage, we will all \n     benefit. Over a dozen empirical studies have shown that an \n     increase in the minimum wage would not have a negative impact \n     on employment. Instead of having the largest wage gap of any \n     industrial country, Congress can act to keep jobs while \n     protecting American working families against poverty.\n       Help lift families out of poverty and improve the lives of \n     over 11 million American workers now dependent on minimum \n     wage jobs. Please support S. 413.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Antonia Hernandez,\n     President and General Counsel.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           Migrant Legal Action Program, Inc.,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 1996.\n     Re Minimum Wage Increase (S. 413).\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to urge you to support S. 413, \n     which would aid America's working families by increasing the \n     minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 per hour.\n       If the minimum wage were to stay at its current level, it \n     would be at the lowest level in real (inflation-adjusted) \n     dollars in the last 40 years. The real value of the minimum \n     wage is now 27% lower than it was in 1979, and has fallen 45 \n     cents in real value since its last increase in April 1991. \n     The last minimum wage increase--also 90 cents--garnered \n     strong bipartisan support. That increase was passed by votes \n     of 382 (including 135 Republicans) to 37 in the House and 89 \n     (including 36 Republicans) to 8 in the Senate. Both Senator \n     Dole and Representative Gingrich voted in favor of that \n     increase.\n       Empirical evidence shows that this proposal can increase \n     wages without costing jobs. More than a dozen studies have \n     found that moderate increases in the minimum wage do not have \n     significant effect on employment. These studies include \n     state-specific research that shows that large state increases \n     in the minimum wage did not result in significant job \n     impacts. As Nobel Laureate Robert Solow stated, ``[T]he \n     evidence of\n\n[[Page S7350]]\n\n     job loss is weak. And the fact that evidence is weak suggests \n     that the impact on jobs is small.''\n       The Migrant Legal Action Program works on behalf of the \n     millions of migrant and seasonal farmworkers in the United \n     States. An estimated 1.65 million farmworkers would benefit \n     from the proposed minimum wage increase. Despite their \n     critical role in providing stoop labor to prune, tend, \n     harvest, and pack our nation's fruit and vegetables, migrant \n     farmworkers are among the most impoverished and exploited \n     populations in this country. At least two-thirds of all \n     migrant farmworkers live below the poverty line. The majority \n     of migrant farmworkers earn on average $4.47 per hour. \n     Research indicates that an increase in the minimum wage of \n     $5.15 would have a ``ripple'' effect, raising the wages of \n     farmworkers who earn within 50 cents of the new minimum wage. \n     Thus, a rise in the minimum wage would be a significant boost \n     to the standard of living of migrant farmworkers.\n       We strongly urge you to support Americans' low-wage \n     workers, including farmworkers, by voting in favor of S. 413.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Roger C. Rosenthal,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, excerpts from the excellent statement \nfrom the NAACP state:\n\n       It is clearly a step in the right direction to improve the \n     income and the quality of living for all Americans through an \n     increase in the minimum wage. This is particularly true for \n     African Americans, who disportionately constitute a large \n     segment of minimum wage earners with below poverty level \n     incomes. . . For all of these reasons, we strongly urge you \n     to vote in favor of S. 413. . .\n\n  ``The National Urban League,'' the same, ``believes that raising the \nminimum wage is an eminently sensible step. It would mean affirming a \npro-work pro-family stance that should be welcomed by all who believe \nwork should be rewarded * * *''\n  This continues with the National Hispanic Leadership Institute: ``It \nis time that this country began to take care of families and \nchildren.''\n  This is a women's issue. It is an issue of justice. It is a \nchildren's issue. Mr. President, it is a family issue--a family issue.\n  I will not take the time of the Senate now to recount the stories \nthat we heard during our forums on the increase in the minimum wage, \nwhere we find a father and a mother not just having one minimum wage \njob, but each having two minimum wage jobs--two minimum wage jobs. When \nthey testified or told us about their life's experience, they did not \ncomplain about working hard. They did not complain about backbreaking \nhours or hard, difficult, dreary work that is repetitive in so many \nways. They did not complain. Their principle complaint was they did not \nhave enough time with their children, that they did not see their \nchildren together, that the only time they see their children together \nis perhaps for a few hours on a Sunday. They always saw their children \napart. We heard that time in and time out, Mr. President.\n  I hope we will not hear a lot of arguments about families, which we \nalways do, and then when we have something that can make a real \ndifference in terms of families, we find opposition to it. This is a \nfamilies issue. It is a mother's issue, a child's issue, an issue of \njustice and fairness, an issue of identifying and rewarding work. It is \nfamily issue, and it is an economic issue for the reasons I outlined, \nin saving the taxpayer.\n  It goes on, Mr. President. Another letter, from MALDEF:\n\n       The time has come to raise the minimum wage to a living \n     wage.\n\n  Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights, Migrant Legal Action Program, all excellent \nletters. I hope those who come out in opposition, who say, ``We do not \nwant to see a great dislocation of jobs,'' this opens an opportunity \nfor minorities, blacks, and browns. The organizations that speak to \nthem and the individuals that speak on this issue overwhelmingly \nsupport an increase.\n  Nowhere in America is there higher support than among those that are \nreceiving the minimum wage, even when all the arguments are made, and I \nthink inappropriately, about the dangers to those individuals--their \njobs. I will come back to that issue.\n  Mr. President, this is a public health issue, as shown in a recent \nstudy by the Harvard School of Public Health and published in the \nBritish Medical Journal. Income inequality is a major public health \nproblem. Measures such as raising the minimum wage, reducing the gap \nbetween the rich and poor will have a beneficial impact on the Nation's \nhealth. Findings show that reducing the income gap is correlated with \nmortality, even after adjusting for age and smoking. It is especially \ncorrelated with infant mortality, coronary heart disease, cancer, \nhomicide, higher mortality from treatable diseases. One striking result \nis that the relationship between income inequality and mortality rates \nremained even after controlling for poverty. Greater income inequality \nwas actually correlated with increased mortality rates for all income \nlevels, not only for the poor.\n\n  So, Mr. President, for those that are opposed to the position we have \nadvanced here this afternoon about what the impact of this is going to \nbe on employment, we have included the series of studies on the impact \non employment. I will come back to those issues in just a few moments, \nbut these are some of the most recent studies, seven recent minimum \nwage studies on the impact of our increase in the minimum wage and what \nit would have on employment. These are the subjects of the study: New \nJersey, Pennsylvania fast food restaurants, minimum wage raised to \n$5.05 in April 1992; increase in the wage, 11 percent. Did employment \ngo down? No, employment goes up.\n  Right across the chart, Texas fast food restaurants, minimum wage \nrises to $4.25 in 1991. Mr. President, Texas has one of the highest \nnumbers of people that would benefit with this increase in minimum \nwage. Wages go up 8 percent, and employment up 20 percent.\n  It goes on. California teenagers, minimum wage rises in 1988, 10 \npercent in wages, employment up 12 percent. Cross-State teenagers, \ncross-State workers with low-predicted wages from 1989 to 1992--we see \nthe numbers constantly go up. And you can say, Mr. President, even the \nstudy with the 101 economists, 3 Nobel laureates, in their study--I am \nreferring now to the leading economists for the higher minimum wage, \nNobel laureates, with 101 signers of a statement backing a 90-cent hike \nover 2 years. I will include the whole statement on it. It is only 2 \npages long. It says:\n\n       Most policies to boost the income of low-wage workers have \n     positive and negative features. The minimum wage is an \n     important component of the set of policies to help low-wage \n     workers. It has key advantages, including that it produces \n     positive work incentives * * * For these and other reasons, \n     such as its exceptionally low value today, there should be \n     greater reliance on the minimum wage to support the earnings \n     of low-wage workers.\n       We believe that a Federal minimum wage can be increased by \n     a moderate amount without significantly jeopardizing \n     employment opportunities. A minimum wage increase would \n     provide a much-needed boost to the incomes of many low- and \n     moderate-income households. Specifically, the proposed \n     increase in the minimum wage of 90 cents over a 2-year period \n     falls within the range of alternatives where the overall \n     effects on the labor market, affected workers, and the \n     economy would be positive.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire document be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    [From the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Oct. 2, 1995]\n\n            Leading Economists Call for Higher Minimum Wage\n\n\nThree Nobel Winners Among 101 Signers of Statement Backing 90-Cent Hike \n                             Over Two Years\n\n       An eminent group of economists--including three recipients \n     of the Nobel Prize in Economics--have endorsed an increase in \n     the federal minimum wage in a statement released today.\n       Among the 101 signatories of the statement are seven past \n     president of the American Economics Association and experts \n     in disciplines ranging from labor markets and industrial \n     relations to income distribution and poverty. Their statement \n     was released by two Washington-based research organizations, \n     the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Economic \n     Policy Institute.\n       The statement notes that ``After adjusting for inflation, \n     the value of the minimum wage is at its second-lowest annual \n     level since 1955. The purchasing power of the minimum wage is \n     26 percent below its average level during the 1970s . . . '' \n     The purchasing power of the minimum wage reached its lowest \n     level right before the last increase in 1990.\n       ``We believe that the federal minimum wage can be increased \n     by a moderate amount without significantly jeopardizing \n     employment opportunities . . . Specifically, the proposed \n     increase in the minimum wage of 90\n\n[[Page S7351]]\n\n     cents over a two-year period falls within the range of \n     alternatives where the overall effects on the labor, market, \n     affected workers and the economy would be positive,'' the \n     economists' statement continues. (Such an increase has been \n     proposed this year in both the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives.)\n       The statement's release comes as Congress is actively \n     considering reductions in the Earned Income Tax Credit. \n     Workers who are affected by a stagnant minimum wage are in \n     large part the same people who would be hurt by proposed EITC \n     cuts.\n       Opponents of a higher minimum wage sometimes claim that \n     economic opinion is settled against any increase. The \n     statement shows that this claim is inaccurate; there is \n     substantial support within the Economics profession for a \n     moderate increase.\n       The three Novel winners backing the minimum wage increase \n     are Kenneth J. Arrow of Stanford, Lawrence R. Klein of the \n     University of Pennsylvania, and James Tobin of Yale. Each has \n     served as president of the American Economics Association. \n     The other AEA past presidents signing the statement are Moses \n     Abramovitz of Stanford, Robert Eisner of Northwestern, John \n     Kenneth Galbraith of Harvard, and William Vickrey of \n     Columbia.\n\n\n            statement of support for a minimum wage increase\n\n       As economists who are concerned about the erosion in the \n     living standards of households dependent on the earnings of \n     low-wage workers, we believe that the federal minimum wage \n     should be increased. The reasons underlying this conclusion \n     include:\n       After adjusting for inflation, the value of the minimum \n     wage is at its second lowest annual level since 1955. The \n     purchasing power of the minimum wage is 26 percent below its \n     average level during the 1970s.\n       Since the early 1970s, the benefits of economic growth have \n     been unevenly distributed among workers. Raising the minimum \n     wage would help ameliorate this trend. The positive effects \n     of the minimum wage are not felt solely by low-income \n     households, but minimum wage workers are overrepresented in \n     poor and moderate-income households.\n       In setting the value of the minimum wage, it is of course \n     appropriate to assess potential adverse effects. On balance, \n     however, the evidence from recent economic studies of the \n     effects of increases in federal and state minimum wages at \n     the end of the 1980s and in the early 1990s--as well as \n     updates of the traditional time-series studies--suggests that \n     the employment effects were negligible or small. Economic \n     studies of the effects of the minimum wage on inflation \n     suggest that a higher minimum wage would affect prices \n     negligibly.\n       Most policies to boost the incomes of low-wage workers have \n     both positive and negative features. And excessive reliance \n     on any one policy is likely to create distortions. The \n     minimum wage is an important component of the set of policies \n     to help low-wage workers. It has key advantages, including \n     that it produces positive work incentives and is \n     administratively simple. For these and other reasons, such as \n     its exceptionally low value today, there should be greater \n     reliance on the minimum wage to support the earnings of low-\n     wage workers.\n       We believe that the federal minimum wage can be increased \n     by a moderate amount without significantly, jeopardizing \n     employment opportunities. A minimum wage increase would \n     provide a much-needed boost in the incomes of many low- and \n     moderate-income households. Specifically, the proposed \n     increase in the minimum wage of 90 cents over a two-year \n     period falls within the range of alternatives where the \n     overall effects on the labor market, affected workers, and \n     the economy would be positive.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is not only these economists and others. I was \ninterested in Business Week not long ago, May 20, 1996--I will include \nthis in the Record--a commentary on ``Minimum Wage Argument You Haven't \nHeard Before.'' This is Business Week. We all hear a lot about the AFL-\nCIO supporting the increase. Here is a very interesting thing. We have \nthe economists, and you have DRI, the econometric study up at the \nWharton School, one of the most respected computer analyses in terms of \neconomic forecasts estimated. The most they saw would be a 20,000 job \nloss for the minimum wage.\n  So you are talking negligible. You have other studies in here. There \nis the New Jersey-Pennsylvania study, which showed that it increased \nemployment because people not in the wage market saw that they could \nget a livable wage and went back in. So the total number of workers \nthat were working increased. Therefore, their taxes for their local \ncommunities, State and Federal increased as well.\n  Mr. President, in this ``Minimum Wage Argument You Haven't Heard \nBefore''--I will include it all--it says:\n\n       As long as it's not overdone, lifting the minimum wage may \n     create overall economic gains that outweigh any short term \n     job loss. In fact, if it keeps productivity rising, slowly \n     boosting labor prices may actually be good for the economy in \n     the long run. ``Most economists oppose the minimum wage \n     because they haven't thought through the connection to \n     productivity,'' says Northwestern University economist Robert \n     J. Gordon.\n       If this argument is correct, raising the minimum wage might \n     not hurt the economy and could even pay for itself. \n     Economists have preached the virtues of productivity growth \n     since the Luddites and before. But the extra efficiency \n     lowers prices, so consumers buy more goods and expand \n     output--and the economy gains in the long run.\n       ``. . . If raising the minimum spurs technical innovations, \n     it could make a real difference in productivity and leave the \n     economy better off,'' says David B. Neumark, a Michigan State \n     University economist.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            A Minimum-Wage Argument You Haven't Heard Before\n\n                          (By Aaron Bernstein)\n\n       Most economists dislike the minimum wage for a simple \n     reason: Raise the price of anything, whether it's lettuce or \n     labor, and buyers can afford less of it. Such elementary \n     logic convinces economists that jacking up the wage floor \n     prices some workers out of a job.\n       But there's more to the subject than that. Because the \n     relative prices of labor and capital influence corporate \n     investment decisions, minimum-wage levels may affect \n     productivity. If pay rates fall, employers have a greater \n     incentive to buy labor instead of new technology. As a \n     result, productivity growth, the key to higher living \n     standards, slacks off. By the same token, raising pay can \n     spur efficiency.\n\n\n                            pay for itself?\n\n       As long as it's not overdone, lifting the minimum wage may \n     create overall economic gains that outweigh any short-term \n     job losses. In fact, if it keeps productivity rising, slowly \n     boosting labor prices may actually be good for the economy in \n     the long run. ``Most economists oppose the minimum wage \n     because they haven't thought through the connection to \n     productivity,'' says Northwestern University economist Robert \n     J. Gordon.\n       The best way to see his point is to look at productivity \n     growth, which has slumped to about 1% a year since 1973 from \n     3% in prior decades. One reason for the decline is the shift \n     in prices of labor and capital, says Gordon and other \n     economists. Baby boomers and women flooded the economy with \n     cheap labor in the 1970s, they argue, and then the prices of \n     capital exploded in the 1980s, when interest rates went \n     through the ceiling. The result: Employment boomed in low-\n     wage service industries, but productivity sagged as new \n     technology became more pricey. ``This is one \n     possible explanation for the slowdown in technological \n     progress,'' says Paul M. Romer, a productivity expert at \n     the University of California at Berkeley.\n       If this argument is correct, raising the minimum wage might \n     not hurt the economy and could even pay for itself. \n     Economists have preached the virtues of productivity growth \n     since the Luddites and before. Yes, jobs are lost when \n     employers swap technology for labor. But the extra efficiency \n     lowers prices, so consumers buy more goods and expand \n     output--and the economy gains in the long run. Economists \n     applaud fast-food chains that install automated french-fry \n     cookers and lay off workers. Why should the result be \n     different just because the employer was jolted into action by \n     higher labor costs?\n       Of course, a minimum wage pegged too high would be a \n     problem. A minimum of $13 an hour, say--the average wage for \n     the economy as a whole--would be a disaster. Everyone still \n     working would be in high-wage, more productive jobs, so the \n     economy would produce more per worker. But half the workforce \n     would be unemployed, so total output would collapse.\n\n\n                               Education\n\n       One solution: peg the minimum wage to a fixed percentage of \n     average wages. That way, employers have a steady incentive to \n     search out the most efficient methods of doing business. Yet \n     the incentive isn't likely to become a hurdle that companies \n     can't figure out how to overcome. ``If raising the minimum \n     spurs technical innovations, it could make a real difference \n     in productivity and leave the economy better off,'' concedes \n     David B. Neumark, a Michigan State University economist who \n     writes on the minimum wage.\n       Neumark and other skeptics still oppose an increase, \n     however, because they doubt that the economic gains would \n     materialize. Their fear: some low-skilled workers will never \n     work again. If so, efficiency gains might not offset the \n     output lost from their labor.\n       That's why setting a wage floor in today's high-skills \n     economy must be combined with policies aimed at helping young \n     people--who comprise half of all minimum-wage workers--to \n     complete their schooling or vocational training. ``Yes, \n     raising the minimum would lift productivity,but then you have \n     to help those on the bottom to keep up,'' says Harvard \n     University economist Dale W. Jorgenson.\n       A rising wage floor may boost living standards. It also \n     ensures that low-wage workers aren't left behind. That's good \n     for the economy and society alike.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, something that I think may have had some\n\n[[Page S7352]]\n\nimpact over the history of these debates on the increase in the minimum \nwage is that we found that Republican Presidents like General \nEisenhower, President Nixon, and George Bush all supported increases in \nthe minimum wage. That is why so many of us are startled by the fact \nthat there has been such extraordinary opposition to this whole effort \nto get an increase in the minimum wage.\n  For the reasons I have outlined here before, Republican Presidents \nhave supported this. In 1989, Speaker Gingrich and Bob Dole supported \nit. Yet, we have had this extraordinary difficulty in gaining support \nfor an increase in the minimum wage.\n  Now, Mr. President, let us take not just the studies that have been \ndone in reviewing past increases, but let us take the most recent \nexamples of increases in the minimum wage and what happened in the \nStates that have seen some increase in the minimum wage. State \nexperiences also prove that minimum wage does not kill jobs.\n  Both Vermont and Massachusetts raised their State minimum wage to \n$4.75 in January of this year, while our neighbors in New Hampshire and \nNew York did not. What happened since then? Have we lost jobs in \nMassachusetts and Vermont? Far from it. Since January, when these \nStates raised their minimum wage, unemployment in both Massachusetts \nand Vermont has fallen. We have not lost jobs, we have added them. In \nfact, unemployment fell where the minimum wage was increased and rose \nwhere the minimum wage was frozen at $4.25.\n  Giving working Americans a living wage will not cost jobs. Making all \nemployers pay a living wage will not cost jobs. The minimum wage law in \nMassachusetts does not exempt businesses with sales of $500,000 or \nless, and neither does the minimum wage law in Vermont.\n  Is the minimum wage a serious problem for small business? No, it is \nnot. The studies cited by the Small Business Administration show that \nonly 7 percent of small businesses consider the minimum wage a critical \nproblem. Even a survey prepared by the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses, which every Member of this body knows is such \nan advocate in terms of small business, ranked the minimum wage as 62d \nin importance--62d in importance--out of 75 issues.\n  Another study, funded by the NFIB Foundation, revealed that even \namong the smallest of small business--those with less than 10 \nemployees--only 6 percent considered the minimum wage a critical \nproblem.\n  So, Mr. President, you can see that the States in the most recent \ntimes this year that have increased the minimum wage have not lost \nemployment. The results are very similar to what the various studies \nhave shown, that in a number of instances--not all, but in many \ninstances--the increase in the minimum wage has attracted more people \ninto the job market.\n  You have the outstanding economists that have recognized that an \nincrease in the minimum wage would have effectively a de minimus, \nnegligible impact in terms of the job market. DRI, one of the most \nrespected econometric models, has found that in this most recent \nanalysis that it is a virtually negligible loss of employment. And you \nfind that the States have actually seen an increase in the minimum wage \nin the last several months. They have not seen a decline in the \nemployment. They have actually seen an increase in the total number of \nemployment.\n  Mr. President, we are all aware of the stark disparity in \ncompensation in the workplace. The news is full of stories about huge \ncompensation packages for CEO's, and a recent study done by Pearl, \nMeyer & Partners, a New York compensation consulting fund, found the \ncompensation of CEO's in 30 major companies was 212 times higher than \nthe pay of the average American worker.\n  Again and again, the financial pages tell the story of the shocking \ndisparity between CEO compensation and pay for the average employees. \nOn April 9, for example, a Washington Post study reported the $65 \nmillion compensation package for the CEO of Green Tree Financial Corp.\n  On that same day the Wall Street Journal published an 18-page section \ndevoted solely to executive pay and the way it has risen through the \nroof. High-flying executive wages have risen through the roof. High-\nflying compensation packages like these are increasingly common, and \nthey stand in stark contrast to the minimum wage that has been stuck in \nthe basement for the last 5 years.\n  Mr. President, one of the groups that is strongest in opposition to \nthe increase has been the food industry and restaurants which have \ndeveloped a special provision in this Republican proposal as well so \nthey effectively can circumvent any increase in the minimum wage, even \nthough half of the women who work in restaurants across the country \ntake on average $250 home a week. With their dependents you see that \nthey are well below the poverty program. The restaurant industry has \nbeen able to carve out their own kinds of protection on it. We have \ngone through that. I will either take time tomorrow, or later to go \nthrough this in greater detail.\n  But I was particularly interested in looking through the compensation \nfor those in the restaurant industry. What you find is this \nextraordinary explosion and increase in the salaries of those in the \nrestaurant industries. They have increased dramatically, and no one is \nbegrudging that they are doing very well in terms of the payments. But \nI daresay it is not very convincing when we hear about the problems the \nrestaurant industry is having, and we see the total work force \nincreasing, the profits going up, and the increase in the CEO's of \nthese various food chain and food restaurant chains--low-wage fast-food \nrestaurants--that are the strongest in opposition to this. We see that \ntheir salaries and compensation is going right up through the roof in \nspite of the fact that by and large most of them have had very, very \nsubstantial profits over the period of these recent years--significant \nprofits; dramatic increase in the compensation of the CEO's; and \neffectively blind opposition to any increase in the minimum wage.\n  Mr. President, I will maybe go into that in greater detail as we have \na chance to go through the debate.\n  Our Democratic Senators say raise the minimum wage. Our Republicans \nsay let them eat cake. At best the last minimum wage was a very minimum \nwage. The minimum wage which you can have is effectively the minimum-\nminimum wage.\n  What possible rationale can there be for forcing millions of \nAmericans to continue to work, as everyone knows, for wages so low that \nthey cannot support a family? Republicans say the reason is to save \njobs. But the fact is the modest increase we are proposing will not \ncause job loss and may even lead to an increase in employment.\n  One reason for that result is reflected in the analysis that Salomon \nBros. recently released in a U.S. Equity Research Report of April 22, \n1996. Salomon Bros. predicted that retail businesses would benefit from \nan increase in the minimum wage due to the enhanced purchasing power.\n  This is not a publication by the AFL-CIO. Here is Salomon Brothers' \nstudy of April 22, 1996.\n\n       We believe that many retailers, especially discounters, \n     would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage due to the \n     enhanced purchasing power you create for many lower income \n     consumers.\n\n  It is interesting that that concept has finally been accepted. Henry \nFord understood it at the very beginning of the production of Fords. He \nunderstood that the only way he was going to sell his product was to \ngive a decent enough wage so his workers could afford it. That is a \nlesson that we are coming back to.\n\n  So, Mr. President, we have other reasons from the business community \nthat has indicated what their assessment about the impact of the \nminimum wage is.\n  So when we come out here later on this afternoon and tomorrow and \nsay, ``Well, enormous job loss, inflation loss,'' the best estimate is \nthat the impact of inflation is one-tenth of 1 percent.\n  Mr. President, in spite of the sensible studies like this, The \nNational Restaurant Association claims that a minimum wage increase \nwould be a job killer even though the restaurant industry has seen \nenormous employment growth since the last minimum wage. In fact, the \nactual experience of the restaurant industry shows the minimum wage \nincrease would be good for business and good for the economy. For\n\n[[Page S7353]]\n\n3 years, before the two-step minimum wage in 1990-91, employment growth \nin the restaurant industry was falling along with the real wages of \nminimum wage workers. Restaurant industry growth in employment growth \nfell from 3.1 percent in 1987 to 2.8 percent in 1988, 2.3 percent in \n1989, and 1.7 in 1990.\n  This is the decline in the growth of, annual employment growth, \n``Eating and Drinking Establishments.'' It is very interesting that it \nwas in 1990 when the minimum wage went in, in 1991. After the last \nminimum wage actually went in, we see this dramatic increase in terms \nof employment. Nonetheless, we just had an enormous 800,000 new jobs in \nthe industry from 1991 to 1995. That is what our Republican friends \ncall ``job killing.''\n  I say let us have more of it.\n  With respect to the Republican proposal for the small business \nsubminimum, it is critical to remember that the last minimum wage \nincrease took effect 5 long years ago. The coverage was expanded at the \ntime to include employees and small restaurants who formally had been \nexcluded. According to the Republican dogma, that expansion should have \ncompounded the job killing effect of the increase. But it did not. \nInstead, the restaurant industry has enjoyed greater job growth, record \nprofits, mind boggling increases in CEO pay. A subminimum wage is not \nneeded. Small businesses do not need it, and their employees do not \ndeserve that harsh and unfair treatment.\n  It is no wonder that America is growing apart as a Nation when so \nmuch effort is being expended to help those at the top of the ladder \nwhile ignoring the families at bottom of the ladder.\n  By lifting families out of poverty, an increase in the minimum wage \nof $5.15 an hour has additional benefits to society in terms of saving \nexpenditures under the safety net.\n  Regrettably, our Republican colleagues continue to try to do all they \ncan to undermine a fair increase in the minimum wage. At every turn, \nwherever they can, they take away the protection of minimum wage from \nvarious groups of workers and delay increases. That is what they try to \ndo. Their goal is to see that any bill that passes leaves us with the \nresult that more people are hurt than helped by the legislation. And \nthat is what the Republican amendment would do.\n  First, they want to put off any raise until January 1, 1997, at the \nearliest. That means for another 6 months minimum wage workers will go \nwithout a raise as they already have for more than 5 years. They will \nbe denied approximately $500 more in additional pay they would receive \nover the next 6 months--$500 they could have to buy medicine for \nchildren, new school clothes, Christmas presents. Surely our Republican \ncolleagues must find this kind of meanness embarrassing.\n\n  Next, the Republican opponents to the minimum wage propose to create \na subminimum wage for any worker who takes a job with a new employer. \nAt least the House of Representatives targeted that on teenagers. And \nthen they had a shorter period of time of 90 days. But they had it on \nteenagers. This is 160 days. And grownups, even if you have been a \nlaid-off skilled worker that has worked for 20 or 30 years, for the \nfirst 6 months you are not going to get any increase. Our Republican \nfriends know that about 40 percent of those that get the minimum wage \nare rotating every year.\n  So effectively it excludes anywhere from 40 to 45 percent of the \ntotal individuals that would be eligible for a minimum wage increase. \nAt least they are true enough more than the last time in 1989 when they \ncalled this job training, except there was no requirement that any \nworker get an hour of training or an hour of education--no requirement \non the employers at all. They just say that we need to have them have \njob training and education on that program because there was no \nrequirement at all that they have it. Now we are talking for a period \nof 6 months. If you move from one job to another job, which so many of \nthe workers do, you would be excluded. You come to the second job, and \nyou start off there. They say for 6 months you do not get an increase \nabove $4.25. Does not anyone think that might be an incentive for the \nemployer to dismiss those workers? Of course, it will be. Of course, it \nwill be.\n\n  I hope our Republican friends will talk to that issue. It will be an \nadditional incentive to dismiss those and hire some others for the \n$4.25 and save themselves 20 or 22 percent on the employment of those \npeople. But the American people are beginning to understand this issue, \nand hopefully Senators will reflect their views tomorrow when we will \nvote on this issue.\n  What they call an ``opportunity'' wage is really only an opportunity \nfor the employer. It is not an opportunity for the employee. It is an \nopportunity for the employer to say that after 6 months you are \ndismissed, and I am going to bring somebody else in here and pay them \n$4.25. That is what the opportunity wage under the Bond amendment is \nreally all about.\n  Mr. President, people that will be hurt most by this are the \ndownsized, the laid-off workers who cannot find jobs equivalent to the \njob they lost. Not only will they endure the indignity of having their \nwages fall to the minimum, they will find themselves falling to a \nsubminimum wage as well.\n  This past year has been a time of economic expansion and relative \nprosperity for the economy as a whole. But again and again, we see \nstories of white- and blue-collar workers laid off after long careers \nin good jobs. Many of these workers have found themselves forced to \naccept minimum-wage jobs after being laid off by a downsizing employer.\n  The Republican answer to their pain is to make it even more painful \nso that these workers fall even further and suffer even deeper \nfinancial loss.\n  Minimum-wage jobs are the least skilled jobs. They are jobs for which \nlittle or no job training is needed--at most, a few hours or days. Yet, \nthe Republican amendment doubles the duration of the subminimum wage in \nthe House bill, from the 90 to 180 days--far beyond any reasonable \ntraining period or try-out period.\n  There is no good reason for this harsh proposal.\n  What they have done is to say, look, we have the opportunity wage of \n180 days, 6 months. So that will affect probably 40 percent. Then we \ncut out the restaurant industry employees from being able to \nparticipate. That is going to be another several hundreds of thousands \nof workers. And then they delay the implementing date. That is going to \nsave the industries hundreds of millions of dollars in terms of wages \npaid out. Gradually through all of this, with the larger carve-out of \nany small business under $500,000--and those could be as high as 10 \nmillion--if you put all of these together, they will be able to say, \nlook, we voted for an increase in the minimum wage.\n  The American people are going to understand that that is basically \ndevious, deceptive and demeans, I think, any argument that they are \nbasically for any increase for these working families. Rather than just \ngive us an opportunity to vote on this up and down, no, we cannot. We \nwill have an opportunity, but it will certainly be clouded by this \nattempt to try to say, look, you can have it both ways. You can have a \nvote for the minimum wage, and yet you will also protect these \nvarious special interest groups. In fact, in the real Republican view, \nthe only good minimum wage is no minimum wage. They would repeal it if \nthey could.\n\n  It is so interesting to me that in the period of these past months we \nhave seen the attempts to dismantle the Medicare Program, the assaults \nthat have been made on Social Security, and they have been made on \nSocial Security, although our Republican friends will not say it, \nbecause Medicare is a part of Social Security; we can point that out, \nand it has been pointed out during the course of the previous debate \nand will again on the various budget issues. So they are opposed to \nSocial Security, opposed to Medicare, and opposed to an increase in the \nminimum wage, those three essential items which have been such \nlifelines to millions of American families, to working families, to the \nelderly people in this country who have toiled and worked so hard for a \nbetter America.\n  The subminimum wage in the House-passed bill is bad enough. It \napplies only to teenagers. Many of the 18- and 19-year-olds need a \nliving wage as much as any adult, especially if they are young welfare \nmothers willing to work for a living. The notion that they need \ntraining for 3 months in jobs like burger flipping or bagging groceries \nis absurd.\n\n[[Page S7354]]\n\n  The Senate Republican proposal is even more objectionable because it \nimposes a longer subminimum wage.\n  We will, hopefully, have a chance to respond to points that will be \nraised by our Republican friends in justification of their proposal \nperhaps later on this afternoon. I have not taken the time of the \nSenate to go through other provisions of this bill that has been \ncoupled with the small business tax relief. In fact, the benefits of \nthis bill to businesses are enormous. It provides $15 billion in tax \nbreaks to businesses over a 10-year period. For all the time that we \nhave been talking about the deficit, I hope we are going to hear from \nour Republican friends as to where they are getting that $15 billion.\n  Sure, we ought to try to provide some help and relief to the smallest \nbusinesses that may be affected, but this is $15 billion that someone \nis going to have to make up somewhere. Someone is going to have to make \nit up. Add that to the deficit. Add that to the deficit, or at least \nrespect the intelligence of the American people sufficiently to tell us \nhow you are going to offset that. And can anyone believe that business \nis being hurt, not helped, with this legislation? Yet, the Senate is \nknee-deep in crocodile tears shed by Republicans who feel that business \nis being hurt.\n  Small business can now deduct up to $17,000 in expenses for new \ninvestment in a year the investment is made rather than deducting it \nover the life of the investment as the normal accounting rules require. \nThis bill would gradually increase the deduction to $25,000. It goes \non.\n  The bill opens up a loophole for corporations that we successfully \nclosed in 1993.\n  In the 1993 reconciliation act, multinational corporations were \nrequired to pay taxes on excess profits and cash on hand from their \noperations in foreign countries. This provision was the first step \nneeded to close the runaway plant loophole, and it reduced the tax \nincentives that encouraged U.S. companies to move jobs overseas. That \nwas closed down in 1993, and it is being reopened again--a provision \nthat will provide tax incentives to move American jobs overseas.\n  This bill provides tax breaks for business owners who run convenience \nstores with gasoline outlets. It provides tax breaks to banks and \ninvestment companies, tax credits to small wineries, helps farmers \nlocated in empowerment zones. It goes on. Yet they attempt to deny a \nfair increase in the minimum wage to millions of low-income Americans. \nThere is no justification for denying even one working American the \nright to a living wage.\n  So Senators who preach about family values should practice family \nvalues, too. This is our chance to speak to the people who struggle the \nhardest to make ends meet, to abide by the work ethic, who believe in \nthe American dream of working hard in order to get ahead, yet who find \nthemselves slipping farther and farther behind, no matter how hard they \ntry. We know the hardships they face.\n  In one family I met last year, the husband works 30 to 35 hours a \nweek at $4.25 for a pizza chain. He works split shifts and evenings. \nHis wife works 40 hours a week at a similar wage. She staggers her work \nhours so she or her husband can be home to take care of their young \nchildren. They have no health coverage. They cannot afford child care, \nlet alone a medical savings account. Because they work different hours, \nthey are rarely able to spend time together, and they worry about \ntrying to save to send their children to college because both of them \nare still paying off loans for the 1 year of college they attended.\n  Large numbers of minimum wage workers have similar stories. They are \nbright, hard-working Americans often with high school educations and \ndreaming of a brighter future, but they are barely scraping by because \nthe law allows their work to be undervalued and underpaid.\n  I urge the Senate to do the right thing for them, for the 13 million \nother Americans who will get a raise if this amendment is approved. Now \nis the time to make the minimum wage a fair wage. No one who works for \na living should have to live in poverty.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, in addition to those articles \nand periodicals I referred to in my statement, to have printed in the \nRecord a ``List of Signatories to Economists Statement of Support for a \nMinimum Wage Increase.''\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as

Mr. KENNEDY. Finally, Mr. President, an op-ed article in today's USA \nToday by Jack Faris, president and CEO of the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, perpetuates the fallacy that Congress acted by \nmistake in 1989 when it increased the small business exemption under \nthe so-called enterprise coverage test, but failed to do so for the so-\ncalled individual coverage test. In fact, Congress was well aware of \nthe effect of its actions in 1989. There was no mistake.\n  Since the beginning, the minimum wage has covered large numbers of \nworkers engaged in interstate commerce, regardless of the size of the \nfirms they work for.\n  In fact, the original minimum wage, enacted in 1938, contained only \nthe individual coverage test. That coverage was based on the view that \nCongress had broad power under the commerce clause of the Constitution \nto protect workers even in the smallest firms, as long as the workers \nwere involved in interstate commerce.\n  From 1938 to 1961, coverage was based only on that principle--\nindividual coverage--a case-by-case, worker-by-worker analysis as to \nwhether the actual work involved interstate commerce.\n  At the beginning, the minimum wage also contained numerous exemptions \nbased largely on policy decisions and interest group pressures. In some \ncases, entire industries or occupations were excluded from coverage. In \nthe years since 1938, the major goals of Congress have been not only to \nincrease the purchasing power of the minimum wage--or at least prevent \na decline in its purchasing power because of inflation--but also to \nreduce the scope of these broad exemptions.\n  Notwithstanding the numerous industry specific exemptions, Congress \nnever enacted a general exemption for small businesses. Since the \nbeginning, many workers in very small firms have continued to be \nprotected by the minimum wage under the individual coverage test.\n  In 1961, with the economy having grown rapidly in the years after \nWorld War II, and with vastly increased economic activities crossing \nState lines, Congress changed the definition of coverage of the minimum \nwage to achieve coverage in a more practical way.\n  The 1961 act specified that all workers in enterprises with more than \na certain level of annual sales would be regarded as engaged in \ninterstate commerce, and would therefore be covered by the minimum \nwage, whether or not the particular activities of individual workers in \nthe firms involved interstate commerce. This new test of coverage was \nwidely referred to as enterprise coverage.\n  The sales figure for the standard was set at various levels for \nvarious industries. For enterprises comprised exclusively of retail \nservice establishments, the threshold for coverage was set at $362,500. \nFor most other industries, the threshold was $250,000. But for \nhospitals, schools, public agencies, and enterprises engaged in \nconstruction, laundry, or drycleaning, the threshold was zero--all \nemployees in those industries were covered, regardless of the size of \ntheir firm.\n  The addition of enterprise coverage was an expansion, not a \nreduction, of coverage. It was not a small business exemption from \ncoverage--it was a large business expansion of coverage. It meant that \nworkers in firms with sales above the threshold were protected by the \nminimum wage, regardless of their personal status in interstate \ncommerce. They were covered, because their employers were involved in \ninterstate commerce.\n  Under the 1961 act, workers in firms below the specified level of \nannual sales continued to be covered under the previous case-by-case, \nworker-by-worker standard, the so-called individual coverage.\n  One result of the broad increase in coverage by the 1961 act under \nenterprise coverage was the narrowing of the previous blanket exemption \nfor workers in small retail firms and service firms. Workers in firms \nbelow the threshold in those industries for enterprise coverage \ncontinued to be exempted from individual coverage, even if they were \nengaged in interstate commerce. Above the threshold, workers in those \nindustries were covered for the first time by the minimum wage.\n  That basic dual structure of enterprise coverage and individual \ncoverage has continued since 1961. In 1989, Congress enacted a large \nincrease in the threshold of coverage under the enterprise test--to \n$500,000 in annual sales. That increase, if enacted by itself, would \nhave reversed the 50-year history of expansions of coverage of the \nminimum wage, by excluding an estimated 3 million workers from its \ncoverage under the enterprise test.\n  That reduction in coverage was unacceptable by itself--so Congress \noffset the reduction by repealing the blanket exemption for workers in \nretail and service firms under the individual coverage test. For such \nfirms, the pre-1961 case-by-case worker-by-worker test was reinstated. \nIf the workers were engaged in interstate commerce, they were covered \nby the minimum wage.\n  In recent years, some, like Mr. Faris, have attempted to argue that \nCongress mistakenly repealed the blanket exemption for these small \nretail and service firms. It is clear that some Members of Congress \nthought they were voting for a blanket small business exemption when \nthey voted to increase the threshold for the enterprise test to \n$500,000. But those Members of Congress were ignoring the longstanding \nprinciple of individual coverage--which the 1989 act did not abandon, \nand for good reason.\n  The overall legislative history of the 1989 act makes very clear that \nCongress intended to repeal the exemption for small retail and service \nfirms. Otherwise, the entire legislation would have made no sense. The \nlarge increase in the threshold for enterprise coverage would have \nmeant that 3 million workers were no longer covered by the minimum \nwage. Repeal of the exemption for small retail and service firms under \nindividual coverage expanded that aspect of coverage by about the same \nnumber of workers. That result was intended by Congress, since the \nexpansion of individual coverage offset the reduction in enterprise \ncoverage. Without that fundamental compromise, the 1989 act would never \nhave been approved by Congress.\n  So I hope my Republican colleagues will reflect again on this \nlegislative history, and reconsider their attempt to reduce coverage of \nthe minimum wage by exempting so many workers from its protection. \nThose who work for small firms deserve an increase in the minimum wage. \nThey have waited 5 years for a fair increase, and now is the time for \nCongress to enact it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/08/senate-section/article/S7345-6", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7355-S7358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts, for his excellent remarks this morning in \ndiscussing the important issue of the minimum wage.\n  Harry Truman once said: ``Republicans favor a minimum wage, the \nminimum possible wage.'' I think that a lot of what was said in the \n1940's may be applicable today, with a 1996 twist, which is: The \nminimum possible wage for the minimum number of people to\n\n[[Page S7356]]\n\nbe affected. That, really, is the debate that we will have today and \ntomorrow with regard to the Bond amendment.\n  I want to call everyone's attention to the Bond amendment for what it \nis and what it is not. The Bond amendment, in many cases and in many \nways, could be described as a Swiss cheese approach to the minimum \nwage; Swiss cheese, because it has so many holes it does not provide \nfor the kind of continuity, the kind of opportunity that everyone ought \nto have if the minimum wage is to be an applicable national wage.\n  There are four very specific issues that it addresses in a very \nharmful manner, for those who are dependent upon the minimum wage. I \nwant to discuss very briefly each of those four this afternoon. Suffice \nit to say, the Bond amendment is truly a vote against the minimum wage \nand against working families who depend upon it. It gives with one hand \nand takes with the other. It uses exemptions, denials, and delays to \nprovide minimum wage increases to a minimum possible number of people. \nIt is a more extreme version of this amendment than what was defeated \nin the House a couple of months ago.\n  The Bond amendment, No. 1, effectively denies an increase to all \nworkers for the first 6 months of employment. It does not matter \nwhether you are young or you are old, whether you are working for \nsummer earnings or have to feed a family, whether you are with or \nwithout any experience, that provision in the Bond amendment would \nsimply deny, for 6 months of employment, any opportunity to benefit \nwhatsoever from the minimum wage.\n  The House-passed bill applies the subminimum to workers under the age \nof 20 for the first 3 months of employment. Already that is an extreme \nprovision in some respects. The Bond amendment is even worse. The high \nturnover in these jobs is an inevitability, so many workers would never \nget an increase. I can see in some cases right now where someone will \nwork for 5 months and 2 weeks and then find he or she is going to be \nleft without work because to increase that person's wage would be \nsomething the small business owner may not want to do. So, in essence, \nyou are going to get churning of people, regardless of what age they \nare; working for 5 months and 2 weeks or 5 months and 3 weeks, only to \nbe denied a minimum wage job after that.\n  I believe most employers are very honest, hard-working people who \ncare a lot of about their employees. But how many unscrupulous \nemployers will there be, people who will find ways in which to avoid \nthe law, avoid paying the minimum wage, avoid living up to their \nresponsibility and find a way to keep people at this extraordinarily \nlow, subminimum level?\n  The President feels so strongly about this provision alone that he \nsaid he would veto the bill if this provision is in the legislation \nwhen it reaches his desk.\n  Second, the Bond amendment denies an increase for any employee of \ncompanies with less than $500,000 in annual sales. Mr. President, these \ncompanies employ 10.5 million people. They make up two-thirds of all \nworkplaces today. They include not only retail and service \nestablishments, but manufacturing firms as well. Their employees \nalready are denied benefits of most Federal worker protection laws. \nThey earn lower wages, get fewer benefits, and have less job security \nthan virtually anybody in the country. They should not be stripped of \ntheir minimum wage protections as well.\n  Over and above everything else, to say that a worker who only has the \noption of working in a company with sales less than $500,000, who \nprobably does not get health insurance, probably does not get any other \nworker protection at the Federal level and probably has less job \nsecurity, but at the same time now may also be denied even minimum wage \nprotection is wrong. That is extreme, and that is something that we \nsimply must oppose.\n  A third provision denies any raise to waitresses or waiters or other \ntipped employees. Right now employers need to pay only 50 percent of \nthe minimum wage, or $2.13 an hour for tipped employees. Instead of \nmaintaining that 50 percent employer payment, the Bond amendment \nfreezes it for all perpetuity at $2.13. We could be here 20 years from \nnow, and if the Bond amendment were to be adopted, anybody who worked \nin a restaurant would be frozen at $2.13, dependent entirely upon tips \nfor any kind of an increase in a living wage.\n  This is especially a problem for women, because 80 percent of tipped \nemployees today are women. In 1995, about half of full-time waitresses \nearned roughly $250 a week, less than the poverty level for a family of \nthree. Just last year, half of the full-time people who worked on tips \nearned roughly $250 a week. So what we are going to tell all of those \npeople, 80 percent of whom are women, is, ``You're going to have to \nlive with a frozen minimum wage at $2.13 an hour for all perpetuity. \nThere isn't any option for an increase. You don't have any opportunity \nto see your wages increase along with everybody else's. That $250 that \nyou may be getting right now to feed your two kids, well, keep in mind \nwe want to keep you off welfare, we're going to kick you off welfare, \nwe're going to tell you to go get a job, go get child support, get \nhealth insurance, go find a way to clothe and house your kids, do all \nof that, but we're going to freeze your wage at $2.13 an hour.''\n  Mr. President, I cannot believe that this body is prepared to say \nthat. If we want to reward work, if we want to protect families, if we \nwant to find ways to ensure the children are going to grow in an \nenvironment that allows a mother to be home at least part of the time \ninstead of getting three and four jobs, staying at home with children \ninstead of working at wages that pay $2.13 an hour, then it would seem \nto me that they, above and beyond just about anybody else, ought to be \nentitled to some increase in the minimum wage.\n  The final thing is, this amendment delays the date of the minimum \nwage for another 6 months. When the House Members passed their bill, \nthey said it was going to go into effect virtually on Independence Day, \non July 4--actually, July 1, a couple of days before Independence Day--\nin the hopes that maybe some families out there could declare some \nindependence economically, some opportunity to be a little freer than \nthey are right now.\n  The Bond amendment says, ``No, no, that's too fast. If you earn \nminimum wage today, we're going to ask you to wait until after next \nChristmas before you're entitled to any increase in the minimum wage. \nYou're not going to get it in July, you're not going to get it by Labor \nDay, the day we set aside to honor working families. No, we're going to \nmake you wait until after next Christmas. We're going to wait until \nnext January before this wage goes into effect.'' This is on top of \nmonths of delay caused by a Republican filibuster to the minimum wage.\n\n  Mr. President, minimum wage workers have gone without a raise now for \n5 years. We have had raises. Most people have had raises in this \ncountry over the last 4 and 5 years. How remarkable it is that those \nsame people who espouse welfare reform, who want to join with us in \nproviding real opportunities for work, to encourage work, would say \nthat the one thing that would probably encourage work more than \nanything else, an increase in the minimum wage, is something we just \nshould not do. We should not do it for tipped employees, we should not \ndo it for employees in businesses that have less than a $500,000 gross \nincome, we should not do it for the first 180 days for anybody who is \non minimum wage. Regardless of what else happens, we better not even do \nit until 1997.\n  I must tell you, Mr. President, I have a hard time understanding the \nmotivation for those who would want to say that to over 10.5 million \npeople--actually close to 14 million workers--in this country. This \ndelay equals the loss of more than $500 in pay, money that could go for \nthe health care and the food and housing that kids are going to need.\n  Every day on the floor somebody with good judgment and with good \nreason comes to lament the destruction of the family, comes to lament \nthe destruction of this nuclear core that we think so much about and \nthat we think really is the key to a civilized society. We cannot \nunderstand why there are teenagers out on the street making trouble for \nthe rest of society. We do not understand why they lost their values. \nWe cannot figure out why there is an increase in juvenile crime and \ntruancy and all the other problems.\n  Mr. President, I will tell you why. The reason is because more and \nmore\n\n[[Page S7357]]\n\nmothers and fathers are forced to leave their homes, unable to take \ncare of their children, because they have three or four jobs they have \nto hold to make ends meet. That is what this is all about.\n  So if we are ever going to get back to making sure that the family is \nprotected, making sure those children have core values with which to \nensure that they will be productive parts of society, then it seems to \nme we have to understand that it all starts with the paycheck and \nwhether or not families have the dignity and the opportunity that they \nmust be accorded to ensure that there is some paycheck security in \ntheir families.\n  Minimum wage workers are not what many people think they are. Two-\nthirds of them are adults; 40 percent are sole breadwinners; 60 percent \nare women. Minimum wage workers' earnings account for almost half of \nthe families' total earnings today.\n  So, Mr. President, this is going to be, of all the votes we cast, one \nof the most critical votes we are going to cast this year, because it \nsends a clear message out there that we hear you, we know how insecure \nso many people feel today because of their inability to pay their \nbills. Not that they are not working hard enough; they are working \nharder and longer than other families in history. They are making the \nhard choices about going out and finding another job or staying home \nand taking care of their children.\n  America is going to watch this vote. They are going to watch to see \nwhether we vote for the Swiss cheese Bond amendment, the one with all \nthe holes in it, the one that devastates the minimum wage law for the \nfirst time in decades, or whether we are going to stand up and say, at \nlong last, America needs a raise after 5 years.\n  Those who are on minimum wage deserve it. If we want to keep them off \nwelfare, they deserve at least a 90-cent increase. That is all we are \nproposing here. It is time we do it. Inflation has eaten away 95 \npercent of the last increase. At the current level of $4.25 an hour, \nmany minimum wage workers who work 40 hours a week do not earn enough \nto keep their families out of poverty. How sad that is today.\n  So unless we act, the minimum wage is going to fall to the lowest \nlevel in 40 years. This does not have to be partisan. The last time we \nvoted on this it was bipartisan. Six weeks ago, the House voted \noverwhelmingly in favor of it; 93 House Republicans voted for it. The \nvast majority, I am told, over 80 percent of the American people, want \nto see it increased.\n  This is a chance to do something right. It is a chance for us to stop \nstalling, to send a clear message to people across this land that we \nrecognize how important your paycheck and your long-term security is, \nwe recognize how important your family is, we recognize that if we are \ngoing to urge you to stay off welfare and go to work, that you need a \nwage to do it. That is what this does. It is important we pass a \nminimum wage increase. It is important we defeat the Bond amendment. It \nis important at long last we sign the increase into law.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a very brief question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I included in the Record the statement by \nthe National Retail Federation that was put out on July 1. The National \nRetail Federation is the largest retail trade association in the \ncountry. In their front page they referenced the minimum wage fight in \nthe Senate. They say President Clinton says he will veto the minimum \nwage increase if it passes, talking about this particular proposal. \n``Let him.'' ``It is our last chance and best hope for stopping the \nminimum wage increase this year,'' referring to the Bond amendment.\n  So here is the largest retail association saying effectively that the \nbest way to stop any increase in the minimum wage is to support the \nBond amendment. I have concluded that was really a devious measure in \nthe sense that people want to have it both ways.\n  This is my question: Whether the Senator would think that the \nargument might be made to those who support the Bond amendment, well, \nyou can vote for it; it is an increase in the minimum wage. But on the \nother hand, for reasons that the Senator has outlined so well this \nafternoon, effectively it gives with the one hand and takes away with \nthe other hand.\n  I am just wondering if this is really the purpose: Our best chance \nand best hope for stopping the minimum wage increase this year. Here is \nthe largest retail organization making this clear statement. We ought \nto call a spade a spade and say that effectively the Bond amendment is \nreally an effort to stop and halt any increase to the minimum wage. \nThat would be the result of it were it to pass. So the vote would be \nvery clear in terms of who is on the side of working families and who \nis not. I am just wondering what conclusion the Senator from South \nDakota would reach on that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I could--I will use whatever leader \ntime I may require. I know our time runs out at 2 o'clock. Given the \nfact no one else is here at this point, I will use leader time to the \nextent necessary to respond to the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator may use his \nleader time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. In \nmany respects, I think there are some of our colleagues who would like \nto have it both ways. They would like to say, ``Yes, I voted for a \nminimum wage increase,'' but then go tell some of their business \nconstituents, ``But really I didn't. I really didn't. This is not a \nreal minimum wage because we exempt virtually everybody.''\n  I was home last weekend, and I just took my own poll. I asked \nretailers, I asked people in just about every line of business I could \nfind in South Dakota, ``What do you think? What do you think about \nraising the minimum wage? Is this something that you oppose? Would this \nhurt you badly? What are your thoughts?''\n  I was amazed, just amazed at the level of sophistication, about the \ncompassion, about the recognition of the importance of this issue, \nabout how troubled many of our employers are in watching their \nemployees try to make ends meet by holding down two and three jobs, \nbecause they know that one job is not going to be enough.\n  One employer told me, ``You know, Tom, I really don't know how these \nemployees do it today. I go home and I watch the baseball game at night \nwhen I finish work. Some of my employees go to their second job. And \ntheir spouses are already at a second or third job. I don't know, but \nmore and more I'm seeing their kids out in the streets because I know \nthey're not home taking care of them.''\n\n  I had an employee tell me the only dinner--the only dinner--they have \ntogether is after church on Sunday once a week. The whole family now \ngets together for dinner once, on a Sunday, because they have no time \nduring the week, no time because everybody is working even harder \ncarrying out second and third jobs. As a result, the kids cook for \nthemselves. The kids are doing whatever they have to. Hopefully they \nare doing their homework.\n  But, Mr. President, that is exactly what we are trying to talk about \nhere. We are trying to address a real and growing problem. If we are \nserious about family, if we are serious about trying to keep them \ntogether and teach our youngsters values, who is to do it if the family \nis not together? Can you teach all the values that you have to share \nwith a young person growing up on a Sunday after church? I do not think \nso.\n  So, while some of our colleagues would like very much to be able to \nsay, ``I voted for a minimum wage,'' but then secretly, ``I voted to \ngut it,'' let me tell you, there are a lot of business people, at least \nin South Dakota, who see it for what it is, who recognize that we have \nto do what is honorable here. It is time we recognized that people on \nminimum wage need more than just $4.25 an hour to survive if they are \ngoing to take care of their kids. So I appreciate very much the \ndistinguished Senator's raising the question. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nGeorgia, Mr. Coverdell, is to control the next 90 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n[[Page S7358]]\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It is my understanding that for the next 90 minutes, I \nor my designee have control of that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Very good.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/08/senate-section/article/S7355-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7358-S7366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FBI FILES AT THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, on Wednesday, July 3, which, \nincidentally, was the cost-of-Government day, which means the last day \nafter which an American family finally quit paying Government--July 4 \ntook on a special meaning because it was not only Independence Day, but \nbecause it is the first day a family could keep its own check. But, \ninterestingly enough, in the midst of all the debate, a very \ninteresting editorial appeared in the Washington Post, which \ncharacterizes itself as an independent newspaper.\n  On July 3, the Washington Post said, ``FBI Files and the ex-FBI \nAuthor.'' That was the name of the article. It says:\n\n       Controversy swirls around both [these issues], but it ought \n     to be possible to separate the probe of the improperly \n     requisitioned FBI reports by the Clinton White House from the \n     effort to sort out fact from fiction in former FBI agent Gary \n     Aldrich's book about life at the White House.\n\n  I agree with this. I agree that the commentary of a popular book \nought to be separate from the very, very serious issue of hundreds of \nour citizens' personal FBI files going to the--hundreds. At this time \nthe current number keeps going up. It started out 300. Then it went to \n407. Then it went to 600. Then 700. The last report I have seen is 900. \nIt is almost beyond belief. Both that the White House could request \nthose personal files and that those files could be violated by our own \nFederal Bureau of Investigation.\n  The Post says:\n\n       The three probes need to find out if the country has an \n     abuse of presidential power on its hands or whether it is \n     witnessing yet one more White House staff-administered blow \n     to this president's prestige.\n\n  Mr. President, for my own part, while there is deep concern about \nwhat has transpired at the White House, I think so far the public \ndiscourse underestimates what transpired at the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation. It is beyond my understanding how this many personal \nfiles or the data in those files could be copied and so routinely made \navailable to the White House without fire alarms and sirens going off \nfrom the front to the back door and all the way to the Director's \noffice. I cannot imagine how this could happen. Now, the Director has \nsaid there was an egregious breach of honor between the White House and \nthe FBI, but much more will have to be answered than that simple \nquestion.\n\n  Mr. President, I see we have been joined by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona. I yield up to 15 minutes to the Senator from Arizona for \nhis remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia both for \ntaking time to get into this matter and also for yielding time to me.\n  I was perplexed, to say the least, as I sat through hearings as a \nmember of the Senate Judiciary Committee just before the Fourth of July \nbreak, hearing testimony from Mr. Livingstone and others regarding this \nmatter of the FBI files. I am going to come back to some conclusions \nthat came out of that hearing and some questions that remain in a \nmoment.\n  I thought, first, perhaps, it would be useful to discuss generally \nwhat we have here. There have been, especially in the time since \nWatergate, numerous investigations of officials involved in different \nadministrations. To some extent, I think this has been politically \nmotivated. To a large extent, I think it is a process that is important \nin a democracy, because people need to have confidence in their \nGovernment, particularly when people in high places are accused of \nwrongdoing or there is a potential of wrongdoing. We have established a \nsystem whereby an independent kind of investigator or prosecutor called \nthe special counsel is appointed by the Attorney General, with court \nacquiescence, to investigate matters. There have been prosecutions from \ntime to time in administrations since the Watergate matter that have \ndemonstrated it is wise to have these kinds of special counsel \navailable to look into such matters.\n  While there may be some politics involved, and certainly Republicans \nbelieve there is politics involved in some of the investigations in the \nReagan and Bush administrations, and I am sure that some Democrats \nbelieve there is glee in Republican ranks to find things wrong now in a \nDemocratic administration, the fact is it is still important to try to \nget to the bottom of some of these matters, particularly where it goes \nbeyond politics. I think it can be demonstrated with this \nadministration that it has gone far beyond politics, that there has \nbeen wrongdoing, and that there are people in this administration that, \nto say the least, have been ethically challenged.\n  As a matter of fact, Mr. President, according to an article written \nby Mary McGrory in the Washington Post,\n\n       President Clinton said that his administration would be the \n     most ethical administration in the history of the Republic.\n\n  That was shortly after he was inaugurated. I think history will \nreveal that this is one of the most ethically challenged \nadministrations in the history of the Republic. This FBI scandal is, \nfrankly, just the latest of the scandals in the Clinton White House. As \nthe Senator from Georgia pointed out, this involves the misuse of about \n900--at least that is the number we have so far--900 FBI files.\n  Going back to reflect on what has occurred earlier in \nthis administration, and again this is not really partisan because if \nyou look at the last three Presidents, President Carter, President \nReagan, and President Bush, I think almost all Americans would agree \nthat all three of these Presidents had the highest ethical standards, \nCarter a Democrat, the other two Republicans. It did not matter what \ntheir politics were. I think most Americans believe that all three of \nthem are people of the greatest integrity and repute. To the extent \nthere was any wrongdoing in any of their administrations each one of \nthem had accusations made, they took responsibility, they tried to \nclean house, and their integrity, I think, remains without question.\n\n  In this particular administration, look at what we have. We have \nfirst of all, Roger Altman, Treasury Secretary who misled Congress \nabout his discussions of a Whitewater-connected S He resigned. Henry \nCisneros, the HUD Secretary under investigation by court-appointed \ncounsel for lying to the FBI. Mike Espy, former Secretary of \nAgriculture, under investigation for taking illegal gifts. He resigned. \nWeb Hubble, a very close associate of the President and First Lady, \nAssociate Attorney General, has been sentenced to 21 months in jail for \nmail fraud and tax evasion. William Kennedy, former associate White \nHouse counsel, and possibly one of the people involved in the hirings \nof Craig Livingstone, failed to pay Social Security taxes and resigned. \nBernard Nussbaum, former White House counsel, resigned his post after \nbeing accused of improper contacts with Whitewater investigators. David \nWatkins, former White House director of administration, resigned after \nhe used a Presidential helicopter to play golf. Hazel O'Leary, \nSecretary of Energy, has committees looking after her travel, and \nthough she is still in the job, questions remain. More than a dozen \nindictments relating generally to Whitewater, most resulting in plea \nbargains, if not convictions. As a matter of fact, three close \nassociates of the President were convicted by a jury, including the \nPresident's hand-picked successor, Gov. Jim Guy Tucker.\n  Then the Travelgate matter. It was as a result of the Travelgate \ninvestigation that the information about the FBI files came out. It \nwas, really, quite by accident. The House committee investigating the \nTravelgate matter had asked for 3,000 documents, all of which had been \ndenied by the White House, 3,000 documents. Finally, under threat of \nsubpoena and contempt of Congress if they did not comply with the \nsubpoena, the White House agreed to turn over one-third of those \ndocuments. It was one of those 1,000 documents that led investigators \nof the House committee into the FBI file issue, because there was a \nreference to FBI files having been obtained, I think, perhaps, relating \nto Billy Dale who was the fired head of the Travel Office of the White \nHouse. The rest, as is commonly said, is history.\n\n[[Page S7359]]\n\n  It was learned first that there were about 300 files, then 400, and \nas the Senator from Georgia pointed out, it may now be as many as 900 \nfiles improperly obtained, most of which were reviewed. It is unclear \nwhether information in those files has been revealed to people \nimproperly. In any event, the mere review of those files was improper, \nas was the acquisition of those files from the FBI. Also, quite \nimproper was the storage of the files then in the White House, rather \nthan having them returned to the FBI. The fact they were not secure and \nmany people had access to them who should not have had access to them, \nwe do not know yet what might have been done with those files and \nwhether information was copied or used. We may not know for a long time \nwhether information in those files, stored away in somebody's drawer, \nmight later come back to haunt some of the people whose files were \nimproperly obtained.\n\n  All of this is beginning to come out. It is not coming out from the \nWhite House. It is having to be gathered by the House committee, the \nSenate committee, the special prosecutor. Just little bits and pieces \nof information keep coming out. There is no coming clean by this \nadministration, which was going to be the most ethical in history. As a \nmatter of fact, the President originally attributed this whole matter \nto a bureaucratic snafu. Now, I think one of two things is true, Mr. \nPresident, but a bureaucratic snafu is not one of them.\n  Here is what we know for a fact: A political operative, so described \nin the press, I am talking about Craig Livingstone, part of his \nresponsibilities in previous campaigns had been opposition research, \nand part of it had been to cause Republicans traveling around George \nBush, I think, in particular, trouble when he stopped at various \nlocations. But Craig Livingstone has had a history in Democratic \ncampaigns of snooping on the opposition, learning facts. I believe it \nwas by his own admission or perhaps he was proud of the fact that he \nlearned things about the Dan Quayle campaign, took them back to the \nMondale campaign, and, as a result of that in the debate that Dan \nQuayle and Lloyd Bentsen had, Bentsen was able to come up with the \ngreat line, ``You're no John Kennedy,'' because Livingstone had learned \nin advance that Quayle was going to compare himself during this debate \nto John Kennedy.\n\n  So here you have a man who has admitted that he is a political \nsnoop--some say dirt digger, but let us use the term that is generally \napplied, and that is a person skilled in ``opposition research,'' an \nindividual who finds out things about the opposition in political \ncampaigns, a person with no professional security experience \nwhatsoever.\n  Now, when this administration comes into power, people who have been \nthere through Democrat and Republican administrations, nonpartisan, \nprofessional security people, who have been in charge of White House \npersonnel files, to get clearance so that the people who are in the \nWhite House are all cleared, are let go. Mr. Livingstone is brought in, \nand nobody seems to remember who hired him. Nobody can recall. This is \nthe first job this guy has in the White House, and he cannot remember \nwho hired him. I think if I got a job in the White House, I would \nremember who hired me. But that is another matter.\n  This person, with no experience whatsoever, certainly not a \nprofessional in security matters, is put in charge of what? He is put \nin charge of the most sensitive material on any American citizen--their \nFBI file. These are the things which people have had to tell the FBI in \norder to get clearance. They are the most sensitive things about their \nhistory that exist. These FBI files, then, are routinely reviewed by \nthe security office in order to give these clearances. Craig \nLivingstone is specifically given the job of clearing people for the \nability to be in the White House and have access to the White House.\n  Now, is it a coincidence that somebody who is skilled primarily in \nopposition research in political campaigns just happens to come across \n300, 400, 600, maybe 900 FBI files--almost exclusively of Republicans--\nand that he then has a friend of his, who also has been involved in \nthis kind of political activity, review those files? Is it just \ncoincidence that a person with that kind of background then begins to \nconduct this kind of activity? Maybe so. That is one possibility. The \nother possibility is that he was told to do it and he was following \norders. Those are the two possibilities, Mr. President.\n  There was no bureaucratic snafu because there was no bureaucrat \ninvolved. There was a paid political operative involved. One of the \nthings that I think we need to find out is exactly what did Craig \nLivingstone and Anthony Marceca do when they worked in the various \nPresidential campaigns that they worked in? Were they involved, as has \nbeen reported, in doing opposition research? Why were they hired? Who \nmade the decision to hire them? Why were they hired? People with no \nsecurity background skills, but very skilled in opposition research--\napparently--according to Craig Livingstone's own comments in his \nhometown newspaper. Why were they hired? Who hired them? What \ninstructions were they given? Were they simply operating on their own? \nBased upon the information that has come out in the hearings, it is \nvery unclear whether or not anybody gave them instructions. It is not \nresolved yet. That is an open question. It may be that if you hire a \nplumber, you will assume he will do plumbing. And if you hire an \nopposition researcher, the assumption is that he will do some \nopposition research for you. Maybe there does not have to be an \nexplicit instruction. As a matter of fact, maybe under the doctrine of \nplausible deniability here, the instructions were given in a wink and a \nnod so that anybody higher up in the White House could say, ``Gee, I \nnever told him to dig up dirt on Republicans. I guess he just did that \non his own. We certainly did not ask him to do it.''\n\n  So it seems to me that one of two things is true. When you hire a \npolitical operative, a person who is skilled in opposition research, by \nhis own account, and he happens to gather up the files of the \nopposition on, in effect, 800 or 900 Republicans, it could be \ncoincidence. That could be true. It could also be that it was \nintentional. If it was intentional, it was for the purpose of learning \ninformation about these people which could later be used for political \npurposes. There has been a lot of speculation about possible motives. \nThere is no question that Billy Dale, the head of the travel office, \nwas greatly mistreated by this administration. The FBI was brought in \nto investigate. He was eventually prosecuted and, of course, he was \nfound innocent. But his file was among those requested, and the files \nwere from A to G, and that certainly falls within that area. So it \ncould have been to get information on him, and the rest of the files \nwere used for cover.\n  It could have been that this administration, intent on learning \neverything it could about 900 Republicans--there were something like a \nthousand people who needed access to the White House, who needed \nclearance, and they had not even complied with the FBI yet so they \ncould be cleared. It was a year or two before many people who needed \nsecurity clearances in this administration were cleared. It finally \nbecame a scandal about this same time. Dee Dee Myers, the press \nsecretary, did not even have clearance. Time after time, people who \nneeded clearance put off interviews with the FBI, refused to give them \ninformation. It was not until after this that the GAO did an audit and \nthe White House had to clean up its act and at least get the \ninformation together to provide the security clearances for people who \nrequired access to the White House.\n  There is speculation that in order to, in effect, cover for that \ndeficiency and inadequacy, the thought was that if we dig up some dirt \non Republicans, that will even it out and there will not be so much \nheat put on us. Maybe it was simply for future use, or for present and \nfuture use. We do not know. We have not gotten answers to some \nquestions yet. Either it was an enormous coincidence, or there was \nsomething more sinister behind it.\n  In either event, it was wrong, and no one has denied that access to \nthese FBI files by people who should not have had access for these \nreasons was wrong, was unethical and, perhaps, depending upon if IRS \nmaterial was in the files, for example, was illegal as well.\n  So let us just conclude with some questions here that I think we are\n\n[[Page S7360]]\n\ngoing to need to get the answers to before we make any accusations. I \ndo not think we know enough yet to make accusations. Here are some of \nthe questions I would like to have answered. Let us tie down exactly \nwho hired Livingstone and why. It was, as George Stephanopolous points \nout, an incredibly loose, informal, and I would say negligent approach \nto hiring one of the most important people in the White House. He \nhappened to be on board when Kennedy got there and, therefore, they \njust assumed he should be the guy in charge. So his employment was then \nratified. Well, who decided all of that, and on what basis was \nLivingstone hired as opposed to some professional?\n  As a matter of fact, the White House had a recommendation before it \nby the then chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, my \npredecessor, Senator DeConcini from Arizona--a Democrat, by the way. \nAfter reviewing the White House security office situation, that \ncommittee made recommendations, conveyed by Senator DeConcini, that the \nWhite House had to get its act together and appoint a professional, \nnonpartisan person to head this office. That was not done. As a matter \nof fact, I have read that letter of transmittal. There was a very nice \nresponse back by the then White House counsel, Lloyd Cutler, who \nthanked Senator DeConcini for the information and said they would get \nback to the committee after deciding what to do. As far as I know, \nthere was never any further response. It was known that there was a \nproblem here. So, in a bipartisan way, recommendations were made to the \nWhite House to clean it up. But it apparently was not cleaned up.\n  Who discussed this within the White House? Why were the political \noperatives put in charge of reviewing these files? What activities did \nLivingstone and Marceca actually perform in the Democratic campaigns of \nGeorge McGovern, Ed Muskie, Geraldine Ferraro, Al Gore, Bill Clinton, \nand others? Are these men the political opposition researchers, dirt \ndiggers, spoofs, or whatever you want to call it? Did Livingstone \ninfiltrate the Dan Quayle campaign? Who gave them their instructions \nand what were they?\n  Did anyone in the White House ever become aware of any of the \ninformation from those files? This information only came to light, as I \nsaid, because the House oversight committee was going to subpoena it \nfrom the White House. But there are still 2,000 documents that have not \nbeen reviewed. There is now an arrangement under which the House \ncommittee can look at those 2,000 documents. But they cannot be taken \nout of the White House possession. What is in those 2,000 documents?\n  Finally, when the problem was discovered, why did the White House not \ncome forward? Why was Craig Livingstone hired? If it was merely a \nmistake, as the White House indicated, one would have thought, if this \nis the most ethical White House in the history of the Republic, that \nthe White House would have come forward and would have said, ``We want \nto find out something here; we want to make everybody aware of it; here \nis a big mistake; here is what it is.'' You would have assumed they \nwould have come forward.\n  One of the suggestions of wrongdoing is there is an attempt to cover \nup. Certainly in this case there has been an attempt to cover up.\n  So I realize these are more questions than answers but I think these \nare the things that we need to get out, and we need to find the answers \nto. And in this case, unlike the assertion with regard to certain other \nsituations, there is already an acknowledgment by everyone that there \nwas something wrong done. It was a question about whether it was \nintentional, or just accidental. But clearly it was wrong.\n  So I do not think we can have the excuse that we should not be \nspending money to look into this, that there should not be hearings to \nget to the bottom of it, and so on. Remember that when there is any \nillegality, or impropriety, or something that is wrong and gives people \nless confidence in their Government, we need to get to the bottom of it \nbecause the essence of a democratic republic, such as ours, is that the \npeople run their government, they have confidence in it, they have \ntrust in it, and when that lags, when that fails, when it frays, then \nthe very fabric of our Government begins to come apart.\n  So, Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Georgia for having this \ndiscussion to bring some of these questions to the floor; to raise some \nof the questions that we still need to get answers to. And I think it \nis appropriate, both for this body and for the House of \nRepresentatives, to continue the investigation to get to the bottom of \nthe matter so that at a very minimum nothing like this can ever happen \nagain. It is people's lives that have been intruded into here; innocent \npeople. And the power of the Federal Government and of the White House \nshould never be used for political retribution, or to disclose the \ndeepest secrets of any individual for improper purposes.\n  Therefore, we have every reason, I think, to ask these questions and \nto try to get to the bottom of this FBI file matter.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Georgia for bringing this matter to \nthe light of day.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to pay particular compliment to \nthe Senator from Arizona. I believe he has framed the substance of this \nissue very succinctly, in a way that is most understanding in the \nphrasing of the questions for which we must resolve. It was exceedingly \nwell done. I want to compliment the Senator from Arizona for his usual \nform as he deals with this very, very sensitive subject.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to go back to the Washington Post editorial \nthat appeared on July 3. They point out that we now have three separate \ninquiries, or investigations into what went wrong between the White \nHouse and the FBI. There is the House inquiry, a Senate inquiry, and, \nof course, the Justice Department has now turned this matter over to \nIndependent Counsel, Kenneth Starr.\n  They say:\n\n       The three probes need to find out if the country has an \n     abuse of Presidential power on its hands or whether it is \n     witnessing yet one more White House staff-administered blow \n     to this President's prestige.\n\n  Then they go on again to say that we need to separate these probes \nfrom the books that are appearing on a regular basis, and I concur with \nthat entirely.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Four days of congressional hearings, however, have yet to \n     adequately explain why hundreds of FBI reports on employees \n     of former Republican administrations ended up in the office \n     of former party operative and now resigned White House \n     personnel security director Craig Livingstone. For nearly two \n     years, sensitive FBI documents were maintained in an office \n     and vault where political advance types, interns and \n     volunteers--without security clearances--could have had easy \n     access to them. What happened to security standards?\n\n  This is a question that every American citizen will now want \nanswered, and answered quickly.\n  Mr. President, we have been joined by the Senator from Montana, and I \nyield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, we have all come off of a week of vacation with a lot \nof travel. You get to visit with a lot of people. We think that the \nwhole world is focused in on what happens here in Washington, DC. To \nour surprise it is not. Maybe that is something to be thankful about.\n  Mr. President, I am baffled after coming off this vacation that I can \nbe sitting in a committee hearing with CEO's and president's of \ncompanies like Netscape, like Microsoft; like all of the companies that \nhave come to be, within the last 10 or 15 years, powerful; and \ncompanies in the new technologies that we are using today, listening to \nthese president's and CEO's argue for strong encryption technology that \nis vital to the future of businesses while at the same moment this \nadministration is apologizing to the American people for the exposure \nof confidential FBI files--I just find absolutely unbelievable that \nthis kind of snafu could be permitted by and enacted by several of the \nemployees at the White House\n\n[[Page S7361]]\n\nthat have unlimited access to extremely--I say ``extremely''--\nconfidential information on hundreds of prominent Americans.\n  After this incident, it gives me pause. And it might be clear that \nnot only does this President believe in big Government, but, I add, \ndoes he also believe in Big Brother? Contrary to popular opinion, Big \nBrother is probably watching and listening to all of us.\n\n  A startling fact revealed this week is that over the last 4 years \nelectronic eavesdropping has increased by 100 percent; from 340 in 1993 \nto an estimated 700 in 1996. Does that mean that we have more criminal \nactivity? I do not think so. I think in fact that most of the crime \nfigures are going the other way. The 1994 Communications Assistance for \nLaw Enforcement Act mandates that all of the Nation's telephone \ncarriers build special access for Government wiretappers as these new \ntelephone companies develop new digital telephone systems, and that \naccess makes it easier for the Government to listen to just about \nanybody or anything that they want to.\n  Right now in this country among the business community--and after the \npassage of the 1996 Telecommunications Act that allowed this new \nsuperinformation highway to be built and to be advanced--we are seeing \nthat information highway used for many purposes: Business creation, \nnational security, communications, and exchanging information. Most of \nthe integrity of that information highway will depend on the kind of \nencryption or the codes that we can put so that whoever we mail to we \nmake sure that it is for their eyes only and that it has not been \nmonkeyed with or tampered with.\n  Any of the three is crucial in doing business on today's information \nhighway. It is just like you drive a truck. If you want to ship some \ngoods to Pennsylvania, you use a public highway. That could be called \nthe Internet. What do you do? You lock the truck. The truck gets on the \nhighway, gets off the highway. You want to make sure that your property \nis protected. That is very essential in this business, this business of \nhigh tech and using the information highway.\n  So basically, we need security through encryption technology to \nprotect our bank transactions, our health transactions--telemedicine is \na reality nowadays. We will deliver our medical services via the \ninformation highway. Your medical records should be kept secure--\nInternet commerce; in other words, if you are doing business on the \nInternet, you have communiques for your people, their eyes only--and, \nof course, software security.\n  There is intense international competition in the technology of \nencryption. So, Mr. President, we do not live in a vacuum. Other \ncountries are developing encryption technology. But American software \ncompanies are hurt by the old World War II-type mentality to encryption \ntechnology.\n  Ironically, the only obstacle to creating the safe environment in \ncyberspace is none other than the White House. The President actually \nargues it is imperative for Government to keep a decoder key, a decoder \nkey--they call it key escrow--of each company's encryption codes for \npublic safety. I am wondering whose safety they are really looking out \nfor.\n  This graph sums it up for us. Confidential FBI files and back door \ngateways to our computers are off limits. It is off limits. People can \nunderstand a snafu, but they do not understand when their privacy has \nbeen invaded without their knowledge and without them giving authority \nto look at that information.\n  If you are having security troubles with confidential paper files, \nhow can the Government be trusted with highly sensitive proprietary \nencryption codes for multibillion-dollar high-tech companies? I just \nhappen to believe that the American people have real concerns about Big \nBrother. It is called trust. They just do not trust the Federal \nGovernment to have any kind of control over their privacy anymore. And \nusing the FBI to investigate anybody is only the tip of the iceberg \nwhen it comes to the potential for corruption in the computer industry.\n  I have America on my mind today, and I am really concerned about the \nstand that the administration has taken on encryption. I was in Palo \nAlto on Monday, a week ago, talking about this very thing and, yes, it \nis something that we are not allowed to export, an encryption that goes \nbeyond the 40-bit-link standard. We can buy it in this country. We can \nuse it in this country. It is about a $15 billion a year export \nbusiness that was locking our software production. You can talk about \nstrictly a business deal, but basically we must have encryption if we \nare to move more things electronically, even for national security.\n  I urge the President to rethink his position on encryption technology \nand just support the efforts to protect the privacy of U.S. citizens. I \ntake that very seriously. I think this Government should take it very \nseriously. And I think the people of this country should have very, \nvery serious concerns with even a little snafu. And it is not a little \nsnafu, folks. It is not little. It is big. And it is just the basis of \na free society.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana. He \nbrings to the Senate floor a unique expertise on privacy in the new \ntechnology and I appreciate very much his sharing that with us here \nthis afternoon.\n  In just one moment I am going to yield to the Senator from Idaho, but \nreturning to this editorial as a postscript of what we heard from the \nSenator from Montana and a prelude to what we will hear from the \nSenator from Idaho, it goes on to say, and I quote:\n\n       A deeply disturbing picture already has emerged based on \n     sworn depositions the House Committee on Reform and Oversight \n     obtained from Mr. Livingstone and his hand-picked detailee, \n     Army civilian investigator and political operative, Anthony \n     Marceca. The deposition of former White House counsel William \n     Kennedy III adds to the concern.\n\n  Adds to the concern.\n\n       If the new administration attached much importance to \n     security requirements for White House employment, it is not \n     evident.\n\n  I repeat: ``It is not evident.''\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield up to 15 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Idaho is recognized \nfor up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from \nGeorgia, and also the Senator from Montana, for their comments on this \nvery critical issue.\n  I see two lines of thought when it comes to the White House and the \nresponsibility as it relates to the FBI files and controversy. The \nfirst line is that the White House masterminded the request for the FBI \nfiles in order to compile a political enemies list and make trouble for \ntheir political opponents. That is the first line I think any \nreasonable person listening might gather.\n  The second line is that Craig Livingstone operated independently, and \nif the White House is guilty of anything then it is guilty only of \nincompetence or sheer ignorance. Somehow one of those lines in the \nhearings that are underway must prevail.\n  Now, if none of those are true, then I would offer a third option, \nwhat I call the agricultural approach. Maybe it is from my background, \nbut it goes something like this. In farming country, you should not be \ntoo surprised if you are growing wheat and you plant wheat that wheat \nis what you get.\n  What am I saying here? I am saying that if you plant a political \noperative as a director of the Office of Personnel Security, and a \npolitical operative who boasts about helping in the dirty tricks of the \nlast Clinton campaign, you should not be too surprised if you harvest a \ncrop of dirty tricks and FBI files. In other words, you reap what you \nsow, and it appears that the White House has sown some pretty bad seed \nin the Office of Personnel Security.\n  The point is that even if the White House did not plan this \noperation, it has established the kind of culture that allows and even \nencourages abuse of power to occur.\n  What do I mean by that? I mean an approach to Government that is \nfundamentally at odds with the concept of the limited central \nauthority. I mean an elitist view that casually accepts the misuse of \npower as long as the individuals involved are members of the\n\n[[Page S7362]]\n\npolitically correct circle driven by politically correct goals. I mean \nan environment where honor and character get lost somewhere in the \npolitical spin of the week.\n\n  It is not just Craig Livingstone or Anthony Marceca. In a previous \nWhite House, Republican or Democrat, those two would have been stopped \nwell before any confidential files were ever requested. In fact, \nsomeone like Mr. Livingstone, with his background and lack of \nprofessional credentials, simply would not have made it to any post in \nany other White House except this one.\n  Even the President's own party recognized the potential problems that \nthey are now having to live with. Former Senator Dennis DeConcini \nreviewed White House security operations 2 years previously and \nrecommended a number of changes, including getting a new chief of \nsecurity who was nonpartisan and professionally qualified.\n  That is a Democrat Senator saying to a Democrat White House: You have \na problem down there, and you ought to fix it so you do not have a \nproblem. Of course, he was ignored. But in a culture that rewards \npolitical gamesmanship, the most qualified individuals are those with \nthe greatest skills on outwitting the opposition. And in that culture, \nCraig Livingstone was not just adequate, he was an outstanding \ncandidate for the job. His fellow political operative, Anthony Marceca, \nwas an outstanding candidate for his assistant.\n  In that culture, it was no big deal to abuse the FBI and violate the \nprivacy rights of innocent citizens; just make sure you do it for the \nright reasons, make sure nobody can prove anything bad came of it. That \nis the name of the game in this White House, and I think all of this is \ngoing to show that is the kind of game Mr. Livingstone and Mr. Marceca \nwere part of.\n  You would think an administration that prides itself on dedication to \ncivil liberties would have shown a lot more concern about the so-called \nsnafu, if it really was any surprise at all. After all, we are not \ntalking about dropping by the local library and looking up some public \nofficial in ``Who's Who,'' or asking for an official biography on \nsomeone. These are highly confidential FBI files that can contain very \nembarrassing and even false information.\n  Senators cannot get these files. You and I would need a good, \nofficial reason, an authorization, and even then we would have to \nreview the files in a strictly controlled setting in the presence--let \nme repeat--in the presence of an FBI agent. You and I could not pick up \nthe phone and demand these files but for only official reasons, and \nthen if they were brought to us under those official reasons, that FBI \nperson would remain present so we would never be allowed to copy or \ntake notes from these files. Yet here these files were just dumped at \nthe White House, by all reports, and we have discovered that they were \naccessible to interns and others without security clearances.\n  Where are the White House civil libertarians, who should be raising \nthe roof about this breach of trust and this abuse of power? The \nConstitution is not self-enforcing. Our liberties require actual \ndefenders and actual champions. Yet, in the culture of the present \nadministration, this misconduct gets nothing more than labeled as a \nbureaucratic snafu?\n  How did Mr. Marceca's lawyer put it? He said his client's files \n``show a bureaucratic process being carried out by a bureaucrat * * *'' \nI guess we are supposed to assume that anything a bureaucrat does will \nbe OK because, after all, the Clinton administration's motives, of \ncourse, were beyond question, and whatever is done in advance of its \ngoals is, therefore, justifiable. Is that what the American people are \nbeing served up at this moment, and is that what they are expected to \naccept?\n  I do not buy that explanation. I hope no one listening will. Neither \ndoes a majority of the American people, I think. If you look at the \npolls, they are not buying it, thank goodness.\n  Let me repeat that. A majority of the American people do not believe \nthe official White House explanation, and that is despite the fact that \nthe media is doing its best to downplay the entire fiasco. Maybe the \nAmerican people realize that the bureaucracy is not a thing, it is \npeople, presumably officials, who are accountable to the public for \ntheir actions. Maybe they do not agree that supposedly noble motives of \nthe Clinton bureaucracy justify every action. No, I do not think \nthey believe that either. Or maybe this is just an implausible story, \nand maybe it is just one too many, story after story, spin after spin, \nthat has come out of this White House. Thank goodness the American \npeople are starting to disbelieve.\n\n  Let us not forget how we learned about these files, though, in the \nfirst place. While we are trying to understand the spin of false \ninformation, the House committee investigating the improper firing of \nBilly Dale and other White House travel officials or employees had to \nthreaten jail to the White House counsel in order to shake relevant \ndocuments loose. It had already been determined that these people had \nbeen fired in a false way. It was in those documents, which they had to \nthreaten the highest level of effort on the part of this Congress to \nget, that we discovered that Billy Dale's files were requested, and \nthat was only the beginning of an effort that uncovered all of this \nmuch larger request.\n  Originally, if you remember, Mr. President, we were told it was only \n300 files. Then, lo and behold, 400 files. And, my goodness, now it is \n700 files. Originally, we were told an outdated list was at the bottom \nof the bureaucratic snafu. Then we learned no such list could possibly \nhave been generated at the time through the normal resources.\n  We cannot find out for sure who hired Mr. Livingstone, and no one has \nyet to explain why this work on confidential files of Republican \nappointees and former National Security Council staff was given \npriority well beyond the publicized backlog of an unfinished check on \nsecurity clearances of hundreds of Clinton appointees. I must tell you, \nnone of it makes sense. None of their stories seem to fit. All of their \nstories are a bit different.\n  How, then, can Mr. Marceca take the fifth? Why would he take the \nfifth? Is it his own files he is concerned about? Something is wrong, \ndramatically wrong.\n  Mr. President, to their credit, members of the President's party have \ndenounced this as a clear abuse of power. ``Whose power, the \nPresident's?''\n  ``Well, of course not. Bill didn't know about it''--excuse me--``the \nPresident didn't know anything about this. It was somebody down the \nline.''\n  Let me suggest a culture, a style, a way of doing business in this \nWhite House that starts at the top. It starts with the President. He \nwas the one who said we will have the most ethical White House and the \nmost ethical administration in the history of our country.\n  Mr. President, you did not keep any of your campaign promises. This \nis one promise as a President that you have not kept either. This is a \nWhite House and an administration that is now ripped and torn with \ncontroversy. Now a hit list, a campaign list, to go after Republicans \nor anyone else who might get in their way. I am sorry, this one does \nnot wash. I think the American people recognize it does not wash, \neither.\n  I think it is time the White House comes clean. Obviously, I think it \nis time this administration, and maybe this President, tell us the \ntruth.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments made by the \nsenior Senator from Idaho. I think he has raised questions that clearly \nare on the mind of every American.\n  In one moment, I am going to yield up to 7 minutes to the senior \nSenator from South Carolina, but I am first going back to this very \ntelling editorial. I have been quoting it all afternoon. This is from \nthe Washington Post of July 3:\n\n       Not only was Mr. Livingstone professionally unqualified for \n     his job, but also his own background investigation raised \n     questions regarding his suitability to fill such a sensitive \n     position. Yet, when FBI background investigations on White \n     House employees arrived at the White House, they were \n     adjudicated by Mr. Livingstone, of all people, according to \n     his superior, Mr. Kennedy.\n  As has been raised by every speaker here this afternoon, the \nincongruities of a person with no security background holding this \nresponsibility and arbitrarily skimming through hundreds of personal \nrecords that he was\n\n[[Page S7363]]\n\nable to obtain from the FBI produces a series of formidable questions \nabout the integrity of our Government and our system and the rights of \nour individual citizens.\n  Mr. President, I yield up to 7 minutes at this time to the Senator \nfrom South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The senior Senator from South \nCarolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, it is appropriate that the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives continue to examine the troubling \ndevelopments recently uncovered at the White House. The American people \nhave a right to know the details and intentions of requests from the \nClinton administration to the FBI for hundreds and hundreds of \nsensitive background files on private citizens.\n  FBI Director Freeh has ordered new procedures to protect sensitive \nbackground material following unjustified and improper requests by the \nClinton White House for over 700 FBI background files. Director Freeh \nhas said that the White House had no justification for gathering these \nfiles and that the situation was an egregious violation of privacy. \nDirector Freeh said that the requests from President Clinton's \noperatives in many instances served no official purpose and at one \npoint he stated that the FBI had been victimized.\n  The White House has said that its collection of FBI files of private \ncitizens was an innocent mistake. That is their response before the \nfacts are examined and seems to reflect an instinctual reaction by the \nWhite House anytime questions arise concerning their operations. The \nfacts have yet to be fully examined and it strikes me as premature and \npolitically convenient to describe this situation as a ``bureaucratic \nsnafu.''\n  Initially, the White House would have us believe that Mr. Marceca was \na random detailee from the Army who had been arbitrarily selected to \nwork temporarily at the White House. We have since learned that Mr. \nMarceca--who along with Mr. Livingstone handled the sensitive files--is \nactually a seasoned Democrat political operative. They both have \nextensive political campaign experience. Mr. Marceca sought the post at \nthe White House to work with his friend, Mr. Livingstone, and officials \nin the White House counsel's office wrote to the Secretary of Defense \nrequesting his assignment.\n  Recently, we learned that Craig Livingstone--who was the White House \npersonnel security director--boasted on his resume that he staged \ncounter- \nevents for President Clinton during the 1992 Presidential campaign. \nEarlier, we learned that his experience in personnel security was \nlimited to his work with President and Mrs. Clinton's Hollywood \nproducer friends during the Inaugural activities. Clearly, Craig \nLivingstone was not qualified to serve as the head of the White House \npersonnel security office.\n  The one thing we have yet to learn is who hired Craig Livingstone. No \none takes credit for his employment. Although a retired FBI agent says \nthat he was told by White House counsel that Mrs. Clinton wanted him in \nthat position. Mrs. Clinton has denied being responsible.\n  At one point senior Presidential adviser, George Stephanopoulos, \npraised Craig Livingstone saying he was the man to see whenever you \nwanted anything done. Lately, Mr. Stephanopolous has said he does not \nknow Livingstone that well, has only seen him around. The Washington \nPost has referred to Craig Livingstone as a phantom appointment. In a \nJune 28 editorial, the Washington Post went on to say,\n\n       At this stage, nobody at the White House will claim credit \n     for Craig Livingstone. It gets you wondering whether there \n     are other people working in sensitive spots in the White \n     House who are, well, just there, and whose hiring cannot be \n     accounted for . . . So people just walk in off the street, \n     sit down at a desk and send for files--or what?\n\n  Mr. President, as you know, we are at this point because the White \nHouse only recently turned over documents pursuant to a long-ago \nsubpoena from the House Oversight Committee. Within the documents \nsubmitted, the House Oversight Committee found a White House request to \nthe FBI for sensitive background files on Billy Ray Dale. The request \nfor FBI background on Mr. Dale was dated 7 months after he had been \nwrongly fired as head of the White House Travel Office. It was only \nafter this was discovered by the House Oversight Committee did the \nWhite House admit it had collected FBI reports on hundreds of private \ncitizens.\n  Mr. President, it is important that hearings continue because right \nnow we have more questions than answers. The American people demand \naccountability. The American people want to know what right Clinton \nadministration officials have to request hundreds upon hundreds of \nsensitive FBI files on private citizens. What were they doing with this \ninformation? This latest troubling development within the Clinton \nadministration represents a dangerous practice and one that deserves \ncareful scrutiny. It is my hope that we will continue to examine this \nmatter and uncover all of the facts for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield up to 15 minutes to the \ndistinguished assistant majority leader, the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from Georgia \nfor his leadership today and many times on the floor.\n  The issue I am going to address today is not one that I enjoy, but it \nis one about which, I think, the American people are entitled to the \nfacts. I want to read a quote that was made in January 1993 by \nPresident Clinton:\n\n       I promise the most ethical administration in the history of \n     the Republic.\n\n  January 24, 1993, quoted in the Washington Post.\n  This administration has been anything but ethical. As a matter of \nfact, there has been a litany, a continuation of scandals that have \nbeen plaguing this administration. Some people say they are much to do \nabout nothing. I disagree. I am afraid some of these scandals are quite \nserious. A lot are serious violations of the law, if they turn out to \nbe proven true. Let me touch on a couple of them.\n  Probably the most famous one is Whitewater. I heard a reporter \nsaying, ``Well, there is not a whole lot of substance to that.'' Yet, \nthe Governor of Arkansas lost his job over Whitewater. There must have \nbeen some substance to the allegations.\n  Obstruction of justice is against the law, and there were reports \nthat were subpoenaed that took over 2 years to surface, and they \nsurfaced adjacent to Mrs. Clinton's quarters, or in her library, which \nhad very limited access. Obstruction of justice is against the law, and \nthose files just recently somehow appeared.\n  There is information in Vincent Foster's office that dealt with tax \nreturns and dealt with Whitewater and dealt with a lot of different \nthings that, again, mysteriously disappeared for months. Reports are \nthat they were actually in the personal quarters of President and Mrs. \nClinton. Those are serious violations of the law if they are \nobstructing justice, obstruction of the investigation of Mr. Foster's \ndeath.\n  A lot of other things have come to light. I will just run through a \nlitany of them very quickly. In the book ``Blood Sport,'' Mr. Stewart \ntalked about the Clinton's deducting $20,000 in a principal payment. I \nthink everyone knows that you deduct interest; you cannot deduct \nprincipal. My son is 26 years old. He recently purchased a townhouse. \nHe knows you deduct interest; you cannot deduct principal. Yet you had \na Rhodes scholar and an attorney, the President and Mrs. Clinton, and \nthey deducted $20,000 or more in principal. That is a violation of law. \nThat is tax evasion, and that is wrong.\n  Consider Mrs. Clinton's profits that were made from a $1,000 \ninvestment in cattle futures or commodity trading that grew to $100,000 \nin 10 months, that defies probability. I heard some people say that the \nchances of that happening are one out of a billion. It is not possible. \nCertainly it looks corrupt. Again, I remember President Clinton's \nspeech in 1992. He said, ``The decade of greed is over.'' But yet you \nsee this type of thing going on.\n  There is a trial in Arkansas right now where two bankers are accused \nof illegally getting $53,500 in cash for the Clinton campaign. I heard \nPresident\n\n[[Page S7364]]\n\nClinton is not on trial. I have not heard anybody say, ``Well, what \nwere they doing with $53,000 in cash?'' Every person in this room that \nhas run a campaign--we all have campaigns, and maybe you need a couple \nhundred dollars in cash every once in awhile, maybe. But you do not \nneed $53,000 in cash for anything that is legal. I have not heard that \nquestion being asked. Maybe it was legal. Maybe it is legal to take \n$10,000 in cash and distribute it around the State, or $50,000. But I \ncannot imagine it.\n  To me it sounds very unethical. Yet that trial is going on today on \nwhether or not the funds were laundered, and what his involvement was, \nand whether jobs were involved quid pro quo for exchange of those kinds \nof contributions. But why in the world would somebody have $53,000 in \ncash? I have run three statewide campaigns. I do not know that we ever \nhad $1,000 in cash. I cannot imagine $53,000.\n  They knew they were breaking the law, a community of individuals did, \nwhen they were withdrawing the money from the bank because they tried \nto hide it. So they knew there was some risk. But somebody in the \ncampaign wanted a lot of cash. That is directly related to, at that \ntime, Governor Clinton.\n  Now, Mr. President, we get into this scandal, this latest one, \nFilegate. What brought some of that about? Travelgate and the fact that \nseven members of the travel office of the White House were fired. I \nhave always said they had a right to put in their own people, but they \ndid not have a right to call in the FBI to try to justify an abuse of \npower by firing them and then prosecuting Billy Dale. Billy Dale's FBI \nfile was requested 7 months after he was fired. That is a real abuse of \npower.\n  They did not need the FBI file then, yet they requested the file on \nhim and hundreds of others, maybe several hundred. And 408 was the \nnumber that people are using now. Originally, it was a couple hundred, \nthen 400. Now we find maybe another 300, maybe Mr. Marceca had several \nhundred others. Maybe well over 1,000 files the White House had on \nindividuals. But the FBI files were certainly an abuse of power. The \n408 were almost all on Republicans. So if it was not political, why \nwere they only investigating Republicans? Why were they investigating \nindividuals who had not had access to the White House in over a year or \nlonger?\n  These files were requested in December 1993 and early 1994, all upon \nRepublicans who left the White House at least a year earlier. These \nwere for permanent access to the White House so they would have open \naccess to come and go as you please. The individuals whose FBI files \nwere collected did not need permanent access to the White House. They \ncould get a visitor's pass like anybody here can. If you go visit the \nWhite House or if you have a special guest, you get a pass for a day. \nYou do not need an FBI background check for a visitor's pass. But a \nbackground check was requested by the White House for these at least \n408 individuals.\n\n  This is a real abuse of power. A real abuse of power. Maybe an \negregious abuse of power. It is particularly egregious that the White \nHouse requested the FBI file on Billy Dale whom they previously fired. \nYet, not only did they fire him, but they prosecuted him and persecuted \nhim and wanted to try to justify their firing of him. They did not have \na good reason to fire him except maybe to replace him with some \ncronies. So they tried to justify their firing of him by pulling in the \nFBI. That is an abuse of power, and certainly should be reviewed.\n  But when we find out now that they requested the files of 408 others, \nand they were in the hands of not national security people, they were \nin the hands of Mr. Livingstone and Mr. Marceca, two people who would \nbe charitably defined as political hacks, hatchet men, people who \nwanted to dig up dirt on opponents, and did that in past campaigns, and \nhad access to private files which could destroy the lives and careers \nof individuals, that is unbelievable. And it happened, happened in this \nadministration. For President Clinton to say it was a bureaucratic \nsnafu I think belittles the intelligence of the American people.\n  Mr. President, when Senators receive an FBI file--it is done very \nseldom. I have only done it a couple times, a few times. Any time I \nhave had an FBI file in my office, that FBI file has also been \naccompanied by an FBI agent or a staff member with particular security \nclearance. That file does not leave the presence of the FBI agent or \nthat staff member with special clearance. I cannot Xerox it. I cannot \nphotocopy it. I cannot take notes from it. I cannot do anything with \nit. I cannot pick somebody and say, here is what it says. I can read it \nand hand it back. That file does not leave the presence of an FBI agent \nor that special staff member.\n  That file, when it leaves my office, is returned to a locked vault. \nIt is not obtainable or accessible by anyone. To think that the White \nHouse obtained hundreds and evidently were trying to get hundreds more, \nhad those in not a secure area, not in an area that was protected, \nunder the control of a couple of political hacks, for whatever reason, \nis really not acceptable. We would not have found out this information \nif it had not been for the House of Representatives and their \nthreatening contempt-of-Congress action against this administration.\n  So, Mr. President, it is with real regret, but when I read the \nPresident's quote of January 4, 1993, which says, ``I promise the most \nethical administration in the history of the Republic,'' I just laugh. \nThis may be the most unethical administration. It certainly brings back \ncomparisons to Watergate and the Nixon administration. But this \nadministration may even exceed some of the abuses of power that \ntranspired at that time. I do not say that lightly. It is with real \nregret.\n  Mr. President, I just urge the White House to begin cooperating, as \nthe President said that he would. They have yet to date to release all \ninformation that the House committee has requested. We still do not \nknow who hired Mr. Livingstone. We do not know what are in the files \nMr. Marceca has. Mr. Marceca has taken the fifth. He refused to testify \nbefore a Senate committee. That is his right to do so. Maybe the White \nHouse should encourage him, ``No, don't take the fifth. Go ahead and \ntell everything you know. Release the information. Let's see what was \non your disc that has all this information on Republicans, and so on. \nLet the information come out. Let's find out the truth.''\n  Let us find out the truth on Mrs. Clinton's commodity trading. How \ndid she make a profit that goes from $1,000 to $100,000 in 10 months? \nWe need to find out answers to that. What did happen to the billing \nrecords or to the Rose Law Firm Whitewater billing records that were in \nthe White House for 2 years?\n  We need answers to these questions. I heard Mr. Clinton say, ``I hope \nwe find out the answers.'' But the White House really has not \ncooperated. Certainly, they have not been the most ethical \nadministration in the history of the Republic. Quite the contrary, they \nmay be the most unethical administration in the history of the \nRepublic. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. In just a moment I am going to yield, but I first want \nto thank the assistant majority leader for the contributions he has \nmade in the grave questions that are hanging over Washington here \ntoday. As usual he has done it in an exemplary manner.\n  I am going to read one more quote, and then I am going to yield to \nthe Senator from Idaho. This is in the Washington Post, Wednesday, July \n3. It says:\n\n       It doesn't get any better with Anthony Marceca, the on-loan \n     Army civilian who improperly requisitioned and reviewed more \n     than 700 FBI files. Mr. Marceca, it now turns out, wasn't \n     retained at the White House following his 6-month stint. \n     Again from Mr. Kennedy's deposition: ``Tony's background had \n     come in, and there were some problems revealed with it that \n     made me think it might be better if he kind of went back to \n     where he was.'' And Mr. Marceca did. But he returned to Mr. \n     Livingstone's White House office long enough, reportedly, \n     to gain unauthorized access to his own FBI file, which \n     enabled him to sue two sources he believed provided \n     negative testimony against him. What a pair.\n\n  So the Washington Post is saying. What a pair Tony Marceca and Mr. \nLivingstone have turned out to be. It is beyond comprehension that \nthese people\n\n[[Page S7365]]\n\nwould be at the center of security in the White House of the United \nStates of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Senator from Georgia for his efforts \ntoday. Mr. President, I will address this issue from the aspect of the \ntype of security and sensitivity that surrounds an individual FBI file, \nFederal Bureau of Investigation. I come at it as a member of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee.\n  From time to time, it was my responsibility to review the FBI file of \na nominee who would be coming forward for Senate confirmation. When I \nreview that file, it would be done in the privacy of my office. No \nstaff members were allowed to be present. Those are the rules under \nwhich we must operate. The individual bringing the sealed file over--in \nthis case, it would be from the White House general counsel, or it \ncould be an FBI agent--remains in the room with the individual Senator \nas we review this extremely sensitive material.\n  Now, what type of material is in there? It can include the tax \ninformation of the person that has been reviewed, the personal finances \nback just as far as you want to go, the credit histories of the \nindividual. If you had some problems in the past with your credit, if \nyou had some areas that have been a problem, they are identified. The \ninternational travel which you have taken: Where have you been, why \nwere you there, who did you see? The education, of course, including \nyour college and high school grades; your work history; your health.\n  I spoke to a highly successful professional who has had to have an \nFBI file constructed on his behalf only to have him contacted and \nasked, ``Well, have you had a mental disorder in the past, in fact, at \nthe age of 18?'' This individual has to think and say, ``Well, at one \ntime I went in and because of stress that we were going through, work \nrelated,'' the individual is a workaholic, the physician had put down \nmental exhaustion. Is that what is recorded, then, as a mental disorder \nin this file?\n  How many Americans would like to have interviews conducted among \ntheir neighbors and among their coworkers and friends, again, for as \nmany years back? Do you think perhaps somewhere in that history there \nis somebody that may have a beef, somebody that maybe does not think \nyou are just as good as others may think you are? They can share that, \nand none of these have to be corroborated or substantiated, but they go \ninto those files. That is how sensitive this material is.\n  Now, I have described for you the process that an individual Member \nof the Senate goes through when called upon to review an FBI file, one \nfile. Now, how in the world do we make this quantum jump that someone \nwho was a political operative, that nobody in the White House can now \ndetermine whoever hired this person, can call up the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, probably one of the most highly regarded law enforcement \nagencies of the entire world, to have some political operative call the \nFBI and say, ``I want these files.'' Not just one file, two files, but \nas has been substantiated, hundreds of files, hundreds of files.\n\n  If I were a member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, I would \nfeel that my entire credibility was being questioned, that this sort of \npolitical operation has somehow clouded over that law enforcement \nagency. I believe that not only does it question the credibility of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, but I think it has created an enormous \ncloud over the people's house, the White House of the United States of \nAmerica, where political operatives have access to those files of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, and nobody knows how it happened or \nhow that person was hired. Yet, that person is the director of \npersonnel security for the White House. Something is wrong. Something \nis very, very wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho. I think \nhe has added a very important ingredient. While many citizens, I think, \nunderstand how sensitive the FBI files are by their nature, that it is \na collection of truth and gospel, nevertheless, recorded in the files, \nhe has hit on a very sensitive nerve, that by discussing what is on the \ninside of those files he is telling all American citizens how very, \nvery sensitive these files are and how damaging they can be, and for \nthose reasons the FBI has traditionally guarded these files jealously, \nwhich is why I will refer to that in a minute, why Director Freeh is so \ndisturbed about circumstances that have occurred here. I thank the \nSenator from Idaho.\n  Mr. President, I have been in the mood to quote newspapers here this \nafternoon. I have a copy of today's Washington Times. It has a \nphotograph of the Vice President announcing his bid for President in \n1988. The heading is, ``Oh, That Guy: The Controversy Surrounding \nFilegate Will Undoubtedly Intensify This Week as Congress Reconvenes \nAfter the Fourth of July Recess.'' It goes on to say that the Vice \nPresident doesn't recall much about his 1988 campaign as it relates to \nMr. Livingstone. He does offer that the advance man performed well in \nhis duties, but the picture is most interesting because it is the Vice \nPresident and Mrs. Gore, one other fellow, and Mr. Livingstone, right, \nfront and center.\n  Mr. President, in the testimony that we have heard this morning or \nthe statements that have been made time and time again, we refer to the \nnumber of files, which, as I said, went from 300 to 400 to 600 to 700, \nand now I have seen a figure of 900. I believe, as important as the \ndiscussion is about what was going on at the White House, is the \nquestion, what was going on at the Federal Bureau of Investigation?\n  I cite in this June 14 for immediate release from the Office of the \nDirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation: ``The FBI inquiry has \nalso discovered Director Freeh said that the White House has identified \n408 files sought and received by the White House without jurisdiction. \nFreeh said those files had been voluntarily surrendered by the White \nHouse to the FBI,'' and it goes on with a series of numbers.\n  My question is, after intense ``inquiry'' of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, how is it that the number of files certified by the FBI \nthat were turned over to the White House is not the right number? One \nwould think after ordering sweeping new measures to protect sensitive \nbackground investigation files and an inquiry in the FBI itself that by \nnow there would be no question as to the number of files that had been \nobtained by the White House from the FBI.\n  I hope that the appropriate committees of jurisdiction will pursue \nanswers from the FBI as to how in the world, given the long history and \nthe depth of the sensitivity of these files, how in the world a siren \nwould not go off by the time you had gotten to hundreds and hundreds of \nthese files leaving the FBI.\n  I want to read another statement or two from this report, and then I \nam going to yield my time back. I know the Senator from Virginia is \nanxious to do a statement in morning business. I will not be but a \nminute or two longer.\n\n       It is important to note, Director Freeh said, that the FBI \n     report contains this finding on the files requested by and \n     given to the White House. Among the unquestionably \n     unjustified acquisitions were reports relating to discharged \n     travel office employees, Billy Ray Dale and Barnaby Brasseux. \n     Director Freeh ordered the inquiry on learning a week ago \n     that the White House requested and received a background file \n     of Dale, a former White House travel director, months after \n     he was fired. This does not sound like an arbitrary \n     bureaucratic error, particularly in light of the difficulties \n     the White House has had with Mr. Dale.\n       The FBI inquiry was expanded when it was learned that the \n     White House earlier--the Clinton administration--also \n     requested and received a large number of files on officials \n     in the previous Bush administration and other persons. In \n     addition, the FBI learned the White House requested and \n     received the FBI file on a second discharged travel employee, \n     Brasseux.\n\n  I am reading directly from the material given to the public by the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation.\n  It says:\n\n       In the past, the FBI routinely filled White House requests \n     for copies of previous background files without checking to \n     see if there were pending criminal investigations of the \n     subject. Under new procedures, there will be checks on all \n     subjects to determine if there are criminal investigations. \n     Director Freeh said it is now clear that the system was very \n     vulnerable to misuse and that government officials, over \n     several decades, including himself, had not provided adequate \n     oversight of the system, resulting now in violations of \n     privacy.\n\n  In addition, Mr. President, we currently have letters from the House\n\n[[Page S7366]]\n\ncommittee chairman on ways and means to the Internal Revenue \nDepartment, IRS, the Commissioner, to determine if any of the data with \nregard to confidential tax matters is in this material, because if it \nis, that is a felony. Thorough clarification should be forthcoming from \nthe Internal Revenue Service to comfort us that none of this \ninformation that was so willy-nilly distributed throughout the White \nHouse found its way into their hands, including material from the \nInternal Revenue Service.\n  So, as has been demonstrated here this afternoon, there are a host of \nlegitimate questions that have deep meaning with regard to the \nprotection of the rights of individual citizens in these United States \nof America.\n  Mr. President, with that, I conclude my remarks and yield back any \ntime remaining that was dedicated to my control.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Robb and Mr. Moynihan pertaining to the \nsubmission of Senate Resolution 276 are located in today's Record under \n``Submissions of concurrent and Senate resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/08/senate-section/article/S7358-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FAREWELL TO PATTY DEUTSCHE\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to say farewell to my \nlegislative assistant, Patty Deutsche. She has been with me for over 7 \nyears and I will certainly miss her.\n  She arrived in my office with almost no knowledge of Montana but \nquickly became one of us. It did not take long for her to figure out \nthat 60 miles on a map did not necessarily mean a car ride of 60 \nminutes. And since she began as my scheduler, that was important. She \nran my life for 2 years--both in the office and on the road--and made \nmy new life in Washington, DC, that much easier.\n  When she moved to the legislative side, I knew she would attack the \nissues with just as much energy and competence. Though the issues she \nhandled fell under committees on which I did not serve, they tended to \nbe the hot topics. From health care to welfare, Medicare to Social \nSecurity, small business to labor unions, veterans and the aging to \nabortion, education and family issues--she learned the issues, knew \nthem well, and was always my dependable source when I needed an update. \nShe had her finger on the pulse here in the District of Columbia and \nher finger on the pulse in Montana and I know my constituents \nappreciated that and benefited from that.\n  Being a Californian in Montana is not easy, but she was quickly \naccepted by even the most ardent Montana natives. They never had an \nopportunity to question her loyalties. She worked for Montana and \nMontana's residents as if it were her own home State.\n  After 5 years handling these many legislative issues, she has \naccomplished a lot. She has been instrumental in promoting rural health \ncare, from the fight over health care reform in 1994 to the promotion \nof telemedicine. She has helped me fight for small businesses--and that \nis crucial to my State. And she has always been a voice of reason when \nit comes to questions of morals, ethics, family values, and what is \nright. I have teased her about being to the right of Attila, but I \nalways knew I could count on her opinion to be well thought out, \nstrong, and conservative.\n  But aside from her tremendous dedication to her work, her sense of \nhumor will be missed. She brought levity to stressful times. Her \ncounseling chair was always available, not just to me but to other \nstaff as well. Whether providing an open ear, objective advice or a \nfunny story, Patty managed to find time for others as well as get her \nwork done.\n  Mr. President, longevity is not the norm on the Hill and keeping \nstaff as long as 7 years is rare. I have been lucky to have Patty on my \nstaff almost since I first arrived in town. And though I will miss her \nterribly, she knows she will always have a home here and in Montana. \nShe is moving to Louisville, KY, to be the manager of government \nrelations for Vencor, Inc. And I hope they realize what a treasure they \nare getting in Patty. I have no doubt that she will embrace her new job \nand that Louisville will embrace her.\n  Patty Deutsche has served me well and she has served Montana well. I \nknow the folks with whom she has built relationships in the Big Sky \nCountry will feel her absence, but Patty is the type that will continue \nto nurture those relationships, whether she represents Montana or not. \nThat is just the way she is.\n  Today is her last day working for me and she will soon leave for \nKentucky. I wish her the best of luck and all the happiness in the \nworld. God bless you, Patty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/08/senate-section/article/S7366-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, at the appropriate place in the Record, I \nwill introduce the statement that does a line-by-line analysis of that \nso that the Members will have that information before them.\n  Mr. President, I want to just take a moment of the Senate's time to \nrespond to a letter that was written by my friend, the majority leader, \nSenator Lott, to President Clinton differing with the President on his \nposition with regard to the minimum wage. This letter was made \navailable this afternoon and distributed to the members of the press \nand to the interested Members. I want to take just a moment of time to \nmake some rather brief comments about the letter because I am somewhat \namazed at the letter and its conclusion.\n  I will include the whole letter in the Record.\n  Mr. President, in paragraph 1 Senator Lott points out:\n\n       It is, of course, dismaying that you regard a measure to \n     protect small businesses from the job killing consequences of \n     the minimum wage as a poison pill.\n\n  What we have tried to do in the course of the earlier debate is to \npoint out what the impact would be of the increase in the minimum wage \nwhich the President, Senator Daschle, myself, and others support.\n  In the earlier part of the day we put in the Record the Salomon Bros. \nestimate. I just quote their first paragraph.\n\n       We believe that many retailers, especially discounters, \n     would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage due to the \n     enhanced purchasing power you create for many low-income \n     consumers.\n\n  Their basic point is that it would enhance the economy.\n  The article I included in there from Business Week, the minimum wage \nargument you have not heard before:\n\n       As long as it's not overdone, lifting the minimum wage may \n     create overall economic gains that outweigh any short-term \n     job losses.\n\n  That is an excellent article in Business Week.\n  I also included the excellent Wharton School analysis that was done \nearlier in this year with regard to job loss. Their estimate is that \nthe total job loss may be as little as 20,000 jobs nationwide--\neffectively de minimis when we see the growth of 10 million jobs over \nthe period of the last 4 years. They have also pointed out that under \nthe current proposal the inflation rise would be one-tenth of 1 \npercent. While in 1996 and 1997 over the longer term the impact would \nbe nil, virtually no inflation. One-tenth of 1 percent would mean that \nwhat you pay $1,000 for you pay $1,001 for. So that is the economic \nimpact on this.\n  I also referred to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, their \nwhole statement which I have included in the Record, three Nobel \nlaureates, some of the most distinguished economists in the country. \nSpecifically, the proposed income in the minimum wage over a 2-year \nperiod falls within the range of alternatives from the overall effects \nin the labor market, and the effect on workers and the economy would be \npositive.\n  So I just hope those who are opposed to the position of Senator \nDaschle, myself, and others who support the minimum wage, would come \nout here and justify their position as being the job killing \nconsequences.\n  Then they talk about election-year politics and the administration \npolicies. All we say is we have been trying to get this up for over a \nyear and a half. It was not the Democrats who have made this a measure \nthat is up in July prior to the November election. We have been trying \nto get this up for over a year and a half.\n  The second paragraph goes on to talk about ``Your chief counsel for \nadvocacy on Small Business Administration supports the exemption \napplying to small businesses grossing under $500,000 a year, precisely \nwhat Senator Bond's amendment would provide.''\n  That is a completely inaccurate statement. Our program continues the \nexisting exemption on those under $500,000 with the exception of those \nthat are involved in interstate commerce. That is what the President's \nposition is. We want to keep that provision. So Senator Bond's \namendment would dramatically change that. That is not a fair reflection \nof what the Small Business Administration Administrator has suggested, \nor Secretary Reich has suggested.\n  Then the next paragraph: ``Similarly, you claim such exemption would \ninclude two-thirds of all firms in the U.S. as if they employ two-\nthirds of all workers.''\n  Of course, there is no such claim in the President's letter. So I do \nnot know what they are referring to.\n  Senator Bond advises me that the labor statistics data show that only \n3 percent of all workers are paid the minimum wage, and that only 8 \npercent of our Nation's work force are employed by businesses grossing \nless than $500,000. That is exactly what we said. If you take 8 percent \nof $126 million, you come out with $8.6 million.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics has talked between 9.7 and 10, which \nwould include not only the hourly but the salaried workers. There is \nsome spillover, some relationship. But if they want to settle for 8.6 \nmillion on that, I am glad to accept those figures at 9 million, \nreferring to that particular provision of the program. That represents \nabout 2 million children that will be affected, whose parent is the \nprincipal supplier for resources of that family.\n  As we mentioned earlier in the debate, this is an issue about \nchildren. It is an issue about women. It is an issue about fairness. It \nis an issue about the economy certainly. But when we talk about \nhundreds of thousands of children, I find it unpersuasive to state that \nnumber to be a relatively small share of the economy. Those 8, 10, or \n12 million American children whose lives are going to be affected, the \n300,000 who will come out of poverty, the children from over 100,000 \nfamilies. I think it means something to those families. I would take \nissue with this attitude.\n  Finally, it continues:\n\n       What Senator Bond has done is to propose a way to keep the \n     current floor of the minimum wage for everybody.\n\n  Of course, that is not what it has done. It has what they call a 180-\nday opportunity wage. As I mentioned earlier in this discussion, this \nwill be about 40 percent of all minimum wage workers who move or get \nanother minimum wage job over the course of the year. And this, of \ncourse, will be an invitation to those employers to get rid of their \nworkers after 6 months so they can get somebody else in there for the \nnext 6 months. They will only have to pay them $4.25 and not the \nlivable wage of $5.15.\n  So if you take the carveout on the opportunity wage, you take the \ncarveout in the Bond amendment for small business, and you also take \nthe carveout on the restaurant workers, It does not keep the current \nfloor for everyone. The tip-credit provision will prevent the minimum \nwage increase for tip-employees at restaurants so they are only \nrequired to pay $2.13 an hour--that is a special provision for the \nrestaurants even though the profits of that business have gone up over \nthe period of the last 3 or 4 years.\n  So it finally ends up:\n\n       To veto the legislation over a measure so modest will be \n     difficult to explain to the American people and the millions \n     of small businessmen and women. I urge you to reconsider.\n\n  My only point, Mr. President, is that we hope our Republican friends \nwould have the similar attitude of Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, \nand George Bush, all who supported an increase in the minimum wage and \nthe overwhelming majority of Republicans, including Bob Dole in 1989 \nand Speaker Gingrich, that supported the increase in the minimum wage \nwhen our economy was not nearly as robust and secure.\n  This again comes down to an issue of equity and fairness. It comes \ndown to whether we are going to honor work. Are we going to say to men \nand women who work hard, play by the rules, work 40 hours a week, 52 \nweeks of the year, they deserve a livable wage. Republicans and \nDemocrats over the length and the history of this program have \nsupported that position.\n  I find it extraordinary once again that the same forces, the same \nvoices,\n\n[[Page S7404]]\n\nthe same old, tired arguments that were used against Social Security, \nused against the Medicare Program, have been used against the minimum \nwage. We are hearing those same tired, old arguments again.\n  I hope that tomorrow, when the Senate has an opportunity to act on \nit, we will say to American working families that we honor work. We \nmust say that this is one of the best ways to get welfare reform. We \nmust say to those working families who are trying to provide for \nthemselves and for their children that we believe in them and that the \nmembers of the Senate will support a livable minimum wage increase.\n  I again thank my colleague and friend from New York for the \nopportunity to make these observations.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Could I just say that the present reports on the \nunemployment rate at 5.3 percent and the increasing reports of labor \nshortages around the country mean if ever there was a moment in which \nto make this appropriate adjustment, maintaining the value of the \nminimum wage, this is the moment. And the Senator from Massachusetts \ncould not be more congratulated, in my view, for the energy with which \nhe has pressed it. Let us hope tomorrow we pass it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, if I may just respond to the minimum \nwage debate without addressing any of the particular amendments. I \ncertainly hope the argument I make will not be viewed as just another \ntired, old argument, because I believe it is not a question of whether \nwe raise the minimum wage--I think most in this Chamber would believe \nthe minimum wage should be increased--but how it is done.\n  I have felt for some time that we need to be very sensitive to the \nchanges that are taking place in the labor markets, including the need \nfor higher skills. These are things that we hopefully have addressed \nwith the job training initiatives that we have considered in the \nSenate, and have now been in conference for some months. Those \ninitiatives are the things that will help workers get good-paying jobs.\n  We have also talked about welfare reform, and the senior Senator from \nNew York knows this issue better than anyone. We need--I believe, if we \nare going to do welfare reform in a meaningful way--to have job \nopportunities where workers can enter at entry level positions and be \nable to have the training and the skills to rise in the labor market.\n  I would not want to make the argument that a family can live on $4.25 \nper hour, which is the current minimum wage, or at $5.15 per hour, \nwhich it would be after the next 2 years. But, that is not really the \npoint. The point is, we need to see that young people and those \nreentering the labor market are able to have the opportunity to develop \nthe discipline and the skills that they need in a changing workplace \nwith the demands of a high technology environment.\n  So we need to think carefully as we debate about this increase, which \nin some ways may not seem large. Many States, including, I believe, New \nYork State, have a State minimum wage higher than the $5.15 we are \ntalking about as the Federal minimum wage. New York may need a higher \nwage to attract workers into the workplace than, say, Kansas. We have \nvery different needs in our urban areas versus our rural areas.\n  That is why I would argue we really should not increase the Federal \nminimum wage but allow for this diversity among the States to take \nplace. The Federal minimum wage should, perhaps, be a target, allowing \nStates to set the wage level that they believe is important to attract \na work force that will benefit their State and their businesses as well \nas those entering the work force.\n  I want to be clear. I have not supported this increase in the minimum \nwage. I oppose it because I think it is the wrong time for us to \npotentially shut off job opportunities for those we are suggesting move \noff welfare rolls. If we pass Federal legislation--and many States have \nalready passed significant welfare reform--individuals will need entry \nlevel jobs in which they can begin to progress back up the ladder in \nthe work force.\n  I think increasing the minimum wage will raise the lowest rung on the \neconomic ladder and thus potentially leave behind those just trying to \ngain a foothold either for their first job or going back in and \nretraining for another type of job. Although well-intended, this \nincrease--I believe--will cause a loss of entry level jobs and will \nlimit job opportunities for low-skilled workers. This, I would suggest, \nwill not help raise living standards for the poor, and that is really \nwhat we wish to see happen.\n  That is why I feel so strongly about the need to have some really \nvery innovative, thought-through, carefully designed job training \ninitiatives. We also have to give a greater emphasis in our educational \nsystem, which is really the foundation, to being able to enter a work \nforce with a good-paying job that can support a family as we move into \na new age of technology that we are facing--a revolution really of \ntechnology today and into the next century.\n  Let me just give you an example. Last December, the Senate labor \ncommittee held a hearing on the minimum wage. We heard from a small \nrestaurant chain owner named Kenneth James who took his first job in \nhigh school in the restaurant business and now runs a restaurant chain \nthat employees 160 people. He testified that he will have fewer workers \nin his restaurants if we increase the minimum wage.\n\n  Due to competition, he and other restaurant employers cannot raise \nprices and pass the costs along to consumers. The big loser, as I said \nearlier, will be those low-skilled workers who are never hired for \ntheir first job. They are the ones I think we need to be concerned \nabout.\n  Mr. James estimated that each of his restaurants would have three \nfewer workers if we raise the minimum wage as proposed. That argument \ncan be refuted. How do we really know? But I think we have already seen \nmany changes that have occurred. For example, when one pumps her own \ngas or when one takes care of his own tray at fast food restaurants. \nAll of these things have entered into ways we see businesses changing.\n  I do not know what the answer is, but I am concerned we are doing \nthis now at a time when we are putting more and more people, because of \nwelfare reform initiatives, out into the marketplace without the \nnecessary skills. Skills that will allow them to have the good-paying \njobs that should be had without the training for work that they have \nnot had. They will need entry-level wages. They will need those, \nwhether they are first-time job-seekers or whether they have not been \nworking for a number of years and need to get back into the work force.\n  If we want to develop the highly skilled work force and employ more \nyoung men and women and move people off the welfare rolls, we need to \nopen more doors so individuals can get the basic skills that will \nenable them to climb the job ladder. Raising the minimum wage will \nonly, I think, shut the door on those trying to get started.\n  The Congressional Budget Office reviewed this proposed increase and \nreached a similar conclusion. CBO estimates that raising the minimum \nwage will result in the loss of potentially 100,000 to 500,000 jobs. \nAccording to CBO:\n\n       Another consequence might be that employers respond to the \n     mandate by reducing employment opportunities for the least \n     skilled job seekers and the ones who could most benefit from \n     the work experience. To the extent that low-skilled workers \n     are shut out of employment opportunities, their total incomes \n     might fall, even though their hourly wage rates while working \n     increased.\n\n  CBO concludes that this minimum wage increase will be an unfunded \nmandate on State and local governments, as well as the private sector. \nIt estimates the cost to the private sector will be more than $12 \nbillion over the next 5 years.\n  Someone has to pay this cost, and I fear that the most vulnerable \nwill pay the price in lost jobs. That, I suggest, is something we \nshould consider carefully as we debate the question, not of whether the \nminimum wage should be increased, but how.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7405]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, there are 2 hours reserved for debate on \nthe minimum wage aspect of this bill, is that not the case?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from New York \nthat there is 1 hour on the Kennedy amendment, equally divided, and 1 \nhour on the bill, equally divided.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I ask the Chair, we have only 2 hours of debate on \nthis entire matter?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be correct.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That is divided on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Equally to each side.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I ask the distinguished Senator from Maryland how much \ntime he might wish to speak.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I see the Senator from North Dakota on the floor as \nwell. Ten minutes?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I will be happy to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMaryland. I see the distinguished chair of the committee has risen.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I want to suggest the time I took \nshould come out of the time allotted to our side in opposition, of \ncourse.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. How generous and characteristic. Opposition to the \namendment.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I assume that will be the case.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Senator will support the bill itself that Senator \nRoth and I are bringing forward for this purpose.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kennedy \namendment and, of course, in very strong support of the effort to raise \nthe minimum wage. Historically, Congress has acted to guarantee minimum \nstandards of decency for working Americans. The object of a Federal \nminimum wage is to make work pay well enough to keep families out of \npoverty and off of Government assistance. It is really an effort to \nensure that any individual who works hard and plays by the rules should \nbe assured of a standard of living for his or her family that is above \nthe poverty line.\n  It is very important to understand that this effort to provide a \nfloor has marked our national policy now for almost six decades. I know \nmany people think it is an imposition upon employers, but we had some \ninteresting testimony this morning at a news conference from some small \nbusiness people who came and testified in favor of the minimum wage. As \none of the ladies who was there pointed out, they are caught by what \ntheir competitors do. Many of them would like to raise the wages of \ntheir workers of their own accord, but they have difficulty in doing \nthis if their competitors do not do likewise. So they welcome a raise \nin the minimum wage because it, in effect, levels the playing field and \nensures that the employer who is not concerned about providing a living \nwage for his employee will not dictate the standard of the industry.\n  The minimum wage does not lift people very far, but it does lift them \nfar enough so that there is the hope they will be able to work \nthemselves out of poverty and stay off of dependency. It has been a \nnational commitment now, as I said, for almost six decades.\n  I think it is long past time to raise the minimum wage again. The \nminimum wage was last raised in 1989, if I am not mistaken. The minimum \nwage increase being proposed now is equivalent to what people got in \n1989. In other words, the 1989 increase has, in effect, been used up by \nthe rise in prices over the intervening 7 years. So you, in effect, are \nno better off at the minimum wage today than you were in 1989, when it \nwas raised.\n  In fact, the current level for the minimum wage in real terms--in \nother words, in purchasing power--is the lowest it has been in 40 \nyears. Of course, this is at the very time, we are reading newspapers, \nmagazines, and story after story about the incredible compensation the \nchief executives are receiving. Yet here we are, now, arguing about \nbasic fairness and equity for the lowest paid workers, those at the \nvery bottom of the pay scale.\n  No one asserts that raising the minimum wage will correct everything, \nbut it certainly will make an important difference to those who are on \nthe low end of the income scale. It is argued, of course, that raising \nthe minimum wage is going to cost jobs. Actually, there are studies \nthat go both ways on this. Recently, there have been some very \nreputable studies that have found no evidence that the increase in \nwages results in reduced employment opportunities. One study in \nparticular analyzed wage increases that were made in New Jersey and \nreached that conclusion.\n\n  Others have found that during the late 1980's, moderate legislative \nincreases did not reduce employment and were, if anything, associated \nwith higher unemployment in some locales.\n  Robert Solo, a distinguished Nobel laureate, distinguished professor \nof economics at MIT, was quoted in the New York Times as saying:\n\n       The main thing about minimum wage research is that the \n     evidence of job loss is weak and the fact that evidence is \n     weak suggests that the impact on jobs is small.\n\n  So I want to try to lay to one side this constant assertion that if \nyou raise the minimum wage, you are going to cost a lot of people jobs.\n  The counter to that, in addition to not costing them a lot of jobs, \nis that you will significantly improve the living standards of people \nreceiving the minimum wage. Of course, as I have indicated, this is a \ntwo-step increase that is proposed in the Kennedy amendment, a 45-cent \nincrease from $4.25 to $4.70 now and another 45-cent increase from \n$4.70 to $5.15 in the middle of next year. So you would have a two-step \nprocess to take the minimum wage from $4.25 an hour to $5.15 an hour.\n  Mr. President, I do not think we need a long argument about the \nequity and fairness of doing this. The statistics are very clear on \nthat point. We know that people have been, in effect, slipping backward \nas a consequence of not raising the minimum wage now for 7 years, going \non 8 years, this is the situation we are now confronting.\n  But the real difficulty occurs in the amendment that is going to be \noffered by my colleagues on the other side, the Republican amendment, \nwhich they portray as their having a commitment to raising the minimum \nwage, but they just want to make some fine-tuning of it. Let us take a \nlook at the fine-tuning, because it really is a shell game and the \nconsequences of it would be very detrimental.\n  First of all, they propose an exemption for employees who are on the \njob in the first 6 months. In other words, the first 180 days, you \nwould get a subminimum wage. That is for workers of all ages.\n  Previously, we have had a lesser wage for a very limited period of \ntime for young workers; very limited, both in time and to the age group \nto which it applies, a so-called training wage. Unfortunately, a lot of \ntraining never took place, but, in any event, that was the theory of \nit.\n  Now we are confronted with an exemption that would deny a minimum \nwage increase to all workers--all workers--regardless of age or \nexperience for the first 6 months of their employment with any \nemployer. In effect, you could begin to create a permanent class of \nsubminimum wage workers. In fact, at the lower wages, workers are often \nchanging jobs. They would be recirculated during this 180-day \nexemption. They would be kept at $4.25. This is a very bad concept, and \nit opens up an incredible loophole that could be exploited in the law \nto violate the very spirit of raising the minimum wage.\n  The other proposal, as I understand it, in the Republican amendment \nwhich will be offered by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nis to deny a minimum wage increase to employees in any company with \nless than $500,000 in annual revenues. So anyone who works in a company \nthat has less than $500,000 in annual revenues--that is $10,000 a week \nin annual revenues, and we are talking now about a number of small \nbusinesses, well over 10 million employees--would be excluded \naltogether. They would just be exempted. Now, that means that many \nemployees now covered by the minimum wage provisions--in other words, \nwho receive the benefit of current law that requires they be paid the \nminimum wage--\n\n[[Page S7406]]\n\nwould then be placed outside of the parameters with respect to any \nincreases in the minimum wage.\n  So, in effect, while asserting that they are extending the minimum \nwage on the one hand, they are taking it away on the other with respect \nto employees now covered in businesses that have revenues of less than \n$500,000 a year, and there are a significant number of such employees--\nin the millions, in the millions.\n\n  So, for the first time since the minimum wage was instituted in the \n1930's, we are actually reducing coverage in a significant and \nsubstantial manner. That is why so many of us are asserting that what \nwe really ought to do is have a clean minimum wage bill, and that is \nwhat the President has indicated he very much wants. We have done that \nin the past in Republican and Democratic administrations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Maryland \nthat he has utilized his 10 minutes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I will be happy to yield another 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I appreciate it.\n  So in the past, in both Democratic and Republican administrations, we \nhave increased the minimum wage. We usually have argued about how much \nto increase it and when to make it effective, and that usually has been \nthe limit of the debate.\n  Now we are confronted with a situation in which there is an effort to \nincrease it, which, by every survey, commands overwhelming support \namongst the American people, and then we are confronted with, as it \nwere, the subterfuges which will erode the meaning of the extension in \nthe minimum wage.\n  The provision that I made reference to of a 180-day period at the old \nwage for everyone, regardless of age, and for the exclusion from \ncoverage of this increase in the minimum wage of any business with \nrevenues of under $500,000 a year, many of the workers of such \nbusinesses are today covered under the minimum wage law. But by the \nprovisions of the amendment to be offered by my Republican colleagues, \nthey would then be excluded.\n  It ought not to be necessary to go through the really heart-rending \nstories of people trying to make it on a minimum wage in order to see \nthe decency of enacting this modest increase.\n  Forty percent of those at minimum wage salaries are single parents \ntrying to support their children. At a minimum wage today they have a \nyear-round income of $8,500. This places them well below the poverty \nlevel. This effort here, of course, to raise the minimum wage and bring \nadditional income to these families would help them to meet their bills \nand in effect to begin to see some light at the end of the tunnel.\n  I know this measure is opposed by some of the small business \nassociations, although I am interested to note that a number of small \nbusinesses are in support of this proposition. As I indicated, at a \npress conference earlier today, there was testimony by a number of \nowners of small businesses in support of this measure.\n  The decrease in the value of the minimum wage has served to widen the \ngulf between the wealthiest and the poorest in our society. In fact, as \nI indicated earlier, the real value of the minimum wage has \ndeteriorated markedly. It will be at its lowest real value in the last \n40 years if Congress fails to take action.\n  In the late 1950's, in fact, the real value of the minimum wage was \nmore than $5 an hour by today's standards. In the mid-1960's it peaked \nat $6.28. If you were making the minimum wage in the mid-1960's, to \nhave that purchasing power today, you would have to have a minimum wage \nof $6.28 an hour.\n  So it is not as though we are asking for some extraordinary thing \nhere. It is not as though the increases that are being sought are out \nof some long-term trend. If anything, they are exceedingly modest. In \nthe late 1950's, the minimum wage available then in purchasing power \nwas better than $5 an hour at today's purchasing power levels. By the \nmid-1960's it was $6.28 an hour.\n  Congress has failed to respond to the erosion of the value of the \nminimum wage over time. We now confront the situation where $4.25 an \nhour in purchasing power is the least it has been in 40 years.\n  More than 70 percent of all minimum wage earners are 20 or above. The \nvast majority, about 60 percent, are women, many of them single heads \nof households. The time has come and gone for an increase in this \nminimum wage. It was last modestly raised in the Bush administration. I \nthink obviously we need to raise it again.\n  We need especially not to support this effort by my Republican \ncolleagues in their amendment to carve out exemptions that, in effect, \nwill render much of this meaningless. I mentioned two things: the \nexclusion of employees of businesses earning below $500,000 a year, \nwhich takes any increases in minimum wage protection away from workers \nnow covered; a substantial number of workers. I also mentioned, of \ncourse, the fact that there is a subminimum wage for 180 days, for 6 \nmonths. Then, if that worker moves, because often those jobs come and \ngo, they move into another low-wage job and get another 180 days at a \nsubminimum wage.\n  The third thing, which was not mentioned earlier in my references, is \nthe effective date for the application of the minimum wage. The \nproposal of my Republican colleagues is to delay it until the beginning \nof next year, delay it for 6 months, in effect. This would obviously \ncost a minimum wage employee about $875 in the course of that period of \ntime, just deny that increase. I defy anyone to make the case that \nsomeone should be able to support a family on $8,500 a year, which \nis what the current minimum wage works out to, $8,500 a year.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I very much hope when the Senate comes to the \nvote, that the Republican amendment will be rejected, that we will \nsupport the proposition put forward by the Senator from Massachusetts \nand the Senate will finally approve an increase in the minimum wage, \nwhich is so important for literally millions of workers and their \nfamilies across our country. I thank the distinguished ranking member \nfor yielding to me.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank my friend from Maryland.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from North Dakota would like \nto speak at this point. Could I ask how much time he might require?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, 7 minutes, 8 minutes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Fine. Could I ask it be charged against the amendment \nof the Senator from Massachusetts as we are running out of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I very much appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from \nNew York.\n  Mr. President, I thought I would read a couple of paragraphs from a \nletter to demonstrate that this debate is not about theory, although we \ndebate a lot of theory here on the floor of the Senate. This debate is \nabout the financial circumstances of a lot of families in our country. \nThis letter comes from a woman in North Dakota who describes the debate \npretty well.\n  She said,\n\n       Today it takes every dime we make to make ends meet, and \n     that is only if we stretch it to the breaking point. We don't \n     have any credit cards. We drive 10- to 15-year-old vehicles, \n     so my husband has recycled. We shop only in thrift stores and \n     at garage sales, and we do a lot of praying. We're better \n     off, I know than a lot of other people who, for instance, \n     have to live on the street. But how far are we from that? We \n     are in the forgotten group of people called the working poor, \n     the people that fall through the cracks of government. I beg \n     you shamelessly, for the sake of my children, to please help \n     us find a glimmer of hope to help us dig our way out of this \n     hopelessly grim situation.\n\n  This from a mother of three children, struggling at the bottom rung \nof the economic ladder, who is trying to make ends meet and finding it \nvery, very difficult.\n  Recently there was a story in the Washington Post with a headline \nthat said that CEO's salaries were up 23 percent last year. The chief \nexecutive officers of the major corporations in America received a 23-\npercent increase in their compensation in 1 year.\n  This woman, and others like her, who are struggling to raise a family \nat the minimum wage and trying to make ends meet, who are working and \nnot on welfare, did not receive a 23-percent increase last year. They \ndid not receive a 1-percent raise last year, not a 1-percent raise the \nyear before. It has been\n\n[[Page S7407]]\n\n7 years since an adjustment in the minimum wage was made. In late 1989, \nCongress adjusted the minimum wage. That's one adjustment in 17 years.\n  Again, this debate is not about theory for a family who is trying to \nraise children. This person whose letter I read got pregnant in high \nschool, made some mistakes, never got employment skills. Her husband \nnever got job skills. So they entered the job market relatively \nunskilled, and have always been somewhere at the bottom of the economic \nladder.\n  It is almost as if we have two economies in our country; one doing \nvery, very well, with 23 percent raises and the stock market at a \nrecord high. Then we see others at the bottom rung of the economic \nladder just struggling day after day after day to try to keep up and to \nmake ends meet.\n  The Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, has spent a good deal of \nhis life talking about the issue of reforming our welfare system. There \nis no one whose opinion I respect more than the Senator from New York \non these subjects. He would know, especially of all the Members of the \nSenate, that the vote that we will take in the Senate is a vote that \nevaluates the question, Do we value work over welfare?\n  The Senator from New York has made a career of trying to figure at \nhow we can fix this welfare system and make it work, so you move people \nfrom welfare rolls to payrolls. Most people on welfare I know do not \nwant to be on welfare. They much prefer to have the skills needed to \nget a good job and take care of their families.\n  We must talk about the question of welfare reform and enact \nlegislation that does the right things to try to address the welfare \nproblem in this country, and does it, as the Senator from New York \nsays, without abandoning our children. Two-thirds of the welfare \nexpenditures in this country are for kids under 16 years of age. Would \nwe have people tell us those folks ought to go out and get a job--10- \nand 12-year-old kids? Most people would say, ``Let's help those \nchildren.''\n  Others on welfare are stuck in the cycle. To the extent we want them \nto move from a welfare roll to a payroll, we want them to get a job, \nthen we have to value work over welfare. One way we can do that in this \nCongress is to decide that we will not keep people stuck at the bottom \nrung of the economic ladder without even a 1-percent increase in the \nminimum wage in 7 years. We will finally make some appropriate and \nmodest adjustments.\n  This is truly a vote, it seems to me, that does determine, do we \nvalue work over welfare? You cannot talk about this and then try to \nundercut the earned income tax credit and try to ignore the issue of \nthe minimum wage and the problems people have at the bottom of the \neconomic ladder.\n  I was in a pizza parlor in North Dakota. A fellow that ran the pizza \nparlor said to me that he supported an increase in the minimum wage. I \nthought to myself, this is very unusual, this is a very small pizza \nparlor. He said, ``The fact is, the folks that come in and buy pizza, I \nwant them to do well, and I have a lot of folks who do not make a lot \nof money. I figure if we have an increase or an adjustment in the \nminimum wage in an appropriate way, I figure it will help me, as \nwell.''\n  I went to a small dressshop while I was touring Main Street of one of \nour towns in North Dakota, stopping and visiting with some people. The \nmanager of the dressshop and I were chatting about the minimum wage and \nshe said, ``I don't own the shop, I manage the shop, but our owner has \nthree shops like this, and our owner says he thinks it is probably a \npretty decent thing because the kind of people who shop in our stores \nwill probably do a little more shopping in our stores if they get an \nadjustment in minimum wage. Our owner says it is probably something \nthat is overdue.''\n  I thought to myself, this is kind of interesting. You find businesses \nas disparate as a pizza parlor and a small dressshop in a small town \nwhere they say that a minimum wage adjustment makes sense. I suppose \nthat this is reflected in the polls that show that 80 to 85 percent of \nthe American people think it makes sense to have an adjustment in the \nminimum wage.\n  I am not unmindful of the burdens that small business owners face in \nour country. To the extent that we can, we always ought to be concerned \nabout the small business owners who risk their money and their assets \nin order to try to make a living. Many of them work long hours without \ngreat compensation. Many of them are very levelheaded people. Most of \nthem are thoughtful, good people, who also understand there is a reason \nwe have a minimum wage in our country.\n  If you believe there ought to be a minimum wage, the only question \nbefore us is, How often should we adjust it? Once every 7 years, or \nonce every 70 years? That is the question.\n  There are some Members of the Senate, I assume, who believe there \nought not be a minimum wage. There is a Member of the other body, a \nprominent Member, who believes the minimum wage is an awful thing and \nthere ought not be any minimum wage at all. There are some people who \nthink there ought not be any prohibition on hiring kids to work at 12 \ncents an hour. There are some with that kind of radical notion. But \nmost of this country has moved well beyond that, and we have child \nlabor laws that are thoughtful, and we have minimum wage provisions \nthat are thoughtful and modest.\n\n  The discussion now between those of us who believe a minimum wage is \nappropriate is, at what level should the minimum wage be set? Should we \nadjust it after 7 years, after the 1989 adjustment, after virtually all \nof the gain from that adjustment has been wiped out? Should we make \nanother adjustment--a thoughtful, moderate adjustment?\n  I think most people come down on the side of saying, yes, this makes \na lot of sense. This is not radical. It is not politics. It is about \npeople's financial circumstances, as they sit around and eat supper and \ntalk about their lot in life. For many of them, it is talking about \nwhat their salary is, what their opportunities are.\n  So, to conclude, a few of us had a press conference this morning, and \nwe had some small business people who made the case, I thought \neloquently, that they supported a moderate adjustment in the minimum \nwage. I found that walking up and down Main Streets and talking to \npeople, that people who think this through believe what is fair is \nfair.\n  We are not asking for the moon here. We are responding to this \nwoman--and millions of others, undoubtedly--who says, ``I beg you, for \nthe sake of my children, please help us find a glimmer of hope to help \nus dig our way out of this hopelessly grim situation.'' She is just \nasking that maybe she and her husband, who do not have it so good--they \nlost their trailer house in a fire, are having trouble buying clothes \nfor her kids, are having trouble paying the rent and buying food--that \nmaybe we will not let them see a little more opportunity.\n  The adjustment in the minimum wage is a small price to pay, in this \nbody, to begin to honor work above welfare. This family and so many \nmillions of others are working. They are not on the welfare rolls. And \nthis amendment, this adjustment will say to them, ``We give great merit \nto work, sufficiently so that we believe those of you at the bottom \nrung of the economic ladder, after 7 years, deserve a modest \nincrease.''\n  We stand for work, not welfare. That is what this vote will be.\n  I appreciate the generosity of the Senator from New York. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I wanted for say how emphatically I \nsupport each of the statements we have just heard. It is embarrassing \nat this point in the 20th century that we have to go to this effort \njust to maintain the value of an economic guarantee that has been with \nus for 60 years. It is as if the 20th century did not happen on the \nother side of the aisle, or should not have.\n  I hope the woman, the lady who wrote the Senator, will not have done \nso in vain. A beautiful letter and beautifully described.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to add an additional point. That \nis, I think many employers are supportive of an increase in the minimum \nwage.\n\n[[Page S7408]]\n\n  In fact, the employers who spoke at this press conference this \nmorning indicated they were in favor of raising the minimum wage. One \nof the press people said, ``If you are in favor of it, why do you not \njust go ahead and do it, and voluntarily raise it in your business?''\n  This lady had an immediate comeback, right on point. She said, ``If \nall my competitors will raise their wages, their payrolls, then I am \nquite prepared to do it. Otherwise, I am placed at a competitive \ndisadvantage.''\n  In effect, under the current system, the only employer who is not \nresponsive to the needs of his employee, in effect, dictates the \nstandard, and it is all brought down to the lowest common denominator. \nFor many employers, this enables them to do what they think ought to be \ndone in any event--that is, give their employees a better wage. It will \nbe done with a level playing field in terms of competition, so that \nemployer--and I think there are not all that many--if they refuse to go \nup, they can be at a competitive advantage against those people who are \nmore responsive to the needs of their employee and who understand the \npressures that are upon them in today's age.\n  This, in many respects, for many employers, means they have an \nopportunity to do what they think ought to be done, in any event. I \nwant to make it clear, I think there are a great many employers across \nthe country who take that position. They are not opposed to raising the \nminimum wage. They recognize that by raising the minimum wage, you keep \nthe competition on a level playing field, and therefore they support \nthe measure that is before the Senate.\n  I very much hope, as the Senator from New York said, when we meet \ntomorrow we will be able to act in a positive manner on this very \nimportant matter.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. If I may say to my friend from Maryland, for a century \nit has been a well-understood principle that with respect to labor \nlegislation, its primary purpose is not to put at a disadvantage \nemployers who will provide better wages and conditions. We have done \nthis not only internally, but through the International Labor \nOrganization. We had labor treaties to do just that. We had to deal \nwith child labor in those terms so that the employer would not put 12-\nyear-olds in coal mines, which we had, would not be at a disadvantage \nmore than one who would.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, is that not exactly what \nthis legislation does?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Exactly. What I cannot understand--and I do not think \nthe Senator from Maryland can help me--is that I thought this was all \nunderstood 50 years ago. Evidently not. We will find out tomorrow.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Actually, the proposal, I think, coming from our \ncolleagues on the Republican side is really a radical proposal.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. This has been a consensus on both sides of the aisle \nfor 60 years, including President Eisenhower, President Nixon and \nPresident Bush. We will see.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak, with the time to be \nallocated against the underlying bill, H.R. 3448, the Small Business \nJob Protection Act of 1996.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this bill, H.R. 3448, the Small Business \nProtection Job Act of 1996, has two titles. Title I is Small Business \nand Other Tax Provisions. This was considered on June 12 by the \nCommittee on Finance, which reported the bill unanimously with a \ncommittee amendment. Title II, Payment of Wages, contains the increase \nin the minimum wage we have been discussing.\n  I want to address some of the more important provisions in the small \nbusiness portion of the bill, and then make a more general point about \nthe provision increasing the minimum wage.\n  Section 1202 of this bill extends employer-provided educational \nassistance until December 31, 1996. That is for the remainder of this \nyear. It also applies the provision to graduate education, which the \nHouse bill did not. At this point, about one-quarter of the employees \nsent to teaching institutions, institutions of higher learning, are, in \nfact, in graduate school, and the value of this program is particularly \nevident in the case of persons sent to do postgraduate work in highly \ntechnical areas. Employers recognize the abilities of the individuals, \nsee the opportunities for bringing them to higher levels of \nproductivity, and pay them more in the process.\n  This measure, which is one of the least known but exceptionally \nrewarding features of our Tax Code was first enacted in 1978. We have \nnever made it a permanent provision. We ought to do that. It ought to \nbe one of the first businesses of the next Congress, because, absent \nthe additional extension I will describe in a moment, it will have \nexpired once again by the time the next Congress convenes. Employer-\nprovided educational assistance is in this measure made retroactive, \npermitting employees to exclude from their income up to $5,250 in \ntuition paid for by their employers. In other words, it allows \nemployers to send employees to college or graduate school tax free.\n  I venture to say that the employer-provided educational assistance \nprogram is one of the most successful efforts ever undertaken by the \nFederal Government in this area. Some 800,000 employees benefit from \nthis provision every year. And they benefit in the most auspicious of \ncircumstances. An employer says, ``Will you go to graduate school and \nget an advanced degree in chemistry so we can put you in a higher \nposition than you are now in? Then you will be in the higher position \nand earn more money and, in time, the Federal Government gets it \nback.''\n  So many of our job training programs have depended on hoping that in \nthe aftermath of the training there will be a job. Here you have a \nsituation where the employer already has the worker and the employee \nsees the opportunity to enlarge his or her situation, and to do so in a \nway that is optimal for all concerned. Now, 95 percent of the persons \ninvolved are pursuing a degree or certificate; 35 percent are enrolled \nin business and business-related fields, such as accounting, finance, \nmarketing, and business administration; 12 percent are enrolled in \nhealth care-related curricula; another 18 percent are in engineering \nand other technical fields.\n  I say, once again, this is a program that works. It administers \nitself. It has the least possible overlay of bureaucracy; it has none. \nThere is no bureau of employer-provided education benefits in the \nDepartment of Education. There is nothing except individual contracts, \nemployee and employer, with a great value added. I say again that it \npays for itself.\n  I am happy to say that the managers' amendment, which we expect will \nbe adopted tomorrow, will provide for an extension through the end of \n1997. So it would be a good thing if we would look to the next Congress \nto make this a permanent arrangement. Right now, almost a million \nemployees do not know whether or not they owe income tax on the \nbenefits--the educational tuition paid for them in the course of this \nprevious year. We now do it retroactively. But this is something that \ncan be made a permanent part of the Tax Code. I think the distinguished \nPresiding Officer would know that universities find this an \nexceptionally rewarding arrangement and, particularly, in the technical \nfields where serious job skill training takes place.\n  I also mention that the Senate version of the expatriation tax \nproposal has been included in this bill. Earlier in this Congress, \nthere was some question about whether the Finance Committee was going \nto address this matter, and we had rather a lively exchange on this \nfloor to that effect. I said at the time that we would, and we have \ndone it. This is a variation of a bill I first introduced in 1995 to \naddress the problem presented when wealthy citizens renounce their U.S. \ncitizenship and move abroad in order to escape taxation. Although \nexpatriation to avoid taxes occurs infrequently, and it is not a seemly \nact, it does occur, and it is a genuine abuse.\n  I would like to say for the Record that this is important, Mr. \nPresident. When the issue first arose in 1995, we had meant to move \ndirectly at that time. Then-chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nBob Packwood of Oregon, and I said this is something to be dealt with \ndirectly. At that time, a number of legal scholars in the field of\n\n[[Page S7409]]\n\ninternational law raised questions concerning the propriety under \ninternational law of restricting the rights of persons to leave the \ncountry of which they are a citizen. We took this seriously, as we were \nrequired to, and put off the legislation until we could satisfy \nourselves--and the critics who had offered good faith comments--that we \nwere doing something that would pass muster as not restricting the \nright of emigration. This bill does that, in our judgment, and does it \nvery well indeed.\n\n  One might think this is a small measure, and perhaps some have \nsuggested it was. But this provision, the expatriation provision in the \nSenate bill, raises $1.57 billion over 10 years. The modified provision \nin managers' amendment that will be offered tomorrow increases that to \na total of $1.71 billion, which suggests that what may have been a \nrelatively rare event up until recently is gathering momentum, and we \nwill now stop it. And stop it we ought. The idea of millionaires, \nmultimillionaires, renouncing their citizenship and moving to the \nBahamas is--well, it is not seemly. I need say no more.\n  A final observation about the small business title of the bill. To \npay for the small business tax relief provisions, which will cost \napproximately $17 billion, we are providing for a tax cut of $17 \nbillion. We are phasing out section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code \nover 10 years.\n  This measure, which dates from the 1920's, was originally intended to \nencourage American business to locate in the Philippines. For a \ngeneration now, it has been almost entirely a matter of Puerto Rican \nbusiness activity, and has been very important to the economy of Puerto \nRico.\n  On the other hand, there comes a time when a measure of this sort has \nbeen in place long enough and it is recognized--not precipitously but \nwith good notice--that the time has come to phase it out. The division \nof opinion on this question in Puerto Rico is probably associated with \nproponents of statehood and proponents of maintaining the commonwealth \nrelationship. We have done our best to accommodate the people of Puerto \nRico and their elected officials. They are not represented on the \nSenate floor. We have a profound responsibility to that possession \nwhich we obtained just short of 100 years ago in the aftermath of the \nSpanish-American War.\n  I might add again, Mr. President, that this bill was reported from \nthe Committee of Finance unanimously. It was bipartisan. It was the \njudgment of persons we found most persuasive that we should follow the \nshift we made in 1993 by encouraging the tax credit for actual job \ncreation as against the depreciation of patents and other arrangements \nwhich had been possible under the earlier regime.\n  I have been on the Senate floor for 20 years talking about this \nmatter. I have tried to make it clear that the United States had an \nobligation not simply to the people of Puerto Rico but to the \ninternational community. Every President since Harry S. Truman has said \nthat the people of Puerto Rico are free to remain a commonwealth--if \nthey choose--to become a State, or to choose independence. And that \noption exists to this moment.\n  But the time for this particular tax subsidy in this form seems now \nto have reached a point where we would say, ``All right, let us have \ndone with it in the early 21st century.'' And this legislation does so. \nIt is bipartisan. We hope it works. We have concerned ourselves solely, \nor I would like to think primarily, with what seems to be the best \ninterests of Puerto Rico. And we have consulted with their elected \nrepresentatives in this regard.\n  I would particularly like to express my appreciation to Chairman \nRoth, who has been wholly cooperative in this matter and in particular \nin making the wage-based credit permanent for existing companies.\n  I hope that at a later time we can work together to do more to \nprovide incentives for new investment for Puerto Rico, not just for \nexisting companies but for new companies as well, but that, too, is for \nthe next Congress. I look forward to working with our committee and the \nSenate itself in this regard.\n  I say once again that we must remain conscious of a very solemn \nresponsibility to the people of Puerto Rico, who are not represented in \nthis Chamber but who are American citizens, who have the right to be \nrespected, whose rights are to be respected, and whose interests are to \nbe advanced.\n  This brings me to the minimum wage title of the bill, which after all \nis the reason we have taken the trouble to write a package of small \nbusiness tax relief provisions. Many members of the majority, \nparticularly in the other body, believe that an increase in the minimum \nwage would harm small businesses. Therefore they demanded offsetting \ntax relief for those businesses.\n  Senators on our side did not feel any sweetener should be required in \norder to pass a long overdue increase in the minimum wage, but even so \nwe tried to be accommodating. We worked on a bipartisan basis to craft \na small business tax relief bill all Senators could support.\n  Yet now we are told this is not enough. The price for passage of the \nminimum wage increase keeps going up. Tomorrow the Senate will vote on \nan amendment to exempt from the minimum wage businesses with less than \n$500,000 per year in sales; permit a subminimum wage of $4.25 per hour \nfor newly hired workers; and delay the increase in the minimum wage for \n6 months.\n  I hope Senators will keep this minimum wage increase in perspective. \nYes, an increase in the minimum wage will reduce demand for labor \nsomewhat. But if you are looking for a painless time to do it, now is \nthe time. The current economic expansion is in its 65th month. \nUnemployment is down to 5.3 percent. Two weeks ago, the Washington Post \nreported that serious labor shortages are developing around the United \nStates, so much so that some fast-food franchises are paying \nsubstantial signing bonuses to new employees. So now is the time to \nphase in a higher minimum wage. Our expanding economy will easily \nadjust to it.\n  When the Finance Committee took up this legislation 3 weeks ago, we \nunderstood that the small business provisions were necessary to get the \nminimum wage increase enacted. And we reported the bill unanimously. I \nhope the Senate will defeat the amendment of the Senator from Missouri \ntomorrow, and that we will then approve H.R. 3448 overwhelmingly and \nwithout further delay.\n  Mr. President, I believe my time may have expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from New York \nthat there are 6 minutes remaining on the Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I will now suggest the absence of a \nquorum as I see no Senator wishing to be heard. I ask that the time be \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I think we are going to find ourselves \nin a situation where we will want to add to the time available for \ndebate tomorrow. But I do not see anyone on the floor at this point. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum, and I will return momentarily with \nsome thought.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4272\n\n         (Purpose: To modify the payment of wages provisions.)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, earlier today the majority leader submitted \nmy amendment to this bill, amendment No. 4272. I believe it is held at \nthe desk. I would like to call up that amendment now, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4272.\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, this is an amendment that merely carries out \nthe intent that Congress has shown on many occasions to exclude the \nsmallest of the small employers from the burdens of a minimum wage. \nBasically, it says that for firms grossing less than $500,000, the \nsmall mom and pop businesses, the folks in your neighborhood, the \npeople who are just getting by and providing a few jobs in their \ncommunity, will not be subjected to the increase in the minimum wage. \nThis does not say that their workers will not be protected by the \ncurrent minimum wage or by Federal overtime provisions. It just says \nthat we are not going to put another burden on the backs of those very \nsmall employers by ordering them to add 20 percent to their payroll \ncosts for those who are employed at minimum wage.\n  As the Clinton administration's own Administrator of the Small \nBusiness Administration, Phil Lader, said, this kind of exemption, this \ntwo-tiered system makes sense. It protects minimum wage jobs in the \nsmallest business and it protects small business.\n  Those of us who have talked with and, more importantly, listened to \nsmall business people throughout this country know that the burdens of \nGovernment regulation, Government mandates fall very heavily on small \nbusiness. This amendment just says we are not going to put another \nmandate, another heavy financial burden, on the very smallest of the \nsmall employers on Main Street in your community and my community.\n  Earlier today, the Senators from Massachusetts and South Dakota \nstated the reasons they opposed my amendment. I am here to set the \nrecord straight about what my amendment does and does not do.\n  First, contrary to their assertions, this amendment is not a killer \namendment. It simply means that the smallest of the small businesses \nwill not have to lay off some of their workers in order to comply with \nthe law.\n  Who says that is a killer amendment? What forces are telling the \nPresident that he cannot protect the smallest of the small businesses \nand give all of the rest of minimum wage workers a minimum wage \nincrease? What kind of logic would say that you cannot have it for \nanybody if you protect just the employees and the smallest businesses \ngrossing under $500,000?\n  The Senators from Massachusetts and South Dakota would have you \nbelieve that the debate is only about whether or not people should be \npaid more. Would I like to see working Americans earn more money? \nAbsolutely. I believe that everybody who has joined me as a cosponsor \nof this amendment and who will vote for this amendment would agree. But \nthe way to get increases in wages is through increases in productivity, \ngetting the training, getting the experience that often minimum wage \nworkers are getting in their very first job. We expand the opportunity \nfor a training wage so people can get off welfare and into work or \nstart on the work ladder. That experience is vital to getting them \nbetter paying jobs in the future. If you increase the minimum wage for \nthe smallest of the employers, there are real tradeoffs. The smallest \nof the small employers, American businesses grossing under $500,000 per \nyear, will, in my view, be forced to lay off workers. That is the \nbottom line. An increase in wages with no increase in productivity and \nrevenues means lost jobs.\n  Here is how it works. Say your neighbors own a small grocery store. \nThey have a payroll budget of $85,000 available for wages. How do we \nknow what is available for wages? Well, that is about how much they can \npay after they figure out how much they are taking in, the costs of \ngoods that they sell, what their operating costs are, and what they \nneed to live on. At the current minimum wage, they could afford\n\n[[Page S7411]]\n\nto hire about 10 workers. It comes out to a minimum wage, 40 hours per \nweek, 50 weeks per year, of about $8,500. If the minimum wage were to \nbe increased by mandate on them by 90 cents, there is added $1,800 per \nemployee to the grocer's cost. But raising that wage does not sell more \ngroceries or anything else in the store.\n\n  So how many people will they be able to afford to hire? Only eight. A \n20-percent increase in the minimum wage means they will have to lay off \n20 percent of their minimum wage workers, or two people. A small \nbusiness employing only five would have too lay off one. To suggest \nthat a minimum wage increase has no effect on employment in the \nsmallest of small businesses is just plain wrong. A mandatory minimum \nwage increase for the smallest employers means job loss.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts would also have you believe that we \nhave locked out millions from increases in the minimum wage, \n``employees of fully two-thirds of all firms in the United States.''\n  Come now, Mr. President, the truth is this amendment only applies to \nthose firms that take in revenues of $500,000 per year or less. These \nfirms employ only about 8 percent of the American work force. The \npercentage of those earning the minimum wage at those firms is even \nsmaller.\n  The Advocacy Council at the Small Business Administration says only \nabout 10 percent of the small business employees are at minimum wage. \nSo we are talking, probably--we do not have exact figures from the \nBureau of Labor Statistics--less than a million people.\n  I also find it somewhat odd that my Democratic colleagues are \ncomplaining about the amendment as a poison pill. Many of them happily \nvoted for similar poison last time we passed a minimum wage increase in \n1989. And many of them supported a bill authored by Senator Bumpers, my \ndistinguished ranking member on the Small Business Committee, in 1991. \nThat amendment clarified the need for a small business exemption. If it \nwas not poison then, why is it poison now?\n  I think it is very unfortunate that this administration is ignoring \nthe advice of its own top small business spokesman, Philip Lader, the \nadministrator of the Small Business Administration, who says:\n\n       An exemption for the smallest of small businesses makes \n     sense. Exempting small businesses from a mandatory wage \n     increase for minimum wage workers means that firms at the \n     margin will not be forced to cut jobs or not grow.\n\n  So there you have it. The view of the need for a small business \nexemption from the Clinton administration's own spokesman on small \nbusiness.\n  We, on our side of the aisle, believe the minimum wage is a floor. \nApparently some on the other side view it as a ceiling. There are some \nDemocrats who would have you believe that Americans are locked into \nminimum wage jobs, in some cases for life. Those just are not the \nfacts. Most Americans do not earn the minimum wage. Many of them start \nthere and they move up the scale. They have to get a start somewhere. \nThat is why the minimum wage and the training wage is so important. \nThose who obtain minimum wage jobs learn the skills and, as they become \nproductive, go on to better jobs at better pay.\n  Who is it that is saying this is a poison pill? Common sense sure \ndoes not. I cannot believe the President would deny the minimum wage \nincrease he so robustly seeks for the very large percentage of minimum \nwage workers who are not employed by the smallest of the small.\n  Mr. President, we will, I understand, have an opportunity to discuss \nthis matter further tomorrow. At this point, I yield the floor and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am taking the floor today to speak \nin favor of the Bond amendment. I certainly am speaking for the small \nbusiness people of this country when I support the exemption that is \nprovided in this amendment.\n  I think it is very important that we look at the big picture when we \nare making law that is going to affect the economy of our country and \nmost certainly the workplace of our country.\n  We have passed free trade agreements, so we are now going to be in \ncompetition with businesses throughout the world. Many of these \nbusinesses have lower standards than we do. They have lower wage \nscales. I think America should keep our high standards, but I also \nthink if we are going to keep jobs in America through export markets \nrather than shipping the jobs overseas--rather, export our products \ninstead of our jobs--if we are going to do that, we have to look at the \nbig picture and look at what we have done in this country over the last \n3 or 4 years.\n  In fact, what we are doing is increasing the cost of doing business \nin America. So if we pass the minimum wage increase, we are going to \nadd one more increase to the cost of doing business that will make us \nless competitive in the global marketplace.\n  I was a candy manufacturer. I did export into Canada, for instance, \nbut I also competed, Mr. President, with candy that was made in South \nAmerica and Mexico, and it was very difficult to compete with candy \nthat was made at much lower cost because I had to be price competitive. \nSo I am very hopeful that we will look at this competition that we have \ncreated as we are taking up an increase the size of a minimum wage that \nwe are talking about today.\n  So if we increase the minimum wage at the same time that we have \nincreased taxes--that has already been done--we have more regulatory \ncosts, and that has been proven, as well, pretty soon we are going to \nsee our jobs exported rather than our products exported from America--\nproducts made with American labor.\n  I think we have to be very careful. I appreciate the fact that \nSenator Bond and Senator Lott are working on an amendment that would \ngive our small businesses a break. By having the $500,000 exemption, we \nare taking the businesses that are most vulnerable to the margins of \nprofit and we are going to give them a break. I think that is very \nimportant.\n  I have seen that small businesses have a harder time competing for \nexport markets anyway because they do not have the size that makes for \nmore efficiencies. So if we can give them this bit of help--$500,000 is \na very small company, especially if that is your gross receipts, that \nis a small company--I think if we can give our small businesses the \nadvantage of an exemption, then maybe we will be able to get the best \nof both worlds with this overall minimum wage increase.\n  I also like the provision in the amendment that says we will have a \ntraining wage for 180 days. A training wage is an entry wage. You do \nnot find experienced people making the minimum wage; you find people \nwho have no experience whatsoever making the minimum wage, and they \nquickly move on if they learn fast and show that they are able to take \non more responsibility.\n  So I think the training wage is very important for our entry level \npeople, our young people who are trying to get their first experience \nor our older employees who might be coming back into the marketplace. \nGetting that first bit of training and allowing the leeway to get that \ntraining, I think, is going to be a very important mitigating factor \nfor the companies to be able to say, yes, I can take a chance and hire \nsomeone at the $4.25 level because I know that if they prove that they \nare worth something, I will then be able to pay more. But that gives me \ntime to get the product on the market and productivity up and find out \nif I am going to be able to afford this and then hopefully be able to \nmake the increase at the end of the 180 days.\n\n  I also think, Mr. President, that this folds into the welfare reform \nthat we have been talking about. If we are going to put limits on the \namount of time that a person can be on welfare, if we are going to \nencourage people who are able-bodied to go into the job market rather \nthan staying in a cycle of welfare, we have to have the jobs available \nfor these people to enter the workplace.\n  They are the very people that need that entry-level wage. People who\n\n[[Page S7412]]\n\nwould be making a transition from welfare into the job market ought to \nbe able to get that training wage, get that experience. Their employers \nhopefully would be able to take a chance at this lower level of the \nwage, and give them that opportunity to pull themselves up by their \nbootstraps to become citizens of this country who are taking a \nresponsibility and providing their fair share of the workload for this \ncountry.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this very important amendment, and \nhelp us make sure that we keep the strength of our economy as we are \nmoving into this higher minimum wage level. Let us have time for people \nto prepare. I think increasing the minimum wage immediately could put a \nvery big hardship on some of our small businesses that they would not \nbe able to immediately cover.\n  But if we give time for these businesses to plan for the increase, \nand see how they are going to be able to increase their prices in order \nto make up for the higher costs, that we will be doing something that \nwill not hurt the small businesses of this country nearly as much, and \nit will not hurt so badly our businesses that might be competitive in \nthe international marketplace either.\n  Many people are concerned that if we raise the minimum wage, it will \nincrease the cost of employing even people who are not making the \nminimum wage. We are going to start a ratchet effect so that every \nlevel of wage is going to go up. Well, that is good, but it is also \nsomething that we have to look at very carefully to make sure that our \nbusinesses can absorb these higher costs. We need to give them the \nability to raise the price of their product in time so that they will \nnot be in a loss situation and have to actually lay people off and \neliminate jobs. That is certainly not what we want the outcome of the \nminimum wage increase to be.\n  So I think the delay, giving business a chance to prepare for the \nminimum wage increase, keeping the training wage are very important. I \nthink the $500,000 and below exemption is very important for helping \nour small businesses to be able to keep their small businesses going \nand increase employment rather than have to lay people off. More than \nseventy percent of the new jobs in this country are created by small \nbusiness. So the last thing we want to do is hurt that economic \nmachine, that job-creating machine that is the small business of this \ncountry. So we want our small businesses to be able to plan for this \nincrease, to have the ability to absorb the increase in costs that will \nhappen. I think this is the responsible way to do it.\n  Mr. President, before I end, I would like to say that I am also very, \nvery pleased about another part of this bill. It does not really relate \nto the minimum wage, but in the business tax part of the bill that will \nbe introduced tomorrow. I just want to commend Senator Roth, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, for including the Hutchison-Mikulski \nhomemaker IRA bill.\n  I have been fighting for 3 years to give the homemakers of this \ncountry the ability to retire in security the same as if they had \nworked outside the home, because there is no question in my mind that \nthe work done inside the home is as much a part of the American family, \nif not more important to the American family, than the work done \noutside the home. But ever since IRA's have been allowed in this \ncountry that would allow people to set aside $2,000 a year, tax free, \nfor their retirement security, ever since we have authorized those, we \nhave not allowed the homemaker, who works inside the home, to be able \nto contribute that same $2,000 a year.\n\n  We are trying to correct that inequity. Senator Mikulski, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Kassebaum, Senator Snowe, and Senator Gramm have all \nsigned on to be cosponsors of that bill. Senator Roth especially has \nbeen very helpful, not only in putting that in the original tax cut \nbill that was vetoed by President Clinton last year, but he has also \nincluded it in this bill. If this bill can be signed by the President \nthen we will have our homemaker IRA's.\n  So I am hopeful that this is a bill that will include the Lott-Bond \namendment so they will help the small businesses be able to prepare for \nthis minimum wage increase and give the exemptions for small business \nto be able to continue to pay the lower minimum wage, and then if we \ncan have the homemaker IRA that will really make a difference in the \nsavings in this country and in the security of our one-income-earner \nfamilies and not only that, but when you take everything into \nconsideration, it is just a matter of equity.\n  It is just flat equity that every person who is working in our \ncountry, whether it is inside the home or outside the home, should have \nthe same opportunities for saving for retirement, tax free. And that is \nexactly what we will be doing if we are able to pass this bill with \nthat very fine amendment that will be sponsored by Senator Roth \ntomorrow.\n  So I am very pleased to be supportive of this measured minimum wage \nincrease because I believe that it can be good for our country if we do \nit in just the right way. So I thank the sponsors of the amendment, and \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I inquire how much time remains on both \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 9 minutes 7 seconds for the majority \nside and 30 minutes for the minority.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, thank you.\n  I wish to compliment my colleague from Texas for an outstanding \nstatement and also for her leadership on this issue and for the fact \nthat she has some business experience to rely on. I think that \ncertainly is needed. I hope that her advice, as far as voting on these \namendments, will be taken to heart by our colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to a 21-percent increase in the \nminimum wage. That does not mean that I do not want individuals that \nmake the minimum wage to make more money. I hope that they do. I hope \nthey make a lot more. I hope we are not satisfied with them making \n$5.15. I would like for them to make a lot more.\n  But what I would hate to do is to pass a Federal law that says it is \nillegal for them to work for $5. In other words, if the economic \nsituation in some area will only allow a job to pay $5 or $4.50, I do \nnot think we should pass a Federal law to say it is illegal for them to \ntake the job.\n  That is exactly what we are doing. I have heard some of our \ncolleagues say, ``Well, this is supported by an overwhelming majority \nof people. Eighty percent of the people support the minimum wage.'' I \nwant people who make minimal amounts of money to make more money as \nwell. But suppose the pollster phrased it like this: Should the Federal \nGovernment make it illegal for an individual to work for $4.80 an hour \nin rural Montana if that is the best that that employer can pay and the \nbest that that employee can make? Most people would say, no, you should \nnot make it illegal.\n  I just say that I believe the reason why we are here is not really to \nraise minimum wages. I believe it is political. I believe our \ncolleagues on the Democrat side, including the President, are playing \npolitics. They are trying to score political points. Maybe they have \nbeen successful. I do not know.\n  Interesting coincidence of timing. The Democrats controlled the \nSenate, both Houses of Congress, in 1993 and 1994. They could have \nraised this issue at any time during then. The majority leader could \nhave called it up. The Speaker in the House could have called it up at \nany point. They controlled both Houses of Congress. President Clinton \nand the Democrats said they were in favor of it. They could have moved \nat that time. They could have pulled it up, and both Houses would have \nconsidered it, would have voted on it, or at least it would have been \nup for consideration. They did not do it in 1993. They did not do it in \n1994. They did it, I believe, for political purposes, about the same \ntime after organized labor came into town and said they would commit \n$35 million to try to retake both the House and the Senate. Interesting \ntiming.\n\n  All of a sudden, here come the amendments, and we will have this\n\n[[Page S7413]]\n\namendment on everything, we will make it illegal for anybody in America \nto work for $5 an hour because somebody in this Chamber has determined \nyou should not have a job if it is only $5 an hour. I disagree with \nthat philosophy. I disagree with it very strongly.\n  Now, if the Senator from Massachusetts or the Senator from any other \nState, if their State wants to raise minimum wage to $5.25, which I \nthink they have done in the State of Massachusetts, they are scheduled \nto go to $5.25, that is fine. If the State of New York wants a minimum \nwage of $6 an hour, they have the right to do so. Why in the world \nshould we make it national? What about the State of Montana, or some \nrural town in Montana? Maybe they have different economic \ncircumstances, which they most certainly do, than, say, New York City \nor Washington, DC.\n  Why should we presuppose we have all the wisdom and we should mandate \nwhat the wages should be nationally, and make it is against the law for \nyou to have a job even if you are 16 years old and want to get started \nclimbing the economic ladder? We are going to say, ``No, if you cannot \nget a job that pays at least $5.15 an hour, you cannot have a job. The \nFederal Government has determined it is better for you to stay at home, \nnot work. If you cannot get a job at $5.15 an hour, we prefer you not \nto have a job. It is against the law for you to have a job.''\n  I think that is a mistake. I think it is a serious mistake. I think \nit will cost jobs. I do not know how many jobs it will cost. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates employment losses for a 90-cent-\nper-hour increase in minimum wage from roughly 100,000 to 500,000 jobs. \nThat is a pretty significant economic impact on that 100,000 or that \n500,000 people who lose a job.\n  Those are people that may need the job more than anything. Maybe they \nare people that want to start climbing the economic ladder, and we will \nsay, ``No, you need not apply. That job is not worth it.'' Maybe it was \npumping gas, sacking groceries, or some menial task. That first job can \nbe one of the most important, in fact, maybe the most important job \nsomebody will have because they start learning skills. They might learn \nthey need more education, or have an idea, ``Wait, I need to make more \nmoney, so therefore I better go back to school,'' or vo-tech, or finish \nhigh school, or maybe go to college. No, we will have a Federal law \nthat says if you do not make at least $5.15 an hour, we have determined \nyou should not have a job. As a matter of fact, it is illegal for you \nto have a job. I think that is wrong.\n  The Employment Policies Institute estimates that the job loss for an \nincrease of 90 cents is over 600,000, if Senator Kennedy's amendment \npasses. Mr. President, 10,000 are in Oklahoma, 18,000 would be in \nGeorgia. I do not want to pass a law that will put 10,000 Oklahomans \nout of work. Again, if they want to do that in the State of \nMassachusetts, power to them. If they want to do it in other States, \nthey have that right to do so. We should not interfere with that.\n  What about States rights? The 10th amendment of the Constitution says \nall the rights and powers are reserved to the States and the people. \nThey did not envision the Federal Government mandating that if you do \nnot make $5.15 an hour, you cannot have a job. That is what Senator \nKennedy's amendment would do.\n  Senator Kennedy's amendment is even worse than the language that \nalready passed the House, which President Clinton said he would sign. \nThe House bill at least has a training wage of 90 days; Senator Kennedy \nonly has one for 30 days. The House bill does not hit the restaurant \nowners and workers; it allows a tip credit. Most people that work in \nrestaurants make $8 or $9 an hour on average. They are not minimum \nwage, so they keep the tip credit at $2.13. Senator Kennedy has that \nincreased. That would be a big hit on somebody that has a small \nrestaurant. My point being that his language is even worse than what \npassed the House. The net result is you will put hundreds of thousands \nof people out of work.\n\n  I believe that is a serious, serious mistake. Not only that, but now \nit would be retroactive. So, think of that. You have a small business. \nSenator Kennedy does not give a small business exemption, no matter how \nsmall. My colleagues know I used to have a janitorial service. We did \nnot pay minimum wage. I used to work for a janitorial service that did \npay minimum wage. Senator Kennedy's bill would make it retroactive. \nThat might be nice if you got the wage, but what about the employer \nthat could not cover it?\n  I remember asking my boss, when I was making $1.60 an hour, for a \nraise, and after a couple weeks he gave me a nickel-an-hour raise. \nSenator Kennedy will mandate they have to give 45 cents retroactive to \nJuly 5. What if they cannot afford that? Sorry, you just lost a job, \nthanks to Senator Kennedy's amendment.\n  We should not allow that to happen. We should not be passing laws \naround this place that will put hundreds of thousands of people out of \nwork. We should not be passing laws around this place that say it is \nillegal for you to have a job that pays $5.10 an hour because the \nFederal Government has determined that any job that is worth having \nshould pay at least $5.15 an hour.\n  I believe that is very bad economics. It does not make sense. I do \nnot believe we can repeal the law of supply and demand. If we can, why \nstop at $5.15? Maybe we should have another amendment that says make it \n$10 an hour if there is no negative impact on a 21-percent increase in \nthe minimum wage. Increase it 100 percent--make it $10 an hour or $20 \nan hour. Anybody making $5 an hour, I would like them to make $10 or \n$20. I would like them to be better off financially. If there are no \nnegative economic consequences, why not do it? We are not going to do \nit because people know it would have a negative economic consequence. \nWe know we would be putting people out of work, and there are certain \njobs in certain places that cannot afford to pay it.\n  The people we will hurt the most are the people we should be hurting \nthe least. We will be hurting a little restaurant or grocery store that \nis competing in some rural town, trying to stay alive, competing \nagainst Wal-Mart. Some big business comes in and the little guy is \nhaving a hard time staying alive. Yet, we are going to mandate a 21-\npercent increase in minimum wage. Maybe they were hiring some young \npeople, 16 and 17 years old, that wanted to earn some money in the \nsummertime, and we will tell them, ``No, you cannot do that. It is \nagainst the law. Unless you pay at least $5.15 an hour, we have \ndetermined that job is not worth having.'' We have decided that in \nWashington, DC, because we are the source of all wisdom.\n  What is right about $5.15? Why not make it $6 or $7 or $8 or $10? It \njust does not make sense. If you repeal the law of supply and demand, \nwe should make it $10 or $20, but we cannot. It will cost jobs. If we \npass the increase in minimum wage, it will cost jobs. We will put \npeople out of work, people that need to work the most, people that want \nto start climbing the economic ladder. That is a serious mistake.\n  I mentioned, Mr. President, I worked for a janitorial service in \nStillwater, OK, and the 1968 minimum wage was $1.60. My wife and I both \nhad a job there. We worked at it a month before we asked for the raise. \nWe got the nickel. We decided that was not enough, so we started our \nown janitorial service and we made a lot more money working for \nourselves. We got started low on the economic ladder, but we were able \nto climb up. I am glad the Federal Government did not come in and say \nthey wanted the minimum wage at that time to be much, much higher. I \nmight not have gotten that job. I might not have gotten the training, \nand I might not have started my own janitorial service and put myself \nand several other people through school.\n  We should not deny people economic opportunities. We should not be \npassing laws that will be putting people out of work. That is exactly \nwhat we will be doing if we pass this increase in minimum wage. I hope \nwe will not do it. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Kennedy \namendment tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/08/senate-section/article/S7366-4", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7413-S7414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 1995, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on July 2, 1996,\n\n[[Page S7414]]\n\nduring the adjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House \nof Representatives announcing that the Speaker has signed the following \nenrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 1880.

A bill to provide that the United States Post Office \nbuilding that is to be located at 9 East Broad Street, Cookeville, \nTennessee, shall be known and designated as the ``L. Clure Morton Post \nOffice and Courthouse''; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n the l. clure morton post office and courthouse designation act of 1996\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill \nto designate the post office and courthouse in Cookeville, TN, the L. \nClure Morton Post Office and Courthouse. I am also pleased that my \ncollegue from Tennessee, Senator Bill Frist, is joining me as an \noriginal cosponsor.\n  After graduating from the University of Tennessee's School of Law in \n1936, L. Clure Morton spent 33 years in private practice and as a \nspecial agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 1970, \nPresident Richard Nixon appointed Morton a U.S. district court judge in \nNashville, TN. Judge Morton was elevated to chief judge in 1977 and \ntook senior status in 1984. Presently Judge Morton presides in the \nnortheastern division and lives in Cookeville.\n  Middlet Tennessee trial lawyers and judges alike comment on the \nabsolute fairness, intellectual honesty, innovative sentencing, and no-\nnonsense manner in which Judge Morton conducted his courtroom over the \npast 26 years. A jurist of great courage, Judge Morton handled many \ncontroversial constitutional issues not addressed by his predecessors. \nHe dealt resolutely with the issue of school integration in Nashville \nand reforms in Tennessee's prison, welfare, and mental health systems.\n  The city council of Cookeville, TN, recently passed a resolution to \nrecommend this name change of the U.S. post office and courthouse to \nhonor Judge Morton. The resolution reads as follows:\n\n       ``A resolution to (recommend to the United States Senate) \n     rename the United States Post Office and Courthouse Building, \n     9 East Broad Street, Cookeville, Tennessee, as the L. Clure \n     Morton Federal Building, to honor Judge L. Clure Morton on \n     the occasion of his retirement.\n       ``Whereas, the Honorable L. Clure Morton has announced his \n     intention to leave active service as a United States judge \n     for the Middle District of Tennessee, and retires to \n     Knoxville; and\n       ``Whereas, Judge Morton was appointed United States \n     District Judge by President Richard Nixon in 1970, and has \n     performed his duties with the utmost dedication and integrity \n     for over 25 years; and\n       ``Whereas, he has handled the entire Northeastern Division \n     docket in Cookeville since 1970, and has presided exclusively \n     in Cookeville, Tennessee since 1984; and\n       ``Whereas, Judge Morton has ruled from the bench without \n     passion or prejudice, seeking only to uphold the Constitution \n     and the laws of the United States; and\n       ``Whereas, Judge Morton is widely respected and admired by \n     his peers and associates in the legal profession and by \n     members of this community; and\n       ``Whereas, this Council desires to recognize the \n     outstanding and lasting contributions made by Judge Morton to \n     the legal profession in middle Tennessee; and\n       ``Whereas, Judge Morton's chambers and courtroom are \n     located in the United States Courthouse and Post Office \n     Building, 9 East Broad Street, Cookeville, Tennessee. Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       ``Resolved by the Cookeville City Council, That we \n     recommend that the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse Building, \n     9 East Broad Street, Cookeville, Tennessee, which has housed \n     an esteemed member of the judiciary and an outstanding public \n     servant for over a quarter of a century, be renamed the L. \n     Clure Morton Federal Building, in recognition for his \n     significant contributions as a United States District Judge \n     for the Middle District of Tennessee.''\n\n  Middle Tennessee is a safer, fairer place because Judge Morton served \non the bench. This legislation is an appropriate tribute to a man who \nso positively touched so many middle Tennesseeans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill we introduce \ntoday be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7415]]\n\n                                S. 1931\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nlimit the amount of nonconstituent contributions that a candidate may \naccept, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n\n\n                  Campaign Finance Reform Legislation\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nto reform our campaign financing system. I am doing so because I feel \nthat it is important to dispel the all too common notion that \ncandidates are improperly influenced by campaign contributions. In my \nview it is not difficult for an honest politician to arrange financing \nin a way that avoids the appearance as well as the reality of \ncorruption. But, because too few candidates choose to impose these \nrules on themselves, we need legislation to show them the way.\n  When I ran for the Senate in 1994 I voluntarily imposed limits on the \ncontributions I would accept from out-of-State sources and from \npolitical action committees. I refused to accept any more than 20 \npercent of overall contributions from PAC's. I also refused to accept \nmore than 25 percent of overall contributions from out-of-State donors. \nI did this because I wanted to make sure that the bulk of my support \ncame directly from Michiganians. And, with this policy in place, I won \nhandily.\n  I am certain that other candidates would find that they can run \nsuccessful campaigns with such self-imposed limits. More important, \nthese limits would increase politicians' accountability to their \nconstituents and decrease the appearance of special interest influence. \nUnfortunately, too few candidates appear willing to take the crucial \nstep of placing limits on their own campaigns.\n  Thus, to increase accountability, my bill would codify limits similar \nto the ones I imposed on myself in the 1994 campaign. All Federal \ncandidates would have to follow the same rules, dictating that they \nreceive no more than 20 percent of overall contributions from PAC's and \nno more than 33 percent of overall contributions from out-of-State/\ndistrict donors.\n  Additionally, in my bill, I have proposed a system of PAC democracy. \nThis system would mandate that PAC's receive input from their donor-\nmembers, whereby all donor-members would have a vote in how and where \nthe PAC donations are to be distributed.\n  Furthermore, I have proposed that the individual contribution limit \nbe increased to reflect the monetary realities in 1996, and that this \nlimit be indexed each year after based on the consumer price index.\n  I believe that campaign finance reform should begin at home--with \ncandidates pledging to abide by their own self-imposed limits. I have \ncodified contribution limits in my own campaign finance reform bill; a \nbill which I believe has the effect of permitting candidates to speak \nfreely while curbing the influence of special interest and out-of-State \nmoneys. By limiting these nonconstituent contributions, we can increase \ncommunication between candidates and voters, enabling voters to make \nbetter, more informed decisions concerning who can best represent them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1932\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the President with the request that he \n     further transmit such copy to the Government of Mongolia.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, during our short Independence Day recess, \nthere were a number of elections overseas that captured our attention.\n  Certainly the most important involved the reelection of Boris Yeltsin \nas President of Russia--a positive development for democracy abroad, \nand a defeat for the Communist Party there that unfortunately maintains \nthe support of a sizable portion of the electorate.\n  Another election that might have gone otherwise unnoticed, except for \nthe stunning results which it produced, occurred in Mongolia on June \n30.\n  I had the opportunity to join with former Secretary of State Jim \nBaker and several other distinguished observers in visiting polling \nstations across the plains of Mongolia to watch democracy in action.\n  Mr. President, what occurred in Mongolia a week ago Sunday was truly \nhistoric.\n  Parliamentary elections there produced dramatic results: Democratic \nreformers upended the ruling former Communist Party seized majority \ncontrol of the legislature for the first time, and are now in position \nto set this vast country on a bold new course.\n  The seismic political shift in Mongolia was unexpected, to say the \nleast.\n  The ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party [MPRP] held 71 of \n76 seats in the Great Hural, Mongolia's unicameral legislature.\n  U.S. Embassy cable reporting just days before the vote suggested that \nthe democratic opposition parties would be doing well to win 25 seats. \nBut Embassy officials cautioned that their sources believed that was \nsomething of an optimistic projection.\n  Mr. President, the democratic opposition won twice that number of \nseats and assumed majority responsibility for Mongolia's future in the \nprocess.\n  The electoral math confirms that 50 of 76 parliamentary seats were \nwon by the Democratic Union Coalition Party.\n  The former Communist Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party dropped \nfrom 71 to 24 seats in the Great Hural.\n  The MPRP, Mongolia's ruling party since 1923, was unceremoniously\n\n[[Page S7417]]\n\nbounced right out of office. Moreover, leading MPRP officials--the \nForeign Minister, two Deputy Prime Ministers, the Labor Minister, and \nthe head of the MPRP--not only lost majority control, but lost their \nseats in the Great Hural as well.\n  U.S. election observers covered more than 1,000 kilometers making \nnine stops over 2 days observing first hand the careful approach to \npreparations as well as the actual conduct of elections. I believe I \ncan speak for the entire group in stating that Mongolian officials were \nmeticulous in administering the elections.\n  On election day, voter names were checked carefully on the \nregistration rolls; actual ballots were handled with great care and \nefficiency; party representatives were provided unimpeded viewing \naccess at polling stations; all ballot counting procedures were \naccessible to pollwatchers and international observers alike; and many \nvote totals were counted three, four, and five times over for accuracy.\n  Mr. President, though most Mongolians had to cover vast distances on \nfoot or horseback, more than 87 percent of eligible voters turned out \nfor what we observed to be free, fair, and transparent elections, \nwithout a hint of fraud.\n  As election observers, our primary concern involved the process--not \nnecessarily the result--but we could not ignore history being made \nbefore our very eyes.\n  The Democratic Union Coalition offered a political and economic \nprescription that obviously resonated with a broad cross section of the \npopulation, particularly the younger voters from Mongolian herdsmen to \ncity workers in Ulaanbattar.\n  The new coalition party vows to make government more transparent. It \nhopes to strengthen local decision-making, make the judiciary more \nindependent, and accelerate decentralization of the economy.\n  The party endorses privatizing 60 percent of state-owned enterprises \nby the year 2000.\n  It is a very progressive agenda.\n  Mr. President, given the harsh economic and social challenges facing \nMongolia, it will be extremely difficult for the new parliamentarians \nto meet expectations, so our support will be crucial.\n  In our post-election meeting with President Ochirbat on Monday, I \npledged to explore the idea of legislative exchanges that would help \nthe approximately 80 percent of the newly elected Great Hural members \nwho have no prior legislative experience.\n  Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs, Kent \nWiedemann, pledged similar cooperation from the executive branch of our \nGovernment. And former Secretary Baker agreed to encourage renewed \ninternational support from the nations he dealt with when he convened \nthe original Mongolian Donors Group.\n   Mr. President, today, I am submitting a Senate resolution that \ncongratulates the people of Mongolia for: First, embracing democracy in \nthese parliamentary elections; second, conducting free, fair, and \ncredible elections; third, building on the progress of the past and \nmoving further away from their previous dependence on a Communist \nsystem; and fourth, serving as an example to other East Asian countries \nthat the people deserve a voice in choosing their government.\n  That last point is worth keeping in mind.\n  I believe the winds of democratic change are getting stronger in East \nAsia.\n  The Philippines, Cambodia, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan--and now \nMongolia.\n  The trend toward democratization and economic liberalization is \nundeniable. What happened in Mongolia represents a geopolitical step in \nthe right direction for East Asia.\n   Mr. Speaker, the day I left Mongolia, President Ochirbat said to me, \n``Democracy in Mongolia has become irreversible and the people have a \nstrong confidence in it.'' Well we now have a strong confidence in the \npeople of Mongolia, and applaud them for joining the democratic \ncommunity of nations.\n   Mr. President, in closing I would like to offer a brief word of \nthanks to the Asia Foundation, which helped organize this election \nobservation mission, the International Republican Institute for its \nsustained efforts at party-building within Mongolia, and fellow \nelection observers who joined me on the trip.\n  They were: former Secretary of State Jim Baker, current Deputy \nAssistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kent Wiedemann, \nformer Senator Dick Clark, former Congressman Elliot Levitas, M. Graeme \nBannerman, of Bannerman & Associates, Casimir Yost, of the Georgetown \nUniversity Institute of Diplomacy, and David Carroll, of the Carter \nCenter in Atlanta.\n  Our Ambassador in Ulaanbaatar, Donald C. Johnson, deserves special \ncommendation in particular for helping to organize the election \nmonitoring trip. We had an opportunity to visit with voters at various \nsites around the country, and benefited from his and Deputy Chief of \nMission Llewellyn Hedgbett's advice and counsel along the way.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask, if I may, to speak for 1 minute \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am sure I could speak for the Senate \nin expressing our appreciation to the Senator from Virginia for his \nservices as an election observer in that distinguished company, and the \nauspicious outcome. But perhaps not sufficiently noticed, we are \ncreating a new institution in the world--the election observers. I am \nsure they were from more than just the United States--in Ulaanbaatar--\nsomething hardly conceivable 30 years ago and now natural and \nincreasingly important.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/08/senate-section/article/S7416-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7417-S7418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             THE SMALL BUSINESS JOB PROTECTION ACT OF 1996\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       KENNEDY AMENDMENT NO. 4435\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY proposed an amendment to the bill (H.R. 3448) to provide \ntax relief for small businesses, to protect jobs, to create \nopportunities, to increase the take home pay of workers, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike Title II and replace with the following:\n\n                       Title II--Labor Provisions\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the \nChurch Arson Prevention Act of 1996 which passed this body on June 26, \n1996. I applaud the efforts of my colleagues, Senators Faircloth and \nKennedy, in proposing a quick course of action which will take us one \nstep closer to putting an end to these terrible acts on our Nation's \nplaces of worship.\n  Mr. President, since January 1995, there have been 75 fires in \nchurches nationwide. Thirty-six fires have occurred in predominantly \nAfrican-American churches in the Southeast United States. Over the past \nyear and a half, there have been several church burnings in my home \nState of Tennessee, a total of six this year alone. Some of these fires \nmay turn out to be accidents but others were clearly set intentionally. \nIt is my belief that the individuals who set these fires must be \nprosecuted and punished to the fullest extent possible.\n  The people of Tennessee have joined together to help heal the deep \nwounds from the loss of these local churches. Like the people of \nTennessee, the people of America demanded that we pass this \nlegislation. H.R. 3525 demonstrates America's commitment to protecting \nhouses of worship across philosophical and geographical boundaries, but \nmore important, it demonstrates that we are united in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I truly believe that the local authorities are the \nbest resource to investigate and solve these types of crimes. This bill \ndoes not undermine, or in any way suggest, that the local authorities \nare not capable of solving these crimes. Rather, the bill helps to deal \nwith special difficulties involved when criminals move from State to \nState and where Federal assistance and a Federal statute is needed to \nadequately resolve the problem.\n  This bipartisan bill is a tremendous resource to help to rebuild the \nchurches and help law enforcement officials investigate and prosecute \nthose responsible. It has four main components. First, it amends the \nFederal Criminal Code to make it easier to prosecute cases of \ndestruction of religious property. Currently, in cases of destruction \nof religious property, there is a requirement that the damage exceed \n$10,000. Moreover, there is a stringent interstate commerce \nrequirement. This bill eliminates the monetary requirement and replaces \nthe interstate commerce requirement with a more sensible scheme that \nwill expand the scope of a prosecutor's ability to prosecute church \narsons and other acts of religious desecration.\n  The bill also conforms the penalty for church arson and the statute \nof limitations to that of the Federal arson statute, thus raising the \nmaximum potential penalty for church arson from 10 to 20 years and the \nstatute of limitations from 5 to 7 years.\n  The bill also gives HUD authority to use up to $5 million from an \nexisting and already appropriated fund to extend loan guarantees to \nfinancial institutions who make loans to 501(c)(3) organizations that \nhave been damaged as a result of terrorism or arson.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the efforts of private corporations and \nlocal charitable organizations in their efforts to provide the vital \nfunds necessary to help rebuild many of these churches. I would urge \nthat the people of this great country continue to dig deep into their \nown pockets, and continue playing a critical role in helping their \nneighbors to rebuild their local church.\n  In order to help State and local authorities investigate the crimes, \nH.R. 3525 authorizes funding for the Treasury and the Justice \nDepartment to help train local law enforcement officials investigating \nchurch arson.\n  Mr. President, growing up and raising my family in the South, I \nunderstand the role that the local church plays in the lives of the \ncommunity and in the lives of the people of Tennessee. The burnings in \nquestion serve as an attack on one of our Nation's most sacred \ninstitutions. We must act now to put an end to these crimes and to \nbring those responsible to justice.\n  I applaud my colleagues who joined me in supporting H.R. 3525. \nTogether we are sending a clear statement that this type of crime is \nunacceptable and those responsible will be severely punished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/08/senate-section/article/S7418-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7418-S7419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize and congratulate \nthe Colorado Avalanche of the National Hockey League for their \nendeavors in bringing the Stanley Cup to Denver. In the early-morning \nhours of June 11, the Avalanche, in the third overtime, were able to \ndefeat the determined Florida Panthers, a team that has worked \nextremely hard in their 3 years of existence to get to where they are \ntoday. The Panthers, even three games behind in the series, had every \nintention of bringing the Stanley Cup to the Citrus State. No doubt \nMiami Arena was a popular place in the late-spring Florida heat.\n  The Avalanche have been playing in Colorado for only 1 year, and \nalready have become the first professional team in Denver to win a \nmajor national championship. I expect names like Joe Sakic, Peter \nForsberg, and Patrick Roy, will soon join the long list of Colorado's \nathletic heroes, the likes of John Elway, Andres Galarraga, and Rashaan \nSalaam.\n  Coloradans and others in the Rocky Mountain region are used to the \ncold and identify with athletes who make their living on the ice. The \ncrowd of nearly 450,000 fans which lined 17th Street in Denver to greet \ntheir heroes is a testimony to the immense support the Avalanche will \nenjoy for years to come. We are indeed honored to have our State's name \ninscribed on the historic Stanley Cup.\n  I ask that the names of the team members and coaching staff of the \nAvalanche be printed in the Record.\n  The names follow:\n\n\n                       1995-96 Colorado Avalanche\n\n  Rene Corbet, Adam Deadmarsh, Shephane Fiset, Adam Foote, Peter \nForsberg, Alexei Gusarov, Valeri Kamensky, Mike Keane, Jon Klemm, Uwe \nKrupp, Sylvain Lefebvre, Claude\n\n[[Page S7420]]\n\nLemieux, Curtis Leschyshyn, Troy Murray, Sandis Ozolinsh, Mike Ricci, \nPatrick Roy, Warren Rychel, Joe Sakic, Chris Simon, Craig Wolanin, \nStephane Yelle, and Scott Young.\n  Head coach: Marc Crawford; assistant coaches: Jacques Martin and Joel \nQuenneville; goaltending coach: Jacques Cloutier; and general manager: \nPierre Lacroix.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/08/senate-section/article/S7419-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I had intended to ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 374, \nH.R. 2337, which is the taxpayers' bill of rights No. 2. I had thought \nthat there was no objection to this, but I understand perhaps there are \nsome amendments that have been committed to with regard to this \nlegislation. Therefore, the Democratic leader indicated that he could \nnot go along with a unanimous-consent request at this time. So I will \nnot propound that request.\n  But I really regret it, because I do think the taxpayers' bill of \nrights is something that has bipartisan support. It has been pending \nnow for about 6 weeks or more. It has been sort of caught up in the \nminimum wage/small business tax relief issue, and I thought since those \nissues were being unbound here this week that we could take up the \ntaxpayers' bill of rights.\n  I will discuss that with the leader again to see if we can get a \ntight time agreement on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/08/senate-section/article/S7420-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 1745\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
