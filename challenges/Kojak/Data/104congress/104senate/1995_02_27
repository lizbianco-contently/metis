Mr. President, we are hearing a great deal these days \nabout something called the Contract With America. It was constructed by \nthe Republican Party prior to the 1994 election and was designed by \nthem to be a road map or a political device by which they could tell \nthe American people what they stand for and what they hoped to \naccomplish. Some of the contract makes good sense. Some of it continues \nand retains the same kinds of policies that we on the Democratic side \nof the aisle have been pushing for some years. But some parts of the \ncontract make no sense at all.\n  I stand on the Senate floor today to talk about something that soon \nwill come to the floor from the other body as a result of action they \ntook last week. The House Economic and Educational Opportunities \nCommittee passed a bill that repeals the School Lunch Act and replaces \nit with block grants to the States. It also eliminates the requirement \nthat poor children get free school lunches. And, third, it eliminates \nFederal nutrition standards.\n  I say to my friends on other side of the aisle who constructed this \nthat there is reason for us to differ on some things and that there is \nroom to differ on many issues. We, for example, differ on the subject \nof whether this country should build star wars. Some say the Contract \nWith America says, ``let us--despite the fact that the Soviet Union is \ngone, vanished, done--build star wars again. Let us spend tens of \nbillions of dollars building a star wars program.''\n  They also say, ``let us cut taxes; in fact, let us cut taxes and give \nthe majority of the benefits to the rich.'' It will reduce the revenue \nto the Federal Government by three-quarters of a trillion dollars in \nthe next 10 years, if we do what the Contract With America wants us to \ndo on revenues.\n  So there is room to disagree on these proposals. But there is much \nmore room to disagree on another proposal at a time when some are \nsaying, ``let us cut taxes, especially for wealthier Americans, and let \nus build star wars because we apparently have the money to do that.''\n  There is much more room for disagreement on the notion that we ought \nto decide at this time in our country's history to repeal the School \nLunch Act and to eliminate the requirement that the poor children get \nfree school lunches. I can recall--as I told my colleagues last week--\nsitting in a hearing one day and hearing a young boy named David Bright \nfrom New York City. His family had been down and out, down on their \nluck. They had no place to live, so they lived in a homeless shelter. \nHe described for us the rats in the homeless shelter, the living \nconditions, and what it is like for a 9-year-old boy to be hungry in \nschool. What he--this young boy--said to the Hunger Committee when he \ntestified:\n\n        No young boy like me should have to put his head down on \n     his desk at school in the afternoon because it hurts to be \n     hungry.\n\n  It was some years ago that young David told us that. But I have not \nforgotten what he said or how he said it. How many in this Chamber have \never hurt because they were hungry in the afternoon? Not very many, I \nmight say, and probably none. But young children do, if they come from \nfamilies that are disadvantaged. Young children do when they come from \nfamilies with no parents. Young children do when they come from homes \nwithout money to buy breakfast or nutritious lunches.\n  [[Page S3140]] This country in its wisdom created national nutrition \nstandards and created the School Hot Lunch Program. It also created \nanother requirement that I am proud of. It is the requirement that says \npoor children in this country will get free school lunches.\n  There ought not be anyone in this Chamber and there ought not be \nanyone who disagrees with the basic assumption that it is our \nresponsibility to give free school lunches to poor children. If we \ncannot, by looking into the eyes of children, understand the dimensions \nof a public policy that would withhold food from children who are \nhungry, what on Earth can we do that is constructive in this body?\n  I am hoping, when the product--that says in effect that we do not \ncare about poor children and that there is no national requirement \nhere--is sent to us by the House of Representatives under the Contract \nWith America, that all of us have the willingness to stand here in the \nSenate and say, we disagree; poor children matter, America's kids \nmatter.\n  Let me use a couple of quotes just to show you how those who push \nthis Contract With America have changed. In 1982, the current Speaker \nof the House cosponsored a resolution written by then-Representative \nCarl D. Perkins that expressed the sense of the Congress ``that the \nFederal Government should retain primary responsibility for the child \nnutrition programs and such programs should not be included in any \nblock grant.''\n  Well, here we are, turning 180 degrees, running the other direction, \nsaying, Let us just eliminate the requirement. Let us roll it into a \nblock grant. Roll it all together and ship it back to the States so you \ncan have 50 different standards. Maybe one State would say it is not a \nstandard that they care about. Maybe a dozen States would say they do \nnot have the money to feed poor children. Does this country not care \nabout that? I think that is not the case.\n  I think it would be a tragic mistake for us to decide in this body \nthat what is really important in the Contract With America is to build \nstar wars or to give tax cuts to the wealthiest among us, but it is not \nimportant to feed hungry children.\n  I know that when I go back to my office, I will get calls from \nsomeone watching C-SPAN saying that this is not what the contract says. \nBut you had better believe this is what it says, and it is what the \nHouse of Representatives is trying to do. If you decide that we should \neliminate the national requirement that poor children get free school \nlunches, then that is exactly what some mean to do.\n  At least from my standpoint, I hope my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle will say that this makes no sense for this country. It \nignores America's children and it retreats on a national standard that \nmakes eminently good sense. Children matter. Hungry children must have \naccess to free school lunches. It matters to all of us in this country \nto see that is done.\n  This is a fight and a discussion that I am anxious to have in the \ncoming weeks when this bill comes to the Senate,\n because this proposal is something that we should change.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens).

Mr. President, let me commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Dakota for his eloquent remarks just now and identify with \nthem. The Senator from North Dakota commented about the Contract With \nAmerica and its ramifications on school children.\n   What I think some of our colleagues forget is that we have had a \ncontract in this country for a long time with our school children. At \nthe heart of that contract is an understanding about the important role \nthat nutrition plays in educating children today.\n  Our contract with school children grew out of our experience in World \nWar II, when large numbers of young men were unable to serve in the \nmilitary because of nutrition-related childhood illnesses.\n  At the same time, many children were coming to school malnourished, \nand because of that, they were unable to learn; and because they were \nunable to learn, they were unable to become productive citizens.\n   So even back in the 1940's, Americans recognized the direct \nrelationship between nutrition and healthy development and learning. We \nalso recognized that what happens in the lunchroom affects what happens \nin the classroom.\n  In 1946 President Truman signed the National School Lunch Act--not as \na matter of charity but as a matter of national security.\n   What an cruel irony it would be, Mr. President, if in order to \nprevent our children from inheriting a huge debt tomorrow, we would \ntake away their meals today.\n  Yet that is exactly what some of our colleagues would now have us do.\n  We cannot allow that to happen. Either way, whether we saddle our \nchildren with debt tomorrow or rob them of their lunch today, we are \njeopardizing their future, and that is wrong.\n  Let us learn from history. The strength of our Nation is not measured \nonly by armaments. It is also measured by the health and education of \nour children.\n  Talk to the teachers who teach our children. Talk to the men and \nwomen who run the school cafeterias and make their lunches. Talk to the \nparents who depend on those lunches to make sure their children are \nadequately nourished. They will tell you.\n  The reality is that a lot of kids, even today, come to school hungry. \nThe reality is that many of them don't get enough to eat at home and, \nif it weren't for the School Lunch Program, they would be too \nmalnourished to learn.\n  So, Mr. President, this goes beyond simply a matter of nutrition. If \nwe deprive children of a balanced meal, we risk depriving them of their \nability to learn and become productive citizens.\n  What a terrible mistake it would be if, in our attempts to reduce the \nnational debt, we increased our nutritional debt to our children. What \na terrible mistake it would be if, in attempting to brighten our \nfuture, we forgot our past.\n  We understood in Harry Truman's time the critical role nutrition \nplays in children's physical and intellectual development. For nearly \n50 years, we have acknowledged the direct link between nutrition and \neducation, and between education and the ability to be productive \ncitizens.\n  When Americans think about cutting government and redtape, taking \nfood out of the mouths of children is not what they have in mind.\n  This is a provision of the Contract With America, Mr. President, that \nI hope will be short-lived. It denigrates the commitment we have made \nto children, to their education and to their future.\n  As the distinguished Senator from North Dakota has indicated, I hope \nthat we will recognize the fallacies of this shortsighted proposal and \nretain in this Congress and in Congresses to come a genuine commitment \nto America's children and their well-being.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/27/senate-section/article/S3140-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3140-S3142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we are approaching perhaps one of the most \nhistoric moments in the history of the Congress, when tomorrow this \nSenate will vote on the balanced budget amendment. We have not had an \nopportunity to pass a balanced budget amendment of this magnitude since \nmy tenure in the Congress, and I doubt this century. We are very, very \nclose--perhaps only one vote away. I think it is important for the \nSenate to understand, and for Senators to consider, just how critical \nit is that we bring to a final resolution this now 4-week-long debate \non the necessity of a balanced budget.\n  I went back and grabbed a copy of the General Accounting Office \nreport to the Congress, written in 1992, to review what their \nconclusions in a study entitled ``Prompt Action Necessary to Avert \nLong-Term Damage to the Economy.''\n  I will just cite a couple of items from their conclusion. They said, \n``Failure \n[[Page S3141]] to reverse the trends and fiscal policy,'' current \nfiscal policy, ``and the composition of Federal spending will doom \nfuture generations to a stagnating standard of living, will damage the \nUnited States competitiveness and influence in the world and hamper our \nability to address pressing national needs.''\n  In 1992, the General Accounting Office warned the Congress, as it has \nrepeatedly--and as many others have warned--that failure to reverse the \ncurrent trends in how we spend money and the composition of that \nspending will doom future generations. It will doom future generations. \nThey go on to say, ``If not nothing is done to reverse current trends, \ndeficits will explode over the longer term.''\n  Finally, they conclude, ``The economic and political reality is that \nthe Nation cannot continue on the current path.''\n  The discussion over the past 4 weeks in this Senate Chamber has been \non whether or not we continue on the current path, or whether we put in \nplace a device which will cause us to change direction, which will \nfundamentally alter the way in which this Congress addresses the \nspending of taxpayers' dollars, through a constitutional mandate, \nconstitutional direction to balance the Federal budget. That is the \nquestion that is before us.\n  We have heard speeches and we have had many, many amendments saying \nwe need to exempt certain programs from the balanced budget amendment. \nPrimarily, the emphasis, as we have just heard, is: let us not follow \nthe mandates of the contract because it will doom our children. It will \nadversely impact those children. We have had a number of amendments \nsaying let us exempt programs for children from the effect of the \nbalanced budget amendment. But it seems to me that if we are really, \ntruly interested in our children, we will face up to the responsibility \nthat is ours to address this deficit and this national debt--a debt \nwhich has run beyond our control and, as the General Accounting Office \nreports, ``will doom future generations of these children.''\n  The contract was put before the American people, and it outlined a \nnew direction for this Congress and a new direction for this Nation \nthat was overwhelmingly endorsed in the last election. We are going \nforward in an attempt to take a look at the Federal programs as they \ncurrently exist, including those that address children, and ask \nourselves the fundamental questions: Is this the best expenditure of \ntaxpayers dollars? Can we maximize that expenditure with fewer dollars? \nIs this the most efficient way of getting support to the very children \nthat our colleagues were talking about here this morning? When we delve \ninto the record, we find that it is not efficient. There is duplication \nand overlap, waste and mismanagement, and administrative costs that \ndeny benefits to the very people that we are trying to help. Many of \nthese programs were well-intended when they were started.\n  But because the Congress failed to adequately oversee the \nimplementation of these programs, and because we have been in literally \na feeding frenzy over the past couple of decades of adding more and \nmore programs, we end up with an inefficiency in Government that is \nstaggering. This Government spending is driving our deficit and driving \nour national debt to the point where we will have very little, if \nanything, to offer to those children in the future.\n  The Labor and Human Resources Committee on which I serve looked at \njob training and found that there were 163 separate Federal job \ntraining programs. Is job training a worthy goal? Of course, it is. Can \nit be done more efficiently? I think we instinctively understand that \nif there are 163 programs administered by 14 agencies of the Federal \nGovernment that perhaps we can consolidate those and run those programs \nmore efficiently.\n  In child care, a component of the children's programs, there are 93 \nseparate programs of child care administered by 11 different Federal \nagencies, disbursing $11.5 billion a year in targeted programs. Many of \nthose programs overlap. In fact, a child in poverty could theoretically \nqualify for 13 separate child care programs, all providing the same \nbenefit.\n  So the charge to this Congress is: Can you do it better? Can you do \nit more efficiently? Can you do it more effectively? And time after \ntime, year after year, Congress has failed in that responsibility.\n  We are here seeking a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution \nbecause Congress has failed in its responsibility to provide efficient, \neffective management of the programs that it enacts. It has failed to \ncorrectly oversee the spending of taxpayers' dollars to the point \nwhere, in just the last 14 years, we have driven the national debt from \nless than $1 to $4.8 trillion.\n  We are saddling future generations with enormous debt. Each new child \nborn in America bears a cost of nearly $20,000 which will have to be \nrepaid. We are approaching an interest payment alone that exceeds \nvirtually every other category of discretionary domestic spending for \nthe Government. Interest does not go to children's lunches. It does not \nto go child care. It does not go to road investment. It does not go to \ncommunity policing. It does not go to fight crime. It does not go to \nfight drugs and all the other numbers of programs the Federal \nGovernment has been involved in. It simply goes to pay interest, simply \ninterest on the debt. And that interest is going to explode in the \nfuture.\n  If we really care about our children, we will look at where we are \ntoday and say: ``We must change course. We must do something \ndifferently than what we have done before.''\n  We have had all kinds of so-called congressional solutions, \nlegislative solutions, to deal with this deficit. And while we are \ntouting the promise of the latest proposal by the Congress to deal with \nthe deficit, the deficit keeps mounting at a staggering rate.\n  The National Taxpayers Union has estimated that for a child born \ntoday, by the time that child is 18 years old, he or she will have \naccumulated $103,000 in extra taxes over his or her lifetime because of \nthe debt. Today's debt burden is over 10 times more than the debt \ntoday's adults inherited from their parents. Let me repeat that. The \ndebt that I inherited from my parents is one-tenth of what my children \nwill inherit from me.\n  The National Taxpayers Union goes on to say:\n\n       Our children and grandchildren will pay. In many ways--not \n     just in extra taxes. But in higher interest rates. Less \n     affordable homes. Fewer jobs. Lower wages. Decaying \n     infrastructure. Meager retirement incomes. A debt-burdened \n     Government unable to afford programs and benefits Americans \n     now take for granted.\n\n  The very programs that our colleagues were talking about--the School \nLunch Programs, the Child Care Programs that go to benefit children and \nwhich we now take for granted--will become completely unaffordable by \nan increasing debt-burdened Government.\n  Thomas Jefferson left us with words of wisdom that we have not \nfollowed, and that we need to ponder as we come to a decision about how \nwe are going to vote on this balanced budget amendment. He said:\n\n       The question of whether one generation has the right to \n     bind another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of Government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts, and be morally bound to pay \n     for them ourselves.\n\n  We are entrusted with a unique privilege and responsibility as \nMembers of the U.S. Senate. We should heed the words of Jefferson that \nsay we should be morally bound to pay our own debts.\n  What right do we have to enjoy a standard of living now and simply \ndump the payment for that standard of living on to our children and our \ngrandchildren? What right do we have to do that? It is immoral to do \nthat. We should, as Jefferson said, be morally bound to pay for what we \nspend. And we have not done that. We have not done that in small \nmargins, we have not done that in massive margins.\n  We have expanded our national debt from less than $1 trillion in 1980 \nto nearly $5 trillion in 1994. We have quintupled it in 15 years. We \nhave quintupled the debt that took 200 years to accumulate prior to \nthat.\n  And so, as Members contemplate their vote, I hope they would see the \nextraordinary implications of this vote. If the balanced budget \namendment fails, I fear we will not have another opportunity to address \nthe primary and fundamental issue facing this \n[[Page S3142]] Nation. If it passes, we will begin a process of doing \nwhat we were elected to do in the first place--of determining \npriorities, of establishing ways in which the taxpayers' dollar can be \nspent in effective, efficient ways. We will have to go into every \nprogram, every program of Government, to ask ourselves the fundamental \nquestion: Is this the best way we can spend this money? Is this the \nhighest priority for this money? Is there a more efficient way to do \nit? It is a question, as Jefferson said, of such consequence to place \nit among the fundamental principles of Government.\n  It is wrong. It is wrong for us to continue this course.\n  We have a choice before us tomorrow evening that will fundamentally \nalter the way we do business. We have proven our incapacity to be \ncareful stewards of the Nation's debt, careful stewards of the Nation's \nearnings, careful stewards of the future of this country for our \nchildren's sakes, for our grandchildren's sakes, for future \ngenerations' sakes.\n  Let us do what we all know we need to do--save us from ourselves. \nGive us a tool which will allow us to balance that budget and once and \nfor all end this practice of saddling posterity with our debts.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was concerned over the weekend as I read \nsome of the items on both the balanced budget amendment and the pending \nresolution, House Joint Resolution 1.\n  I was in a debate over the weekend on this balanced budget amendment \non television and other areas. I have been asked questions about some \nof the issues involving child nutrition.\n  Now, the area of child nutrition, Mr. President--I may or may not \nhave expertise in some areas in this body--I do believe I have an \nexpertise in that area. As both chairman and as ranking member of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee, and before that as a member, I have had a \nprimary responsibility handling our child nutrition programs. I have \ndone this in Republican administrations and Democratic administrations. \nI have done it with both Republican and Democratic cosponsors.\n  In fact, I might say that since the Truman administration, both \nRepublicans and Democrats have strongly backed the School Lunch \nProgram. The distinguished occupant of the chair may recall when this \nprogram began. It began right after World War II. President Truman \nrealized that thousands of military recruits were turned down, even at \na time of war, because of malnutrition and nutrition-related medical \nproblems.\n  Now, I am afraid, Mr. President, the House Republicans want to end \nthis 50-year tradition. They want to repeal the School Lunch Act. \nActually, I believe they want to do that as part of this overall \nContract With America, which includes the balanced budget amendment and \nothers.\n  In fact, in committees last week, the Republican majority in the \nHouse repealed free lunches for school children who cannot afford a \nmeal ticket. They turned their back on the program supported by \nRepublican and Democratic Presidents since the time of Harry Truman. \nThey eliminated national nutrition standards for healthy school \nlunches. Now, that will not make parents of grade school children very \nhappy, but it will make a fortune for soft drink bottlers and their \nPAC's and their lobbyists.\n  Now, Republicans also have taken steps to cut thousands of children \noff child care food programs. They are dismantling the WIC Program. \nMillions of pregnant women, infants and children could be thrown off \nthe WIC Program. In fact, it is the height of hypocrisy when they speak \nof having the Contract With America and the American family when they \nmove to cut the Women, Infants and Children Program, something that \nfeeds pregnant women and feeds their children when they are first born.\n  Not only that, I would say to my colleagues; they removed the so-\ncalled Leahy amendment which required competition among infant formula \nmakers. This competition saved the American taxpayers $975 million a \nyear and allowed more children, more infants, and more pregnant women \nto go on this program. They eliminated that.\n  What does it do? It tells the American taxpayers that that $975 \nmillion, instead of feeding poor hungry children, will go to four major \ndrug companies. It is welfare for the wealthiest. It is denying food to \nthe neediest. It is hypocrisy at its worst, and it is a giveaway to \nmajor political contributors in the most obvious sense.\n  These people have reduced dramatically the chance of low-income \nfamilies to get off welfare. Their cuts in day care funding may mean \nthat thousands of day care homes go out of business. They know the \nchildren are not old enough to vote, so what they have done is target \nthe School Lunch Program, the School Breakfast Program, the child care \nprograms, and WIC. They put back in Meals on Wheels because they \nsuddenly realized that went to older Americans who do vote and may \ncontribute. So they put that back in, but they cut out the children who \ndo not vote.\n  The fine print in the Contract With America is really a contract \nagainst children. It is a contract against mothers and fathers. I \nbelieve it must be stopped. The contract is antichild, antifamily, and \nfalse advertising.\n  I believe, Mr. President, that we ought to look at what they have \ndone. They say they will pass this out in block grants. Of course, they \ndo not put out money for the block grants, and if they do, we know what \nwill be the first thing to be cut. In fact, I must say that one of the \nbest arguments against block granting child nutrition programs have \ncome from Speaker Gingrich and Congressman William Goodling, but, in \nthe past, not when they are here with this unholy contract.\n  Speaker Gingrich has done a complete about-face on these issues. He \ncosponsored a resolution in 1982 stating that the ``Federal Government \nshould retain primary responsibility for the child nutrition programs \nand such programs should not be included in any block grant.''\n  The reasons child nutrition programs should not be included in block \ngrants is best stated by Congressman William Goodling, who is now \nchairman of the House committee. He said that ``a child's basic \nnutrition needs should not vary from State to State,'' and yet we now \nfind that what was true then apparently is not true today when you have \na Contract With America to fulfill, no matter how hypocritical it is, \nno matter how many giveaways to huge campaign contributors and wealthy \ninterests there are.\n  Mr. President, I feel, as does the distinguished senior Senator from \nWest Virginia, that I have one contract with America, and like him, I \ncarry that with me. It is the Constitution of the United States--the \nConstitution of the United States. This is so good, we have only had to \namend it 17 times since the \n[[Page S3143]] Bill of Rights. It has been the framework of the most \npowerful democracy known to history. It has been the framework of a \ndemocracy that, if it keeps to its basic tenets, can last for hundreds \nand hundreds and hundreds of years.\n  I do not like the Republican Contract With America. I think it would \nresult in the largest transfer of benefits and entitlements from \nworking-class families and the middle class to the rich of this \ncountry. I have seen reports that households with incomes over $200,000 \nwould receive an average annual tax entitlement of more than $11,500 by \nthe year 2002, and working-class America will lose. I will fight those \nchanges in the Senate.\n  Since the Truman administration, Republicans and Democrats have \nstrongly backed the School Lunch Program. The Lunch Program began \nbecause thousands of military recruits were turned down in World War II \nbecause of malnutrition and nutrition-related medical problems.\n  Now House Republicans want to end this 50-year tradition and repeal \nthe School Lunch Act. The Republicans keep changing their minds on who \nthey should pick on next--infants, toddlers, pregnant women, or school \nchildren?\n  In committee last week, the Republican majority repealed free lunches \nfor school children who cannot afford a meal ticket.\n  They eliminated national nutrition standards for healthy school \nlunches. That will not make parents of grade school children very \nhappy, but it will make a fortune for the soft drink bottlers.\n  House Republicans also have taken steps to cut thousands of toddlers \noff child care food programs, and they are dismantling the WIC Program. \nMillions of pregnant women, infants and children could be thrown off \nthe WIC Program.\n  House Republicans have reduced dramatically the chance that low-\nincome families can get off welfare--their cuts in day care funding may \nmean that thousands of day care homes go out of business.\n  This makes no sense whatsoever.\n  But, the Republicans know that children are not old enough to vote so \nthey have targeted the School Lunch Program, the School Breakfast \nProgram, child care programs, and WIC.\n  The fine print in the Contract With America is really a contract \nagainst children, and a contract against mothers and fathers. This \nassault on America's families must be stopped.\n  The contract is antichild, antifamily, and false advertising. It \npromises limited block grants, but delivers big cuts.\n  The contract is antitaxpayer as well. The House Republicans on the \ncommittee voted down last week a provision that would save taxpayers $1 \nbillion a year.\n  The WIC Program is required to buy infant formula under competitive \nbidding under a provision I was able to get passed in 1989. That \nprovision puts an additional 1.5 million pregnant women, infants, and \nchildren on WIC at no extra cost to taxpayers--it does this by saving \n$1 billion.\n  Who wins under this Republican scheme? Four giant drug companies that \nmake infant formula. Who loses? Taxpayers, and 1.5 million pregnant \nwomen, infants, and children.\n  At the same time House Republicans are throwing hundreds of millions \nof dollars at these corporate giants, they are proposing to cut free \nlunches to children who cannot afford the cost of a lunch.\n  The best arguments against block granting child nutrition programs \nhave come from Newt Gingrich and Congressman William Goodling.\n  Newt Gingrich has done a complete about-face on these issues. He \ncosponsored a resolution in 1982 stating that the ``Federal government \nshould retain primary responsibility for the child nutrition programs \nand such programs should not be included in any block grant.'' [H. Con. \nRes. 384, which passed on September 29, 1982.]\n  The reasons that child nutrition programs should not be included in \nblock grants was best stated by Congressman William Goodling who is now \nchairman of the House committee that just approved the block grants of \nchild nutrition programs. He said that ``a child's basic nutrition \nneeds do not vary from State to State.'' [Cong. Rec., July 23, 1982, p. \n17865.]\n  The report explaining that resolution, which was sponsored by Newt \nGingrich, said that if you have ``50 distinct State programs, there is \nno guarantee that the needy child whose family income has fallen below \nthe poverty line would be entitled to participation in a free-lunch \nprogram.''\n  The report concluded that Federal child nutrition programs ``should \nnot be turned back to the states or diluted through a block grant at \nreduced funding.'' [Page 4, Hse. Rpt. 97-870, Sept. 24, 1982.]\n  The report explains that block grants do not increase to address \nrecessions, and thus they throw children off the program just when the \nlunch program is most needed.\n  That was true then. It is still true today.\n  Why has Newt Gingrich changed his mind? To understand why you have to \nlook at the whole contract.\n  The Republican Contract With America and the balanced budget \namendment--taken together--would likely result in the largest transfer \nof benefits and entitlements from working-class families and the middle \nclass to the rich in the history of this country. I have seen reports \nthat households with incomes over $200,000 a year would receive an \naverage annual tax entitlement of more than $11,500 by the year 2002. \nAnd the working class will lose.\n  I will fight these changes in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/27/senate-section/article/S3142-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

HALEY\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I would like to share with my colleagues the \nremarks of Commissioner George W. Haley, who was recently invited to \nspeak at Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, TX, in observance of Black \nHistory Month.\n  In his remarks, Commissioner Haley reminds us that the American \nexperiment is indeed working today, despite all the divisions that \nbeset our great Nation. Commissioner Haley's message is one of hope and \noptimism for the future. He understands that America is not perfect, \nbut that injustice and imperfection should inspire us to work harder to \nensure that the American dream can become a reality for all Americans.\n  Commissioner Haley comes from a military family. During World War I, \nhis father was wounded in the Argonne Forest. His brother Alex spent 20 \nyears in the U.S. Coast Guard. His brother Julius is a Korean war \nveteran. And Commissioner Haley himself served his country as a member \nof the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II.\n  We are proud of the Haley family, and we thank them for the important \ncontributions they have made to our country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Commissioner Haley's \nremarks be reprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n     Remarks by Hon. George W. Haley, Postal Rate Commissioner, in \n                   Observance of Black History Month\n\n       Martin Luther King, Jr., liked to tell a story about a \n     minister who was very emotional and dramatic in his \n     presentations. After one of his fiery Sunday morning sermons, \n     a member of his congregation was commenting to one of his \n     friends that afternoon on what a good sermon the minister had \n     preached. His friend asked: ``What did he say?'' The \n     parishioner replied: ``I don't know, but he sure was good!''\n       [[Page S3144]] My friends, it is my intention that my \n     address this evening will be both good and thought provoking.\n       I consider it a great privilege to be invited to speak at \n     this banquet this evening. Before I move on, let me pause for \n     just a moment. General Henderson, I thank you and your staff \n     very much for making this occasion and opportunity possible, \n     and I am glad to be with you tonight.\n       Two prize members of your military family here, Major James \n     Durant and his wife, Karen, are also members of my family. \n     Major Durant, whom we affectionately call Jimmy, and his wife \n     are both a credit to the military and to our Nation--our \n     family is exceedingly proud of them.\n       On May 12, 1946, I was honorably discharged from your \n     predecessor service, the United States Army Air Corps. I had \n     been drafted three years earlier, just two months after my \n     18th birthday, to serve in the Second World War.\n       Being in the service was a rich experience for me. I had \n     come from a rather sheltered environment, and I learned many \n     valuable lessons about life as a young adult in the military. \n     During my entire military career, the United States Army Air \n     Corps, and all of the military forces of the United States, \n     were totally segregated. Squadron F was the segregated \n     squadron to which all African Americans, then called colored \n     Americans, were assigned. Calling an African American \n     ``Black'' at that time--well, those were fighting words. But \n     the meaning of some words changes with time. For instance, \n     then, the word mouse had no computer connotations. When we \n     thought about a mouse, the only mouse we ever hoped to catch \n     was in a trap and not a mouse driving a computer. Mr. Justice \n     Holmes describes changes in meanings and interpretations of \n     words most eloquently in a case before the U.S. Supreme Court \n     in 1918, in which he says:\n       ``A word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged. It is \n     the skin of a living thought, and may vary in circumstances \n     according to the time and place in which it is used.''\n       Everything was not dismal when I was a young man in the \n     military. We were hardy, healthy, young men. We were proud of \n     our country--aware of its inequalities, but willing and ready \n     to defend it against its enemies and those who would threaten \n     it. Our squadron sang the words, ``Off we go into the wild \n     blue yonder, climbing high into the sky * * *,'' with much \n     patriotism--and with gusto and pride.\n       My father served in the Army. He was wounded in the Argonne \n     forest in France during World War I. My brother, Alex, spent \n     20 years in the United States Coast Guard, including the \n     World War II years. Julius, my younger brother, served in the \n     Korean\n      conflict. Dad was proud that he and his three sons were all \n     veterans and had served this Nation. He lost no \n     opportunity to tell you about himself and his children. \n     During his later years, Dad was a very active veterans \n     serving for some years as Commander of the American Legion \n     post in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and in many other capacities \n     until his death at age 83.\n       I have been privileged to travel in all parts of the world, \n     and there is absolutely no place I'd rather claim as a \n     citizen--including the Republic of South Africa, under the \n     magnificent leadership of Nelson Mandela--than the United \n     States of America. But in spite of the sentiments of Oscar \n     Hammerstein's famous song, ``Summertime, and the Livin' is \n     Easy,'' which, as you know, is from the beloved American \n     classic, George Gershwin's opera, ``Porgy and Bess,'' the \n     lives of African Americans have never been easy.\n       As I grow older, I feel more the urge to express my \n     thoughts and to articulate some of the challenges which I \n     believe confront young Americans--and more specifically, \n     young African Americans. I want to share with you, as we \n     consider your African-American heritage celebration this \n     year, my interpretation and reaction to the incredible story \n     of African Americans since we were brought to this country \n     early in the 17th century. But I also want to stress how all \n     of us can be proactive and accept the opportunities, \n     challenges, and responsibilities to make this Nation and the \n     world a better, safer, more humane place for the great \n     experiment our Nation represents to continue.\n       It has been said that history is important only as it \n     relates to the present and the future. From the evils of \n     slavery came the Dred Scott case. The Dred Scott case was \n     decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1856. It still \n     amazes me when I read portions of it. The Nation's highest \n     court found that a slave was not a person--that a slave was \n     simply personal property--and could be sold like a pig or cow \n     or mule.\n       Just a bit more than a decade after this case the era in \n     our Nation's history which is the theme of your celebration \n     here this year. Specifically, we are reflecting on the lives \n     and philosophies of three Americans: Frederick Douglass, WEB \n     DuBois, and Booker T. Washington. The influence of these \n     three men continues to be felt, not only on the domestic \n     front, but increasingly on the international scene as well.\n       There is no statement by Frederick Douglass that is more \n     compelling and meaningful than when he states:\n       ``We Negroes are here, and here we are likely to be. To \n     imagine that we shall ever be eradicated is absurd and \n     ridiculous. We can be remodified, changed and assimilated, \n     but never extinguished. We repeat, therefore, that we are \n     here; and that this is our country. We shall neither die out, \n     nor be driven out, but shall go forth with this people, \n     either as a testimony against them, or as an evidence in \n     their favor throughout their generations.''\n       Booker T. Washington advocated a doctrine which suggested \n     that Blacks and whites could both prosper, but live in \n     separate communities. This doctrine was calculated to appeal \n     to whites. DuBois was more the carrier of Douglass's \n     tradition towards an integrationist position. We can conclude \n     from the debates between DuBois and Washington that in the \n     making of history no individual has all of the answers--only \n     God has all the answers. Life for all of us--Black and white; \n     Asian, Native American, and Hispanic--is a compromise. We \n     influence each other--as individuals, within the races, \n     within the Nation.\n       Benjamin Elijah Mays, an eminent theologian, philosopher, \n     educator--and for many years the President of Morehouse \n     College from which I graduated--used to tell us when I was a \n     student there:\n       ``Train your minds while you are young. For the man who \n     out-thinks you, rules you.''\n       One of Dr. Mays' many other sources of inspiration were the \n     writings of the Apostle Paul, from the Christian tradition. \n     Specifically, he enjoyed Paul's letter to the church at Rome. \n     In that epistle, Paul wrote:\n       ``Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by \n     the renewal of your mind.''\n       And what can we say about this age? Our society and our \n     communities in many areas of this Nation have become \n     frightening. We don't need to cite isolated events; they \n     abound all over the Nation--in big cities as well as small \n     towns. Soaring homicide rates for young African-American men \n     in center cities now commonly referred to as ``war zones.'' \n     There are more Blacks in prison than in college. Displays of \n     profanity and sexuality abound, masquerading as free speech \n     and ``the language of the people.'' The society in which we \n     presently live would have given my grandmother apoplexy. I \n     know that most of you are deeply troubled--as am I--by this \n     chaotic state of affairs. We are reminded today, more than \n     ever, that the mind is a terrible thing to waste. Is it not \n     time for us to transform the entire political process by the \n     renewal of our minds?\n       Don't be afraid to think and to act! And don't be afraid to \n     change. The art of politics is power, and the ability to use \n     it wisely.\n       In Shakespeare's ``King Lear,'' one of the characters \n     describes a politician as having few or no principles--a man \n     who speaks without redeeming purpose while practicing his \n     ``oily art.'' I certainly would not consider all who are \n     politicians to be practitioners of the ``oily art''--the \n     political process can be used for good or for bad, liberation \n     or oppression. I urge you to use it well!\n       Many of you have brilliant minds. Use them. The economic \n     and political world in our democracy is based on power and \n     the wise use of political and business acumen--not race.\n       You must use your minds, because:\n       While you are here in the military, you have great \n     opportunities for further preparedness.\n       Some of you will move on from military service into \n     civilian life, still at very young and productive ages.\n       You need to prepare for further contributions.\n       Our country and the world need you.\n       You can continue your educations here. Many American \n     colleges and universities have excellent correspondence \n     programs for advancing your formal training.\n       You can hone your skills--become more proficient--not just \n     getting-by or getting-over.\n       You must strive for excellence in whatever your \n     responsibilities are.\n       You should be satisfied only after you have given your best \n     and done your best.\n       We know that African Americans play with a stacked deck in \n     America. Things are not always equal. Opportunities can \n     appear and, just as suddenly, disappear. Such is the nature \n     of the world in which we live. You cannot always control \n     situations, but you can\n      control your response. When slapped down, get up. When up, \n     don't forget--help someone else. As you grow in strength, \n     so does the Nation.\n       There is much discussion about affirmative action in the \n     Nation today. General Colin Powell recently stated:\n       ``Nowhere in corporate America can it be said, as it can be \n     said in the military, that a person is judged by his merit \n     and his character and can supervise and command troops \n     everyday at every level from corporal to general.''\n       You, here in the military, are very much aware of the \n     opportunities that affirmative action can bring about, but \n     the discussion is also divisive and unsettling in many \n     quarters. There is grave need to encourage and stimulate as \n     much of the citizen ability as possible for the good of the \n     entire Nation.\n       Affirmative action was initially designed to help make a \n     level playing field for a race crippled socially, culturally, \n     and economically from generations of unequal treatment. It \n     was certainly never designed to take away any opportunities \n     from white Americans by giving preference to underserving \n     minorities. Rather it was designed to enable African \n     Americans--and, subsequently, other minorities and women--to \n     compete in education and industry for the betterment of the \n     entire Nation. When I was growing up in the South, public \n     schools for whites received the new text books and new \n     science and laboratory \n     [[Page S3145]] equipment, while the Black schools invariably \n     inherited the used books and old equipment.\n       It is not questioned that there have been some abuses along \n     the way of what the basic intentions of affirmative action \n     are. Admittedly, some of its policies and remedies need \n     reexamination. It cannot be challenged, however, that America \n     is a better, stronger country when all of its citizens are \n     able to compete and contribute. And this is the purpose of \n     affirmative action!\n       Never let anybody convince you that you are inferior--the \n     Bell Curve and anybody else's curve notwithstanding! Many \n     whites are conditioned to think they are superior to African \n     Americans and some African Americans are conditioned to think \n     they are inferior. This is a most unfortunate myth. If \n     intellect, survival, and progress of this Nation were based \n     solely on skin color, this Nation would not be nearly so \n     strong and vibrant.\n       Don't deal with these misconceptions in a hostile manner, \n     even with those who seek to use African Americans as \n     scapegoats. Most African Americans, male and female, cringed \n     with fear as the Nation sought the head of a nonexistent \n     Black male so vividly described by the distraught Susan Smith \n     of Union, South Carolina, when, in fact, she, herself, had \n     driven her two little boys down a ramp to their deaths in a \n     lake. That was the same sort of apprehension when Charles \n     Stuart of Boston, Massachusetts, said his wife was murdered \n     by a Black man and he, himself, had done it.\n       Much of the madness which has developed in inner cities is, \n     in fact, caused by a deep frustration of racial overtones in \n     this Nation. We as a Nation simply must recognize it, and \n     continue to seek solutions to solve our problems, not letting \n     this madness consume us. This is a national problem, and \n     white suburbia dare not keep its doors locked as if it didn't \n     exist.\n       Even against these odds, African Americans have made untold \n     contributions. Across America and throughout its history--\n     whether in arts, literature, sports, science, politics, \n     business, military--we have seen heroes. From Crispus Attucks \n     to Colin Powell, we have witnessed incredible African-\n     American contributions. African Americans have--indeed--\n     assimilated into the American culture and strongly influenced \n     many of its institutions. There is absolutely no end of \n     contributors: Michael Jackson, Oprah Winfrey, Ed Brooke, \n     Douglas Wilder, Marian Anderson, Benjamin O. Davis, Mary \n     McLeod Bethune, Malcolm X, Jesse Jackson, Maya Angelou, \n     Jackie Robinson, Joe Louis, Andrew Young, Roland Hayes, \n     Sojourner Truth, and many, many others.\n       But do you know what? While it is easy to find fault, and \n     while shortcomings abound, what Alexis de Tocqueville long \n     ago called America's experiment in government is working! In \n     so many situations, people from many ethnic backgrounds work \n     together for a common purpose. Just as I have seen divisions \n     based on color in my lifetime, so have I seen rich and \n     rewarding diversity at work. And I think you also have seen \n     what I am talking about. As a Nation, we can do better--we \n     must do better, but maybe--just maybe--we are getting better.\n       My final question for you is: Where do you fit into this \n     great American experiment--into this American dream? Have you \n     ever seriously thought about it? You are unique. There is \n     absolutely nobody else in all the world like you. No other \n     person can offer the world what you can!\n       I leave you with the challenge as we reflect on this Black \n     history observance this year. What will you do to keep this \n     country strong and safe--this country we all are proud to \n     call home?\n       I thank you!\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/27/senate-section/article/S3143-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3145-S3147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nCHERISHING THE IRISH DIASPORA--PRESIDENT MARY ROBINSON'S ADDRESS TO THE \n                            IRISH PARLIAMENT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 1995 marks the beginning of the 150th \nanniversary of the Great Irish Famine. Many of the 70 million men, \nwomen, and children of Irish descent around the world today, including \n44 million Irish-Americans, are part of the Irish diaspora which the \nfamine caused.\n  Earlier this month, President Mary Robinson of Ireland addressed both \nHouses of the Irish Parliament on the famine and on the larger subject \nof the Irish diaspora and the modern meaning of ``Irishness'' for \npeoples and communities everywhere. I believe that President Robinson's \neloquent address will be of interest to all of us in Congress and I ask \nunanimous consent that it may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the address was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Cherishing the Irish Diaspora--Address to the Houses of the Oireachtas\n\n                      (By President Mary Robinson)\n       Four years ago I promised to dedicate my abilities to the \n     service and welfare of the people of Ireland. Even then I was \n     acutely aware of how broad that term ``the people of \n     Ireland'' is and how it resisted any fixed or narrow \n     definition. One of my purposes here today is to suggest that, \n     far from seeking to categorize or define it, we widen it \n     still further to make it as broad and inclusive as possible.\n       At my inauguration I spoke of the seventy million people \n     worldwide who can claim Irish descent. I also committed my \n     Presidency to cherishing them--even though at the time I was \n     thinking of doing so in a purely symbolic way. Nevertheless \n     the simple emblem of a light in the window, for me, and I \n     hope for them, signifies the inextinguishable nature of our \n     love and remembrance on this island for those who leave it \n     behind.\n       But in the intervening four years something has occurred in \n     my life which I share with many deputies and senators here \n     and with most Irish families. In that time I have put faces \n     and names to many of those individuals.\n       In places as far apart as Calcutta and Toronto, on a number \n     of visits to Britain and the United States, in cities in \n     Tanzania and Hungary and Australia, I have met young people \n     from throughout the island of Ireland who felt they had no \n     choice but to emigrate. I have also met men and women who may \n     never have seen this island but whose identity with it is \n     part of their own self-definition. Last summer, in the city \n     of Cracow, I was greeted in Irish by a Polish student, a \n     member of the Polish-Irish Society. In Zimbabwe I learned \n     that the Mashonaland Irish Association had recently \n     celebrated its centenary. In each country I visited I have \n     met Irish communities, often in far-flung places, and \n     listened to stories of men and women whose pride and \n     affection for Ireland have neither deserted them nor deterred \n     them from dedicating their loyalty and energies to other \n     countries and cultures. None are a greater source of pride \n     than the missionaries and aid workers who bring such \n     dedication, humour and practical common sense to often very \n     demanding work. Through this office, I have been a witness to \n     the stories these people and places have to tell.\n       The more I know of these stories the more it seems to me an \n     added richness of our heritage that Irishness is not simply \n     territorial. In fact Irishness as a concept seems to me at \n     its strongest when it reaches out to everyone on this island \n     and shows itself capable of honouring and listening to those \n     whose sense of identity, and whose cultural values, may be \n     more British than Irish. It can be strengthened again if we \n     turn with open minds and hearts to the array of people \n     outside Ireland for whom this island is a place of origin. \n     After all, emigration is not just a chronicle of sorrow and \n     regret. It is also a powerful story of contribution and \n     adaptation. In fact, I have become more convinced each year \n     that this great narrative of dispossession and belonging, \n     which so often had its origins in sorrow and leave-taking, \n     has become--with a certain amount of historic irony--one of \n     the treasures of our society. If that is so then our relation \n     with the diaspora beyond our shores is one which can instruct \n     our society in the values of diversity, tolerance, and fair-\n     mindedness.\n       To speak of our society in these terms is itself a \n     reference in shorthand to the vast distances we have traveled \n     as a people. This island has been inhabited for more than \n     five thousand years. It has been shaped by pre-Celtic \n     wanderers, by Celts, Vikings, Normans, Hugenots, Scottish and \n     English settlers. Whatever the rights or wrongs of history, \n     all those people marked this island: down to the small detail \n     of the distinctive ship-building of the Vikings, the linen-\n     making of the Hugenots, the words of Planter balladeers. How \n     could we remove any one of these things from what\n      we call our Irishness? Far from wanting to do so, we need to \n     recover them so as to deepen our understanding.\n       Nobody knows this more than the local communities \n     throughout the island of Ireland who are retrieving the \n     history of their own areas. Through the rediscovery of that \n     local history, young people are being drawn into their past \n     in ways that help their future. These projects not only \n     generate employment; they also regenerate our sense of who we \n     were. I think of projects like the Ceide Fields in Mayo, \n     where the intriguing agricultural structures of settlers from \n     thousands of years ago are being explored through scholarship \n     and field work. Or Castletown House in Kildare where the \n     grace of our Anglo-Irish architectural heritage is being \n     restored with scrupulous respect for detail. The important \n     excavations at Navan fort in Armagh are providing us with \n     vital information about early settlers whose proved existence \n     illuminates both legend and history. In Ballance House in \n     Antrim the Ulster-New Zealand Society have restored the \n     birthplace of John Ballance, who became Prime Minister of New \n     Zealand and led that country to be the first in the world to \n     give the vote to women.\n       Varied as these projects may seem to be, the reports they \n     bring us are consistently challenging in that they may not \n     suite any one version of ourselves. I for one welcome that \n     challenge. Indeed, when we consider the Irish migrations of \n     the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th centuries our pre-conceptions \n     are challenged again. There is a growing literature which \n     details the fortunes of the Irish in Europe and later in \n     Canada, America, Australia, Argentina. These important \n     studies of migration have the power to surprise us. They also \n     demand from us honesty and self-awareness in return. If we \n     expect that the mirror held up to us by Irish communities \n     abroad will show us a single familiar identity, or a pure \n     strain of Irishness, we will be \n     [[Page S3146]] disappointed. We will overlook the fascinating \n     diversity of culture and choice which looks back at us. Above \n     all we will miss the chance to have that dialogue with our \n     own diversity which this reflection offers us.\n       This year we begin to commemorate the Irish famine which \n     started 150 years ago. All parts of this island--north and \n     south, east and west--will see their losses noted and \n     remembered, both locally and internationally. This year we \n     will see those local and global connections made obvious in \n     the most poignant ways. But they have always been there.\n       Last year, for example, I went to Grosse Isle, an island on \n     the St. Lawrence river near Quebec city. I arrived in heavy \n     rain and as I looked at the mounds which, together with white \n     crosses, are all that mark the mass graves of the five \n     thousand or more Irish people who died there, I was struck by \n     the sheer power of commemoration. I was also aware that, even \n     across time and distance, tragedy must be seen as human and \n     not historic, and that to think of it in national terms alone \n     can obscure that fact. And\n      as I stood looking at Irish graves, I was also listening to \n     the story of the French Canadian families who braved fever \n     and shared their food, who took the Irish into their homes \n     and into their heritage.\n       Indeed, the woman who told me that story had her own \n     origins in the arrival at Grosse Ile. She spoke to me in her \n     native French and, with considerable pride, in her inherited \n     Irish. The more I have travelled the more I have seen that \n     the Irish language since the famine has endured in the \n     accents of New York and Toronto and Sydney, not to mention \n     Camden Town. As such it is an interesting record of survival \n     and adaptation. But long before that, it had standing as a \n     scholarly European language. The Irish language has the \n     history of Europe off by heart. It contains a valuable record \n     of European culture from before the Roman conquest there. It \n     is not surprising therefore that it is studied today in \n     universities from Glasgow to Moscow and from Seattle to \n     Indiana. And why indeed should I have been surprised to have \n     been welcomed in Cracow in Irish by a Polish student? I take \n     pleasure and pride in hearing Irish spoken in other countries \n     just as I am moved to hear the rhythms of our songs and our \n     poetry finding a home in other tongues and other traditions. \n     It proves to me what so many Irish abroad already know: that \n     Ireland can be loved in any language.\n       The weight of the past, the researches of our local \n     interpreters and the start of the remembrance of the famine \n     all, in my view, point us towards a single reality: that \n     commemoration is a moral act, just as our relation in this \n     country to those who have left it is a moral relationship. We \n     have too much at stake in both not to be rigorous.\n       We cannot have it both ways. We cannot want a complex \n     present and still yearn for a simple past. I was very aware \n     of that when I visited the refugee camps in Somalia and more \n     recently in Tanzania\n      and Zaire. The thousands of men and women and children who \n     came to those camps were, as the Irish of the 1840s were, \n     defenseless in the face of catastrophe. Knowing our own \n     history, I saw the tragedy of their hunger as a human \n     disaster. We, of all people, know it is vital that it be \n     carefully analyzed so that their children and their \n     children's children be spared that ordeal. We realize that \n     while a great part of our concern for their situation, as \n     Irish men and women who have a past which includes famine, \n     must be at practical levels of help, another part of it \n     must consist of a humanitarian perspective which springs \n     directly from our self-knowledge as a people. Famine is \n     not only humanly destructive, it is culturally \n     disfiguring. The Irish who died at Grosset Isle were men \n     and women with plans and dreams of future achievements. It \n     takes from their humanity and individuality to consider \n     them merely as victims.\n       Therefore it seemed to me vital, even as I watched the \n     current tragedy in Africa, that we should uphold the dignity \n     of the men and women who suffer there by insisting there are \n     no inevitable victims. It is important that in our own \n     commemoration of famine, such reflections have a place. As \n     Tom Murphy has eloquently said in an introduction to his play \n     FAMINE: ``a hungry and demoralized people becomes silent''. \n     We cannot undo the silence of our own past, but we can lend \n     our voice to those who now suffer. To do so we must look at \n     our history, in the light of this commemoration, with a clear \n     insight which exchanges the view that we were inevitable \n     victims in it, for an active involvement in the present \n     application of its meaning. We can examine in detail \n     humanitarian relief then and relate it to humanitarian relief \n     now and assess the inadequacies of both. And this is not just \n     a task for historians. I have met children in schools and men \n     and women all over Ireland who make an effortless and \n     sympathetic connection between our past suffering and the \n     present tragedies of hunger in the world. One of the common \n     bonds between us and our diaspora can be to share this \n     imaginative way of re-interpreting the past. I am certain \n     that they, too, will feel that the best possible \n     commemoration of the men and women who died in that famine, \n     who were cast up on other shores because of it, is to take \n     their dispossession into the present with us, to help others \n     who now suffer in a similar way.\n       Therefore I welcome all initiatives being taken during this \n     period of commemoration, many of which can be linked with \n     those abroad, to contribute to the study and understanding of \n     economic vulnerability. I include in that all the \n     illustrations of the past which help us understand the \n     present. In the Famine Museum in Strokestown, there is a \n     vivid and careful re-telling of what happened during the \n     Famine. When we stand in front of those images I believe we \n     have a responsibility to understand them in human terms now, \n     not just in Irish terms then. They should inspire us to be a \n     strong voice in the analysis of the cause and the cure of \n     conditions that predispose to world hunger, whether that \n     involves\n      us in the current debate about access to adequate water \n     supplies or the protection of economic migrants. We need \n     to remember that our own diaspora was once vulnerable on \n     both those counts. We should bear in mind that an analysis \n     of sustainable development, had it existed in the past, \n     might well have saved some of our people from the tragedy \n     we are starting to commemorate.\n       I chose the title of this speech-cherishing the Irish \n     diaspora--with care. Diaspora, in its meaning of dispersal or \n     scattering, includes the many ways, not always chosen, that \n     people have left this island. To cherish is to value and to \n     nurture and support. If we are honest we will acknowledge \n     that those who leave do not always feel cherished. As Eavan \n     Boland reminds us in her poem ``The Emigrant Irish'':\n\n     ``Like oil lamps we put them out the back,\n     ``Of our houses, of our minds.''\n\n       To cherish also means that we are ready to accept new \n     dimensions of the diaspora. Many of us over the years--and I \n     as President--have direct experience of the warmth and \n     richness of the Irish-American contribution and tradition, \n     and its context in the hospitality of that country. I am also \n     aware of the creation energies of these born on this island \n     who are now making their lives in the United States and in so \n     many other countries. We need to accept that in their new \n     perspectives may well be a critique of our old ones. But if \n     cherishing the diaspora is to be more than a sentimental \n     regard for those who leave our shores, we should not only \n     listen to their voice and their viewpoint. We have a \n     responsibility to respond warmly to their expressed desire \n     for appropriate fora for dialogue and interaction with us by \n     examining in an open and generous way the possible linkages. \n     We should accept that such a challenge is an education in \n     diversity which can only benefit our society.\n       Indeed there are a variety of opportunities for co-\n     operation on this island which will allow us new ways to \n     cherish the diaspora. Many of those opportunities can be \n     fruitfully explored by this oireachtas. Many will be taken \n     further by local communities. Some are already in operation. \n     Let me mention just one example here. One of the most \n     understandable and poignant concerns of any diaspora is to \n     break the silence: to find out the names and places or \n     origin. If we are to cherish them, we have to assist in that \n     utterly understandable human longing. The Irish Genealogical \n     Project, which is supported by both governments, is \n     transferring handwritten records from local registers of \n     births, deaths and marriages, on to computer. It uses modern \n     technology to allow men and women, whose origins are written \n     down in records from Kerry to Antrim, to gain access to them. \n     In the process it provides employment and training for young \n     people in both technology and history. And the recent \n     establishment of a council of genealogical organizations, \n     again involving both parts of this island, shows the \n     potential, for voluntary co-operation.\n       I turn now to those records which are still only being \n     written. No family on this island can be untouched by the \n     fact that so many of our young people leave it. The reality \n     is that we have lost, and continue every day to lose, their \n     presence and their brightness. These young people leave \n     Ireland to make new lives in demanding urban environments. As \n     well as having to search for jobs, they may well find \n     themselves lonely, homesick, unable to speak the language of \n     those around them; and if things do not work out, unwilling \n     to accept the loss of face of returning home. It hardly \n     matters at that point whether they are graduate or unskilled. \n     What matters is that they should have access to the support \n     and advice they need. It seems to me, therefore, that one of \n     the best ways to cherish the diaspora is to begin at home. We \n     need to integrate into our educational and social and \n     counselling services an array of skills of adaptation and a \n     depth of support which will prepare them for this first \n     gruelling challenge of adulthood.\n       The urgency of this preparation, and its outcome, allow me \n     an opportunity to pay tribute to the voluntary agencies who \n     respond with such practical compassion and imagination to the \n     Irish recently arrived in other countries. I have welcomed \n     many of their representatives to Aras an Uachtarain and I \n     have also seen their work in cities such as New York and \n     Melbourne and Manchester, where their response on a day-to-\n     day basis may be vital to someone who has newly arrived. It \n     is hard to overestimate the difference which personal warmth \n     and wise advice, as well as practical support, can make in \n     these situations.\n       I pay a particular tribute to those agencies in Britain--\n     both British and Irish--whose generous support and services, \n     across a whole range of needs have been recognized by \n     successive Irish governments through the Dion project. These \n     services extend across employment, housing and welfare and \n     make a practical link between Irish people and the future \n     they are constructing in a new environment. Compassionate \n     assistance is given, not simply to the young and newly \n     arrived, \n     [[Page S3147]] but to the elderly, the sick including those \n     isolated by HIV or AIDS, and those suffering hardship through \n     alcohol or drug dependency or who are in prison. Although I \n     think of myself as trying to keep up with this subject, I \n     must say I was struck by the sheer scale of the effort which \n     has been detailed in recent reports published under the \n     auspices of the Federation of Irish Societies. These show a \n     level of concern and understanding which finds practical \n     expression every day through these agencies and gives true \n     depth to the meaning of the word cherish.\n       When I was a student, away from home, and homesick for my \n     family and my friends and my country, I walked out one \n     evening and happened to go into a Boston newsagent's shop. \n     There, just at the back of the news stand, almost to my \n     disbelief, was ``The Western People.'' I will never forget \n     the joy with which I bought it and\n      took it back with me and found, of course, that the river \n     Moy was still there and the Cathedral was still standing. \n     I remember the hunger with which I read the news from \n     home. I know that story has a thousand versions. But I \n     also know it has a single meaning. Part of cherishing must \n     be communication. The journey which an Irish newspaper \n     once made to any point outside Ireland was circumscribed \n     by the limits of human travel. In fact, it replicated the \n     slow human journey through ports and on ships and \n     airplanes. Now that journey can be transformed, through \n     modern on-line communications, into one of almost \n     instantaneous arrival.\n       We are at the centre of an adventure in human information \n     and communication greater than any other since the invention \n     of the printing press. We will see our lives changed by that. \n     We still have time to influence the process and I am glad to \n     see that we in Ireland are doing this. In some cases this may \n     merely involve drawing attention to what already exists. The \n     entire Radio 1 service of RTE is now transmitted live over \n     most of Europe on the Astra satellite. In North America we \n     have a presence through the Galaxy satellite. There are \n     several internet providers in Ireland and bulletin boards \n     with community database throughout the island. The magic of \n     E-mail surmounts time and distance and cost. And the splendid \n     and relatively recent technology of the World Wide Web means \n     that local energies and powerful opportunities of access are \n     being made available on the information highway.\n       The shadow of departure will never be lifted. The grief of \n     seeing a child or other family member leave Ireland will \n     always remain sharp and the absence will never be easy to \n     bear. But we can make their lives easier if we use this new \n     technology to being the news from home. As a people, we are \n     proud of our story-telling, our literature, our theatre, our \n     ability to improvise with words. And there is a temptation to \n     think that we put that at risk if we espouse these new forms \n     of communications. In fact we can profoundly enrich the \n     method of contact by the means of expression, and we can and \n     should--as a people who have a painful historic experience of \n     silence and absence--welcome and use the noise, the \n     excitement, the speed of contact and the sheer exuberance of \n     these new forms.\n       This is the second time I have addressed the two Houses of \n     the Oireachtas as provided under the Constitution. I welcome \n     the opportunity it has given me to highlight this important \n     issue at a very relevant moment for us all. The men and women \n     of our diaspora represent not simply a series of departures \n     and losses. They remain, even while absent, a precious \n     reflection of our own growth and change, a precious reminder \n     of the many strands of identity which compose our story. They \n     have come, either now or in the past, from Derry and Dublin \n     and Cork and Belfast. They know the names of our townlands \n     and villages. They remember our landscape or they have heard \n     of it. They look at us anxiously to include them in our sense \n     of ourselves and not to forget their contribution while we \n     make our own. The debate about how to best engage their \n     contribution with our own has many aspects and offers \n     opportunities for new structures and increased contact.\n       If I have been able to add something to this process of \n     reflection and to encourage a more practical expression of \n     the concerns we share about our sense of ourselves at home \n     and abroad then I am grateful to have had your attention here \n     today. Finally, I know this Oireachtas will agree with me \n     that the truest way of cherishing our diaspora is to offer \n     them, at all times, the reality of this island as a place of \n     peace where the many diverse traditions in which so many of \n     them have their origins, their memories, their hopes are \n     bound together in tolerance and understanding.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/27/senate-section/article/S3145-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO LINDA WARD-THOMAS\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated \nservant of the people of the United States. Linda Ward-Thomas, who has \nan outstanding record of public service, was tragically killed in an \nauto accident February 7, 1995, near the family home of Fishtail MT. \nShe is survived by her husband, Burt, and her parents, Thomas and Ethel \nWard of Hysham, MT. Burt Williams is currently with the Bureau of Land \nManagement.\n  According to the Billings Gazette,\n\n       Linda was definitely an individual. She was born June 12, \n     1947, the daughter of Tom and Ethel Ward, and attended \n     schools in Hysham, Billings and Missoula in Montana, \n     culminating in a master's degree in anthropology at the \n     University of Colorado, working toward a Ph.D.\n       Linda started professional life as an Old World \n     archaeologist and worked on projects in Israel and Western \n     Europe. She gave up the allure of the Old World and settled \n     into Western U.S. archaeology when she marred her husband in \n     1971.\n\n  Linda as an archaeologist, started her career with the Bureau of Land \nManagement in 1978. She moved to the Bureau of Reclamation in 1979. She \nbegan her work as a forest ranger for the U.S. Forest Service in 1987 \nand was elevated to district ranger at the Beartooth Ranger District, \nRed Lodge, MT, in 1989.\n  Federal land managers have the most challenging positions of all the \npublic service jobs in the West. They are constantly being challenged \nby resource managers and users, special interest groups, and folks who \nknow very little about natural resource management but think they do, \nespecially the great renewable resources found on our Nation's national \nforests. She met those challenges with intelligence and judgment. I did \nnot always agree with her but she gave the full measure of thought \nbefore every decision.\n  The State of Montana has lost a friend, the Nation has lost a \ndedicated public servant. In the great tradition of those who are tied \nto the land in this country, there will be those who will follow in her \nfootsteps with the same degree of dedication.

WILLIAM FULBRIGHT\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, a constituent of mine, Clyde Edwin Pettit, \nwas a member of the staff of the late Senator J. William Fulbright. Mr. \nPettit went to Vietnam as a foreign correspondent and made many \ndistinguished radio broadcasts from there in 1965 and 1966. He was one \nof the very first Americans to predict that the United States would not \nprevail in that tragic undertaking. He wrote what Senator Fulbright \ncalled a long and prescient letter * * * from Saigon that was a \nsubstantial influence upon my long opposition to America's adventure in \nIndochina. Mr. Pettit has written a moving and eloquent tribute to \nSenator Fulbright.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the eulogy to \nwhich I have referred and a letter of introduction Senator Fulbright \nwrote regarding Clyde Pettit be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Bill Fulbright--an Appreciation\n\n       Senator J. William Fulbright is dead.\n       He was, in every sense, an American original.\n       A small-town boy, who was both a scholar and triple-threat \n     halfback on the Razorback football team at the University of \n     Arkansas, he became, almost by chance, a Rhodes scholar in \n     England.\n       Later, while a law professor, he became president of the \n     University of Arkansas--the youngest college president in the \n     country.\n       He backed into politics almost accidently, running for the \n     House of Representatives and winning.\n       In Congress in 1943 he revived the concept of the League of \n     Nations, but a more effective one. This was the Fulbright \n     Resolution pledging U.S. membership for a future United \n     Nations. Arkansas made Fulbright a Democrat. Europe made him \n     an internationalist.\n       After his Rhodes scholarship experience, he wanted other \n     young men and women to have the educational opportunities he \n     had. In 1945 he had a unique idea: the world was awash with \n     surplus war materiel. The secretary of state could dispose of \n     assets outside the U.S. in return for foreign credits. Since \n     none of the countries involved had dollars to pay for the \n     materiel, why not exchange it for credits and use them for an \n     educational exchange program? The idea became the \n     internationally celebrated Fulbright Act. Since that time, \n     approximately 220,000 young scholarship students have \n     traversed the globe--the greatest cross-pollination of \n     learning in the history of the world.\n       Few remember that he cast the single vote in the Senate in \n     1954 against funding Senator Joe McCarthy's witchhunting \n     subcommittee. McCarthy called Fulbright a communist \n     sympathizer, referring to him as ``Senator Halfbright.'' \n     Fulbright: ``I can only say that his manner and his methods \n     were offensive to me. I thought him to be a demagogue and a \n     ruthless boor.'' He said McCarthy had ``done more harm to the \n     United States than \n     [[Page S3148]] he has ever done to the Communist conspiracy \n     here or abroad.'' He cosponsored the censure resolution that \n     was the beginning of the end of McCarthy.\n       In 1960 President Kennedy wanted Fulbright as his Secretary \n     of State, but was dissuaded from asking him to serve. Much \n     later Fulbright said he was ``not temprementally asuited'' to \n     administer ``somebody else's policy--or one I disagreed \n     with.'' Another reason is that it would have removed him from \n     the Senate that he loved.\n       He opposed the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba and \n     tried vainly to talk President Kennedy out of proceeding with \n     it.\n       As Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \n     Senator Fulbright led the floor-fight for the Gulf of Tonkin \n     Resolution because President Johnson asked him to, promising \n     him that its effects would be limited and not open-ended. \n     This began Johnson's tragic adventure in Indochina. Soon \n     after, Fulbright realized he had been lied to about what \n     really happened in the Gulf of Tonkin, he had the courage and \n     the manhood to confess that he had been wrong in supporting \n     it. He then convened the so-called, Fulbright Hearings of the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee, summoning Dean Rusk and \n     Robert McNamara and all the great war-hawks to educate the \n     American public via television. He began his courageous \n     seven-year crusade against the Vietnam War.\n       When a colleague asked him if the Senate had the power to \n     enact certain legislation, Fulbright replied, ``We have the \n     power to do any dawn fool thing we want, and we always seem \n     to do it.''\n       Apropos of Vietnam and our tragic experience there, he \n     liked to quote Kipling:\n\n     The end of the fight is a tombstone white\n       with the name of the late deceased,\n     And the epitaph drear: ``A fool lies here\n       who tried to hustle the East''.\n\n       He was one of the first to warn that Americans were being \n     taxed to pay for being propagandized by what he called ``The \n     Pentagon Propaganda Machine.''\n       He had the wisdom to see that in all political systems \n     there is a tendency for public servants to metamorphose into \n     public masters, surfeited with unchecked power and privilege \n     and increasingly overpaid to misgovern. He knew that even \n     free peoples can be led to death and maiming because they do \n     not realize that all wars are against their interests. The \n     tragedy of his life is his discovery that wars, once started, \n     tend to become inundating forces of nature, inexhorable and \n     beyond the control of any of the participants.\n       He was a tory by birth and breeding, a capitalist by \n     background, conviction and instinct. He used to say, ``I \n     believe that capitalism is, by and large, the best system to \n     bring the highest standard of living to the most people. If, \n     however, a country wants to try socialism or some other \n     system, then they should by all means be permitted to. But I \n     do not believe that we have the moral right, and certainly \n     not the capacity, to prevent their going their own way.''\n       He was a conservative. He believed as the Founding Fathers \n     did that governments derive their powers from the consent of \n     the governed. He believed in the limitation of executive \n     powers, in checks and balances and in the separation of \n     governmental powers. Constitutionally he was a strict \n     constructionist.\n       He was a liberal, resonating to the principles of the \n     American Revolution and the inherent right of all peoples to \n     change their governments. His liberalism was in the original \n     sense of the word, derived from the word liberty, in being \n     broad-minded, undogmatic, tolerant--which is what all true \n     conservatives should aspire to be.\n       He was one of the early champions of the wise investment of \n     American aid to rebuild and strengthen a war-ravaged Europe. \n     Later, he was one of the early opponents of the extravagant \n     support of unpopular and repressive dictatorships abroad--\n     enriching Asian countries merely because they professed to be \n     anti-communist. He fought against the transfer of hundreds of \n     billions of U.S. dollars to the Far East, enriching Asian \n     nations merely because they professed to be anti-communist. \n     He was a reluctant witness to America's rapid decline from \n     being the biggest creditor nation on earth to become the \n     biggest debtor nation--what he called ``a crippled giant.''\n       Usually courteous to the point of courtliness--especially \n     to the humble--he was sometimes professorial, even \n     condescending to his peers--especially the pompous. Only with \n     difficulty did he suffer fools, He had contempt for \n     politicians and their ``communications'' experts--with \n     government by poll. ``Their purpose seems to consist largely \n     in discovering what people want and feel and dislike,'' he \n     said, ``and then associating themselves with those feelings. \n     * * * This is the opposite of leadership, it is followship, \n     elevated to a science, for the purpose of self-advancement. \n     Even formal policy speeches are determined by the polls. The \n     policy statements that emerge have little to do with the \n     national interest.''\n       He lived through most of a terrible and turbulent century. \n     In the vastness of time, his nine decades of life were but a \n     narrow valley between the peaks of two eternities. And yet, \n     what a bountiful valley it was.\n       Sir Christopher Wren's epitaph in London--in the St. Paul's \n     Cathedral he designed--is Si monentum requiris circumspice--\n     ``If you would seek his monument, look around you.''\n       The same epitaph is appropriate for Bill Fulbright.\n       The United Nations.\n       The Fulbright scholarships.\n       The anti-war years during the maelstrom of Vietnam.\n       The scores of legislative accomplishments.\n       The wise world-view he sustained thoroughout his long \n     lifetime.\n       ``Our future is not in the stars,'' he used to say, ``but \n     in our own minds and hearts.''\n       In a sense, his most lasting monument is invisible. It is \n     the thousands of names that are not engraved on The Wall of \n     the Vietnam Memorial in Washington--all the names that are \n     not there because once, long ago, he led the fight against an \n     unwinnable war he knew was contrary to the interests of his \n     country. He was one of the first to diagnose the dangers of \n     the arrogance of unchecked executive power, the price of \n     pride and hubris. He had the common sense to oppose old \n     myths, the vision to appreciate new realities, and a keen \n     feel for the great lesson of history--that the price of \n     empire is always too high.\n       If half the Congress were composed of Bill Fulbrights, \n     legislative functioning might be extremely difficult. But \n     unless America continues to produce two or three in every \n     generation, America democracy as we know it might indeed \n     perish.\n       We have lost a great national treasure--perhaps a \n     nonrenewable resource.\n       Sic transit.\n                                                                    ____\n\n     To whom it may concern:\n       Mr. Clyde E. Pettit, Jr. is well known to me. He is a \n     lawyer and television producer from a prominent family in my \n     state. He is President of KYMA-TV and Vice President of Sun \n     Communications.\n       Mr. Pettit was on the United States Senate staff during the \n     years I was U.S. Senator from Arkansas and Chairman of the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He was Special Assistant \n     to the late Senator Carl Hayden, then the President of the \n     U.S. Senate.\n       Mr. Pettit went to Vietnam as a foreign correspondent and \n     made many distinguished radio broadcasts in 1965 and 1966. He \n     was one of the very first Americans to predict that the \n     United States could not prevail in that tragic undertaking. \n     He wrote a long and prescient letter to me from Saigon that \n     was a substantial influence upon my long opposition to \n     America's adventure in Indochina. Later he wrote the book, \n     ``The Experts''--the definitive chronicle of the Vietnam War. \n     He has had a consistent vision of our proper role in foreign \n     affairs and a continuing concern for U.S. involvement in Asia \n     and the Middle East.\n       He believes, incidentally, that since more than fifteen \n     years have elapsed since the end of hostilities, it is time \n     for diplomatic, cultural and commercial relations to be re-\n     established. I agree.\n       Any courtesies extended to him will be appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   J.W.

The Chair does apologize to the Senator from \nWest Virginia. Under the previous order, the Senate was to resume \nconsideration of House Joint Resolution 1 at 12:30. We will now do \nthat.

Res. 1 to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary with instructions.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia [Mr. Byrd] is now recognized.\n  (Mr. HELMS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have discussed this request with the distinguished \nSenator from Utah. I think, at the moment, he might be constrained to \nobject, because I believe he will want to discuss the request with the \nmajority leader. But I will make it for the Record just now and then I \nwill withdraw it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendments be voted on \nin the following order: No. 252, 254, 255, 253, and 258, and that \namendment No. 289 be withdrawn.\n  I withdraw that request until such time as the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah can discuss it with the majority leader.\n  Mr. President, on tomorrow, the Senate will begin voting on the \namendments that have been called up and made to qualify under the order \nthat was entered previously. I believe that there are in the nature of \n22 or 23 or 24 amendments that are on the list. Among those amendments, \nI have five amendments. I am not counting the amendment which I \nanticipate that I will withdraw.\n  Mr. President, in the main, my amendments go to certain of the flaws, \nwhich I have discussed on previous occasions, that I have found \nobjections to in the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. For \nexample, I have been troubled by the numerous supermajority \nrequirements that are included in the balanced budget amendment.\n  As I have stated on previous occasions that the United States \nConstitution and amendments thereto contain nine circumstances in which \na two-thirds vote in one or both Houses is necessary to an action or to \nthe making of a quorum. Specifically, these are, one, conviction \nfollowing impeachment; two, expulsion of a Member; three, override of a \nPresidential veto; four, advise and consent on treaties; five, \nproposing constitutional amendments; six, removing the bar of entry to \nCongress for having engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the \nUnited States; and seven, determining the President's ability to \ndischarge his duties following a Vice Presidential declaration of \nPresidential disability.\n  In addition, article II, section 1, clause 3, and the 12th amendment, \nwhich supersedes the article II provision, require a two-thirds quorum \nwhen the election of the President and/or Vice President should be \ndecided by Congress. The actual vote, however, remains a constitutional \nmajority.\n  In several of these instances, the supermajorities have either never \nbeen called into play or have been resorted to only in a few instances \nand, in some instances, the last occasion in which the particular \nprovision was called into play was decades ago.\n  For example, in the case of the expulsion of a Member, which requires \na supermajority, the last instance in which a Member of Congress was \nactually expelled was in 1862, when Waldo P. Johnson, Democrat of \nMissouri, was expelled for having supported the rebellion. Therefore, \nin that instance, as we can see, it was 133 years ago when that \nsituation requiring a supermajority last arose.\n  In the case of constitutional amendments, for which supermajorities \nare required in both Houses and by the States, only 27 amendments have \nbeen adopted, and 17 of those have been adopted since the first 10 \namendments.\n  There are six additional amendments that have been submitted to the \nStates, thus having received the requisite two-thirds in both Houses, \nbut which have failed on ratification. The following are those six \namendments that did not receive the requisite support of three-fourths \nof the States:\n  September 25, 1789, an amendment dealing with the number of \nRepresentatives in the House; an amendment adopted during the second \nsession of the 11th Congress relating to acceptance of foreign titles \nof nobility; an amendment adopted and submitted to the States on March \n2, 1861, prohibiting congressional abolition of slavery; June 2, 1926, \nauthorizing the Congress to enact child labor laws; March 22, 1972, the \nequal rights amendment; and August 22, 1978, relating to the voting \nrights of D.C. residents.\n  So, as we can see, the amendment provision under article 5 of the \nUnited States Constitution has not been used very frequently.\n  As to the 14th amendment, namely, the removal of the bar from entry \ninto Congress, the right to remove disabilities imposed by section 3 of \nthe 14th amendment was exercised by Congress, by supermajority votes in \nboth Houses, at different times on behalf of certain persons. In 1872, \nthe disabilities were removed by a blanket act from all persons \n``except Senators and Representatives of the 36th and 37th \nCongresses,'' and 26 years later on June 6, 1898,--in other words, 97 \nyears ago--Congress passed legislation removing the disability imposed \nby section 3.\n  The authority of Congress to determine Presidential disability under \nsection 4 of the 25th amendment has never been exercised since the \namendment's ratification in February, 1967. It should be noted, \nhowever, that President Reagan did notify the Speaker of the House and \nthe Senate President pro tempore of his temporary disability on July \n13, 1985. The disability, due to anesthesia administered during \nsurgery, was subsequently terminated later the same day.\n  What I have attempted to show here, Mr. President, is the dearth of \ninstances in which many of these supermajorities, that are included in \nthe original Constitution and the amendments thereto, have actually \nbeen called into play. And as I say in some instances decades have \npassed since these provisions last were activated. These \nsupermajorities, however, deal with the structure of our form of \ngovernment, or with the protection of individual rights.\n  But here we come now with this amendment to the Constitution to \nbalance the budget which requires supermajorities in enforcing fiscal \npolicy--for example, in section 1, section 2, section 4, and section 5. \nIncluded in those supermajorities is the phraseology of section 4 which \nrefers to approval by ``a majority of the whole number of each House,'' \nand of section 5 which does likewise.\n  Mr. President, the requirement of approval by a majority of the whole \nnumber of each House can very well in some instances require more votes \nthan a two-thirds vote depending upon how many Senators or House \nMembers are present and voting.\n  The instances in the original Constitution and the amendments thereto \nthat require two-thirds majorities, require a two-thirds majority of \nthose Senators and House Members ``present and voting'', except in the \ninstance of treaties and convictions on impeachments. I seem to \nremember that in \n[[Page S3150]] those two instances a two-thirds majority of the \nSenators ``present'' are required--not two-thirds of the Senators who \nare chosen and sworn, not two-thirds of those Senators who are voting, \nbut two-thirds of the Senators ``present''.\n  May I inquire of the Chair if I am correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from West \nVirginia he is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  But, now, this balanced budget amendment, in section 1, which deals \nwith balancing outlays and receipts, any waiver requires that ``three-\nfifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by \nlaw for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a rollcall \nvote.''\n  Section 2, the provision whereby the limit on the debt may be \nincreased, ``three-fifths of the whole number of each House'' is \nrequired to waive that stricture.\n  Section 4: ``No bill to increase revenue shall become law unless \napproved by a majority of the whole number of each House by a rollcall \nvote.''\n  Well, as I have already indicated, depending upon how many Members \nare present and voting in each House, that requirement could well \nrequire more than a two-thirds or three-fifths majority of those \npresent and voting.\n  And the same thing obtains with respect to section 5 of the balanced \nbudget amendment. Any resolution allowing for the provisions of the \narticle to ``be waived for any fiscal year in which the United States \nis engaged in military conflict which causes an imminent and serious \nmilitary threat to national security,'' must be adopted by a majority \nof the whole number of each House, which, in the case of the Senate, \nmeans at least 51--and that requirement may very well be more than two-\nthirds or more than three-fifths of the Senators who are present and \nvoting.\n  These are very difficult strictures to overcome--these supermajority \nrequirements that are being written into the Constitution by this \nbalanced budget amendment--more constrictive than any of the \nsupermajorities written into the original constitution and/or \namendments thereto.\n  Mr. President, let us see what the authors of the Federalist Papers \nhave to say about supermajorities. Hamilton in the Federalist No. 75 \nsaid and I quote:\n\n       . . . all provisions which require more than the majority \n     of any body to its resolutions have a direct tendency to \n     embarrass the operations of the government and an indirect \n     one to subject the sense of the majority to that of the \n     minority.\n\n  In other words, they create a minority veto.\n  I will read Hamilton's statement in Federalist No. 75 again.\n\n       . . . all provisions which require more than the majority \n     of any body to its resolutions have a direct tendency to \n     embarrass the operations of the government and an indirect \n     one to subject the sense of the majority to that of the \n     minority.\n\n  Hamilton, in the Federalist No. 22 says this, about giving the \nminority a negative on the majority:\n\n       To give a minority a negative upon the majority (which is \n     always the case where more than a majority is requisite to a \n     decision) . . .\n\n  Let me read that again because it goes to the provisions that require \na majority of the whole number of each body, that are to be found in \nsections 4 and 5 of the balanced budget amendment.\n\n       To give a minority a negative upon the majority (which is \n     always the case where more than a majority is requisite to a \n     decision) is, in its tendency, to subject the sense of the \n     greater number to that of the lesser number.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       In those emergencies of a nation in which the goodness or \n     badness, the weakness or strength, of its government is of \n     the greatest importance, there is commonly a necessity for \n     action. The public business must in some way or other go \n     forward. If a pertinacious minority can control the opinion \n     of a majority, respecting the best mode of conducting it, the \n     majority in order that something may be done must conform to \n     the views of the minority; and thus the sense of the smaller \n     number will overrule that of the greater and give a tone to \n     the national proceedings. Hence, tedious delays; continual \n     negotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of the \n     public good. And yet, in such a system it is even happy when \n     such compromises can take place: for upon some occasions \n     things will not admit of accommodation; and then the measures \n     of government must be injuriously suspended, or fatally \n     defeated. It is often by the impracticability of obtaining \n     the concurrence of the necessary number of votes kept in a \n     state of inaction. Its situation must always savor of \n     weakness, sometimes border upon anarchy.\n\n  Mr. President, you see we have to go through these Perils of Pauline \nin every fiscal year.\n  The Northwest Ordinance was being debated in New York City at the \nvery same time that the Constitutional Convention was meeting in \nPhiladelphia. On July 13, 1787, the Northwest Ordinance was adopted. \nAnd that ordinance is one of the most important documents in the \nhistory of this country, and it rates--not as high as the Constitution \nand the Declaration of Independence, but it may rank a very close \nthird. It may be instructive to note that the Northwest Ordinance \nrequired only simple majorities in the votes of the council, which \nwould correspond with the Senate in the Federal Constitution, and in \nthe votes of the representatives who were to be elected.\n  It also should be remembered that when and where these \nsupermajorities are required--and I have listed four instances here in \nthe balanced budget amendment in which supermajorities would be \nrequired--they promote unreliability and unpredictability. People \ncannot count on, from year to year, just what is going to happen, and \nhow their lives are to be affected, because we are talking about \nbalancing the budget in every fiscal year.\n\n       Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed receipts \n     for that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of the whole number \n     of each House of Congress shall provide by law for a specific \n     excess of outlays over receipts. . . .\n\n  Hence, the people are to be left without assurance as to whether or \nnot their Government is going to be constant. These supermajorities \npromote inconstancy. Let us see what Madison, in the Federalist No. 62, \nhas to say about such.\n\n       What prudent merchant will hazard his fortunes in any new \n     branch of commerce when he knows not but that his plans may \n     be rendered unlawful before they can be executed? What farmer \n     or manufacturer will lay himself out for the encouragement \n     given to any particular cultivation or establishment, when he \n     can have no assurance that his preparatory labors and \n     advances will not render him a victim to an inconstant \n     government? In a word, no great improvement or laudable \n     enterprise can go forward which requires the auspices of a \n     steady system of national policy.\n\n  Madison continues:\n\n       But the most deplorable effect of all is that diminution of \n     attachment and reverence which steals into the hearts of the \n     people towards a political system which betrays so many marks \n     of infirmity, and disappoints so many of their flattering \n     hopes. No government, any more than an individual, will long \n     be respected without being truly respectable; nor be truly \n     respectable without possessing a certain portion of order and \n     stability.\n\n  Daniel Webster said, ``Let us develop the resources of our land, call \nforth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great \ninterests, and see whether we also, in our day and generation, may \nperform something worthy to be remembered.''\n  Webster was talking about the development of the country, and about \ninvesting in the Nation, in its people, in its highways, its railroads, \nits waterways. But such investment needs to be on a multi-year basis--\nit requires reliability, predictability, and consistency in accordance \nwith long-term planning and design. Such investment planning must not \nbe subjected to the fits and starts that will result from annual \nsupermajority requirements to balance the Federal budget.\n  Madison, in 62, is talking about this inconstancy and \nunpredictability in Government policy that would be brought about by \nthis spate of new and very difficult supermajorities required in the \nimplementation of fiscal policy.\n\n       What prudent merchant will hazard his fortunes in any new \n     branch of commerce, when he knows not but that his plans may \n     be rendered unlawful before they can be executed? What farmer \n     or manufacturer will lay himself out for the encouragement \n     given to any particular cultivation or establishment, when he \n     can have no assurance that his preparatory labors and \n     advances will not render him a victim to an inconstant \n     government? In a word no great improvement or laudable \n     enterprise, can go forward, which requires the auspices of a \n     steady system of national policy.\n\n  There are also those who are concerned, like myself, with respect to \nsection 5, which deals with military conflicts.\n\n       [[Page S3151]] Section 5. The Congress may waive the \n     provisions of this article for any fiscal year in which a \n     declaration of war is in effect. The provisions of this \n     article may be waived for any fiscal year in which the United \n     States is engaged in military conflict which causes an \n     imminent and serious military threat to national security and \n     is so declared by a joint resolution, adopted by a majority \n     of the whole number of each House, which becomes law.\n\n  Let us see what Hamilton has to say in the Federalist No. 30.\n\n       How can it undertake or execute any liberal or enlarged \n     plans of public good?\n       Let us attend to what would be the effects of this \n     situation in the very first war in which we should happen to \n     be engaged. We will presume, for argument's sake, that the \n     revenue arising from the impost duties answers the purposes \n     of a provision for the public debt and of a peace \n     establishment for the Union. Thus circumstanced, a war breaks \n     out. What would be the probable conduct of the government in \n     such an emergency? Taught by experience that proper \n     dependence could not be placed on the success of \n     requisitions, unable by its own authority to lay hold of \n     fresh resources, and urged by considerations of national \n     danger, would it not be driven to the expedient of diverting \n     the funds already appropriated from their proper objects to \n     the defense of the State?\n\n  Mr. President, note that Hamilton refers to ``the expedient of \ndiverting the funds already appropriated from their proper objects to \nthe defense of the State?''\n  I have heard Senators who are supporters of this amendment say that, \nif we get into a military exigency we will just cut other programs, we \nwill divert funds from other programs--as though we have plenty of time \nduring a military exigency to go through all this examination of other \nprograms and projects and take our pencils and add up and subtract all \nthose things. We do not have time for that during an emergency \ninvolving our military security.\n  Hamilton is here speaking of diverting funds already appropriated \nfrom their proper objects to the defense of the state.\n\n       It is not easy to see how a step of this kind could be \n     avoided; and if it should be taken, it is evident that it \n     would prove the destruction of public credit at the very \n     moment that it was becoming essential to the public safety.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       In the modern system of war, nations the most wealthy are \n     obliged to have recourse to large loans.\n       But who would lend to a government that prefaced its \n     overtures for borrowing by an act which demonstrated that no \n     reliance could be placed on the steadiness of its measures \n     for paying?\n\n  Section 2 deals with the limit on the debt of the United States:\n\n       The limit on the debt of the United States held by the \n     public shall not be increased unless three-fourths of the \n     whole number of each house shall provide by law for such an \n     increase by a rollcall vote.\n\n  Hamilton says:\n\n       But who would lend to a government that prefaced its \n     overtures for borrowing by an act which demonstrated that no \n     reliance could be placed on the steadiness of its measures \n     for paying? The loans it might be able to procure, would be \n     as limited in their extent as burthensome in their \n     conditions. They would be made upon the same principles that \n     usurers commonly lend to bankrupt and fraudulent debtors--\n     with a sparing hand and at enormous premiums.\n\n  Then Hamilton in 22 goes on to say this:\n\n       Suppose, for example, we were engaged in a war, in \n     conjunction with one foreign nation against another. Suppose \n     the necessity of our situation demanded peace, and the \n     interest or ambition of our ally led him to seek the \n     prosecution of the war, with views that might justify us in \n     making separate terms. In such a state of things, this ally \n     of ours would evidently find it much easier by his bribes and \n     intrigues to tie up the hands of government from making \n     peace, where two-thirds of all the votes were requisite to \n     that object, then where a simple majority would suffice. In \n     the first case he would have to corrupt a smaller number; in \n     the last, a greater number. Upon the same principle, it would \n     be much easier for a foreign power with which we were at war, \n     to perplex our councils and embarrass our exertions. In a \n     commercial view, we may be subjected to similar \n     inconveniences.\n\n  We have discussed section 5 of this balanced budget amendment \nheretofore. It is very obvious that, when it comes to dealing with an \nimminent military threat to the Nation's security, the Congress may be \nhard pressed to secure a majority of the whole number of each House in \norder to lift this burdensome restriction of requiring that outlays not \nexceed receipts in a given fiscal year.\n  Let us see what Hamilton, in the Federalist No. 30, says that might \nhave some bearing upon this situation.\n\n       It has been already observed that the federal government \n     ought to possess the power of providing for the support of \n     the national forces; in which proposition was intended to be \n     included the expense of raising troops, of building and \n     equipping fleets, and all other expenses in any wise \n     connected with military arrangements and operations. But \n     these are not the only objects to which the jurisdiction of \n     the Union in respect to revenue must necessarily be empowered \n     to extend. It must embrace a provision for the support of the \n     national civil list; for the payment of the national debts \n     contracted or that may be contracted; and, in general, for \n     all those matters which will call for disbursements out of \n     the national treasury. The conclusion is that there must be \n     interwoven in the frame of the government a general power of \n     taxation, in one shape or another.\n\n  I have heard certain Republican Senators recently on this floor state \nthat they will never vote for a tax increase. Yet, Mr. President, it \nmay be absolutely necessary to have a tax increase, if the Nation is \nfaced with a military exigency such as that contemplated in section 5 \nof the balanced budget amendment, and increases in taxes may also be \nnecessary to balance the budget, or to pay for other important objects \nthat are within the jurisdiction of the Congress and the Union.\n  Hamilton, in the Federalist No. 30, goes on to say:\n\n       What substitute can there be imagined for this ignis \n     fatuus--\n\n  That is a will-o'-the-wisp or jack-o-lantern.\n\n       What substitute can there be imagined for this ignis fatuus \n     in finance, but that of permitting the national government to \n     raise its own revenues by the ordinary methods of taxation, \n     authorized in every well-ordered constitution of civil \n     government?\n\n  Mr. President, we are not going to have ``ordinary methods of \ntaxation'' if this balanced budget amendment is approved because, in \norder to increase revenues, ``a majority of the whole number of each \nhouse'' will be required to do so. And in some instances, as I have \nalready demonstrated, that may amount to more than a two-thirds vote. \nIt may actually amount to more than two-thirds or three-fifths of the \ntotal membership in a given situation.\n  Continuing with Hamilton's Federalist No. 30:\n\n       Ingenious men may declaim with plausibility on any subject; \n     but no human ingenuity can point out any other expedient to \n     rescue us from the inconveniences and embarrassments, \n     naturally resulting from defective supplies of the public \n     treasury.\n       How is it possible that a government half supplied and \n     always necessitous, can fulfill the purposes of its \n     institution--can provide for the security of--advance the \n     prosperity--or support the reputation of the commonwealth? \n     How can it ever possess either energy or stability, dignity \n     or credit, confidence at home or respectability abroad?\n\n  Mr. President, this new amendment with its supermajorities will makes \nthis Nation musclebound. It will put the Nation in a straitjacket when \nit comes to the necessity of increasing revenues, when it comes to the \nnecessity of waving the requirements that outlays not exceed receipts.\n  Let us look at the plausibility of these new supermajorities which \nfly in the face of what the Framers contemplated. I call attention to \nthe fact that, under the Articles of Confederation agreed to on \nNovember 15, 1777, supermajorities were required in great number--one \nof the reasons why the Articles of Confederation did not work well. I \nshall read from article 10 of the Articles of Confederation.\n\n       The united states in congress assembled shall never engage \n     in a war, nor grant letters of marque and reprisal in time of \n     peace, nor enter into any treaties or alliances, nor coin \n     money, nor regulate the value thereof, nor ascertain the sums \n     and expences necessary for the defence and welfare of the \n     united states, or any of them, nor emit bills, nor borrow \n     money on the credit of the united states, nor appropriate \n     money, nor agree upon the number of vessels of war, to be \n     built or purchased, or the number of land or sea forces to be \n     raised, nor appoint a commander-in-chief of the army or navy, \n     unless nine states assent to the same; nor shall a question \n     on any other point, except for adjourning from day to day be \n     determined, unless by the votes of a majority of the united \n     states in congress assembled.\n\n  Well, there were 13 States. Nine votes would mean a majority of the \nwhole number. But in the case of ascertaining the sums and expenses \nnecessary for the defense and welfare of the United States or to borrow \nmoney on the credit of the United States or to appropriate money or to \nagree upon the number of vessels at war to be built or \n[[Page S3152]] purchased, or to agree upon the number of land or sea \nforces to be raised, a supermajority of 9 States out of the 13 would be \nrequired in each of those instances. Hence, the Articles of \nConfederation were filled with requirements for supermajorities. As I \nsay, that was one of the primary reasons why the Articles of \nConfederation did not work.\n  So, the Framers of our Constitution, some of whom had served in the \nCongress under the Articles of Confederation, saw the bane of those \nsupermajorities and were determined that the new Constitution would not \ncontain them. Therefore, only a majority is required to exercise the \ngreat policy powers that are granted in article I, section 8 and in \nsection 9 of the Constitution.\n  I offered an amendment last week that would have eliminated the \nproblem with section 5, insofar as a majority of the whole number of \neach House is required to lift the restrictions of the balanced budget \namendment in a time of serious conflict, the security of the Nation \nbeing at stake. My amendment was tabled by a vote of 55 to 41. The \nlanguage of section 5 remains.\n  I talked about the possibility of a Vice President not being able to \ncast a vote that would count in a situation arising under section 5 of \nthe balanced budget amendment, because at least 51 Senators would be \nrequired. At least 51 Senators would be required to lift the strictures \nimposed by the balanced budget amendment. In the event of a 50-50, or a \n48-48, or a 47-47 vote--a vote of the Vice President could not break \nthe tie to make a simple majority. A minimum of 51 Members of the \nSenate must vote to lift such restrictions in a time of danger to the \nNation.\n  Here is what Hamilton said in Federalist No. 68:\n\n       The appointment of an extraordinary person, as Vice \n     President, has been objected to as superfluous, if not \n     mischievous.\n       . . . two considerations seem to justify the ideas of the \n     convention in this respect. One is, that to secure at all \n     times the possibility of a definitive resolution of the body, \n     it is necessary that the President should have only a casting \n     vote.\n\n  There are other dangers in the balanced budget amendment that I have \ncited from time to time. I think it is pregnant with an invitation to \nthe judiciary to intervene. There is nothing in the balanced budget \namendment that either forbids or invites the judiciary to intervene in \nthe enforcement of the balanced budget amendment. But I think that \ncircumstances themselves would result in the intervention by the \njudiciary when it came to cutting programs, increasing taxes, deciding \nother problems and cases and controversies that might arise under this \nnew article and even outside the new article.\n  I read from Hamilton, Federalist No. 78:\n\n       The executive not only dispenses the honors, but holds the \n     sword of the community. The legislature not only commands the \n     purse, but prescribes the rules by which the duties and \n     rights of every citizen are to be regulated. The judiciary, \n     on the contrary, has no influence over either the sword or \n     the purse. . . . It proves incontestably that the judiciary \n     is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of \n     power.\n       . . . there is no liberty, if the power of judging be not \n     separated from the legislative and executive powers.\n\n  Mr. President, when this new amendment is adopted and later \nratified--if it is adopted and ratified--it will stand Hamilton's words \non their head. The judiciary will then become the strongest of the \nthree departments of power, rather than the weakest, as Hamilton had \nsaid in the Federalist No. 78.\n  No one can say, Mr. President, with absolute certitude as to what \nwill happen if and when this amendment is made a part of the \nConstitution. Nobody can say\n with absolute certainty. But we have to explore these possibilities, \nand I fear, with great alarm, the possibility, nay the probability, \nthat the power of the purse will be shifted to the executive; and when \ncases or controversies arise, the courts will intervene and we will \nhave situations in which the courts, made up of unelected judges with \nlife tenures, will be telling the Congress when to tax, where to tax, \nhow much to tax, when to cut programs, what programs to cut, and by how \nmuch, and it will be a sad day when our country awakens to the fact \nthat the judiciary is the strongest of the three branches. Even if \nthere were a way to exclude the judiciary--and the Johnston amendment \nwas an attempt to do so, but it was rejected--the legislative branch \nwould still be weakened.\n\n  Mr. Nunn has an amendment which will be voted on. I will support the \nNunn amendment, as I supported the Johnston amendment. But I do not \nconcede that that amendment will eliminate all prospects of the \njudicial branch's entering into the political thicket of decisions with \nrespect to this new article, the balanced budget amendment.\n  What did Madison say about the power of the purse in Federalist No. \n58? This is what he said:\n\n       The House of Representatives cannot only refuse, but they \n     alone can propose the supplies requisite for the support of \n     Government. They, in a word, hold the purse; that powerful \n     instrument by which we behold, in the history of the British \n     Constitution, an infant and humble representation of the \n     people, gradually enlarging the sphere of its activity and \n     importance, and finally reducing, as far as it seems to have \n     wished, all the overgrown prerogatives of the other branches \n     of the Government. This power over the purse may, in fact, be \n     regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which \n     any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the \n     people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for \n     carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.\n\n  In the Federalist No. 48, by Madison, we are told,\n\n       . . . the legislative department alone has access to the \n     pockets of the people.\n\n  All this is going to be changed, Mr. President, once this balanced \nbudget amendment goes into the Constitution. If it ever becomes a part \nof the Constitution, much of what Madison and Hamilton have said in the \nFederalist Papers will have been thrust aside by today's would-be \nFramers. This power over the purse may, in fact, be shifted to the \nexecutive and judicial branches of Government and away from the \npeople's representatives in Congress.\n  There is also a danger of too-frequent amendments to the \nConstitution. Hamilton warned of this in Federalist No. 49.\n\n       . . . as every appeal to the people would carry an \n     implication of some defect in the Government, frequent \n     appeals would, in great measure, deprive the Government of \n     that veneration, which time bestows on everything, and \n     without which perhaps the wisest and freest governments would \n     not possess the requisite stability.\n\n  So here we are, we are about to appeal to the people again by \nsubmitting to them this balanced budget constitutional amendment. The \nfact that the Senate has taken 30 days to deliberate on this amendment, \npoints, Mr. President, to the utility of the Senate. This balanced \nbudget amendment was adopted by the other body in 2 days--2 days! \nIncluding tomorrow, the balanced budget amendment will have been before \nthe Senate for a total of 30 days. During those 30 days, Senators have \ndebated at considerable length the entire new article, and they have \nfound numerous flaws which, upon careful probing, were brought to \nlight. This did not happen in the other body. It happened here because \nthis is the U.S. Senate, where there is unlimited debate, which can \nonly be shut off by a cloture motion or by a unanimous-consent \nagreement entered into by all Senators.\n  I believe the constitutional Framers would have been proud of the \nSenate in this instance. I do not know how proud they would be of the \nSenate, once the rollcall vote is taken tomorrow evening upon the final \ndisposition of this glittering gewgaw of glorified garbage. That \nremains to be seen. I hope they will be proud of it, as they look down \nfrom above, because I hope that the amendment will be defeated.\n  Madison spoke of the utility of the Senate in Federalist No. 62.\n\n       The necessity of a senate is not less indicated by the \n     propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to yield to \n     the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to be seduced \n     by factious leaders into intemperate and pernicious \n     resolutions.\n\n  What Madison said in the Federalist No. 62 reflects exactly what took \nplace in the House of Representatives--passage after only 2 days of \ndebate on this amendment. Let me read Madison's words again from the \nFederalist No. 62.\n\n       The necessity of a senate is not less indicated by the \n     propensity of all single and numerous assemblies, to yield to \n     the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to be seduced \n     by factious leaders, into intemperate and pernicious \n     resolutions. . . . The mutability in the public councils, \n     arising from a rapid succession of new members, however \n     qualified they may be, points out, in the strongest manner, \n     the necessity of some stable institution in the government.\n\n  [[Page S3153]] And in Federalist No. 63, Madison continues to write \nabout the utility of having a Senate. I quote:\n\n       . . . so there are particular moments in public affairs \n     when the people, stimulated by some irregular passion, or \n     some illicit advantage, or misled by the artful \n     misrepresentations of interested men, may call for measures \n     which they themselves will afterwards be the most ready to \n     lament and condemn. In these critical moments, how salutary \n     will be the interference of some temperate and respectable \n     body of citizens, in order to check the misguided career and \n     to suspend the blow meditated by the people against \n     themselves, until reason, justice, and truth can regain their \n     authority over the public mind? What bitter anguish would not \n     the people of Athens have often escaped if their government \n     had contained so provident a safeguard against the tyranny of \n     their own passions? Popular liberty might then have escaped \n     the indelible reproach of decreeing to the same citizens the \n     hemlock on one day and statues on the next.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is advised the Senator has 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, that Montesquieu or Locke or Washington or Madison or \nHamilton could have believed in the fooleries contained in this \nconstitutional amendment on the balanced budget cannot be suspected.\n  I should think that the amendment might very well be pronounced as \nthe ``gunpowder plot'' against the Constitution. The Gunpowder Plot was \nthat conspiracy which was discovered and foiled when Guy Fawkes and a \ngroup of Englishmen intended to blow up the English Parliament on \nNovember 5, 1605, the day that King James I was to address it.\n  Fortunately the plot was foiled. Whether or not this ``gunpowder \nplot'' against the Constitution will be foiled will be determined by \ntomorrow's vote, but I will cast one vote to help in its demise.\n  Mr. President, I think that about the best that can be said of the \namendment is that it is a partisan, political amendment. In it we can \nsee the ``cloven foot'' as to the intentions of most of those in the \nSenate who support it. It is a political amendment. It is supported by \na political party, as witness the fact that all but one of the \nRepublican Senators will very likely vote for it. Political ads have \nbeen run throughout the Nation by the Republican Party in support of \nit. It is a partisan amendment. That is what we are about to nail into \nthe Constitution.\n  Washington, in his farewell address, warned us against putting in the \nplace of\n\n       The delegated will of the nation the will of party, often a \n     small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; \n     and, according to the alternate, triumphs of different \n     parties, to make the public administration the mirror of the \n     ill concerted and incongruous projects of faction . . . they \n     are likely, in the course of time and things to become potent \n     engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men, \n     will be enable to subvert the power of the people, and to \n     usurp for themselves the reigns of government; destroying \n     afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust \n     dominion.\n  Mr. President, the proponents of this amendment in the Congress are \nreally living in a fool's paradise. They are living in a state of \nillusive bliss, suspended in the limbo of hypocrisy, doublespeak, \ndouble-shuffle, vanity, and nonsense. Milton spoke about the limbo of \nvanity in ``Paradise Lost.'' Dante wrote in his ``Divine Comedy'' that \nlimbo was the first circle of Hell.\n  Mr. President, let me close by remembering some words from the \n``Rubaiyat'' written by Omar Khayyam, a Persian poet of the 12th \ncentury:\n\n       The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,\n       Moves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit\n       Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,\n       Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan editorial from the New York Times of today, February 27, titled \n``Unbalanced Amendment,'' together with letters from the Secretaries of \nDefense; Housing and Urban Development; Education; Veterans Affairs; \nHealth and Human Services; and Justice; and various and sundry other \narticles and materials that are germane to the subject of the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Council of Economic \n           Advisers,\n                                Washington, DC, February 23, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: The Council of Economic Advisers is \n     strongly opposed to a balanced budget amendment to the \n     Constitution. Although continued progress on deficit \n     reduction is sound economics, a balanced budget amendment is \n     not. As the attached opinion piece which appeared in The \n     Washington Post two weeks ago indicates, such an amendment \n     would eliminate the ability of the Federal budget to moderate \n     the cyclical ups and downs of business cycles which are \n     normal occurrences in a market economy. Indeed, a balanced \n     budget amendment would actually require budgetary policy to \n     aggravate the business cycle, by requiring Congress to \n     increase taxes or cut spending whenever the economy slowed in \n     order to avoid an increase in the deficit. Statistical \n     analysis performed at the Council and at the Department of \n     the Treasury indicates that the amendment would cause \n     recessions to be substantially deeper.\n       With fiscal policy enjoined by a balanced budget amendment \n     to be destabilizing rather than stabilizing, sole \n     responsibility for moderating the business cycle would rest \n     with the Federal Reserve. As the attached analysis indicates, \n     even a well-intentioned and prescient Federal Reserve would \n     not be able to play this role as well on its own as it can \n     working in tandem with the automatic fiscal stabilizers. \n     Moreover, in order to fulfill this responsibility, the \n     Federal Reserve might well have to foster greater cyclical \n     variability in interest rates, something which could have a \n     destabilizing effect on financial markets. Finally, there is \n     no reason to assume that Federal Reserve decisions will be \n     influenced by the single goal of stabilizing output and \n     employment levels. Historically, concern about inflation has \n     been the major determinant of Federal Reserve actions. \n     Indeed, some proponents of the balanced budget amendment have \n     also proposed legislation that would require the Federal \n     Reserve's only policy target to be price stability. If such \n     legislation were also to become law, neither monetary nor \n     fiscal policy would be available to limit the ups and downs \n     of the business cycle and their attendant human and economic \n     costs.\n       Deficit reduction can be achieved even without a balanced \n     budget amendment. This Administration, working with the \n     Democrats of the 103rd Congress, dramatically reduced the \n     deficits for FY1994 and FY1995, and the budget we have just \n     presented for FY1996 makes additional progress. If it were \n     not for the interest owed on the debt accumulated during the \n     1981-92 period, the federal budget would be in balance by \n     1996 and headed toward surplus thereafter. Based on our \n     projections, the Clinton Administration will be the first \n     since the Johnson Administration to run a non-interest budget \n     surplus for a cycle of four fiscal years. Moreover, net \n     federal debt, after tripling during the 1980s, has now \n     stabilized relative to the size of the economy, and the \n     deficit is projected to decline relative to the size of the \n     economy for at least the next ten years.\n       A balanced budget amendment offers only a promise to reduce \n     the deficit--it does not reduce the deficit by a single \n     penny. And it has the potential to cause serious economic \n     harm. I urge you to vote against it for the economic well-\n     being of the Nation.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Laura D'Andrea Tyson,\n       Chair.\n     Martin N. Baily,\n       Member-Nominee.\n     Joseph E. Stiglitz,\n       Member.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 7, 1995]\n\n                    It's a Recipe for Economic Chaos\n\n                       (By Laura D'Andrea Tyson)\n\n       Continued progress on reducing the deficit is sound \n     economic policy, but a constitutional amendment requiring \n     annual balance of the federal budget is not. The fallacy in \n     the logic behind the balanced budget amendment begins with \n     the premise that the size of the federal deficit is the \n     result of conscious policy decisions. This is only partly the \n     case. The pace of economic activity also plays an important \n     role in determining the deficit. An economic slowdown \n     automatically depresses tax revenues and increases government \n     spending on such programs as unemployment compensation, food \n     stamps and welfare.\n       Such temporary increases in the deficit act as ``automatic \n     stabilizers,'' offsetting some of the reduction in the \n     purchasing power of the private sector and cushioning the \n     economy's slide. Moreover, they do so quickly and \n     automatically, without the need for lengthy debates about the \n     state of the economy and the appropriate policy response.\n       By the same token, when the economy strengthens again, the \n     automatic stabilizers work in the other direction: tax \n     revenues rise, spending for unemployment benefits and other \n     social safety net programs falls, and the deficit narrows.\n       A balanced budget amendment would throw the automatic \n     stabilizers into reverse. Congress would be required to raise \n     tax rates or cut spending programs in the face of a recession \n     to counteract temporary increases in \n     [[Page S3154]] the deficit. Rather than moderating the normal \n     ups and downs of the business cycle, fiscal policy would be \n     required to aggravate them.\n       A simple example from recent economic history should serve \n     as a cautionary tale. In fiscal year 1991, the economy's \n     unanticipated slowdown caused actual government spending for \n     unemployment insurance and related items to exceed the \n     budgeted amount by $6 billion, and actual revenues to fall \n     short of the budgeted amount by some $67 billion. In a \n     balanced-budget world, Congress would have been required to \n     offset the resulting shift of more than $70 billion in the \n     deficit by a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts that \n     by themselves would have sharply worsened the economic \n     downturn--resulting in an additional loss of 1\\1/4\\ percent \n     of GDP and 750,000 jobs.\n       The version of the amendment passed by the House has no \n     special ``escape clause'' for recessions--only the general \n     provision that the budget could be in deficit if three-fifths \n     of both\n      the House and Senate agree. This is a far cry from an \n     automatic stabilizer. It is easy to imagine a well-\n     organized minority in either House of Congress holding \n     this provision hostage to its particular political agenda.\n       In a balanced-budget world--with fiscal policy enjoined to \n     destabilize rather than stabilize the economy--all \n     responsibility for counteracting the economic effects of the \n     business cycle would be placed at the doorstep of the Federal \n     Reserve. The Fed could attempt to meet this increased \n     responsibility by pushing interest rates down more \n     aggressively when the economy softens and raising them more \n     vigorously when it strengthens. But there are several reasons \n     why the Fed would not be able to moderate the ups and downs \n     of the business cycle on its own as well as it can with the \n     help of the automatic fiscal stabilizers.\n       First, monetary policy affects the economy indirectly and \n     with notoriously long lags, making it difficult to time the \n     desired effects with precision. By contrast, the automatic \n     stabilizers of fiscal policy swing into action as soon as the \n     economy begins to slow, often well before the Federal Reserve \n     even recognizes the need for compensating action.\n       Second, the Fed could become handcuffed in the event of a \n     major recession--its scope for action limited by the fact \n     that it can push short-term interest rates no lower than \n     zero, and probably not even that low. By historical \n     standards, the spread between today's short rates of 6 \n     percent and zero leaves uncomfortably little room for \n     maneuver. Between the middle of 1990 and the end of 1992, the \n     Fed reduced the short-term interest rate it controls by a \n     cumulative total of 5\\1/4\\ percentage points. Even so, the \n     economy sank into a recession from which it has only recently \n     fully recovered--a recession whose severity was moderated by \n     the very automatic stabilizers of fiscal policy the balanced \n     budget amendment would destroy.\n       Third, the more aggressive actions required of the Fed to \n     limit the increase in the variability of output and \n     employment could actually increase the volatility of \n     financial markets--an ironic possibility, given that many of \n     the amendment's proponents may well believe they are \n     promoting financial stability.\n       Finally, a balanced budget amendment would create an \n     automatic and undesirable link between interest rates and \n     fiscal policy. An unanticipated increase in interest rates \n     would boost federal interest expense and thus the deficit. \n     The balanced budget amendments under consideration would \n     require that such an unanticipated increase in the deficit be \n     offset within the fiscal year.\n       In other words, independent monetary policy decisions by \n     the Federal Reserve would require immediate and painful \n     budgetary adjustments. Where would they come from? Not from \n     interest payments and not, with such short notice, from \n     entitlement programs. Rather they would have to come from \n     either a tax increase or from cuts or possible shutdowns in \n     discretionary programs whose funds had not yet been \n     obligated. This is not a sensible way to establish budgetary \n     priorities or maintain the healthy interaction and \n     independence of monetary and fiscal policy.\n       One of the great discoveries of modern economics is the \n     role that fiscal policy can play in moderating the business \n     cycle. Few if any members of the Senate about to vote on a \n     balanced budget amendment experienced the tragic human costs \n     of the Great Depression, costs made more severe by President \n     Herbert Hoover's well intentioned but misguided efforts to \n     balance the budget. Unfortunately the huge deficits inherited \n     from the last decade of fiscal profligacy have rendered \n     discretionary changes in fiscal policy in response to the \n     business cycle all but impossible. Now many of those \n     responsible for the massive run-up in debt during the 1980s \n     are leading the charge to eliminate the automatic stabilizers \n     as well by voting for a balanced budget amendment.\n       Instead of undermining the government's ability to moderate \n     the economy's cyclical fluctuations by passing such an \n     amendment, why not simply make the hard choices and cast the \n     courageous votes required to reduce the deficit--the kind of \n     hard choices and courageous votes delivered by members of the \n     103rd Congress when they passed the administration's $505 \n     billion deficit reduction package?\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Committee on Appropriations,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Thank you for your recent letter. I join you \n     in looking forward to working together closely on crucial \n     matters affecting our nation's future security.\n       Your letter asked for my assessment of the probable and \n     possible consequences on America's defense posture of an \n     amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced federal \n     budget. Such an assessment is detailed in the enclosed \n     statement, which was presented at a recent hearing on this \n     subject by John Hamre, Under Secretary of Defense \n     (Comptroller). This statement is an update of my presentation \n     to your committee last February 15, and I strongly support \n     its warnings. With the absence of any realistic \n     implementation details in the amendment, [I fear that huge \n     defense reductions are likely under a balanced budget \n     amendment, which would fundamentally change the character of \n     America's military posture, make our new strategy \n     unsupportable, call into question our ability to fulfill U.S. \n     commitments to our allies and to protect our interests \n     worldwide, and undermine U.S. global leadership.]\n       I thank you for this opportunity to inject defense concerns \n     into the debate on this critical issue facing our nation.\n           Sincerely,\n     William J. Perry.\n                                                                    ____\n\nStatement of Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) John J. Hamre in \n    Connection With the Balanced Budget Amendment, House Judiciary \n                      Committee, January 10, 1995\n\n       Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, thank you for the \n     opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment, and the likely impact that it \n     would have on America's defense posture.\n       The Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) could severely \n     jeopardize America's national security, and that is one of \n     the major reasons for the Administration's opposition to it. \n     Unless legislatively exempted from reductions, defense \n     spending could end up being the primary billpayer to make \n     federal budgets balance, and that would fundamentally \n     undermine the security of our nation.\n       If the Balanced Budget Amendment were adopted, America's \n     defense posture would be vulnerable to two different \n     problems: the impact on defense to reach a zero deficit and \n     the effect on defense of the annual budget process under the \n     BBA.\n\n\n               impact on defense to get to a zero deficit\n\n       (Chart 1) To illustrate the impact of getting to a zero \n     deficit, several assumptions have to be made about the final \n     date and provisions of the BBA. Let us assume that the year \n     of BBA implementation if 2002, and make calculations based on \n     the most recent deficit projections by the Congressional \n     Budget Office. Balancing the budget on a phased basis--14 \n     percent year in 1996 through 2002--would require a total of \n     $1,040 billion in spending cuts and/or revenue increases.\n       Exactly how much the Department of Defense (DoD) would have \n     to contribute to achieving a zero deficit would depend on how \n     much revenue would be increased and whether entitlements \n     would be cut. Under the worst case scenario, there would be \n     no increase in revenue and no cuts in the entitlement \n     programs. This means the budget would have to be balanced by \n     cuts in discretionary spending, of which national defense \n     represents about one half. The best case scenario assumes \n     half of the deficit would be offset by increases in revenue \n     and the other half proportionately to spending for \n     entitlements and domestic and defense discretionary programs.\n       (Chart 2) Not reproducible in the Record.\n       (Chart 3) For national defense, the best case scenario \n     would have a serious impact on national security. The worst \n     case would be a disaster. Achieving these totals would entail\n      subtantial reductions to defense people and programs, which \n     are already downsized to the minimum acceptable level \n     deemed necessary in the Bottom-Up Review. Our forces would \n     become hollow and we would have to give up our quality of \n     life initiatives such as adequate compensation for \n     military personnel, child care programs, decent barracks \n     and family housing and other programs that provide a sense \n     of community and support for military families. We would \n     have to stop the modernization and recapitalization, which \n     is needed and planned in our current five-year budget. We \n     would have to cut back our emphasis on science and \n     technology and technology reinvestment programs, and \n     thereby risk the technological edge that has always given \n     our forces an advantage over our adversaries.\n       Reductions such as these would fundamentally change the \n     character of America's military posture, make our new \n     strategy unsupportable, call into question our ability to \n     fulfill U.S. commitments to our allies and to protect our \n     interests worldwide, and undermine America's global \n     leadership.\n\n\n                The Annual Budget Process Under the BBA\n\n       Let me now turn to the second problem: Life under a \n     balanced budget amendment.\n       What about the effect on defense of the annual budget \n     process under the Balanced Budget Amendment? The BBA annual \n     budget process could routinely end up removing from our \n     elected political leaders the decision about what level of \n     defense spending is prudent. America's defense preparedness \n     could get determined by economic shifts, cost growth in \n     entitlements, and other non-defense factors. Even if threats \n     to America's \n     [[Page S3155]] global interests were increasing or our forces \n     deteriorating, the BBA could lead to deep defense cuts.\n       The fact that these consequences could be avoided with \\3/\n     5\\ approval of each house of Congress is scant reassurance. \n     Preservation of an adequate defense posture would become \n     dependent on exceptional political efforts. The BBA process \n     would be heavily skewed in favor of cutting defense to \n     compensate for whatever was escalating elsewhere in the \n     budget. Even when a \\3/5\\ majority minus one in either house \n     believed that BBA cuts were unjustified, the minority view \n     would prevail. Not exactly ideal for the world's most \n     powerful democracy and best hope for future peace and \n     stability.\n       The BBA would threaten frequent interruptions to the many \n     long-term processes that are essential to maintaining a \n     prudent defense posture. The quality and morale of our people \n     must be continually nurtured, and would be devastated by \n     rapid and deep cuts in end strength. Our military and \n     civilian professionals require extensive training and \n     experience. We cannot recruit and retain top-notch military \n     and civilian professionals, if they are vulnerable to summary \n     dismissal.\n       Repair parts must be ordered three years ahead of \n     anticipated use, in order to ensure the readiness of U.S. \n     forces. Many years of research and development are needed to \n     ensure that our forces are never outgunned or outmaneuvered. \n     The average major weapons procurement program requires 8 \n     years of development and testing. Production lines are \n     necessarily set up anticipating stable procurement rates; \n     they cannot be stopped and started, in order to offset a \n     downturn in revenues or surge in entitlements. Because of the \n     long-lead times needed for our weapons systems, DoD is unique \n     among executive departments in that we must have detailed \n     five-year plans incorporating them. It would be extremely \n     costly, and essentially unworkable, to turn on and off \n     defense programs, when the BBA forced deep budget cuts.\n       In sum, budgeting under BBA would inject great uncertainty \n     and chaos into defense planning, which needs to have \n     stability and a long-term perspective.\n       (Chart 4) Small changes in the U.S. economy would mean even \n     bigger budget problems. Using the CBO rule of thumb, a one \n     percent rise per year in interest rates would increase the \n     federal budget deficit $5 billion in the first year and 108 \n     billion over five years. A one percent fall per year in real \n     growth in the economy would increase the deficit $9 billion \n     in the first year and $289 billion over five years. Thus \n     under the BBA, even modest changes in the economy could \n     trigger sweeping cuts to federal programs.\n\n\n                                closing\n\n       The Balanced Budget Amendment addresses a very important \n     issue, but it would dramatically complicate our ability to \n     plan for and manage a strong Department of Defense.\n       Defense programs would be especially vulnerable under the \n     BBA, because DoD accounts for about half of all discretionary \n     spending. And that is critical because the BBA has no \n     implementation details. Unless the BBA becomes a vehicle by \n     which revenues are increased or entitlements cut, DoD could \n     well have to pay for half of every dollar of deficit \n     reduction.\n       DoD budget authority, in real terms, has been in decline \n     since FY 1985. We have finally reached the end of our \n     builddown. It would be dangerous to continue to downsize our \n     forces at this time. The Balanced Budget Amendment would cut \n     defense spending to whatever level its arbitrary formula \n     dictated, and thereby displace the carefully considered \n     judgments of Members of Congress, Presidents, and civilian \n     and military leaders as to what spending is necessary and \n     wise.

We are \n     opposed to the proposed balanced budget amendment because it \n     is unnecessary and could undermine important functions of \n     this Department.\n       We certainly support the intended goal of reducing the \n     federal deficit. Indeed, in 1993 the President joined with \n     Members of Congress to enact the largest deficit reduction \n     bill in history. The Administration looks forward to \n     continuing to work with Congress on deficit reduction.\n       At the Department of Housing and Urban Development, we have \n     established basis spending priorities to guide our decisions \n     in preparing budgets for FY 96 and beyond. We have made our \n     own hard choices and tough spending cuts in developing our \n     proposed ``Reinvention Blueprint'', which would consolidate \n     60 programs into three programs and accomplish $800 million \n     in administrative savings alone over the next five years. \n     Further program reforms and budget economies to be announced \n     February 6, 1995 will show five year savings at HUD of $51 \n     billion in budget authority and $13 billion in outlays. In \n     addition, we have already generated savings through a \n     reorganization of our field structure to eliminate an entire \n     layer of regional management. We have found many ways to do \n     more with less people through service-oriented, performance-\n     driven, results management, and partnerships with communities \n     and the people we serve.\n       The proposed balanced budget amendment would create havoc \n     with our budget decisions and program management. It could \n     have a devastating impact on HUD's mission of service to the \n     American people and communities. For example, our Department \n     worked very hard to provide emergency relief to the victims \n     of natural disasters such as the Southern California \n     earthquake, the Midwest floods, Hurricane Andrew in Florida \n     and Hurricane Iniki in\n      Hawaii. Our ability to respond rapidly and effectively to \n     emergencies could be severely curtailed by the balanced \n     budget amendment. The amendment's requirement of a three-\n     fifths vote could cause long delays, severe hardship, and \n     perhaps even irreparable harm for the many people that \n     will lose their homes and urgently need adequate housing \n     in these emergency situations.\n       While we support the goal of a balanced budget, the \n     proposals under consideration to achieve a balanced budget by \n     the year 2002 could require an unprecedented level of \n     reductions in our programs. It is our understanding that, if \n     social security and defense are exempt from reductions and \n     the tax cuts in the Contract with America are enacted, the \n     remaining Federal programs will have to be reduced by more \n     than 30 percent in FY 2002. For HUD, this would mean a cut of \n     about $10 billion in one year alone. Assuming that reductions \n     of this magnitude would be evenly spread across agencies and \n     accounts, the effect on HUD programs would be devastating. \n     For example, low-income rental assistance, which in the \n     President's Budget would already be declining at the end of \n     the century, would suffer severely, putting thousands more \n     families at risk of homelessness, and our capacity to assist \n     the already homeless would be crippled. A cut of 30 percent--\n     $1.4 billion--in Community Opportunity Performance Funds \n     (CDBG), would be a major blow to cities and communities \n     across the nation who depend on the grant to support low-\n     income job creation and infrastructure.\n       HUD has taken a disciplined, fiscally responsible, creative \n     approach to achieving our key priorities. We have proposed \n     dramatic, sweeping changes in the way the Department is \n     structured and operates. Implementation of our Reinvention \n     Blueprint would make HUD a more customer-driven, cost-\n     effective, entrepreneurial organization. With consolidation \n     of existing programs into performance-based funds, the focus \n     would be on serving people and communities and producing \n     better outcomes at significantly less cost.\n       This Administration has made great strides in reducing the \n     size of the Federal budget and HUD has contributed to that \n     effort. We must continue these efforts, but we must be \n     prudent and produce real results, not simply crowd-pleasing \n     rhetoric.\n       I am committed to working with the Congress to produce \n     savings through further responsible program rescissions, \n     reductions and reforms.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Henry G. Cisneros.\n                               __________\n\n                                     U.S. Department of Education,\n\n\n                                                The Secretary,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 22, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: Thank you for your recent call and your \n     inquiry concerning the possible impact of a balanced budget \n     amendment to the Constitution on the operation of Federal \n     education programs. I have set out some examples of the \n     effect of the implementation of such an amendment on \n     education programs.\n       [[Page S3156]] I am informed by reliable analysts that if \n     we assume that Social Security and National Defense \n     Expenditures are exempted from the reductions in Federal \n     spending required to comply with a balanced budget amendment, \n     all other Federal programs could be subject to an estimated \n     30 percent reduction from the 1995 appropriated level.\n       Based on these assumptions, the following are some specific \n     examples of how these reductions could affect Department of \n     Education programs:\n       Financial aid for college--the surest route to the middle \n     class American dream--would be slashed. A 30 percent cut \n     would require a $2 billion cut in Pell Grant funding, \n     eliminating awards to nearly 300,000 students and reducing \n     the average award to the remaining 3.5 million students from \n     $1,548 to $1,218. The termination of loan interest subsidies \n     for 3 million low-income students and their families could \n     increase borrowing costs by as much as 20 percent over the \n     life of their loans. Support for the Supplemental Educational \n     Opportunity Grant and Work-Study programs would decline by \n     $360 million, eliminating awards to more than 500,000 needy \n     postsecondary students. These cuts would effectively reverse \n     30 years of progress in expanding postsecondary education \n     opportunity.\n       Goals 2000 and School-to-Work Opportunities. Reform efforts \n     now under way in nearly all States would be dramatically \n     scaled back, forcing the Nation to significantly reduce its \n     commitment to high standards for all students. Under Goals \n     2000, for example, 45 States and 5 territories and thousands \n     of communities are working hard to improve their schools, and \n     are counting on these Federal dollars to help implement their \n     education reform plans.\n       Title I Grants to Local Educational Agencies. The $2 \n     billion cut required by a balanced budget amendment could \n     reduce assistance to over 6 million economically \n     disadvantaged elementary and secondary school students, or \n     even terminate services altogether to as many as 2 million \n     students. Title I helps low-achieving children, particularly \n     those in high-poverty schools, meet the same challenging \n     academic content and performance standards expected of all \n     children.\n       Special Education Grants to States. Federal assistance in \n     meeting the extra costs of serving over 5.6 million children \n     with disabilities could drop from $426 to $298 per eligible \n     child. Similar reductions for preschool and early \n     intervention programs could lead many States to stop serving \n     younger children with disabilities, a step that could only \n     increase the need for more expensive services in later years.\n       Impact Aid. For this program, there could be a 30 percent \n     reduction in Federal support for paying the operating costs \n     of school districts enrolling large numbers of Federally \n     connected children. Districts heavily dependent on such \n     support could be forced to undertake such actions as \n     furloughing or laying off teachers or shortening the length \n     of the school year.\n       All of these serious reductions in Federal support for \n     education could come at a time when international economic \n     competition demands ever higher skill levels from American \n     workers, and when our civic life and democracy demands better \n     educated citizens. It is absolutely the wrong time to take \n     any steps that might reduce our investment in education. I \n     hope that this information will aid your efforts to place the \n     full implications of such an amendment before the Members of \n     the United States Senate.\n           Yours sincerely,\n     Richard W. Riley.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         The Secretary of Veterans Affairs,\n                                 Washington, DC, January 30, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: This is in response to your request for \n     information on the potential effect on VA programs of the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment that is soon to be considered on \n     the Senate floor. I appreciate the need for continuing \n     efforts to reduce federal deficits and support the goal of a \n     balanced budget. However, I am extremely worried about how \n     the current proposal would affect veterans and their \n     families.\n       The proponents of the amendment have refused to indicate \n     what spending cuts they would make in order to eliminate the \n     deficit by fiscal year 2002. Nevertheless, many of the \n     amendment's proponents have indicated what they will not do \n     to eliminate the deficit: reduce Social Security and increase \n     taxes. At the same time, they are promising to create new \n     deficit pressures by increasing defense spending and actually \n     reducing taxes, again without showing how they would offset \n     the enormous costs involved in their initiatives. But despite \n     the fundamental nature of the federal government's commitment \n     to our veterans, Balanced Budget Amendment proponents have \n     left VA programs on the table--subject to tremendous, \n     inevitable pressures that the amendment will create to cut \n     unprotected programs.\n       It is my understanding that, if Social Security and defense \n     are exempt from reductions and the tax cuts in the Contract \n     With America are enacted, then remaining federal programs \n     will have to be reduced by more than 30 percent in FY 2002. \n     Assuming, in the current absence of specifics, that such a \n     reduction would be applied across the board, it would have a \n     devastating effect on veterans' programs.\n       A 30-percent reduction to the Veterans Health \n     Administration would prohibit us from providing health care \n     services to many of those whom we now treat. A reduction in \n     full-time-equivalent employees (FTEE) of 63,000 in 2002 could \n     be expected and we would be able to treat 488,000 fewer \n     inpatients and accommodate 11,403,000 fewer outpatient \n     visits. The cutbacks could mean the closing of many VA\n      hospitals, outpatient clinics, and nursing homes. In fact, \n     the viability of the VA as a national health-care system \n     for veterans could be threatened. It certainly could not \n     be maintained on the same scale as today's system, and the \n     Department's ability to maintain the current high level of \n     quality care could be severely damaged.\n       Similarly, our Regional Offices could suffer a reduction of \n     3,000 FTEE, which might make it impossible for us to process \n     veterans' claims for benefits in a timely way. Likewise, \n     operations in the National Cemetery System might have to be \n     severely curtailed; impairing our ability to bury veterans \n     with dignity.\n       The many benefit programs that VA administers for disabled \n     veterans could also be subject to deep cuts. As an example, \n     certain severely disabled veterans who receive compensation \n     for service-connected disabilities would, under current \n     policy, be receiving approximately $42,400 per year by 2002. \n     A 30-percent reduction in such a veteran's earned benefit \n     would amount to $12,721 for that year. This is hardly an \n     appropriate response for a grateful nation.\n       Our pension program for non-service-disabled wartime \n     veterans is designed to keep these disabled veterans from \n     living a life of abject poverty. A 30-percent cut in 2002 \n     would result in a loss of up to $4,790 for the neediest of \n     veterans, and would force nearly all VA pension recipients \n     below the poverty line.\n       Thank you for this opportunity to share with you my \n     concerns regarding the Balanced Budget Amendment. As always, \n     I greatly appreciate your concern for and support of veterans \n     and their families.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jesse Brown.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           The Secretary of Health\n\n\n                                           and Human Services,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 30, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: Much has been said and written about \n     adding a balanced budget amendment to the United States \n     Constitution, but I want to make sure that the American \n     people and the members of Congress fully understand what such \n     an amendment could mean for the people served by the \n     Department of Health and Human Services.\n       Let me be clear: While we support the goal of a balanced \n     budget, the proposals under consideration by the Congress to \n     achieve a balanced budget by the year 2002 could require an \n     unprecedented level of reductions in our programs--including \n     Medicare, Head Start, NIH research, and Medicaid.\n       If reductions to Social Security and defense spending are \n     taken off the table and the tax cuts included in Contract \n     With America are adopted, then all other domestic programs, \n     including those at HHS, would have to be reduced by over 30 \n     percent. This magnitude of reduction could threaten the \n     affordable, high-quality health care our elderly have come to \n     expect, jeopardize the critical research performed by our \n     National Institutes of Health, and drive millions more \n     families into poverty.\n       Applying a 30 percent reduction to the Medicare program to \n     achieve the Balanced Budget Amendment goals could mean cuts \n     of over $100 billion in the year 2002 alone. If Congress \n     required beneficiaries to absorb the full cost, it would be \n     the equivalent of charging an additional $215 a month to \n     maintain the Medicare program in addition to the current \n     projected Part B premium in 2002 of $59 a month. If these \n     Medicare premiums are deducted from Social Security checks, \n     this would mean a 25 percent reduction in the average \n     beneficiary's Social Security check each month. For the one-\n     in-four elderly Americans who rely almost solely on their \n     Social Security check for their income, this is a painful \n     loss.\n       If Congress instead chooses to cut the $100 billion from \n     medical providers, then one of two things could happen: \n     Providers may accept fewer Medicare beneficiaries as \n     patients, or they may shift the costs to their non-Medicare \n     business. This could increase private sector health costs by \n     over 10 percent.\n       For Medicaid, balancing the budget could require over $55 \n     billion in cuts in the year 2002 alone. Because Medicaid is a \n     Federal/State partnership, cuts in the Federal budget could \n     force States to make up the cuts either with increased State \n     spending or through reduced support to the Medicaid program. \n     Either approach simply shifts the burdens to the States. \n     Moreover, States could have to choose between cutting \n     services or coverage to either the elderly, disabled or poor \n     mothers and their children.\n       Other key HHS programs could be harmed by a balanced budget \n     amendment. For example, Head Start local programs could be \n     forced to discontinue services to almost a quarter of a \n     million children. The National Institutes of Health could \n     lose $3.5 billion. This would be equivalent to eliminating \n     the \n     [[Page S3157]] entire National Cancer Institute; the National \n     Heart, Lung and Blood Institute; and about half of the \n     National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke.\n       This Administration has made great strides in reducing the \n     size of the Federal budget deficit, and the Department of \n     Health and Human Services has contributed its fair share, but \n     we must proceed down the path of further deficit reduction \n     with care and with the full knowledge of what the price will \n     be.\n           Sincerely,\n     Donna E. Shalala.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 27, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Byrd,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: We understand that the Senate will \n     shortly turn its consideration to various proposals to amend \n     the Constitution to require a balanced federal budget. We \n     certainly support the intended goal of reducing the federal \n     deficit. Indeed, in 1993, the President joined with Members \n     of Congress to enact the largest deficit reduction bill in \n     history. The Administration looks forward to continuing to \n     work with Congress on deficit reduction.\n       Before passing a balanced budget amendment, however, the \n     Congress should be keenly aware of the impact that such an \n     amendment could have on the essential operations of the \n     federal government in general, and of the Department of \n     Justice in particular. In a word, the impact could be \n     devastating.\\1\\\n     \\1\\Many proponents of the balanced budget proposals have \n     stated that they would implement the balanced budget \n     amendment without spending reductions in Social Security and \n     national defense. If this is the case, and if the tax \n     proposals contained in the Contract With America are adopted, \n     all other domestic discretionary spending would have to be \n     reduced by over 30 percent. Such reductions would be \n     unprecedented--indeed Draconian--and would wreak havoc on the \n     essential law enforcement programs of this Department.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       When the Attorney General testified before the Senate \n     Committee on Appropriations on February 15, 1994, she stated \n     that ``[p]ut simply, the Balanced Budget Amendment would put \n     at risk the Justice Department's ability to fight crime. \n     Passage of the Amendment would mean sharp reductions in all \n     of the Department's crime fighting units.'' This is as true \n     today as it was a year ago. We believe now, as we did then, \n     that the American people look to the federal government for \n     more, not less, assistance in making their communities safe, \n     and that they will not support arbitrary cutbacks or \n     limitations on the essential resources that are urgently \n     needed to combat wrongdoing.\n       The Attorney General also noted in her statement that \n     passage of the Balanced Budget Amendment would lead to sharp \n     reductions--and perhaps total elimination--of federal aid to \n     State and local law enforcement. As the Attorney General \n     indicated, elimination of this funding would ``destroy any \n     hope of implementing our community policing and pubic safety \n     initiatives''--two absolutely critical goals of last year's \n     crime bill. At a time when we are striving to assist our \n     State and local partners in ridding the Nation's schools and \n     streets of crime, such an outcome would be tragic--and wrong.\n       We have taken the liberty of enclosing a copy of the \n     Attorney General's statement of February 15, 1994, before the \n     Senate Appropriations Committee. It goes into considerably \n     greater detail than this letter about the likely negative \n     effects that passage and ratification of a Balanced Budget \n     Amendment would have upon the Department of Justice and upon \n     law enforcement in the United States. We recognize, of \n     course, that, because of the passage of time, the figures \n     cited in the Attorney General's statement are not current. \n     For example, the effects upon the Department, as stated by \n     the Attorney General, were based on the assumption that \n     spending would have to be reduced by twenty percent. If a \n     thirty percent reduction were required, the budget impact \n     would be fifty percent greater. These considerations do not, \n     however, alter in any way the conclusions contained in the \n     Attorney General's statement. If anything, they reinforce \n     them. We urge that the Senate evaluate these considerations \n     with extreme care before acting on any of the Balanced Budget \n     Amendments that may come before it.\n       Thank you for permitting us to provide our views on this \n     important matter.

My remarks this morning will be devoted to \n     explaining why this Amendment, which I oppose, could severely \n     undermine the ability of the Department of Justice to fulfill \n     its core function of fighting crime.\n       As everyone here is no doubt aware, the Administration is \n     deeply committed to fighting crime and to making our streets \n     and schools safe once again. President Clinton has made a \n     promise to the American people to use all the resources of \n     his Administration to reduce the rate of crime now plaguing \n     our communities. As the President himself said last month in \n     his State of the Union Address, ``violent crime and the fear \n     it provokes are crippling our society, limiting personal \n     freedom, and fraying the ties that bind us.'' Our charge is \n     clear: to rid our society of this scourge while healing the \n     wounds that divide us.\n       Members of this Committee have made a significant \n     contribution in the fight against crime by voting for passage \n     of a comprehensive crime bill. I salute you--and your \n     colleagues in the Senate--for your support and dedicated \n     efforts toward making this legislation a reality.\n       As Attorney General, my most important responsibility to \n     the American people is to ensure that the laws are strictly \n     enforced and that all the means at my disposal are utilized \n     to their fullest extent in the fight against crime. My \n     testimony today will focus on why the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment--by forcing cutbacks in the very programs at the \n     center of our anti-crime crusade--could severely undermine \n     the Department's ability to banish violence from our homes \n     and streets.\n       At the outset, let me state very clearly the basic \n     assumptions I have made in addressing the effects of the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment on the Department of Justice. For \n     purposes of my analysis this morning, I have assumed that any \n     spending cuts required by the Balanced Budget Amendment on \n     the department of Justice. For purposes of my analysis this \n     morning, I have assumed that any spending cuts required by \n     the Balanced Budget Amendment would be pro-rated across all \n     government programs; no single Cabinet Department or agency \n     would be asked to cut any more, or any less, than any other. \n     All would be affected equally.\n       Applying this basic assumption, in 1999--the earliest year \n     the Amendment could go into effect--the total budget deficit \n     is projected to be $201 billion. Because Department of \n     Justice outlays are approximately 1 percent of total Federal \n     outlays, we have estimated--again assuming that the \n     Department will be asked to make the same percentage of \n     spending reductions as everyone else--that the Department \n     would be cut by $2 billion in outlays, or one percent of $201 \n     billion. This equates to about $1.8 billion in budget \n     authority by 1999, or approximately 20 percent of our \n     discretionary budget authority.\n       Let me be blunt: If the Balanced Budget Amendment took \n     effect today, and we were asked to cut almost $2 billion from \n     our discretionary spending--the effects would be immediate, \n     and they would be dire. We would feel those cuts in the very \n     areas we are now trying to strengthen in order to win back \n     our streets, schools and homes against escalating crime and \n     violence.\n       Put simply, the Balanced Budget Amendment would put at risk \n     the Justice Department's ability to fight crime. Passage of \n     the Amendment would mean sharp reductions in all of the \n     Department's crime fighting units.\n\n\n the amendment would cause sharp reductions in essential departmental \n                                programs\n\n       Every single component of the Department--the FBI, the DEA, \n     INS, the U.S. Attorneys' Offices, the U.S. Marshal's Office, \n     the Bureau of Prisons, and other federal prosecutors--has \n     worked hard to meet the President's FY 1995 budget. To cut \n     them further--as the Balanced Budget Amendment would \n     require--would not only prevent us from meeting our ambitious \n     goals, but might result in a significant retreat from our \n     current capabilities. Let me be more specific.\n       As you all well know, most of the Department's activities \n     are funded out of a discretionary budget authority which is \n     under the jurisdiction of the Committees On Appropriations. \n     While the President's 1995 appropriation request for the \n     Department includes only $103 million in mandatory \n     appropriations, it includes a full $12.2 billion in \n     discretionary budget authority. This portion funds the FBI, \n     the DEA, the INS, the U.S. Marshals Offices, the U.S. \n     Attorneys Offices, the Criminal Division, the Tax Division, \n     the Antitrust Division, the Civil Rights Division, the \n     Environment and Natural Resources Division and their \n     respective litigating operations, the Bureau of Prisons, the \n     Office of Justice Programs, and other components.\n       As I have already testified, we estimate that the Balanced \n     Budget Amendment, if enacted, would require us to cut $2 \n     billion from our discretionary programs by 1999. Using 1994 \n     budget figures, instead of having $9.4 billion in \n     discretionary funds to spend on crime fighting measures, we \n     would have slightly more than seven and a half billion \n     dollars.\n       Make no mistake about it: these cuts would have immediate \n     consequences for our department. All this at a time when we \n     are working so hard to take back our streets and to stop this \n     devastating cycle of crime and violence.\n       With the public up in arms about the epidemic of crime in \n     our communities, I am confident that no one on this Committee \n     would want to see such draconian cuts in our crime-fighting \n     units. Unfortunately, the Balanced Budget Amendment might \n     leave us \n     [[Page S3158]] with no other choice. Indeed, if forced to \n     operate with the parameters of this Amendment, all the paths \n     available to us would lead to one inevitable dead-end--the \n     necessity of limiting the resources our nation so desperately \n     needs to fight crime aggressively.\n       For example, one of the cornerstones of our crime-fighting \n     program is the assistance we provide to state and local \n     jurisdictions devoted to crime prevention. In fiscal year \n     1994, this assistance, most of which comes in the form of \n     grants, will amount to nearly $1 billion. The purpose of \n     these funds is to help our local and state law enforcement \n     officials by supplementing their often severely limited \n     resources, providing incentives for action in areas of \n     critical need, and giving them the tools they need to serve \n     their communities.\n       The hard, cold reality is that complying with the \n     requirements of the Balanced Budget Amendment might mean \n     eliminating aid to state and local law enforcement entirely. \n     As the former prosecutor of Dade County, I learned first-hand \n     how critically important this assistance is to holding the \n     line against crime at the local level. I know, and President \n     Clinton knows, that it is our local law enforcement \n     officials, working in partnership with citizens and public \n     interest groups, who are leading the fight to take back our \n     streets. If that money is eliminated, it would effectively \n     destroy any hope of forging the crucial federal-local \n     partnerships that today must form the basis of our crime \n     prevention efforts, and destroy any hope of implementing our \n     community policing and public safety initiatives. In \n     practical terms, the Balanced Budget Amendment would make it \n     impossible to meet the President's budget request to put up \n     to 100,000 more police officers on the street by 1999. As you \n     know, in order to increase in 1995 the financial assistance \n     to state and local law enforcement for purposes authorized in \n     the Senate version of the crime bill, the President has \n     already ``bitten the bullet'' and reallocated within the \n     discretionary spending ceiling in order to support this new \n     initiative.\n       Yet eliminating all local and state assistance measures--\n     while a severe remedy in itself--would account for only half \n     of the cutbacks required by the Balanced Budget Amendment. \n     The Department would still have to eliminate approximately 11 \n     percent of its total full-time staff funded by discretionary \n     programs.\n       If instead state and local assistance were continued at a \n     rate 20 percent below the current level, we would need to cut \n     approximately 20,000 full-time employees, or about one-\n     quarter of our entire full-time workstaff.\n       If, on the other hand, we continued the President's \n     commitment to fund 100,000 new police, and the Balanced \n     Budget Amendment were enacted today, the effect on the \n     various Department components responsible for our crime \n     prevention efforts would be catastrophic. The 20 percent \n     reduction in our discretionary spending from 1994 resources \n     required by the Amendment would mean:\n       The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) would have to \n     decrease its 1994 resources by $412.1 million and eliminate \n     4387 positions, including approximately 1900 agents and 2500 \n     support staff. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) \n     would have to decrease its total resources by $145.9 million \n     and eliminate approximately 500 agents and 600 support staff.\n       The impact of this reduction on these programs would be \n     devastating. At all levels of law enforcement, essential \n     training programs and important task forces would be \n     eliminated. In addition, DEA's drug king-pin strategy would \n     be crippled. Most, if not all, of the DEA's resident offices \n     and posts of duty in small and mid-sized cities and towns \n     would have to be closed. These effects would be felt well \n     beyond this nation's borders, as DEA offices in drug source \n     and transit countries would be forced to close shop.\n       The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) would need \n     to reduce about 2400 staff members to cut $211.9 million off \n     its budget. A reduction of this magnitude would severely \n     curtail INS' ability to control the U.S. borders and enforce \n     the nation's immigration laws. At a time when both the agency \n     and the Administration have been targeting resources on \n     controlling our borders, this would virtually shut down \n     border patrol operations and negate all enhancements, \n     including the increased agent strength that we achieved in \n     1994.\n       No new prisons would be built by the Bureau of Prisons\n        (BOP), and due to lack of staff, existing institutions \n     would have to close. Prison overcrowding would soar, to a \n     startling 77 percent by 1999, forcing courts to mandate \n     the release of violent offenders back onto the street. \n     Living conditions would worsen, increasing the dangers \n     posed to staff, inmates and the community at large.\n       The American people, tired of empty rhetoric and tired of \n     escalating crime, are looking to us to provide direct and \n     immediate action to make our communities safe once again. By \n     passing the Balanced Budget Amendment, we would not be able \n     to make good on the promises set forth in the crime bill. We \n     would be saying to the American people in the same breath \n     that while we're serious about fighting crime, we won't be \n     able to fund the essential programs necessary to win this \n     battle. We can not--and we should not--send such conflicting \n     messages to the American people.\n       By passing the Balanced Budget Amendment, we would be \n     gutting the heart and soul of the Senate-passed Crime Bill: \n     the 20 percent reduction required by the Amendment would \n     affect the Crime Control Fund like all other discretionary \n     spending programs. For example, one of the most important \n     initiatives included in the Crime Bill is the provision to \n     hire 100,000 new police officers over the next five years. \n     America's neighborhoods desperately need these new cops; more \n     cops on the streets, working hand-in glove in their \n     communities, means less crime. If passed today, the Balanced \n     Budget Amendment will severely undercut our ability to put \n     these police in the communities where they belong.\n       Just as important to our crime-fighting plan is the \n     decision to build boot camps. These camps can give youths who \n     have committed their first crime and who are at risk of drug \n     and gang involvement the discipline, education and training \n     they need to grab another chance for an honest life. If \n     passed today, the Balanced Budget Amendment, however, would \n     slash funds intended for these camps, depriving many young \n     offenders of a chance at a new start on life.\n       Similarly, drug-treatment and coerced abstinence programs \n     for criminal offenders--including residential substance abuse \n     for prisoners--cornerstones of both the Crime Bill and the \n     President's National Drug Control Strategy, would not be \n     possible under a Balanced Budget Amendment. Nor could the \n     Bill's plan to help support drug courts, drug testing and \n     certainty of punishment for young offenders be implemented \n     under a Balanced Budget Amendment.\n       Tomorrow, Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger will \n     testify before this Committee on the potential impact of the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment on the structure of the \n     constitution, and I don't want to duplicate what he will say. \n     I do hope, however, that you will listen very carefully to \n     his testimony, because it will highlight another important \n     aspect of this debate, one that merits serious consideration \n     when you debate the merits of this Amendment.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Mr. Chairman, I hope my testimony has made this Committee \n     more aware of just how dangerous the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment could be for the Department and its efforts to \n     reduce violent crime and drugs in America's streets and \n     schools.\n       No one wants to see the deficit reduced more than this \n     Administration. As the President and the Senate showed last \n     summer, the deficit can be reduced only if we are willing to \n     make the hard and necessary choices to control federal \n     spending.\n       The Balanced Budget Amendment is not the simple cure that \n     its proponents suggest. If it does work, it will only cause \n     painful reductions in the very areas we are trying to \n     bolster.\n       The fight against crime is not easy. It has never been \n     easy. Hundreds of thousands of Americans each day put their \n     lives on the line to protect their fellow-countrymen and \n     women from the dangers of their communities. We owe it to \n     them, and to all of us who are afraid to walk our streets at \n     night or to attend schools during the daytime, to provide \n     them with the resources to stamp out this epidemic of crime \n     and restore our neighborhood security. The Balanced Budget \n     Amendment will impede us in this effort at the very time that \n     it is needed most. Let us not make this mistake.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to meet with you this morning \n     and I'll be happy to answer any questions.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Howard Dean, M.D.,\n     Chairman, National Governors' Association, Office of the \n         Governor, Montpelier, VT.\n       Dear Governor Dean: I write to answer your request for \n     information on the likely effects of passage of a balanced-\n     budget amendment, accompanied by ``Contract with America'' \n     federal tax reductions, on state budgets and state taxes.\n       Enclosed is a set of estimates that Treasury staff have \n     constructed of the possible effect on states and their \n     finances of a constitutional amendment requiring the \n     balancing of the federal budget in 2002, accompanied by the \n     tax reductions mentioned above. These estimates are based on \n     the following assumptions: (I) that the federal budget would \n     be balanced through spending cuts, (II) that Social Security \n     and Defense spending would not be reduced below baseline, and \n     thus (III) that the entire burden of balancing the federal \n     budget would be placed on non-interest, non-Social Security, \n     non-Defense spending, as proposed methods for balancing the \n     budget and financing various tax cuts excludes Social \n     Security and Defense.\n       The estimates assume that every expenditure--interest, \n     Social Security, and Defense aside--would be reduced relative \n     to baseline by the same proportional amount. The estimates \n     assume that the deficit reduction will be phased in \n     gradually, an equal amount in each year between now and 2002. \n     This arrangement of the spending cuts results in substantial \n     interest savings relative to the baseline in 2002, and thus \n     reduces the amount of non-interest spending that must be cut \n     in 2002 to balance the budget.\n       Nevertheless, the cuts required in 2002 would be severe. To \n     help balance the budget and help offset the tax reductions \n     noted above, federal grants to states would be cut by a total \n     of $97.8 billion in fiscal 2002. Other federal spending that \n     directly benefits state \n     [[Page S3159]] residents would be cut by $242.2 billion in \n     fiscal 2002.\n       The cuts in grants--in Medicaid, highway funds, AFDC, and \n     other grants--and the cuts in other spending--on Medicare and \n     on other spending--were distributed across states \n     proportionately to current levels of federal expenditures. \n     Also reported is the amount by which total state taxes would \n     have to be raised if the state wished to fully offset the \n     reduction in federal grants.\n       Grants to states in the aggregate, to specific states, and \n     to states for specific programs may be cut by more or by less \n     than projected here. Yet, without further detail, the most \n     reasonable method for illustrating the likely burdens on \n     states is to assume across-the-board proportional cuts.\n       Note, also, that these estimates do not incorporate any \n     significant feedback effects: it is possible that shifts in \n     monetary policy would not be able to fully offset the \n     downward macroeconomic impact of a balanced-budget amendment. \n     To the extent that implementation of an amendment slows \n     growth and reduces state revenues, the gap would be somewhat \n     larger and the effect on state finances somewhat more severe. \n     On the other hand, balancing the federal budget could have \n     substantial positive effects on the U.S. economy, which would \n     promise to raise state revenues as state economic activity \n     increased. Such effects are not discussed here.\n       Note, finally, that this set of estimates is far from being \n     a complete analysis of a balanced-budget amendment. Its \n     principal function is to identify and evaluate the \n     approximate impact on state government finances of a \n     constitutional amendment that requires federal budget balance \n     by 2002.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                                Joyce Carrier,\n\n                                        Deputy Assistant Secretary\n     for Public Liaison.\n

The second scenario differs from \n     the first in that it also incorporates a set of deficit-\n     increasing provisions in the Contract with America (CWA). \n     These provisions are all tax reductions except for a spending \n     increase associated with relaxation of the Social Security \n     earnings test. No specific defense spending increases \n     discussed in the CWA are reflected in the simulations.\n\n              Step 1: Derive size of aggregate budget cuts\n\n       Congressional Budget Office (CBO) baseline estimates of the \n     Federal deficit were taken from Table 4 of the preliminary \n     Economic and Budget Outlook dated January 5, 1995. Equal \n     yearly deficit reductions, beginning in FY1996, were then \n     computed which were sufficient to achieve a balanced budget \n     by FY2002.\n       The required cuts take into account the interest savings \n     that would result from lower deficits and debt; a 6.7 percent \n     rate of interest was assumed throughout based on long-term \n     CBO projections of the 10-year Treasury note rate. The \n     estimates are static in nature and reflect no macroeconomics \n     feedback--e.g., lower economic growth resulting from the \n     contractionary effects of deficit reduction or higher growth \n     resulting from lower tax rates. Deficit-reducing spending and \n     tax changes of $248 billion, or 22.5 percent of noninterest, \n     non-Social Security spending, would have to be made in FY2002 \n     to achieve a balanced budget. The required cumulative deficit \n     reduction is approximately $1.3 trillion, of which about $0.2 \n     trillion occurs through interest savings.\n       A similar procedure was used to derive required spending \n     reductions with the CWA's tax cut and Social Security \n     spending amounts (and associated interest carrying costs) \n     added to the CBO deficit baseline. Estimated revenue effects \n     of the proposed tax reductions were obtained from the \n     Treasury Department, Office of Tax Analysis. Annual costs of \n     the proposed relaxation of the Social Security earnings test \n     were taken from a National Economic Council staff working \n     paper, September 20, 1994. The required percentage spending \n     reduction is 30.9 percent in this scenario. The aggregate \n     required cuts in total spending in FY2002 total $340 billion.\n\n            Step 2: Derive allocation parameters for states\n\n       Grants to state and local governments, as well as Social \n     Security, defense, and other Federal spending, are reported \n     in Federal Expenditures by State for Fiscal Year 1993. Our \n     analysis divides intergovernmental grants into four \n     components. Aid to Families with Dependent Children, \n     Medicaid, highway trust fund grants, and all Other. It was \n     assumed that all grants in the first three of these \n     categories went directly to state governments. To estimate \n     the local share of the Other category, we used estimates of \n     total 1992 intergovernmental revenues from Federal to local \n     governments in each state, as reported in the August 1994 \n     Census publication Government Finances, 1991-92: Preliminary \n     Report. These state-by-state estimates were divided by the \n     Government Finances estimates of Federal revenues to states \n     and localities combined, less the values of AFDC, Medicaid, \n     and highway grants from the FY1992 edition of Federal \n     Expenditures by State. It should be emphasized that \n     discrepancies between the Government Finances and Federal \n     Expenditures aggregates, resulting from different definitions \n     and sources, make this local vs. state, decomposition of \n     Other grants an imprecise process.\n       State tax revenues for the average of the 1990 and 1992 \n     fiscal years was also taken from issues of Government \n     Finances. The use of two years at different points in the \n     business cycle was designated to mitigate cyclical influences \n     on projected revenue.\n\n             Step 3: Project FY2002 Grants and State Taxes\n\n       CBO's projected levels for FY2002 for Social Security, \n     Medicare, and most other major spending categories were taken \n     from the above-mentioned CBO report. For defense spending, \n     the Administration's project of FY2000 defense outlays was \n     inflated by the annual rate of growth to total discretionary \n     spending from FY2000 to FY2002 in the CBO projections.\n       The projection of grant amounts was also derived from the \n     long-term CBO budget forecast. AFDC grants were projected \n     using the ratio of 2002 to 1993 values of Other Mandatory \n     spending as reported by CBO, respectively, in the January 5 \n     report and on page 37 of The Economic and Budget Outlook: \n     Update dated August 1994. (Unpublished figures on FY1993 \n     Civil Service and military retirement spending were obtained \n     from CBO.) Highway trust fund grants were projected using the \n     ratio of 2002 to 1993 values of domestic discretionary \n     spending; the 2002 value was estimated as estimated total \n     nondefense discretionary spending multiplied by the FY2002 \n     ratio of domestic to the sum of international and domestic \n     discretionary spending in Table 4 of the January 5 report.\n       The category of Other grants was decomposed into \n     discretionary and mandatory components. The Other mandatory \n     component was defined to include: Agricultural Marketing \n     Service Funds for strengthening markets (Section 32); child \n     nutrition programs; food stamp grants; special milk program; \n     national grasslands payments to counties; social services \n     block grants; foster care and adoption assistance; assistance \n     for legalized aliens; other Administration for Children and \n     Families grants; and Supplemental Security Income grants. \n     These were projected in the same manner as AFDC, while the \n     residual Other discretionary grants were projected in the \n     same manner as highway grants.\n       Total baseline state taxes were projected to move in \n     proportion to nominal U.S. Gross Domestic Product. The \n     projection of GDP for calendar year 2000 was taken from Table \n     1 of the CBO January 5 report and increased by three years of \n     assumed 2.3 percent real growth and 2.8 percent increases in \n     the GDP price deflator. The growth in nominal GDP between \n     1991 and 2002 was converted to a per capita basis. Individual \n     state taxes in FY2002 were then estimated by multiplying \n     1990-1992 state population growth and the growth in U.S. per \n     capita GDP. State population totals for 2000 and 2010 were \n     drawn from the 1994 Statistical Abstract, and our estimates \n     for 2002 were interpolations of the 2000 and 2010 values.\n\n    Step 4: Derive required grant reductions and state tax increases\n\n       The percentage reductions in FY2002 grants and other \n     spending components necessary to achieve budget balance were, \n     by assumption, equal to the aggregate rate computed for all \n     nondefense, non-Social Security spending. Finally, the \n     percentage increase in the state tax levels necessary to make \n     up the dollar loss in Federal grants to each state was \n     computed.--Office of Economic Policy, Department of the \n     Treasury, January 11, 1995.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                High Cost of A Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n                           (By Richard Kogan)\n\n       Advocates of the Balanced Budget Amendment to the \n     Constitution do not intend to jeopardize the life savings of \n     America's families, or threaten the stability of the nation's \n     banks. As written, however, the amendment could do just that.\n       Currently, America's savings are safe. The Federal Deposit \n     Insurance Corp. (FDIC) \n     [[Page S3170]] guarantees individual deposits in banks and \n     thrift institutions up to $100,000 per account. Depositors \n     rely on the U.S. government to keep its word, quickly and \n     automatically; if a bank goes broke, the government makes \n     good on deposits. Deposit insurance claims are enforceable in \n     court.\n       Now look at the Balanced Budget Amendment. It begins, \n     ``Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \n     receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of the \n     whole number of each house of Congress shall provide by law \n     for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a roll-call \n     vote.'' This deceptively simple concept--that the federal \n     budget must be balanced each eyar--would inadvertently cast \n     doubt over the ``full faith and credit'' of the U.S. \n     government, putting all federal guarantees, including deposit \n     insurance, at risk.\n       Here's why. During a severe economic downturn, the risk of \n     bank failure is greatest. An economic downturn also produces \n     (or exacerbates) federal budget deficits as tax revenues \n     decline and spending for programs such as unemployment \n     compensation increases. At such time, the government would \n     lack the extra revenues it could need to cover the large \n     costs of rescuing depositors and the banking system. Under \n     current law, deposit insurance claims are automatically paid \n     as needed, regardless of the deficit. Under the amendment, if \n     deposit insurance payments would cause a deficit, might not \n     those payments be prohibited? Don't forget that the measure \n     would amend the Constitution, while deposit insurance and \n     other such guarantees are only statutes.\n       American banking was not always protected. The Great \n     Depression was so steep--the economy shrank almost 30 percent \n     from 1929 to 1933--in part because there was no deposit \n     insurance. Some lost all their savings. A rumor that a bank \n     was in trouble prompted panic, with depositors rushing to \n     withdraw their savings. Even false rumors caused banks to \n     collapse.\n       One of President Roosevelt's first acts was to close the \n     banks while Congress enacted deposit insurance. The banks \n     reopened, citizens could redeposit their funds in safety and \n     the economic collapse ended. Deposit insurance became the \n     first and best economic stabilizer. It is one reason that no \n     post-war recession has shrunk the economy more than 3\\1/2\\ \n     percent.\n       Doesn't the FDIC charge annual fees to banks, building up \n     large balances, which would automatically be available in a \n     banking crisis?\n       Not after the amendment. It prohibits spending borrowed \n     funds. Incredibly, it also prohibits using accumulated \n     savings; it requires that all federal spending in any fiscal \n     year be covered by that year's revenues. This requirement is \n     like telling a family to finance a new house or a child's \n     college tuition out of that year's wages, no matter how much \n     money the family has in the bank. In this case, the amendment \n     precludes a sudden increase in deposit insurance payments if \n     that increase would cause federal spending to exceed federal \n     revenues in that year, no matter how much the FDIC has ``in \n     the bank.''\n       There are two possible ways out. First, Congress could \n     raise taxes or cut other spending by enough to offset deposit \n     insurance costs. But the potential size of those payments \n     shows why they could not be easily offset. The recent \n     restructuring of the savings and loan industry required \n     deposit insurance payments of $156 billion over four years, \n     $66 billion in 1991 alone. And the government's deposit \n     insurance guarantee covers private savings of $2.7 trillion. \n     These amounts are too large to be offset by a single year's \n     tax increases or spending cuts.\n       Second, there is the escape hatch. By a three-fifths vote, \n     Congress could choose to pay deposit insurance and allow \n     deficit spending. But it is hardly automatic that Congress \n     would respond in a timely manner (or at all), even in a \n     pending crisis. In August 1941 Congress barely mustered a \n     majority to extend the draft, even though Hitler had already \n     marched across half of Europe. In the current debate, neither \n     the Senate nor the House could find a majority to write into \n     the amendment an exception for recessions.

And a laid-off worker who collected \n     $12,000 in unemployment pay might have received only $7,000 \n     or so.\n       Such estimates of the potential economic impact are not \n     emphasized very much, however, in the debate over the \n     balanced budget amendment. So far, the battle has focused on \n     its value as a tool to shrink government or to discipline \n     spending. But if the amendment is enacted, the side effect \n     would be huge: a system that has softened recessions since \n     the 1930's would be dismantled.\n       ``There are risks associated with a balanced budget, and I \n     don't think anyone should deny them.'' said William Hoagland, \n     the Republican staff director for the Senate Budget \n     Committee. ``Nevertheless, the debate on the floor has been \n     dominated by what we must do to get the budget in balance, \n     not what the risks of a balanced budget amendment might be.''\n       Mr. Hoagland expressed surprise that the biggest risk--\n     deeper, more painful recessions--had not figured \n     significantly in the debate, although Senator Daniel P. \n     Moynihan, Democrat of New York, and Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, \n     Democrat of Maryland, had called attention to this risk in \n     several floor speeches. ``The reason must be that the \n     advocates of a balanced budget see the benefits to the \n     economy as far outweighing the negatives associated with \n     cyclical downturn,'' Mr. Hoagland said. ``That must be what \n     is going on.''\n       No benefit seems to hold more sway than the view that the \n     amendment would shrink the Federal Government by restricting \n     its power to tax and to spend. A dollar not collected and \n     spent by the Government is a dollar left in the hands of the \n     private sector. And the private sector invariably invests \n     money more efficiently than the Government, this view holds.\n The ``automatic stabilizers'' of the economy rely on deficit spending\n\n       ``The people have spoken clearly that government is too big \n     and we need to do something about it,'' said Robert Hall, a \n     Stanford University economist who favors smaller government. \n     ``The problem is that the balanced budget amendment is a \n     heavy-handed solution and risky.''\n       The biggest risk is to the nation's ``automatic \n     stabilizers,'' which have made recessions less severe than \n     they were in the century before World War II. The \n     stabilizers, an outgrowth of Keynesian economics, work this \n     way: When the economy weakens, outlays automatically rise for \n     unemployment pay, food stamps, welfare and Medicaid. \n     Simultaneous, as incomes fall, so do corporate and individual \n     income tax payments. Both elements make more money available \n     for spending, thus helping to pull the economy out of its \n     slump.\n       The problem, of course, is that the stabilizers make the \n     deficit shoot up--by roughly $65 billion as a result of the \n     1990-1991 recession, according to the Treasury Department. \n     Under the balanced budget amendment, Congress and the \n     Administration would be required to get the budget quickly \n     back into balance, through spending cuts, higher tax rates, \n     or a combination of the two--perhaps even in the midst of a \n     recession.\n       ``The Government would become, almost inevitably, a \n     destabilizer of the economy rather than a stabilizer,'' said \n     Joseph Stiglitz, a member of the President's Council of \n     Economic Advisers. Many economists share that view.\n       Absent the stabilizers, every 73-cent drop in national \n     income in the last recession would have become a $1 drop, \n     said Bradford DeLong, deputy assistant Secretary of the \n     Treasury, who as a Harvard economist studies this dynamic and \n     recently updated his research. Of the 27 cents in cushioning, \n     20 cents came from falling tax revenue and 7 cents from the \n     higher spending.\n       Economists outside the Government offer similar estimates. \n     Ray Fair of Yale University, for example, said for every $10 \n     billion decline in national income during a recession, the \n     deficit rises by $2 billion, as the stabilizers kick in with \n     their higher spending and lower tax revenue.\n       ``We ought not to give up the stabilizers,'' Professor Fair \n     said. ``That would be very Draconian.''\n       Nearly every economist agrees that the American economy \n     requires, if not stabilizers, some substitute method for \n     offsetting recessions in an era of balanced budgets. And \n     those who favor the amendment are no exception.\n       ``It would be a disaster to lose the stabilizers,'' said C. \n     Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute of International \n     Economics, who endorses the amendment as a necessary step if \n     the nation is to afford the high cost of Social Security and \n     Medicare for the baby boom generation, which reaches \n     retirement age early in the next century.\n       Mr. Bergsten notes that the amendment, as now worded, would \n     permit Congress to bring back the stabilizers by a three-\n     fifths vote in both houses. The vote would permit the \n     necessary deficit spending to finance the stabilizers.\n       While a three-fifths vote is a big hurdle, Mr. Bergsten and \n     others argue that Congress would get used to authorizing the \n     necessary deficits during recessions. Nevertheless, he would \n     prefer a different solution. Once through the painful process \n     of balancing the budget by 2002, as required by the \n     amendment, then the Government should run budget surpluses in \n     years of strong economic growth and full employment, Mr. \n     Bergsten said.\n       The surpluses would cover the rising costs of the \n     stabilizers during recessions. ``You could go down to a \n     balanced budget in the hard years, and still give the economy \n     a little stimulus,'' he said.\n[[Page S3171]] is monetary policy enough to bolster the u.s. economy in \n                              tough times?\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the \n     surplus needed to pay for the stabilizers during a recession \n     as severe as that of 1981-1982, the worst since World War II, \n     would be 1 percent of the national income during robust \n     periods of full employment, and perhaps as much as 1.5 \n     percent.\n       That would mean an annual surplus in today's dollars of $70 \n     billion to $100 billion, rather than the nearly $200 billion \n     or so in annual deficits expected under current policy. Most \n     of the $200 billion is to help pay for programs like highway \n     construction and new weaponry that have fixed costs and do \n     not fluctuate with the ups and downs of the economy, as \n     unemployment pay, food stamps, tax revenues and the other \n     stabilizers do.\n       Some economists--including Milton Friedman, a Nobel \n     laureate in economics who is with the Hoover Institute--hold \n     that the stabilizers, despite the ballyhoo, are no longer so \n     important. The Federal Reserve, through monetary policy, can \n     more than offset their disappearance by lowering interest \n     rates an extra notch or two to give the economy an additional \n     stimulus in hard times.\n       ``I have looked at many episodes in the world in which \n     monetary policy went one way and fiscal policy the other, and \n     I have never found a case in which monetary policy did not \n     dominate,'' Mr. Friedman said. He favors a balanced budget \n     amendment that would shrink the Federal Government by putting \n     a ceiling on the tax increases that could be enacted to \n     balance the budget.\n       But the Clinton Administration and even Federal Reserve \n     officials question whether monetary policy could alone handle \n     the task of reviving an economy in recession. The \n     stabilizers, they note, kick in automatically--before the \n     Federal Reserve and most economists often realize that the \n     economy is falling toward recession.\n       A recession might be well along and getting deeper before \n     the Fed recognized the problem and began to drop rates. The \n     lower rates, in turn, would not be felt in the economy for a \n     year to 18 months, the traditional lag. And even if the Fed \n     acted quickly enough, the economy would behave in new and \n     different ways without the stabilizers.\n       ``My guess is that we would get it wrong the first time we \n     went into recession, making that recession much deeper than \n     it should be,'' said a Federal Reserve official, who spoke on \n     condition that he not be identified. ``But we would learn \n     from that experience and do a better job thereafter.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n                     [From Newsweek, Jan. 30, 1995]\n\n Corrupting the Constitution: Balance the Budget, But Not by Amendment\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       The Constitution is not a sledgehammer. It embodies broad \n     principles of government and enduring national values. As \n     such, it commands deep public respect and even reverence. \n     There's a temptation to think that its power and mystique can \n     bludgeon public opinion into convenient consensus on hard \n     issues. It can't, and the exercise shouldn't be tried. The \n     balanced-budget amendment--to be debated by Congress this \n     week--promises just such a popular conversion. The proposal \n     is a very bad idea.\n       You should not confuse balancing the budget, which in \n     general is desirable, with the undesirability of using the \n     Constitution to do it. Just because the Constitution requires \n     a balanced budget does not mean that the budget will be \n     balanced. If an amendment were regularly flouted, then the \n     budgetary impasse would become a constitutional crisis. ``The \n     first principle of a conservative should be: don't muck with \n     the Constitution,'' says constitutional scholar Robert \n     Goldwin of the American Enterprise Institute.\n       By this standard, Congress has lots of Republicans but few \n     conservatives. The amendment's advocates essentially embrace \n     a theory of immaculate consensus. No one wants to confront \n     the inconsistencies of public opinion--the simultaneous \n     desires for lower taxes, higher spending and no tampering \n     with social security--that cause budget deficits. Instead, an \n     amendment is supposed to dissolve these inconsistencies. \n     Congress can't control ``its deficit addiction without the \n     strong therapy of a constitutional mandate to make it get \n     clean and sober,'' proclaims Orrin Hatch, chairman of the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       All recent major amendment proposals have been similarly \n     inspired; they aimed to pervert the Constitution by using it \n     to settle passionate public disputes. The school-prayer, \n     ``equal rights'' and anti-abortion amendments all fit this \n     description. None succeeded, because the Founders did not \n     intend for the Constitution to be so used. They set high \n     hurdles for amendments (two-thirds congressional approval, \n     then ratification by three quarters of the states). Although \n     Prohibition--the 18th Amendment--overcame these barriers, it \n     showed the folly of using the Constitution for consciousness-\n     raising.\n       Congress passed it in 1917 in a ``mood of Spartan \n     idealism'' created by World War I, wrote historian Frederick \n     Lewis Allen. If the war would ``end all wars,'' then \n     Americans could imagine an ``era of efficient sobriety!'' The \n     actual result was rampant lawlessness: bootleggers, speak-\n     easies and gangsterism. Congress was complicit because--\n     caught between demands for tougher enforcement and for \n     repeal--it did neither. Finally, the amendment was repealed \n     in 1933.\n       The plain lesson that the Constitution can't singlehandedly \n     impose consensus is now ignored. The amendment's proponents \n     echo the simple moralisms of prohibitionists; note Senator \n     Hatch's identical imagery (``get clean and sober''). The \n     reality is bound to be grittier. Consider three broad \n     possibilities and their probability if Congress passes the \n     amendment.\n       It's ratified by the states--and it works. Intimidated, \n     Congress and the president end programs (farm subsidies, \n     public TV) and trim entitlements (social security, Medicare). \n     Because a deficit remains, they also raise taxes. Finally, \n     they pass long-term social-security and Medicare reforms to \n     prevent huge deficits when baby boomers retire. (Probability, \n     generously: 20 percent.)\n       It isn't ratified. Congressional passage triggers a \n     lobbying and TV blitz aimed at state legislatures by groups \n     that feel threatened (the elderly, farmers, the poor, etc.). \n     State and local officials realize the amendment could be \n     costly; less federal spending on highways, health care and \n     schools will mean more pressure for local spending. \n     (Probability: 40 percent.)\n       It's ratified--and doesn't work as advertised. Congress \n     balks at visible tax increases or entitlement cuts. Or it \n     regularly votes to run deficits by a three-fifths majority, \n     as the amendment permits. Or it resorts to gimmicks to spend \n     outside ``the budget.'' The amendment has no enforcement \n     mechanism: courts refuse to intervene, because budget choices \n     are deemed ``political'' matters. (Probability: 40 percent.)\n       Until the 1960s, Americans valued balanced budgets. The \n     respect was rooted in Jeffersonian beliefs that budget \n     balancing checked the ``corruption'' of government, writes \n     political scientist James Savage of the University of \n     Virginia.* Deficits were tolerated in wars and depressions. \n     But the need for discipline was seen, and budgets were \n     balanced in good times. This consensus was destroyed by \n     Keynesian doctrines that deficits could spur the economy. \n     Now, the need is to reverse this: to de-emphasize the \n     budget's use as an economic tool, and to restore a balanced \n     budget as a way of defining what government should and \n     shouldn't do.\n\n\n                          bipartisan hysteria\n\n       Unfortunately, the balanced-budget amendment serves as an \n     excuse to evade specifics. At present, balancing the budget \n     is not so hard. The deficit equals about 2.5 to 3 percent of \n     national income. Americans will not starve if farm subsidies \n     stop; the elderly will not become destitute if cost-of-living \n     adjustments are trimmed; the economy will not collapse if \n     taxes are raised modestly. Changes are horrific only if any \n     spending cuts or tax increases are considered intolerable. \n     The harder issues involve adjusting programs for baby \n     boomers' retirement.\n       Yet, budget hysteria is bipartisan. House Majority Leader \n     Richard Armey won't say how Republicans would balance the \n     budget because ``once members of Congress know exactly, \n     chapter and verse, the pain . . . to get to a balanced \n     budget, their knees will buckle.'' President Clinton condemns \n     GOP silence. But he has not proposed a balanced budget; all \n     the White House plugs is ``deficit reduction.'' Worse, it \n     tries to terrify people about the harsh tax hikes or spending \n     cuts needed to balance the budget.\n       The resort to the Constitution is a reckless gambit that \n     could backfire in many ways. It postpones necessary choices \n     and, perversely, could make the choices harder by mobilizing \n     threatened groups against ratification. But mostly it \n     assaults our political culture. The Constitution stands above \n     ordinary disputes; that's why it's respected. The amendment \n     imperils this. Instead of elevating the budget debate, it may \n     lower the Constitution.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 24, 1995]\n\n                 State of the Union? Someday, Paralyzed\n\n                            (By Paul Starr)\n\n       Princeton, N.J. When the Framers replaced the Articles of \n     Confederation with the Constitution, they gave the Government \n     unqualified and unimpeded fiscal powers. Today, a new \n     Republican majority in Congress proposes to overturn that \n     decision. Speaker Newt Gingrich says he intends to reverse \n     the growth of the Federal Government's role in society since \n     1932. The legacy he challenges, however, is not only that of \n     Franklin D. Roosevelt but more fundamentally that of \n     Alexander Hamilton.\n       As President Clinton delivers his State of the Union \n     Message tonight, many Americans will wonder about the fate of \n     particular programs and policies in the new Congress. But the \n     larger question raised by the Republicans is the Government's \n     capacity to act, for they propose not just to shrink programs \n     but to impose a permanent constitutional straightjacket that \n     is likely to paralyze the Government in future crises.\n       The Constitution is a parsimonious document, unencumbered \n     with detailed policy prescriptions. This restraint expressed \n     confidence in representative government; it left the people's \n     future representatives free to confront problems the Founders \n     knew they could not anticipate. As Hamilton explains in ``The \n     Federalist'' (No. 30), it was imprudent to set any limit to \n     the new government's taxing power because there was no clear \n     limit to the demands that might be placed upon it. The \n     Constitutional Convention deliberately rejected requirements \n     for supermajorities: impediments to revenue-raising had \n     helped make the Articles of Confederation unworkable.\n       [[Page S3172]] Today's Republican majority apparently \n     believes it is more capable of making fiscal policy for \n     future generations than were the Founding Fathers. It seeks \n     to prescribe a balanced-budget amendment, to require a three-\n     fifths supermajority for tax increases and to prohibit the \n     Government from imposing requirements on the states except \n     when it assumes 100 percent of the costs.\n       These measures are frankly intended to disable a Government \n     that many Americans say they no longer trust. Yet those \n     measures severely weaken the Government's capacity to achieve \n     any purpose. They hand weapons to minorities to obstruct \n     majorities: a minority in either house would be able to \n     impede preparations for national defense as well as spending \n     on the poor.\n       If in the pursuit of a balanced budget in the year 2002, we \n     cut Medicare and social programs and provoked an inevitable \n     angry reaction, it would be all the harder to find money for \n     purposes that conservatives prefer, whether ``Star Wars'' \n     defense systems, more prisons or intensified border patrols.\n       The Government's capacity to act is a resource as much for \n     conservative as for liberal purposes. So those who are \n     planting a time bomb under the welfare state may see it \n     explode in their own faces.\n       The comeuppance could be much more serious for the nation \n     than for any party. The dangers would likely be greatest in a \n     recession. If revenue fell along with economic activity and \n     if three-fifths of Congress could not agree to run a deficit, \n     the Government would be forced to aggravate the downturn by \n     cutting public expenditures as well--a recipe for turning \n     recessions into depressions.\n       The Pentagon is committed to maintaining forces prepared to \n     fight two wars simultaneously, but a nation with weakened \n     fiscal powers is much less capable of sustaining such \n     commitments. Our enemies would understand this and act \n     accordingly.\n       Some critics may dismiss these as empty worries. After all, \n     the amendment, if passed in time, would not require a \n     balanced budget until 2002. But seven years come soon enough. \n     Concerns about the amendment are empty only if the amendment \n     itself is empty of force.\n       The requirements for supermajorities are the most dangerous \n     element in the Republicans' plan. But even if they reduced \n     voting requirements to an absolute majority of members of \n     Congress--as many Democrats prefer--it would give undue \n     constitutional force to the norm of budget balancing.\n       Denying the Government the routine power to borrow is a \n     surrender to the medieval view of debt that continues to \n     shape popular attitudes. The introduction of credit cards \n     almost three decades ago prompted overwhelming disapproval in \n     public opinion surveys; meanwhile, Americans got the cards in \n     droves.\n       There has never been a time--not even during the New Deal--\n     when public opinion surveys failed to register overwhelming \n     disapproval of government deficits. Yet Americans' \n     disapproval of deficits ought to be taken as a mandate for \n     constitutional prohibition about as seriously as their \n     disapproval of credit cards was taken as grounds for \n     outlawing charge accounts. Credit cards have not doomed the \n     economy, nor will Federal deficits.\n       The problem of the deficit is its long-term rate of growth, \n     which is due almost entirely to projected health care costs. \n     There are no more grounds for making a zero deficit a \n     constitutionally required objective than for denying \n     corporations or families the ability to borrow. Federal \n     deficits of 1 or 2 percent of the gross domestic product are \n     entirely manageable. If the outstanding debt is inflation-\n     adjusted annually, deficits of that scale typically do not \n     amount to a real increase in the debt anyway.\n       Judge Robert Bork opposes the amendment as unworkable. So \n     do other jurists, who think that if Congress used accounting \n     gimmicks to portray an unbalanced budget as balanced, the \n     courts would have no competence to enforce the amendment. And \n     some state officials worry that the burdens of Federal \n     cutbacks would be passed on to them. If the Senate does not \n     derail the amendment, such objections may well do so.\n       The original rationale for constitutional parsimony still \n     stands. We will never know enough about the future to predict \n     the tests that democratic government will face. More than 200 \n     years of American history should assure us that the Republic \n     not only can survive without constitutionally imposed fiscal \n     restrictions, it has been better off without them.\n       If the Constitution had required a balanced budget, many \n     members of Congress would not sit there today: for one thing, \n     Thomas Jefferson could never have completed the Louisiana \n     Purchase.\n       Hamilton's legacy of unimpeded fiscal power has been \n     crucial to a system of government that has brought us through \n     wars, depressions and natural calamities to an unchallenged \n     position as the strongest nation on earth.\n       During the Depression, World War II and the cold war, there \n     was a ready-made answer to questions about why we needed a \n     strong Federal Government. The crisis of Government capacity \n     has erupted today in part because there is no longer any \n     shared sense of the Government's overriding mission. But \n     depressions and wars have not been banished forever; rules we \n     adopt now must be good when the world turns bad. \n     Constitutionalizing fiscal policy is bad for the Constitution \n     and bad for fiscal policy. It would make a mockery of one or \n     a failure of the other, or both.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 22, 1995]\n\n Any Way Its Proponents Slice It, Balanced-Budget Amendment Is Baloney\n\n                           (By Hobart Rowen)\n\n       The case against a constitutional amendment to balance the \n     budget is overwhelming. It has been hyped by Democrats and \n     Republicans alike as the only way to force reluctant \n     congressmen to make tough decisions, and there is no doubt \n     that a large segment of the public has come to believe this \n     propaganda.\n       But the truth is that an amendment to the Constitution for \n     this purpose is bad economics, bad budget policy and bad \n     constitutional policy. By itself, such an amendment would cut \n     neither a dollar nor a program from the federal budget. As \n     Office of Management and Budget Director Alice S. Rivlin told \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee on Jan. 5, ``most of all, it \n     evades the hard choices needed to achieve real deficit \n     reduction.''\n       Why is the constitutional amendment bad economics? In an \n     interview, Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Laura \n     D'Andrea Tyson points out that the beauty of the present \n     fiscal system is that it contains automatic stabilizers that \n     moderate economic activity whenever business activity \n     weakens. Thus, when workers lose jobs, unemployment \n     compensation rises and it cushions the slide. If business \n     profits are off, then tax liabilities decline. These events \n     boost the government deficit, thus offsetting to some degree \n     the decline in the private sector.\n       ``But the balanced budget amendment would take away these \n     automatic stabilizers when the economy is slowing down,'' \n     Tyson said. It would force the government to raise taxes or \n     cut spending to cover the increasing deficit that a slowing \n     economy was generating. Rivlin puts it this way: ``Fiscal \n     policy would exaggerate, rather than mitigate, swings in the \n     economy. Recessions would tend to be deeper and longer.''\n       Meanwhile, the House Republican version of the amendment \n     wrongly (and possibly unconstitutionally) requires a three-\n     fifths majority of each house of Congress to increase \n     revenue, run budget deficits or increase the public debt. \n     There is supposed to be a safety valve to permit a deficit in \n     time of real economic weakness. But who in Congress is a good \n     enough forecaster to sense when the safety valve should be \n     opened? As Rivlin said, in all likelihood, ``the damage would \n     be done long before we recognize that the economy is turning \n     down.''\n       Why would the amendment also be bad constitutional policy? \n     Not only would it put fiscal policy, as outlined above, in a \n     straitjacket, it would denigrate the document that deals with \n     the big issues--individual rights, the system of separation \n     of powers, the ultimate guarantor of our system of liberties \n     in effect since 1776. It would force the courts to adjudicate \n     disputes certain to arise.\n       Meanwhile, what are the hard choices being avoided? The \n     Republicans who are pushing the ``Contract With America'' \n     freely concede that to balance the budget by the year 2002, \n     as called for by the amendment, would cost $1.2 trillion in \n     cuts in the various big entitlement programs--Social \n     Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other pensions. But they \n     aren't prepared to make them. Rep. Richard K. Armey of Texas, \n     House majority leader, said forthrightly that if members of \n     Congress understood the full dimension of what is involved, \n     ``they would buckle at the knees.''\n       But wait, there's more than $1.2 trillion involved: Because \n     of the new tax cuts and other ``reforms'' proposed in the \n     Republican ``Contract,'' there is an additional $450 million \n     that would have to be found by 2002--making a net reduction \n     of $1.65 trillion.\n       But the story isn't over--and this is the most significant \n     missing piece.\n       The bland assumption is that if somehow a miracle is \n     accomplished--the huge $1.65 trillion cuts are made to \n     balance the budget by 2002--the budget will continue to be in \n     balance. Not so! The dirty little secret is that within a few \n     years after 2002, as the Kerry-Danforth entitlement \n     commission report showed, the workplace demographics begin to \n     explode, and with that, the budget deficit. Fewer workers in \n     the labor force supporting Social Security pensioners will \n     drive the Social Security trust fund deep into the red. Once \n     again, the budget will be unbalanced, perhaps more so than \n     before--and the game must start over again.\n       Clearly, the balanced-budget amendment is bad business. \n     Congress should reconsider the whole plot. The real goal, in \n     the first place, should not be to balance the budget but to \n     balance the economy. The deficit needs to be cut back \n     sharply, but to aim at a balance in 2002 or 2012 is self-\n     defeating. There will be some years ahead when the nation may \n     need to run a deficit--and it shouldn't be afraid to make \n     such decisions.\n       The need now is to put aside the gimmickry, forget the \n     constitutional amendment and for the Clinton administration \n     and the Republican Congress to attend to business. A little \n     maturity, please!\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 27, 1995]\n\n                          Unbalanced Amendment\n\n       Tomorrow's vote in the Senate on the balanced-budget \n     amendment is crucial for the Republican agenda to chop \n     Government programs into bits. The outcome is also crucial \n     [[Page S3173]] to the nation because the pernicious amendment \n     would do enormous fiscal damage. Proponents are alarmingly \n     within three votes of winning.\n       The core of the amendment would require the Government to \n     balance its books unless three-fifths of the House and Senate \n     vote to run a deficit. To the wavering Democrats--John Breaux \n     of Louisiana, Sam Nunn of Georgia, Wendell Ford of Kentucky, \n     and Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota--here are \n     five unassailable reasons to vote no.\n\n\n                              unnecessary\n\n       Federal deficits have indeed been too high. That poses a \n     threat that borrowing will siphon savings away from \n     productive private investments.\n       But the fact that borrowing must be contained does not \n     imply it ought to be eliminated--any more than family \n     borrowing, to buy a house or pay college tuition, need be \n     eliminated. A prudent rule would keep Federal debt growing \n     less quickly than incomes. This rule would justify deficits \n     of about $200 billion a year, close to current levels.\n\n\n                               misleading\n\n       Proponents claim the amendment would protect future \n     generations against ruinous interest payments. True, today's \n     children will owe taxes when they grow up to pay interest on \n     Federal debt. But proponents ignore the fact that the tax \n     payments will flow right back to these children as owners of \n     Government bonds.\n\n\n                             unenforceable\n\n       Because key terms of the amendment--like outlays and \n     receipts--are undefined, Congress will be able to manipulate \n     and evade. Can Congress create independent agencies or find \n     other ways to spend and borrow off the Government books? A \n     Senate committee has already written into the legislative \n     record, used to guide future court decisions, that the \n     Tennessee Valley Authority would be exempt from the \n     amendment. It should take lawyers five minutes to stretch \n     whatever ``principle'' guides that exception to scores of \n     other Government programs.\n       The amendment also fails to provide an enforcement \n     mechanism. I might simply become an empty gesture or, worse \n     yet, the courts might step in to tell Congress how much it \n     should tax and where it should spend.\n\n\n                               Irrational\n\n       Federal bookkeeping lumps ordinary spending with long-term \n     public investments. Congress, forced by the amendment to cut \n     quickly, would go after hugely expensive, though vitally \n     important, investments, such as scientific research, costly \n     laboratories and equipment, job training or other investments \n     that would not produce benefits for years, if not decades.\n\n\n                                Reckless\n\n       When the economy slows, tax revenues fall off and spending \n     on unemployment insurance and food stamps rises. This \n     automatic rise in the deficit, by triggering spending, serves \n     to mitigate the slowdown. But under the proposed amendment, \n     Congress could easily turn a mild downturn into something \n     worse. Unless a three-fifths supermajority saves the day, \n     Congress would have to raise taxes and cut spending in a slow \n     economy--the opposite of responsible stewardship.\n       Take another unintended consequence. When savings and loans \n     went bankrupt during the 1980's, the Federal Government \n     bailed out depositors with borrowed money, thereby preventing \n     a banking panic. But under the proposed amendment, the \n     Government could not react instantly unless a supermajority \n     in Congress approved.\n       The balanced-budget amendment appeals to taxpayers who \n     demand that the Government spend their money wisely. But \n     Senators Nunn, Ford, Conrad, Dorgan and Breaux need to \n     recognize that this honorable sentiment cannot be wisely \n     embedded into the Constitution.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I notice the Senator from Massachusetts is \nhere. If I can, I would like to make a few comments.\n  Mr. President, the gist of the amendments of the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia numbered 252 and 254 is that the majority \nprovisions of House Joint Resolution 1 are undemocratic and alter the \nfine balance in the Constitution between the branches of Government.\n  More specifically, as I understand the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia, he contends--and I think in the past has eloquently \ndebated the balanced budget amendment--that Congress' control over \ntaxing, spending, and borrowing is diluted by restraints placed on such \npowers by supermajority requirements of the amendment. According to the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, the democracy reflected by \nthe present majority requirement of Congress would be dealt a blow if \nthis amendment passes.\n  Naturally, I disagree. The balanced budget amendment furthers the \npurpose and structure of the Constitution. Indeed, the amendment goes \nto the very heart of the hope of the Framers of the Constitution for \nthe constitutional system, a system that would protect individual \nfreedom and restrain the size and power of the Federal Government.\n  In the latter half of this century, however, the intention of the \nFramers has been betrayed by Congress' own inability to control its \nspending habits. Passage and ratification of the balanced budget \namendment would restore the constitutional Framers' promises of liberty \nand what the Framers called our republican form of government.\n  Mr. President, let me first say what the modern day crisis is. Our \nNation is faced with the worsening problem of rising national debt and \ndeficits and the increased Government use of capital that would \notherwise be available to the private sector to create jobs or to \ninvest in our future. Increased amounts of capital are being wasted on \nmerely financing the debt through spiraling interest costs. This \nproblem presents risk to our long-term economic growth and endangers \nthe well-being of our elderly, our working people, and especially our \nchildren and our grandchildren. The debt burden is a mortgage on their \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, the time has come for a solution strong enough that it \ncannot be evaded for short-term gain. We need a constitutional \namendment or requirement to balance our budget. House Joint Resolution \n1, the consensus balanced budget amendment, is that solution. It is \nreasonable. It is enforceable. It is necessary to force Congress to get \nour fiscal house in order. It not only furthers the economic welfare of \nour Republic, it fosters the Constitution's purpose of protecting \nliberty through the framework of limited government.\n  James Madison, in explaining the theory undergirding the Government \nhe helped to create, had this to say about government and human nature:\n\n       Government [is] the greatest of all reflections on human \n     nature. If men were angels, no government would be necessary. \n     If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal \n     controls on government would be necessary. In framing a \n     government that is to be administered by men over men, the \n     great difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the \n     government to control the governed; and in the next place \n     oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is no \n     doubt the primary control on government; but experience has \n     taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, we are here to debate an auxiliary precaution, \nHouse Joint Resolution 1, proposing an amendment to the Constitution of \nthe United States to require a balanced budget, because our recent \nhistory has shown that Congress is not under control and will not bring \nspending under control without such a mechanism being placed into the \nConstitution.\n  The balanced budget amendment helps restore two important elements in \nthe constitutional structure: limited government and an accountable, \ndeliberative legislative assembly, both of which are vital to a free \nand vibrant constitutional democracy.\n  Deliberative assembly--the essence of whose authority is, in \nAlexander Hamilton's words, ``to enact laws, or in other words to \nprescribe rules for the regulation of society'' for the common good--\nwas considered by the Framers of the Constitution the most important \nbranch of the Government because it reflected the will of the people. \nYet, as the makers of laws, it was considered the most powerful and the \none that needed to be guarded against the most.\n  Recognizing that in republican government the legislative authority \nnecessarily predominates and to prevent elective despotism, James \nMadison, the father of the Constitution, recommended that the \nPhiladelphia Convention adopt devices in the Constitution that would \nsafeguard liberty. These include bicameralism, separation of powers and \nchecks and balances, a qualified executive veto, limiting congressional \nauthority through enumerating its powers, and, of course, the election \nof legislators to assure accountability to the people.\n  However, in the late 20th century, our century, these constitutional \nprocesses that Madison termed auxiliary precautions have failed to \nlimit the voracious appetite of Congress to legislate in every area of \nprivate concern, to invade the traditional bailiwick of the States, and \nconsequently, to spend \n[[Page S3174]] and spend to fund these measures until the Government \nhas become functionally insolvent and the economy placed in jeopardy. \nCongress has been mutated from a legislative assembly deliberating the \neconomic interests into the playground of special interests.\n  The balanced budget amendment, Mr. President, will go a long way \ntoward ameliorating this wrong. It will create an additional \nconstitutional process, an auxiliary precaution, if you will, that will \nbring back legislative accountability to the constitutional system.\n  The balanced budget amendment process accomplishes this by making \nFederal deficit spending significantly more difficult. Significantly, \nit advances liberty by making it more difficult for the Government to \nfund overzealous legislation and regulation that invades the private \nlives of citizens.\n  According to Prof. Harvey Mansfield, Jr., of Harvard, in his \nscholarly book, ``The Taming of the Prince,'' the real genius of our \nConstitution is that, having placed all power in the hands of its \ncitizenry, the American people consented to restraints on that power. \nUnderstanding that direct or pure democracies in history were \ninherently unstable and fickle, the Framers placed restraints on \npopular rule and congressional power, what we now call supermajority \nrequirements.\n  Senator Byrd is this body's expert on these requirements, but we will \nmention some of them again, that are in the Constitution now. Article \nI, section 3, the Senate may convict on an impeachment vote of two-\nthirds; article I, section 5, each House may expel a Member with a two-\nthirds vote, a supermajority; article I, section 7, a Presidential veto \nmay be overridden by a two-thirds vote of each House, again, a \nsupermajority in each House; article II, section 2, the Senate advises \nand consents to treaties, again, by a majority of two-thirds; article \nV, a constitutional amendment requires two-thirds of each House or a \nconstitutional convention can be called by two-thirds of the State \nlegislatures, three-quarters of the State legislatures must ratify any \nconstitutional amendment--all supermajorities; article VII, the \nConstitution itself required ratification of 9 of the 13 States, again, \na supermajority.\n  This is not a democracy. This is a representative republic. Our \nFounding Fathers understood the need to have majorities. The 12th \namendment requires a quorum of two-thirds of the States in the House to \nchoose a President. A majority of States is required to elect the \nPresident. The same requirements exist for the Senate choosing the Vice \nPresident; again, a supermajority. The 25th amendment dealing with the \nPresident's competency and removal requires that if Congress is not in \nsession within 21 days after Congress is required to assemble, it must \ndetermine by a two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is \nunable to discharge the duties of his office. Now, all of those are \nsupermajorities. All of those are part of the Constitution now.\n  Mr. President, it is indeed ironic as we debate a constitutional \namendment following a cloture vote, that arguments are being made that \nmere majorities are more appropriate to fundamental constitutional \ndecisionmaking than supermajorities. We recently voted on ending this \ndebate, and we were scheduled to vote on that again before we entered \ninto an agreement setting a final vote. A substantial majority \nexpressed its desire to end the debate. A three-fifths vote of \nSenators--that means 60 Senators--must vote to end debate. Is that rule \ninappropriate in a constitutional debate? Of course not. As a matter of \nfact, I think we would have had the 60 votes had we gone to cloture the \nsecond time.\n I think that is one reason why the minority agreed to the time \nagreement that we now have before the Senate.\n\n  The Constitution requires that a supermajority approve a \nconstitutional amendment. To pass the balanced budget amendment, we \nmust have 67 Senators vote for it. Is this inappropriate? Or should we \nallow some number between 26 and 51, or 50 with the Vice President \ncasting the tie-breaking vote to approve the balanced budget amendment? \nThe Constitution requires that three-quarters of the States ratify the \nbalanced budget amendment. Perhaps our majoritarian friends would \nprefer that some number of States between 26 and 51 ratify the \namendment, with the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, or Guam casting \nthe tie-breaking vote if the States are evenly divided. That is not the \nConstitution, however. The Constitution provides for a supermajority.\n  Mr. President, if majority rule were the fundamental principle of our \nGovernment, as I have heard some in this debate say, we would not have \nthe Government we do. We would have a unicameral parliamentary system \nwithout judicial review and, indeed, without the Bill of Rights or a \nwritten Constitution, because each of those features of our Government \nis an intrusion into the principle of majority rule, and they are \ncertainly not the only examples.\n  The first amendment does not say Congress shall not abridge free \nspeech unless a fleeting majority wants to. It does not say that \nCongress shall not interfere with the free exercise of religion or \nestablish religion unless a majority of those present and voting want \nto. The first amendment takes those options away from even \nsupermajorities of Congress, except through constitutional amendment. \nShall we tear up the Bill of Rights and the Constitution because they \ncontain checks on the power of transient majorities? I do not think so.\n  As I have said, as Thomas Jefferson said, as even Prof. Laurence \nTribe has said, the power of transient majorities to saddle minorities \nor future majorities with debt is the kind of infringement on \nfundamental rights that deserves constitutional protection. The Framers \nwished to protect life, liberty and property. They reacted harshly \nagainst taxation without representation. As I pointed out throughout \nthis debate, our deficit spending taxes generations which are not now \nrepresented. It takes their property and their economic liberty. It is \nwholly appropriate that we at least increase the consensus of those \ncurrently represented to allow them to shackle those who are not--that \nis, future generations--with the debt, the taxes and the economic \nservitude that go with citizenship in a country with high national \ndebt.\n  Opponents of the balanced budget amendment charge that supermajority \nrequirements will create some new kind of sinister bargaining among \nfactions to gain advantage in return for supporting the necessary \nconsensus. This objection strikes me as strange because that kind of \nnegotiation is as old as the legislative process. It happens now in the \nsearch for a majority.\n  Opponents also charge that the balanced budget amendment writes \nfiscal policy into the Constitution in an inappropriate way. This \namendment deals with the structural problem in our fiscal \ndecisionmaking. We unthinkingly spend money we do not have for \ntemporary benefit to our children's long-term harm. But I would note \nthat the 16th amendment allows taxes to be levied by Congress. Is that \nnot fiscal policy in the same sense as the balanced budget amendment? \nArticle I, section 8 allows Congress to collect taxes, duties, imposts \nand excises, to borrow money and to regulate commerce. Are not these \nfiscal policy provisions like the balanced budget amendment? In fact, \nis not the balanced budget amendment simply a process to safeguard \nagainst overuse of the article I power to borrow? Article VI adopted \nthe pre-Constitution debts of the Continental Congress. That was \ncertainly a decision of fiscal policy.\n  Under the balanced budget amendment, majorities will continue to set \nbudget priorities from year to year. Only if a majority attempts to \nborrow money from future generations to pay for its priorities would \nthere have to be a supermajority vote. This allows the minority to play \nthe conscience of the Nation and to protect future generations from the \ntype of borrowing sprees that we have seen in recent decades.\n  I would note that those who believe the supermajority vote would be \nthe rule rather than the exception betray their mental habit of \nthinking in terms of deficit spending. We must break this habit and \nmake deficit spending the exception instead of the rule. The balanced \nbudget amendment does not require a supermajority to pass the budget, \nonly a budget that is out of balance. The balanced budget amendment \ncreates a positive incentive for current \n[[Page S3175]] majorities to avoid borrowing to avoid supermajority \nvotes and risking the kind of intrigue opponents say could happen when \nsupermajorities are required. This is wholly appropriate and reasonable \nto break Congress of its borrowing habit.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the amendments offered by the Senator from \nWest Virginia would gut the balanced budget amendment by cutting its \ncentral provision, the supermajority requirement it places in the way \nof Congress' deficit spending. If either of these amendments were \nadopted, the balanced budget amendment would read in essence: \n``Congress shall not spend money it does not have unless it wants to.''\n  Such a balanced budget amendment would be no balanced budget \namendment at all. It would be the status-quo, business-as-usual, let-\nus-keep-rolling-up-the-debt amendment.\n  This amendment, or other of these similar amendments, is a poison \ndart aimed at the heart of the last best hope for the fiscal sanity of \nCongress and our country. I urge that they both be defeated.\n  Mr. President, it is absolutely clear that to restore the \nconstitutional concept of limited government and its protection of \nliberty, as well as to restore fiscal and economic sanity, we must pass \nthis balanced budget amendment. We need the supermajority provisions of \nHouse Joint Resolution 1--a modern day ``auxiliary precaution'' in \nMadison's words--to put teeth into the balanced budget amendment, to be \na force to end ``business as usual'' here in Congress and, most \nimportantly, to foster the liberty of limited government that the \nFramers believed to be essential.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I just very quickly want to address the \nargument that was advanced by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nin opposition to Senator Byrd's amendments that are pending at the desk \ndealing with the supermajorities.\n  In that statement, he asserted as an argument against Senator Byrd's \ncontention that these supermajority requirements here were running \ncounter to the prevailing theme of the Constitution that a majority \nought to prevail, the fact that there were some supermajority \nrequirements put in the Constitution by the Founding Fathers, for \nexample, amending the Constitution or overriding a veto.\n  I wish to make the point that the very Founding Fathers who put those \nsupermajorities into the Constitution considered at the time whether \nsupermajorities ought to be required in order to make decisions, and \nthey rejected that concept. So they in effect considered the very issue \nthat is before us in this regard and rejected the notion of \nsupermajorities.\n  So they specifically weighed that question at a time when they did \ninclude some supermajorities in very special instances. Obviously, \namending the document is a very special instance, and the veto is an \nessential part of the checks and balances.\n  I cite the quote of James Madison in Federalist Paper 58 in which he \nrejects the notion of the supermajorities in order to reach decisions \nand says in fact in the course of that quote, and I will include all of \nit in the Record, ``It would no longer be the majority that would rule. \nThe power would be transferred to the minority.'' And he spoke, of \ncourse, against that proposition.\n  There being no objection, the quote was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                            No. 59: Hamilton\n\n       It has been said that more than a majority ought to have \n     been required for a quorum; and in particular cases, if not \n     in all, more than a majority of a quorum for a decision. That \n     some advantages might have resulted from such a precaution \n     cannot be denied. It might have been an additional shield to \n     some particular interests, and another obstacle generally to \n     hasty and partial measures. But these considerations are \n     outweighed by the inconveniences in the opposite scale. In \n     all cases where justice or the general good might require new \n     laws to be passed, or active measures to be pursued, the \n     fundamental principle of free government would be reversed. \n     It would be no longer the majority that would rule: the power \n     would be transferred to the minority. Were the defensive \n     privilege limited to particular cases, an interested minority \n     might take advantage of it to screen themselves from \n     equitable sacrifices to the general weal, or, in particular \n     emergencies, to extort unreasonable indulgences.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The Senator from Massachusetts \n[Mr. Kennedy] is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I notice the distinguished Senator from \nKansas is on the floor and has an important statement. I will be glad \nto yield to her and then be recognized following her statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from \nMassachusetts yielding for a few moments so I can weigh in and offer my \nobservations on the constitutional amendment that we have been debating \nover the past several weeks.\n  During these debates, I think we have heard some very thoughtful \ncomments, both pro and con, on this important issue. This debate, in \nsome ways, seems a fitting symbol for the amendment itself which \ninvolves a great deal of talk without any specific action.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have long been an opponent of this \nproposed change in the Constitution of the United States. I have said \nit would not get us 1 cent closer to a balanced budget. I have \ncontended that it would invite evasive accounting and legal gymnastics. \nI have expressed concern that it would open a whole new frontier for \njudicial review.\n  These concerns are not without basis and actual experience. I am sure \nwe all remember the lengths we went to in order to get around the \nprovisions of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act and other abbreviated \nattempts at deficit reduction. We remember how, in the wake of the \nsavings and loan crisis, the Resolution Trust Corporation was created, \nmasking billions of dollars from budget totals. Even for this very \namendment, we have left definitions of crucial language open to \nreinterpretation. Today's outlays may become tomorrow's ``working \ncapital.''\n  I think many of my colleagues will also remember that in the past, I \nhave referred to this amendment as a sham and a gimmick. I do not \nbelieve it is the panacea to a sound fiscal policy. It has been highly \neffective, however, in both roles by preventing us from focusing on the \nreal choices that must be made in the Federal budget and serving as a \nnearly annual diversion that allows us to talk about balanced budgets \nwhile avoiding the clear and urgent need to adopt a sound fiscal \npolicy.\n  This may sound, Mr. President, as if I am leading up to expressing a \nvote against a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. But this \nyear, I intend to vote for final passage of the balanced budget \namendment. I do so not as a result of the change in my views or beliefs \nor because of some revelation that this amendment does not suffer from \nthe flaws that troubled me in the past. Instead, I will vote for this \namendment this year simply and solely to eliminate it as an excuse for \nnot cutting spending.\n We have been debating this amendment for more than a decade, \nconstantly arguing about a change in the Constitution that would force \nus somehow to do what we all know eventually must be done.\n\n  If this seems like a backhanded endorsement to this amendment, it \ncertainly is the case. All of the arguments that I have made in the \npast and many of the arguments that have been made in the last few \nweeks are, in my mind, still valid. Unfortunately, Mr. President, the \narguments against this amendment and my concern about casual changes in \nthe Constitution are rendered almost irrelevant by another simple fact \nof our budget life. That fact is that every day our Government issues \nscraps of paper marked IOU that are themselves becoming a deadly weight \nnot only to future generations but to the Constitution itself. This \nyear, we will issue almost $500 million a day in IOU's. Interest is \npiling up alongside those IOU's high enough to consume 15 percent of \nour spending. To put that in perspective, the budget we received a \ncouple of weeks ago calls for us to spend almost as much money next \nyear in interest as on defense. If only that meant our world had become \npeaceful and safe. Instead, what it means is that we have put our \ngrandchildren in debt and the future of our Government in danger.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is time to stop debating this amendment. \nIt is time to pass it, get it out of the way, \n[[Page S3176]] take it off the list of excuses we constantly use, and \nmove on to the real issue, which is how to balance our Government's \nincome with its expenditures, how to lay out a sound fiscal policy \nevery year. If this amendment works, then I will be glad to admit that \nI was wrong to ever oppose it. I certainly hope it serves the purpose \nfor which it was intended. If it does not work, then it will no longer \nbe available as an excuse for failure to achieve sound fiscal policy.\n  That, Mr. President, is my reason for supporting this constitutional \namendment to balance the budget and why I believe it is important for \nus in the Senate to pass it this year.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By previous order, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 267\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be temporarily laid aside and that my amendment No. 267 be \nplaced before the Senate for the duration of my remarks on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, during the debate on the proposed \nconstitutional amendment, we have heard practically nothing from \nsupporters of the proposal regarding how the amendment is to be \nenforced. The reason is clear: The amendment would give the President \nand the Federal courts unprecedented, and unacceptable, roles in \ndeciding how Federal funds are to be allocated. My amendment addresses \nthe first of these issues--the powers of the President.\n  In its current form, the proposed constitutional amendment would give \nthe President--in order to avoid an unauthorized deficit--the power to \nimpound funds appropriated by Congress. Section 1 of the amendment \nprovides that:\n\n       [t]otal outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \n     receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of the \n     whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by law \n     for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a rollcall \n     vote.\n\n  In other words, the constitutional amendment would flatly prohibit \nspending from exceeding revenues, unless both the House and the Senate \nauthorize the deficit.\n  Under article II, section 3 of the Constitution, the President has a \nduty to ``take care that the Laws be faithfully executed,'' and article \nII, section 7, requires the President to take an oath to ``preserve, \nprotect and defend the Constitution.''\n  In any fiscal year in which it is clear that there will be an \nunauthorized deficit, the President is bound by the Constitution and \nhis oath of office to balance the budget and prevent the deficit.\n  Such a deficit could occur for a wide range of reasons. Congress may \nlack the political will to cast a vote authorizing a deficit as large \nas the one that it actually anticipates. Or, unanticipated decreases in \nrevenue or increases in expenditures may result from natural disasters \nor from a downturn in the economy.\n  In these circumstances, the proposed constitutional amendment would \ngive the President the power, indeed the duty, to impound appropriated \nfunds to prevent the unauthorized deficit from occurring.\n  That is not just my opinion. This commonsense reading of the proposed \nconstitutional amendment is shared by a broad range of highly respected \nlegal scholars and by the executive branch of the Government.\n  Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger, who as head of the \nOffice of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice is responsible for \nadvising the President and the Attorney General on the scope and limits \non Presidential authority, testified before the Judiciary Committee \nthat the proposed constitutional amendment would authorize the \nPresident to impound funds to ensure that outlays do not exceed \nreceipts.\n  Harvard Law School Professor Charles Fried, who served as Solicitor \nGeneral during the Reagan administration, testified that in a year when \nactual revenues fall below projections and a bigger-than-authorized \ndeficit occurs, section 1 ``would offer a President ample warrant to \nimpound appropriated funds.'' Others who share this view include former \nAttorney General Nicholas Katzenbach, Stanford University Law School \nProfessor Kathleen Sullivan, Yale University Law School Professor Burke \nMarshall, and Harvard University Law School Professor Laurence Tribe.\n  By giving the President impoundment authority, the proposed amendment \nwould dramatically alter the allocation of powers set forth in the \nConstitution. As James Madison wrote in The Federalist No. 48,\n ``the legislative department alone'' has the power to tax and spend.\n\n  So, Mr. President, as we mentioned here, we have broad views of \ndifferent high administration officials who have served in the Justice \nDepartment or in the White House, who are thoughtful men and women and \nconstitutional scholars, who believe virtually unanimously, if you \nregard the hearings that were held on the balanced budget amendment by \nSenator Byrd as well as by the Judiciary Committee--virtually \nunanimously that this power of impoundment is very real and that the \nPresident would have a duty to impound; not just an option, a duty to \nimpound should there be an imbalance between receipts and outlays.\n  The Constitution gives Congress the primary authority and \nresponsibility with regard to raising and spending funds.\n  Article I, section 7 states that ``all Bills for raising Revenue'' \nmust originate in the House of Representatives.\n  Article I, section 8 grants Congress the powers ``to lay and collect \nTaxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises,'' and ``to borrow Money on the \ncredit of the United States.''\n  Article I, section 9 provides that ``[n]o Money shall be drawn from \nthe Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.''\n  Changing the constitutional allocation of powers that has served this \ncountry well for over 200 years would be a profound mistake.\n  I support a statutory line-item veto, and I hope to be able to vote \nfor one on the floor this year. But the impoundment authority given to \nthe President by this amendment is far broader than a line-item veto.\n  The line-item veto simply allows the President to delete or reduce \nspecific items in an appropriations bill. But as Assistant Attorney \nGeneral Dellinger testified, the impoundment authority conferred upon \nthe President by the proposed constitutional amendment would allow a \nPresident, confronted with an unauthorized deficit, to order across-\nthe-board cuts in all Federal programs, abolish entire programs, or \ntarget expenditures intended for particular States or regions for \nimpoundment.\n  In the name of deficit reduction, the President could freeze cost-of-\nliving adjustments for Social Security recipients. He could abolish \nMedicare. He could slash defense spending.\n  In the past, Presidents from time to time have asserted that they had \ninherent constitutional authority to impound funds. This issue came to \na head during the Nixon administration, when President Nixon impounded \n$18 billion from programs he wanted to terminate or reduce.\n  He impounded $9 billion appropriated for water treatment facilities. \nHe imposed a moratorium on subsidized housing. He cut back on disaster \nrelief. He suspended rural and community development programs. He \nwithheld almost $2 billion from the Department of Labor and from the \nDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare.\n  Dozens of lawsuits were filed challenging the legality of President \nNixon's actions. The vast majority of court decisions ruled against the \nimpoundment. In 1974, Congress finally resolved the matter by passing \nthe Impoundment Control Act to require the appropriated funds to be \nspent--unless the President sends a rescission message to Congress and \nCongress acts to uphold the rescission. The balanced budget amendment \nwould scrap this arrangement. As I mentioned, that is the law now. The \nImpoundment Control Act since 1974 is the law guiding the whole issue \nof impoundment.\n  The balanced budget amendment would scrap this arrangement, and \nfundamentally change the allocation of powers between the President and \nthe Congress.\n  In addition to granting authority to the President to impound \nappropriated funds, the amendment would also enable future Presidents \nto assert that \n[[Page S3177]] they have the power unilaterally to raise taxes, duties, \nor fees--in order to generate additional revenue to avoid an \nunauthorized deficit. That was the testimony of Assistant Attorney \nGeneral Walter Dellinger, the chief legal advisor to the executive \nbranch, before the Judiciary Committee this year.\n  This outcome would drastically transform the allocation of powers \nenvisioned by the Framers. No longer would the legislative department \nalone have the power to tax and spend, as Madison promised in The \nFederalist No. 48.\n  The fact that the proposed constitutional amendment would confer \nimpoundment authority on the President is confirmed by the actions of \nthe Judiciary Committee this year. Supporters of the amendment opposed \nand defeated my amendment that would have added the following section \nto the proposed amendment:\n\n       Nothing in this article shall authorize the President to \n     impound funds appropriated by Congress by law, or to impose \n     taxes, duties or fees.\n\n  If the supporters of the proposed constitutional amendment to do not \nintend to give impoundment authority to the President, there is no \nlegitimate explanation for their failure to include this clear \nprohibition in the proposed amendment.\n  Supporters of the constitutional amendment make two arguments to \nsupport its assertion that the proposal would not give the President \nimpoundment authority. Both are wrong.\n  They argue that there will never be an unauthorized, and therefore \nunconstitutional, deficit, because Congress will always step in at the \nend of the year and ratify whatever deficit has occurred.\n  That is like arguing the President has the unilateral power under the \nConstitution to declare war, because Congress will always step in to \nratify a Presidential declaration.\n  If their prediction is accurate, then the balanced budget amendment \nis a sham, because it would impose no fiscal discipline whatsoever. But \nif the prediction is wrong--if Congress failed to act before the end of \na fiscal year to ratify an unauthorized deficit--then all of the \nexpenditures by the Federal Government throughout the fiscal year would \nbe unconstitutional and open to challenge in the State and Federal \ncourts. it is inconceivable that the President, sworn to preserve, \nprotect and defend the Constitution, would be found to be powerless to \nprevent such a result.\n  Supporters also argue that Congress can specify in the enforcement \nlegislation required by section 6 exactly the enforcement mechanism it \nwants, and that the President, as Chief Executive, is duty bound to \ncarry out the congressional plan, to the exclusion of impoundment. But \njust because Congress spells out one means of enforcing the amendment \ndoes not mean that the President could not assert another means.\n  As the Supreme Court recognized in In re Neagle, the President's \nobligation to faithfully execute the laws is independent of Congress. \nThat duty is not--\n\n       * * * limited to the enforcement of facts of Congress * * * \n     according to their express terms * * * it include[s] the \n     rights, duties and obligations growing out of the \n     Constitution itself. * * * and all the protection implied by \n     the nature of the government under the Constitution[.]\n\n  If an unconstitutional deficit were occurring, Congress could not \nconstitutionally stop the President from impounding appropriated funds \nin order to prevent it. As Prof. Kathleen Sullivan testified, the \nproposed constitutional amendment--\n\n       * * * if enacted would, of course, be constitutional law, \n     fundamental law. It would trump [the Impoundment Control Act \n     of 1974] or any other statute designed to umpire disputes \n     between the President and Congress.\n\n  In short, the only certain way to see that the President is not given \nimpoundment authority is by adopting the Kennedy amendment.\n  This does not even take into consideration the fact that if you have \nsubsequent enabling legislation, as suggested by those who support it, \nthat the President might veto it. He way say, ``No, I believe that the \nstatements and the positions that have been expressed by Charles Fried \nand former Attorney General Katzenbach and Solicitor General Archibald \nCox and Walter Dellinger and Kathleen Sullivan give me the power to do \nthat. They give me the power to do it so I am going to veto the \nimplementing legislation.'' And what is to say what would be the \noutcome of such a veto?\n  My amendment will make clear that nothing in the balanced budget \namendment gives the President authority to impound appropriated funds \nor impose taxes, duties, or fees.\n  My amendment will not limit Congress' power to give the President \nline-item veto authority. I will not limit the authority already given \nto the President elsewhere in the Constitution, and by the Budget \nControl and Impoundment Act. All it will do is specify that the \nproposed constitutional amendment does not give the President the power \nto impound appropriated funds or impose taxes, duties, or fees.\n  We should not sign over to the President the power that Congress has \nhad over the purse for over 200 years, simply because some Members lack \nthe political courage to make the tough decisions needed to balance the \nbudget.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to respond to Senator Kennedy's \nimpoundment argument. In each of the years the balanced budget \namendment has been debated, I have noticed that one specious argument \nis presented as a scare tactic by the opponents of the amendment. This \nyear the vampire rising from the grave is presidential impoundment. \nSupposedly, a President, when faced with the possibility of budgetary \nshortfalls after ratification of the balanced budget amendment, will \nsomehow have the constitutional authority--nay duty--to arbitrarily cut \nsocial spending programs or even raise taxes.\n  I want to emphasize that there is nothing in House Joint Resolution 1 \nthat authorizes or otherwise allows for impoundment. It is not the \nintent of the amendment to grant the President any impoundment \nauthority under House Joint Resolution 1. Indeed, House Joint \nResolution 1 imposes one new duty, delegates one new authority, on the \nPresident: To transmit to Congress a proposed budget for each fiscal \nyear in which total outlays do not exceed total receipts. In fact, \nthere is a ripeness problem to any attempted impoundment: Up to the end \nof the fiscal year the President has no plausible basis to impound \nfunds because Congress under the amendment has the power to ameliorate \nany budget shortfalls or ratify or specify the amount of deficit \nspending that may occur in that fiscal year.\n  Moreover, under section 6 of the amendment, Congress must--and I \nemphasize must--mandate exactly what type of enforcement mechanism it \nwants, whether it be sequestration, rescission, the establishment of a \ncontingency fund, or some other mechanism. The President, as Chief \nExecutive, is duty bound to enforce a particular requisite \ncongressional scheme to the exclusion of impoundment. That the \nPresident must enforce a mandatory congressional budgetary measure has \nbeen the established law since the nineteenth century case of Kendall \nv. United States ex rel. Stokes, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 542 (1838). In \nKendall, Congress had passed a private act ordering the Postmaster \nGeneral to pay Kendall for services rendered. The Supreme Court \nrejected the argument that Kendall could not sue in mandamus because \nthe Postmaster General was subject only to the orders of the President \nand not to the directives of Congress. The Court held that the \nPresident must enforce any mandated--as opposed to discretionary--\ncongressional spending measure pursuant to his duty to faithfully \nexecute the law pursuant to article II, section 3 of the Constitution. \nThe Kendall case was given new vitality in the 1970's, when lower \nFederal courts, as a matter of statutory construction, rejected \nattempts by President Nixon to impound funds where Congress did not \ngive the President discretion to withhold funding. For example, State \nHighway Commission v. Volpe, 479 F.2d 1099 (8th Cir. 1973). Unless \nCongress grants the President impoundment power, the President, as a \npractical matter, will not be able to impound funds under this \namendment.\n  [[Page S3178]] Let me stress again that section 6 of House Joint \nResolution 1 requires Congress to enforce and implement the amendment \nby appropriate legislation. This is not a delegation of power to \nCongress, similar to that of the 14th, 15th, 16th, and 19th amendments, \nwhereby Congress has the discretion whether or not to exercise its \nenforcement power. Congress must enforce the balanced budget amendment \nby appropriate legislation. This is a powerful statement that evidences \na preclusion of unilateral presidential action.\n  The position that section 6 implementing legislation would preclude \nPresidential impoundment was seconded by Attorney General Barr at the \nrecent Judiciary\n Committee hearing on the balanced budget amendment. Testifying that \nthe impoundment issue was in reality incomprehensible, General Barr \nconcluded that ``the whip hand is in Congress' hand, so to speak; under \nsection 6 [the] Congress can provide the enforcement mechanism that the \ncourts will defer to and that the President will be bound by.''\n\n  Further, the notion that Congress would stand idly by while the \nPresident threatens to, or, in fact, does invade Congress' spending \nauthority, is not realistic as a practical matter. We simply would not \nstand for it.\n  What we have here then, is an argument based on a remote possibility. \nUnder the remote possibility scenario of an impoundment, we would have \nto preclude any possibility, however, remote, in the amendment. The \namendment would look like an insurance policy. Why preclude something \nin the Constitution that in strong probability could never happen, and \nwhich Congress could preclude by legislation?\n  Finally, the Kennedy amendment, as worded, would prohibit Congress \nfrom delegating to the President in implementing legislation any \nrescissionary authority. This is what Congress did in Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings. Why limit the tools that Congress may employ to balance the \nbudget in the future?\n  As to the President's hypothetical power to raise taxes, this is not \neven a remote possibility. It is a constitutional impossibility. \nPresident's simply do not have the power to raise taxes and the \nbalanced budget amendment does not alter this. This power is \nexclusively delegated to Congress by the Constitution in article 1. All \nthe balanced budget amendment does is to limit Congress' spending, \ntaxing, and borrowing powers.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, in 1788, Alexander Hamilton recognized \nthat deliberations on the Constitution would by no means be, as he put \nit, ``decorous and genteel.'' Much too much was at stake. Instead, he \npredicted there would be ``a torrent of angry and malignant passions'' \nthat would be let loose during ``the great national discussion.''\n  Well, Mr. President, we are having a great national discussion. We \ncan be thankful that we are having it on a basis which is appropriate \nand genteel. At the same time, we must answer some of the charges that \nhave been made, as well as examine further some of the arguments that \nare being raised against the balanced budget amendment.\n  Just moments ago, in this Chamber, the Senator from Maryland came to \nus with the suggestion that the supermajority that is required in this \namendment--and, as we all know, in the proposed amendment there is a \nsupermajority of 60 percent required to raise the national debt--is \nundemocratic to the extent that it inappropriately gives to a minority \nof people, the 40 percent, the right to block the will of the 60 \npercent.\n  I agree that it is important for us all to agree that we do not want \nto have supermajority requirements everywhere, particularly where it is \nnot important. But we also know that the Constitution itself contains a \nvariety of supermajorities that are included in the Constitution \nbecause there are some things it is vital to protect.\n  Indeed, the Senator from Maryland pointed out that we have a \nsupermajority requirement for overriding the President's veto. But the \nreasoning behind prohibiting supermajorities in the main is to keep one \ngroup from unduly imposing its will on another group. The reason we \nbelieve generally in simple majorities is that we believe that people \nwho are represented ought to be represented on an equal footing.\n  However, there is a special situation about which we debate here \ntoday concerning the national debt. And it is not about one group in \nAmerica displacing the cost of its consumption to another group now \nexistent in America. What we are talking about is the displacement of \nthe costs of current programs that we now benefit from onto the next \ngeneration, who are not currently represented at all. It is in truth a \nproblem about allowing one group to impose its will on another group--\nanother group upon whom this debt is being imposed who are not even \nhere to protest.\n  Mr. President, we have tried over and over again as a body--in the \nUnited States--to somehow preclude this recurring debt problem by \nbinding the next Senate. We had the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, then we \nhad Gramm-Rudman, and then we had the budget deals of 1990 and 1993. We \nhave not been able to get one Senate to bind the next Senate to the \nnecessary discipline to restrain this Government from going deeper and \ndeeper into debt. Unfortunately, while the Senate cannot bind the next \nSenate, the Senate certainly binds the next generation to the current \ndebt.\n  So, when we are talking about a group that is yet to come into \nexistence--the next generation of Americans whose toil has not yet \nproduced the first of its wages--I think it is essential that we have \nthe capacity to require a supermajority vote.\n  Mr. President, in the deliberations we also frequently hear that \nthere is no need for us to have this kind of amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution. It is argued that there is authority now for the U.S. \nCongress to do what is right. There is authority for the U.S. Congress \nto do what is right and to live within its means.\n  Frankly, it is only part of what a Constitution stands for, what a \nConstitution's function is, to provide authority to do what is right. \nThe other half of the Constitution's function and purpose is to \nprohibit that which is wrong. If we come to the conclusion that \nspending the resources of the next generation is wrong, we cannot rely \non the fact that there is authority in the Constitution for the \nCongress to act properly. We must prohibit the Congress from doing that \nwhich is wrong.\n  The mere authority to do that which is right has been insufficient. \nWe have had in the last 60 years only seven balanced budgets. We have \nhad authority to balance the budget in every one of those 60 years, yet \nwe have not had the fiscal discipline to balance the budget. It is \nagreed, we have had the authority to do what is right. What we need now \nis a prohibition against doing what is wrong.\n  It is wrong to spend your neighbor's resources. It is wrong to take \nthose things which are not yours. It is simply wrong. It is part of the \nconsensus that we all have when we first understand right from wrong. \nYet we in Congress continue to recklessly spend the resources of the \nnext generation without their consent.\n  The idea of placing a prohibition on the actions of Congress is not \nnew. As a matter of fact, as a precondition for ratifying the U.S. \nConstitution, the States demanded that there be a Bill of Rights that \nclearly curtailed the ability of Congress to do things that were wrong. \nThe first five words of the Bill of Rights are ``Congress shall make no \nlaw.''\n  Again, I reiterate Mr. President, it is very important that the \nConstitution not only include authority to do that which is right, but \nto prohibit the Congress from doing those things which are wrong. And \nthis is a fundamental function of the Constitution that is as old as \nthe Bill of Rights and the Constitution itself.\n  It is in this context, then, that we need a balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution. When you think of the things which were said by \nthose at the beginning of this Republic which inspire us now--such as \nNathan Hale saying on his way to the gallows, a patriot willing to give \nhis life, ``I regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.'' \nI think sometimes that the Congress regrets that there are but one \n[[Page S3179]] or two generations to pay for the excesses of the \nCongress.\n  As a matter of fact, I do not believe we can have any confidence that \nthe debt which we now have could be paid off within one generation, or \neven perhaps within two generations. But I do have confidence that if \nwe now take this act of principled discipline and begin to prohibit our \nprofligate spending, we will begin to move away from the kind of \ndeficits which have characterized this country for far too many years.\n  It is in this context that we must have this great discussion, Mr. \nPresident. It is in this context that we must understand the need for \nthe U.S. Congress to send to the States for ratification an amendment \nto the Constitution which would impose upon the Congress of the United \nStates the very same discipline under which virtually every State in \nthe United States operates.\n  It is the discipline of practice, of living within the resources that \nare available, of living within the resources which have been \ncontributed by those whose representatives are in the elected bodies--\nthe legislative branches of the States. We should engage in the same \npractice at the national level. Indeed, we should live within the \nresources that we are willing to gather now--we should not attempt to \ntake the resources of the next generation.\n  The ability to take the resources of the next generation is unique to \nthe U.S. Congress. No family in America finds its children encumbered \nby the debts of their parents. No matter how profligate the spending of \na father may be, the children are not asked to endure the debts of the \nfather. While the Congress cannot bind the next Congress, it can and \ndoes bind the next generation. It is time for the Constitution to be \namended so that we do indeed curtail this practice which deprives \nindividuals affected of representation--a practice, again, which \nimposes on the next generation a kind of taxation, a kind of \nconfiscation of their wealth without any participation whatsoever in \nthe development of the priorities their resources are allocated for.\n  It is wrong, Mr. President, and we need to stop it. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                      Amendments Nos. 259 and 298\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, on Friday, I proposed two amendments, \nwhich will be voted on tomorrow. I would like to use this opportunity \nto briefly discuss those amendments, and why I believe they are so \ncritical, prior to the passage of this constitutional amendment and its \npossible ratification by the States.\n  I commence by saying that it is my intention to vote for the balanced \nbudget amendment. I do so with great regret. I consider the very debate \nthat we are having today, and over the past several days, an admission \nof failure. It is an admission of failure in a basic quality of the \nAmerican character, and that is the quality that each generation has \nnot only the responsibility to attend to its own affairs, but to leave \nthis country as a stronger and better place for our children and \ngrandchildren. That, in fact, has been the history of America for over \n200 years. Regrettably, it is the generation of our children that may \nbe the first generation to find that they are not better off, that they \ndo not have greater opportunities personally, economically, \neducationally than did our generation and preceding generations.\n  We have broken that contract, that intergenerational contract of \nAmerica. The balanced budget amendment, therefore, is the regrettable \nresponse to that broken contract. If there were reason to believe that \nwe were prepared to reform Federal spending without having to go to the \ndraconian extreme of a constitutional amendment, with all of its \nimplications, many of which are unforeseen, if we had not broken that \ncontract, if we had shown some discipline in the past or demonstrated \nour serious intention to do so in the future, then I would not vote for \nthis constitutional amendment. But the fact is that we have done \nneither. We have been profligate in the past, and every indication is \nthat we will continue to be in the future.\n  I will cite two examples from each of the major political parties. \nThe President has submitted a budget this year which calls for \napproximately a $200 billion addition to our national debt--$200 \nbillion of deficit, and about the same level of projected deficit \nthrough the next 5 years. The Republicans' Contract With America calls \nfor a balanced budget, but it also calls for increased spending, \nparticularly in the area of Defense, and it calls for tax cuts which, \nover the next 10 years, will cost the Treasury in excess of $700 \nbillion.\n  Neither the President's budget nor the Republicans' Contract With \nAmerica adds up. Thus, we are at the point that we are considering a \nconstitutional amendment to place shackles on ourselves so that we will \nnot be as able to sin in the future as we have in the past.\n  My criticism of this amendment, Mr. President, is that its reality \ndoes not live up to its rhetoric. It is less than it is purported to \nbe; it is less than it should be. It is not, as it has been described \nby some of its most fervent advocates, the ironclad amendment that will \nprotect the fiscal future of America.\n  This amendment, however, is likely to be a permanent part of the \nConstitution of America in the form that we submit it to the States. I \nbelieve the States are likely to ratify this amendment. The history of \nthe United States is that we have had 27 constitutional amendments. \nWith the exception of the amendment on prohibition that was repealed \nsome 13 years after it was adopted, no other amendment has been \nrepealed. No other amendment has been modified. So I am operating on \nthe assumption that what we pass in this Senate, what the States \nratify, will be in the Constitution of the United States for the \nforeseeable future. And it is against that long stretch of time that we \nmust evaluate whether this amendment meets our rhetoric and the \npublic's expectation.\n  In my opinion, the combination of the provisions in section 1, which \nprovide that total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \nreceipts for any fiscal year; section 2, which states that the limit on \nthe debt of the United States held by the public shall not be increased \nwithout a three-fifths vote; and section 7, which states that total \nreceipts shall include all receipts to the U.S. Government, total \noutlays shall include all outlays of the U.S. Government, results in a \nconstitutional amendment that will tolerate--will almost assure that we \nwill grow the national debt by $3 trillion over the next 25 years.\n  While the public is being led to believe that we are passing an \namendment that is going to assure fiscal responsibility, we are going \nto be passing an amendment that will almost have the opposite effect of \nassuring a dramatic increase in our national debt.\n  How is that going to happen? Well, the first component of that, as \nthis chart indicates, is going to happen whatever we do. Between now \nand the year 2002, which is the earliest fiscal year to which this \namendment will apply, we are going to add approximately $1 trillion to \nour current $4.942 trillion national debt. So that we will reach the \nyear 2002 with a national debt of $6 trillion. It is the next $2 \ntrillion that we have the opportunity to avoid. The combination of \nthose three sections that I summarized will provide that we will \naccount for our national deficit by an accounting system that says you \ntake in all of the income and you subtract all of the expenditures, and \nif you are in balance on that basis, then you have met the strictures \nof the constitutional amendment.\n  The fact is that for the next period, from now until approximately \nthe year 2018, our Social Security Program is going to be generating \nenormous surpluses. These surpluses will reach a peak of over $3 \ntrillion--a $3 trillion Social Security surplus. Every one of those \ndollars generated as a surplus in the Social Security system is a \ndollar against which we can spend for any purpose. Use of the surplus \nwill not be limited to Social Security spending.\n  So the effect of this amendment, with its requirement that Social \nSecurity be integrated into the rest of the Federal budget, is to \ntolerate a $2 trillion increase in the national debt between now and \nthe year 2018.\n  But it could be worse, Mr. President. If, for instance, this or \nfuture Congresses decide to manipulate Social Security and the handful \nof other trust funds that will be contributing to this \n[[Page S3180]] large debt held by Social Security and other trust \nfunds, we can have further opportunities to spend, cut taxes, and still \nappear to be balancing the budget.\n  The aviation trust fund provides us with a good example of how \nCongress has misused a Federal trust fund. Every time an American or a \nforeign visitor purchases an airline ticket within the United States, \nthey must pay a Federal transportation tax. The tax revenue then goes \ninto an aviation trust fund. Legislation passed by this Congress stated \nthat the proceeds of that trust fund were to be used to finance \nAmerica's aviation system. It helps to pay for the very complex \ncommunications system that protects the navigation and the safety of \naircraft. It goes, in part, to expanding our system of airfields and \nairports and terminals and other activities which benefit aviation in \nthis country.\n  The fact is that for a period of years, particularly during the \n1980's, we did not spend the money that was coming into that aviation \ntrust fund. The primary reason we did not spend the money was not \nbecause we had suddenly decided we were going to become extra \nconservative in the area of aviation spending, but rather because every \ndollar we did not spend out of that trust fund added to its surplus and \ncontributed to the masking of the Federal budget deficit. I think that \nwhile we were artificially reducing the reported deficit, we were \ntragically contributing to a degeneration of the best aviation safety \nsystem in the world. And we are all aware of some of the recent \nconsequences of that degeneration. So I do not believe that we ought to \nbe encouraging Congress to continue that pattern of behavior.\n  Finally, let me say on this point, Mr. President, I am concerned that \nsome of the strongest advocates of this constitutional amendment are \ncontributing to this public perception that we are going to be passing \nan ironclad constitutional amendment. Let me just refer to a few of the \nstatements that were published over this weekend and which caught my \nattention. I am certain they also caught the attention of many of my \ncolleagues.\n  First was an article in the Washington Post, dated Sunday, February \n26, entitled ``Congress May Ask Historic Gamble by States,'' a \ndiscussion of this constitutional amendment. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 26, 1995]\n\n               Congress May Ask Historic Gamble by States\n\n\n balanced budget amendment variously characterized as offering ``glide \n                            path'' or crash\n\n                            (By Eric Pianin)\n\n       If the Senate approves the proposed balanced budget \n     amendment Tuesday, Congress will ask the states to take a \n     historic gamble that some say will free future generations \n     from onerous debt and others warn could ruin the economy, \n     disrupt vital government services and devastate the social \n     safety net.\n       For nearly 60 years, the fight over a constitutional \n     amendment to force the government to live within its means \n     except in times of war has largely been an academic exercise. \n     But in the wake of the Republican takeover of Congress, the \n     House has overwhelmingly approved the measure, 300 to 132, \n     and supporters in the Senate are within a couple of votes of \n     the two-thirds majority needed to adopt the amendment and \n     send it on to the states for ratification.\n       Republican leaders--including House Budget Committee \n     Chairman John R. Kasich (Ohio) and Senate Judiciary Committee \n     Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (Utah)--say passage of a balanced \n     budget amendment is essential to GOP plans to impose fiscal \n     discipline on an unruly and often cowardly Congress and put \n     the government on a seven-year ``glide path'' to eliminating \n     the deficit.\n       With a balanced budget amendment in place, they insist, the \n     Republicans can cut taxes, protect Social Security from \n     reductions, beef up defense and still eliminate the deficit \n     by the year 2002--all without much upheaval or suffering.\n       ``It isn't like we're trying to haul a Mack truck--attach \n     ourselves to a Mach truck--and then pull it 100 yards with \n     the power of our own bodies,'' Kasich said recently. \n     ``There's an impression out there this is somehow impossible \n     or terribly difficult. It's not that at all.''\n       But critics--such as Sens. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), Paul \n     S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Paul D. Wellstone (D-Minn.)--warn the \n     opposite: If the amendment is approved, it would make the \n     government powerless to respond quickly to recessions and \n     other economic crises and force dismantling of agencies and \n     programs crucial to the poor and the middle class.\n       Others, including Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), also argue the \n     amendment would disrupt the balance of power among the three \n     branches of government, strengthening the hand of the \n     president to impound funds any time\n      Congress violated the constitutional strictures and opening \n     the door to judicial intervention on congressional fiscal \n     policy.\n       Critics also complain Republicans have refused to detail \n     how they intend to achieve a balanced budget within seven or \n     eight years. And they say the Social Security trust fund \n     would become an irresistible target for budget-cutters early \n     next century, despite assurances from House Speaker Newt \n     Gingrich (R-Ga.) and Senate Majority Leader Robert J. Dole \n     (R-Kan.) that Social Security would be exempted.\n       ``No one is going to escape the wrath of the balanced \n     budget mandate,'' Byrd said in a recent Senate speech.\n       The new Republican leadership has premised much of its \n     economic and budgetary strategy on passage of the budget \n     amendment, centerpiece of the House GOP's ``Contract With \n     America.'' Many proponents favor the amendment on moral \n     grounds, saying its adoption would help spare their children \n     and grandchildren from the economic burdens of a national \n     debt approaching $5 trillion.\n       Passage of the balanced budget amendment is also a vital \n     pretext for the larger goal of dramatically shrinking size of \n     government--dismantling or repackaging large chunks of it. \n     Sen. Connie Mack (R-Fla.) said last week, ``This is a \n     fundamental debate about those who believe more government \n     will solve our problems and those who believe less \n     government, less taxing and less spending will give us more \n     freedom.''\n       As a foretaste, Republican House appropriators last week \n     voted to cut $17 billion from current spending for housing, \n     health care, nutrition, clean water, job training and other \n     programs. Moreover, the House Economic and Educational \n     Opportunity Committee voted to repeal the National School \n     Lunch Act and fold school feeding and other nutritional \n     programs for the poor into block grants for states to \n     administer.\n       While these budgetary actions caused an uproar among angry \n     Democrats and social welfare activists, the cuts and program \n     changes were a drop in the bucket compared with what would be \n     required under a balanced budget amendment.\n       Studies by the Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury \n     and Center on Budget and Policy Priorities show Congress \n     would have to reduce projected spending over the next seven \n     years by as much as $1.4 trillion to balance the budget and \n     pay for the Republicans' $200 billion package of tax cuts. In \n     the year the proposed amendment would take effect, 2002, \n     Congress would have to cut an estimated $357 billion of \n     spending to meet the constitutional requirement.\n       The Republicans have promised a relatively painless \n     prescription for achieving the deficit, by redesigning costly \n     entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid, \n     consolidating other programs into block grants and slowing \n     the rate of growth of spending from a projected 5.4 percent \n     to 3.2 percent.\n       ``I won't call it horrific cuts,'' said Sen. Larry E. Craig \n     (R-Idaho), a leading proponent of the balanced budget \n     amendment. ``I'm talking about reductions of the rates of \n     growth. There isn't going to be one dime cut below this \n     year's budget in next year's spending.''\n       But liberal and conservative policy groups say the ``glide \n     path'' to a balanced budget will be far bumpier than the \n     Republicans let on. Also, it will be virtually impossible to \n     balanced the budget in seven years if Republicans insist on \n     fencing off large portions of the federal budget from \n     spending cuts, they say.\n       ``You have to be willing to take down defense and future \n     Social Security benefits, and you have to meanstest Medicare \n     and you have to eliminate a lot of cats' and dogs' \n     programs,'' said William Niskanen, an economic adviser to the \n     Reagan administration and head of the Cato Institute, a \n     conservative think tank. ``Arithmetically, it's not difficult \n     to do, but that begs the question of whether it's politically \n     difficult.''\n       Under the amendment, the president would be obliged to \n     submit a balanced budget each year and Congress would have to \n     adopt a budget with outlays no greater than the projected \n     revenues for the coming year, unless three-fifths of the \n     House and Senate agree to allow a deficit.\n       The amendment would also require a three-fifths majority in \n     each chamber to raise the ceiling on the amount of debt the \n     government can incur, and a simple majority to raise taxes. \n     The provisions would be waived in times of war or threats to \n     national security.\n       Although it is called a balanced budget amendment, the \n     measure does not guarantee a balanced budget in any year, \n     only that Congress certifies it is attempting to stay within \n     the project revenues. If, as commonly happens, revenue or \n     spending estimates prove faulty, the government could still \n     close its books showing a deficit. However, if annual \n     deficits get out of hand and push the overall national debt \n     to the legal ceiling, it would take a three-fifths \n     ``supermajority'' to raise the limit to allow additional \n     borrowing.\n       The biggest problem with the amendment, critics say, is \n     that it would rob the Congress \n     [[Page S3181]] of flexibility in responding to economic \n     crises, such as recessions, or emergencies similar to the \n     mass failures of savings and loan associations. Programs like \n     unemployment insurance, food stamps and other welfare \n     benefits currently kick in automatically whenever \n     unemployment surges. But under a balanced budget amendment, \n     it would take supermajorities in the House and Senate to \n     approve the emergency funding.\n       ``That kind of extreme fiscal policy makes a small \n     recession worse,'' President Clinton said in his radio \n     address yesterday. ``In its most exaggerated form, it's what \n     helped turn the economic slowdown of the 1920s into the Great \n     Depression of the 1930s.''\n                       text of proposed amendment\n\n       Following is text of proposed balanced budget amendment:\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of \n     each House concurring therein). That the following article is \n     proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as \n     part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of \n     three-fourths of the several states within seven years after \n     the date of its submission to the states for ratification:\n\n                               Article --\n\n       Section 1. Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not \n     exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-\n     fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall \n     provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts \n     by a roll call vote.\n       Section 2. The limit on the debt of the United States held \n     by the public shall not be increased, unless three-fifths of \n     the whole number of each House shall provide by law for such \n     an increase by a roll call vote.\n       Section 3. Prior to each fiscal year, the president shall \n     transmit to the Congress a proposed budget for the United \n     States government for that fiscal year, in which total \n     outlays do not exceed total receipts.\n       Section 4. No bill to increase revenue shall become law \n     unless approved by a majority of the whole number of each \n     House by a roll call vote.\n       Section 5. The Congress may waive the provisions of this \n     article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is \n     in effect. The provisions of this article may be waived for \n     any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in \n     military conflict which causes an imminent and serious \n     military threat to national security and is so declared by a \n     joint resolution, adopted by a majority of the whole number \n     of each House, which becomes law.\n       Section 6. The Congress shall enforce and implement this \n     article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on \n     estimates of outlays and receipts.\n       Section 7. Total receipts shall include all receipts of the \n     United States government except those derived from borrowing. \n     Total outlays shall include all outlays of the United States \n     government except for those for repayment of the debt \n     principal.\n       Section 8. This article shall take effect beginning with \n     fiscal year 2002 or with the second fiscal year beginning \n     after its ratification, whichever is later.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, in this article, this statement appeared:\n\n       The amendment would also require a three-fifths majority in \n     each Chamber to raise the ceiling on the amount of debt the \n     Government can incur.\n\n  It goes on to state:\n\n       If annual deficits get out of hand and push the overall \n     national debt to the legal ceiling, it would take a three-\n     fifths supermajority to raise the limit to allow additional \n     borrowing.\n\n  That is clearly untrue.\n  The constitutional amendment in the clearest words--and it is ironic \nthat the text of the amendment was printed inside the article that I \nhave just read--states that ``the limit on the debt of the United \nStates held by the public''--held by the public--``shall not be \nincreased without a three-fifths vote.''\n  By the year 2018, only approximately half of the total national debt \nwill be held by the public. The rest of the national debt will be held \nprimarily by Social Security and other Federal trust funds which are \nnot subject to the limitation of this constitutional amendment.\n  In a response to the President on Saturday, one of our colleagues \nmade this statement.\n\n       Americans know this measure would require Washington to \n     start living within its means and balancing its budget like \n     families and most State governments must do. That's why about \n     80 percent of Americans support it.\n\n  If 80 percent of Americans believe that this would require Washington \nto start living within its means and operating like a typical American \nhousehold, they are supporting this amendment for the wrong reasons and \nthey are about to be severely disappointed.\n  Finally, on one of the Sunday talk shows, one of our colleagues, in \ndiscussing the amendment, challenged a statement that this amendment \nwould require 60 votes to raise taxes, correctly challenged that \nstatement by saying:\n\n       No, you don't need 60 votes under this amendment to \n     increase revenues. You need 60 votes to increase the debt \n     ceiling.\n\n  That is not what the amendment provides. You do not need 60 votes to \nincrease the debt ceiling. You need 60 votes to increase the amount of \ndebt held by the public, which will be by the year 2018 only about half \nof our national debt. All the other debt that the Government borrows is \noutside of the three-fifths requirement. And it is that other \navailability of borrowing that is going to drive our national debt to \nalmost $8 trillion by the year 2018.\n  I have one other item from the weekend news that I want to discuss in \na moment where I think there has been a misstatement.\n  So these are some of the realities of the amendment that we are about \nto pass. It is an amendment which does not live up to its rhetoric. \nWhat is going to be the principal consequence of this gap between \nreality and rhetoric? The principal consequence of this deficiency in \nreality as opposed to the rhetoric with which the amendment is being \nsold is going to be aimed, targeted, focused on our Social Security \nsystem and primarily on those Social Security beneficiaries born after \nthe year 1954.\n  If you were born after the year 1954--and I see some people in this \nChamber who I think meet that standard--listen: Social Security is \ngoing to be used to mask the extent of the real deficits of the United \nStates.\n  Let me just give you a few figures at 5-year intervals. In 1980, the \nreported national debt--this is reported on integrated, budgeted, total \nrevenues versus total receipts including Social Security--the deficit \nwas reported at $73.8 billion in 1980. When you look at the Social \nSecurity trust fund in 1980, the Social Security trust fund was running \nin a deficit. It had a deficit of $1.1 billion. So the real deficit of \nthe general operations of Government was $72.7 billion; that is, the \nreported deficit minus the degree to which it incorporated the \nnecessity to finance the deficit of Social Security.\n  By 1985, the reported deficit had jumped to $212.3 billion. And by \n1985, as a result of the changes made in Social Security in 1983 when \nSocial Security was converted from a pay-as-you-go system to a surplus \nsystem--one that had this print line of developing large surpluses in \norder to be prepared to meet the needs of that population largely born \nafter World War II and particularly after 1954--we had a surplus of \n$9.4 billion. So the real deficit in the general accounts of the \nFederal Government, that is everything other than Social Security, was \n$221.7 billion. That is 1985.\n  In 1990, the reported deficit, $221.4 billion. The real deficit, \nafter you eliminate the mask of Social Security surplus, was $279.6 \nbillion.\n  In 1995, reported deficit, $176 billion. It would appear that we had \nmade significant progress in controlling the deficit. But because there \nhas been a significant increase in Social Security surpluses, the real \ndeficit was $245 billion, or not so much progress. By the year 2000, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office's latest report, dated \nJanuary 1995, the reported deficit will be $284 billion. The Social \nSecurity surplus will equal $96 billion. So the real deficit, the \ndeficit in all of our ongoing governmental accounts, will be $380 \nbillion--$380 billion.\n  That is just a foretaste of what it will be like 5 years later when, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, we have a reported \ndeficit of $421 billion and a Social Security surplus of $137 billion \nfor a real deficit of $558 billion. That is what we are experiencing in \nterms of the direction of the budget.\n  That brings me to my fourth and final weekend news communique. A \nleading Washington Post columnist wrote in an article entitled ``Fool's \nAmendment,'' that the redink hemorrhage this constitutional amendment \nis supposed to stop is not a chronic condition, it is actually a \nphenomena of the 1980's which has washed over into the 1990's, but it \nis a dubious proposition to rewrite the permanent charter of Government \nto correct for the follies of one decade.\n  [[Page S3182]] I am afraid, my friends, that the facts indicate this \nwas not just a decade-long aberration, that we did not just lose our \nway for one 10-year period. In fact, we seem to have lost this \nfundamental character of America of generational responsibility. We are \nmasking the extent to which we are lost by these increasing Social \nSecurity surpluses. We are lost with no indication that we are about to \nfind a compass.\n  Why is Social Security in the target of this issue? It is because \nthat any future attempts to reform Social Security--and clearly Social \nSecurity cries out for some reform--are going to be stymied by the fact \nthat those very reforms will be seen as, and in fact will be, means to \nfurther mask the deficit. Those reforms will not be used for the \nprincipal purpose of assisting Social Security to be a sound, reliable, \nretirement system for the indefinite future. They will be used as a \nmeans of generating additional surplus so we can have even more \nspending, even more tax cuts, even more borrowing.\n  Third, the increased national debt will lead to increased national \nannual debt payments. Under this constitutional amendment, the amount \nof deficit that we will add from the year 2002 through the year 2018 \nwill be between $120 billion and $140 billion. That is $120 billion to \n$140 billion that our children and grandchildren and their children and \ngrandchildren are going to be asked to pay.\n  There will be no net national savings increase as a result of this \namendment between 1995 and the year 2018.\n  Mr. President, we reformed the Social Security system in the early \n1980's, in order to build a surplus to meet our future obligations. By \nstatute, that fund can only be invested in a particular form of \nTreasury notes which, incidentally, are restrained so they are \nnontransferable. How are we going to pay for all those notes when this \nlarge wave of Americans, particularly those born after 1954, arrive and \nbegin to ask for their benefits?\n  The theory was that the rest of the national budget would be in \nbalance during this period, and we would use the Social Security \nsurpluses for real investments in America, in our economic growth, in \nmaking our country stronger so that it would be in a position after the \nyear 2018 to meet this enormous indebtedness.\n  In fact, we have not been doing that. We have been using the Social \nSecurity surplus to fund our annual deficits. This amendment will allow \nMembers to continue to use our Social Security surplus to fund our \nannual deficits and add $12 trillion to that national debt.\n  We are facing, Mr. President, a gigantic truck wreck beginning in \nabout the year 2015. We are still operating in a surplus, but the rate \nof increase in that surplus is beginning to decline. I remember an old \njoke told about a trucker who was in a class, studying new techniques \nin driving trucks. The teacher used a method of instruction in which he \nwould ask students different hypothetical questions to see how they \nwould respond in emergency situations. One of the questions that was \nasked was, ``Joe, suppose you are riding on a mountainous road in \nnorthern New Mexico. You are 200 yards from the top of the hill, and \nyou look up and there is another truck that has just crested the hill. \nYou can tell it is out of control, and you can tell it is going over \n100 miles an hour. What would you do?'' Joe said, ``I would turn to my \nrelief driver, Ray, who is sleeping in back of me, and wake him up.'' \nThe driver was shocked. ``You would do what? You would wake up your \nrelief driver in that kind of an emergency situation?'' Joe said, ``I \nsure would, because Joe never has seen a truck wreck like the one we \nare about to have.''\n  Well, friends, we need to wake up America because we have not seen a \ntruck wreck like the one we will have which will begin in about the \nyear 2015, no longer having the enormous annual surpluses but reversing \nto the point where we will have deficits.\n  And what type of deficits? The period of about the year 2020 or \n2025--and it sounds like a long time from now; we hope we will be here \nto see it--about that time, we will be running deficits in the Social \nSecurity of in the range of $350 billion to $400 billion a year. We \nwill be spending out that much more than we will be taking in. That is \nnot an aberration. That is the way the system was designed in order to \ncreate a core of assets that will be able to meet this future demand.\n  If you could analogize this to a household, the Jones household has \nearnings of $40,000. Unfortunately, the Joneses have not been very \nprudent and they have gotten into a pattern over the last 2 or 3 years \nof spending $50,000. So every year, their indebtedness goes up and they \nget a little more in the hole. Well, good news and bad news has just \noccurred for the Jones family. Their favorite uncle died, and the uncle \nleft an inheritance, part of which goes to the Jones family.\n  Now, this is a somewhat unusual inheritance. The Jones family is \ngoing to receive $15,000 a year for the next 10 years. They are very \nhappy about that. But the uncle has imposed a requirement on them. He \nloves the Jones' two children. They are his favorite nephew and niece, \nand he wants to see that they go to college. So he is going to require \nas a condition of receiving this $15,000 over each of the next 10 years \nthat the Jones family commit that they will send these two children to \ncollege.\n  They estimate that it will cost $10,000 a year per child to send them \nto college. What do the Joneses do? Do they put the $15,000 aside in \nsome trust fund to meet this obligation to send their children to \nschool, as their beloved uncle wanted? No. They take the money and they \nstart to spend it. They actually increase their annual spending from \n$50,000 up to $55,000, so now they are spending the $40,000 they make \nand the $15,000 they got from their favorite uncle, and they live very \nwell for the next 10 years.\n  At the end of the 10 years, the $15,000 no longer is there. They are \nback to $40,000, having gotten themselves into the lifestyle of a \n$55,000-a-year family, and they have this obligation to send their two \nchildren to college.\n  It is not far off from what our family of America will face in about \nthe year 2018. We will no longer have the Social Security surplus, but \nwe will have to meet the retirement obligations that we have made to \nour older Americans. We are setting up another type of clash, and that \nwill be a confrontation between classes of Americans. We are setting up \na potential confrontation between those Americans who will be in the \nwork force in the decade of the 2020's and those Americans who will be \nretired, because we will be asking those people in the work force to \nwork harder. There will be fewer of them to support the large number of \nretirees. We will ask them to pay excessively higher taxes in order to \nmeet those accumulated obligations.\n  Further, there will not be the kinds of student financial aid that \nmaybe the Jones family thought they would get for their two children \nbecause we cannot afford student financial aid anymore.\n  There is going to be a generational clash in America. There could \nalso be a clash between older Americans and better-off Americans. There \nis going to be a temptation to manipulate Social Security in order to \nmake the surplus even greater so that some of those obligations in the \nContract With America that have this $700 billion-plus price tag from \nnow until the year 2005 can be met. This concerns me.\n  So we are going to be fraying the basic social relationship between \nand among important groups of Americans. And we are doing all of this, \nMr. President, unnecessarily. We do not have to do this in order to \npass this constitutional amendment. We will pass a better, a stronger, \na significantly more conservative amendment if we will but take a \nseries of actions in the next few hours.\n  It would be my hope that we would take as preferred action, No. 1, \nthe passage of the amendment that the Senator from California, Senator \nFeinstein, has offered which takes Social Security out of the rest of \nthe Federal budget. It would deal with the principal issues raised \nparticularly in section 1 and in section 7 that I discussed earlier.\n  If we fail to pass the Feinstein amendment, we ought to adopt the \nfirst of my two amendments which says: If we are going to have a three-\nfifths vote to raise the limit of debt held by the public, let us make \nit a three-fifths vote on all national debt. The Social Security funds \nshould not be more exposed than the other sources \n[[Page S3183]] from which the Congress can borrow money.\n  Let us all play on a level playing field. Let us have a three-fifths \nvote for lifting our public debt limit. Let us do what the reporter in \nthe Washington Post, and what two of our colleagues apparently think we \nare doing in this amendment, by requiring a three-fifths vote to raise \nthe ceiling on borrowing. We are not doing that in this amendment. We \nshould.\n  Finally, and I particularly would like to direct this comment to the \nchairman of the Budget Committee who probably understands these issues \nas well as anybody in this Chamber. If we continue with the outline of \nfiscal policy found in this amendment, using the Social Security \nsurpluses as an additional area of borrowing, with only a majority vote \nrequired, we will be masking the extent of our other spending or tax \ncuts. As a result, in 2018 we will carry an $8 trillion debt, about $3 \ntrillion of which is held by the Social Security System.\n  In 2019, we begin this dramatic drawdown of the Social Security fund. \nThe surplus will drop from $3 trillion to zero by the year 2028. How \nare we going to fill this triangle on this chart? The triangle \nrepresents the national debt that we have accumulated by borrowing from \nSocial Security, but which now we are going to have to start repaying \nto the beneficiary. How are we going to fill that void?\n  Under the balanced budget amendment, a three-fifths vote would be \nrequired to borrow from the public. This amendment will worsen this \ngigantic truck crash by saying that over a 10-year period, we have to \nborrow $3 trillion additional from the public and do it, we must have a \nthree-fifths vote. At an absolute minimum, I think at least we ought to \nadopt my second amendment. The second Graham amendment which says that, \nwhen the Social Security program moves into a deficit position, we \nshould be able to refinance the program by a simple majority vote. If \nwe were able to borrow from Social Security at a majority vote, why \nshould we not be able to pay off the beneficiaries with a majority \nvote?\n  In addition, I would like to comment on the issue of judicial review. \nAs the advocates have stated on this issue, as well as others, how much \njudicial interference there would be in enforcing this amendment? All \nof these matters can be handled pursuant to the language in section 2 \nwhich states:\n\n       The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by \n     appropriate legislation which may rely on estimates of \n     outlays and expenditures.\n\n  I think that there is an obligation owed by us to the American people \nto tell them how we are going to do that. I believe that the outcome of \nthe balance budget amendment has been misrepresented. We should outline \nthe implementing legislation. I believe that the advocates of this \nlegislation ought to present to us between now and approximately 23 \nhours from now that language. Certainly, the bill's advocates have \ndrafted this language. The objectives and strengths of this legislation \nare being regularly commented upon. Making public that language might \nhelp to alleviate some of the concerns that myself and others have \nraised during this debate.\n  I think we have a right to see what the implementing language will \nactually say so that we can assess whether we think it will protect the \nSocial Security System, and other important areas that have been \nstated.\n  Or finally, and this, again, goes to the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, if we pass this amendment without either the modifications \nthat address the serious problems of integrating Social Security into \nthe rest of the Federal budget, and without the ability to analyze the \nimplementing legislation, then I think the Budget Committee needs to \nlead our colleagues by pledging that we are not going to succumb to the \ntemptation to borrow an additional $2 trillion between the year 2002 \nand 2018. Instead, the Senate will produce a budget plan that, in fact, \nwill get us in balance, without having to use the Social Security \nsurplus. That we will, rather than adding to the national debt, be \nadding to the Nation's savings account.\n  I think that a commitment by the leadership of the Senate and the \nBudget Committee that they would take that course of action would be of \nconsiderable relief to the American people, it would certainly be of \nconsiderable relief to this Senator.\n  So, Mr. President, in closing, the American people are poised for a \ndisappointment. It is not the first time. This Congress, over many \nyears, has stated that its intention was to act with fiscal \nresponsibility. You could list the amendments, bills, the proposals \nthat have had that as their objective. In every one of those instances, \nthe American people have been disappointed. They have felt that they \nhave been misled. That has contributed to the fact that the public \nstanding of this institution has reached almost historic lows.\n  It is in our hands to do otherwise. It is in our hands to pass a \nbalanced budget amendment which will live up to our rhetoric. It is in \nour hands to pass a balanced budget amendment which will provide a \nstrong deterrent to further additions to the national debt. It is in \nour hands to pass a balanced budget amendment that will protect what \nhas been one of the great social programs in this Nation's history, a \nprogram that has lifted the America's seniors out of poverty, given \nthem a level of respect and dignity in their retirement years. We \nshould protect the Social Security system, a system that now stands in \nthe gun sight of this amendment.\n  All of those things are within our power to do and to do beginning 23 \nhours and 5 minutes from now. The question is, will we? Thank you, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  I might say to my friend from Florida, I only have about 15 minutes, \nand if the Senator does not mind, with reference to the questions the \nSenator has posed to me regarding the Social Security trust fund, I \nwill come back to the floor on another occasion before the vote if I am \ngranted time and I will explain my version of what the Senator has just \ndescribed.\n  Frankly, I think the issue is one of a unified budget and whether we \nshould abandon the unified budget or not. I am a staunch proponent of \nthe unified budget which has everything on board for economic purposes \nand for deficit purposes. I believe I can explain to the Senator that \nthe changes the Senator is talking about would be accomplished by \nmajority vote, not by supermajority vote, because of the residuals we \nare talking about, and the residuals come about by passing laws that \nchange things, and those laws are passed by simple majorities. But I \nwill go into that in more detail with the Senator at another time.\n  I came today, Mr. President, because over the weekend there was a lot \nof talk about what I choose to call what ifs. There were some what ifs \nthat Senator Moynihan used on ``Meet the Press.'' There is a what if \nthis morning by a columnist named Richard Kogan, who used to be a \nstaffer on the House Budget Committee. And I would like to talk about \nthis a bit because this constitutional amendment will not leave us \nwithout some what ifs. I think there will be some.\n  I propose that the what ifs we are going to have to address are less \ndangerous to America's future than if we do nothing and leave the \nbudget process and leave the Constitution alone and continue the \nprofligate spending that we have.\n  I was lucky over the weekend to go for 4 hours to the city of Detroit \nand then moved next door to Oakland County to conduct a hearing with my \ndistinguished friend, the new Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham], and \na very large crowd of participants, including their Governor.\n  It is interesting, Mr. President, that on that day on the front page \nof the Detroit paper was a good picture of money, and it was 43 million \ndollars' worth of money. It was, ``What Does $43 Million Look Like?'' \nIt indicated that the night before last they were drawing their \nlottery, which they call a lotto, and somebody might win $43 million.\n  I would like the American people to know that it is interesting that \nit took that much space to show $43 million, and yet in 1 day the \ndeficit of the United States is increased by about $500 million, which \nis about 12 times that $43 million. I left a dollar with Senator \n[[Page S3184]] Abraham and said buy me one of those lottery tickets and \nmake the U.S. Government the beneficiary, and if we win we will get $43 \nmillion. It turns out there were three winners so we would only have \ngotten $15 million.\n  But essentially, if we would have won the $43 million and put it \nagainst the deficit, which exists even though Americans are working and \npaying taxes to try to pay our current expenses, it would have taken \ncare of 2 hours of the accumulated deficit of the United States for the \nyear--2 hours, $43 million.\n  Now, frankly, that is what brings me to the floor and that is what \nbrings me in support of an effort on our part to produce within our \nConstitution a mandate that we stop this kind of profligate spending \nwhich is going to cause America to have little economic future 15 or 20 \nyears from now when my good friend from Florida is worried about how we \nare going to pay the Social Security recipients, and I am worried about \nthat. But I am also worried about what is going to remain for anybody \nelse, including my grandchildren and their children, who are going to \nhave to work--in one case it is suggested that to pay this bill, if we \ndo not get the costs under control, the marginal tax rates would have \nto be 82 percent.\n  Now, who is going to work in America and what kind of future do you \nhave if that is the case?\n  So there are a lot of what ifs, and one of the what ifs is what would \nwe do if our banking system or our savings and loan system suffered a \nvery big loss and we had to come up with the money to bail it out.\n  Well, Mr. President, let me suggest there is nothing in this \nconstitutional amendment which says you must have a three-fifths vote \nto conduct the business of the U.S. Government, whatever that business \nis.\n  What it does say is if you want to do it in a way that is unbalancing \nthe budget and you must borrow more money to do it, you need three-\nfifths.\n  So it is a matter of priorities and choices. And for those who think \nwe will not have the wherewithal to prevent the big recessions from \noccurring and harming us more if we have this amendment than if we did \nnot, might I suggest that we can be accused of a lot of things but we \ncannot be accused of being totally ignorant and stupid. We will have to \ndraw our laws after we have this amendment in place--and I hope it is \nin place within the next couple of years--we will have to draw the laws \nwith reference to security of banks, security of savings and loans, \nrecessions and, yes, even unemployment compensation so as to comply \nwith this law. We will have to choose some priorities. We may in fact \nhave to set up better reserves in some of these funds so that at the \nend of the year we do not have to push ourselves out of balance in \norder to meet these kinds of requirements.\n  So for those who want to continue with a whole laundry list of what \nifs, I would just suggest what if we do not do anything about this \ndeficit. That is the biggest what if.\n  Some would say just go ahead and cut the deficit, cut programs. Some \nof us have been trying for a long time. Presidents have been around, \nfour, five, or six, and we have only had one balanced budget or two in \nthat whole period of time.\n  What we need is the American people speaking throughout our country \nin a loud and clear voice that says enough is enough. And what if we do \nnot put this in the Constitution and force ourselves, and, yes, force \nthe American people to accept less from their Government rather than \nmore?\n  Now, in trying to get the deficit better under control, when we have \nour great constituents, our friends from our home States, coming before \nus saying, ``Not my program, somebody else's,'' let me say in my State \nI pledge only fairness, that my State in this restraint and this \nrestructuring of Government will be treated fairly. But I cannot say \nthat every single program and every single entitlement that we \ncurrently spend, that we currently have programmed in where they will \nincrease every year--in the case of Medicare and Medicaid at 10.5 or 11 \npercent ad infinitum--I will not have to say who is going to pay for \nthat. And if we have to get the deficit under control, what are we \ngoing to change if we do not change yours?\n  So the bigger what if is not what if we have a bank failure or what \nif we have a recession or what if we have more unemployment.\n  I would remind the Senate, if you are wondering whether the Senate \ncan work its will even against difficult voting requirements for \nsomething like unemployment, I would like to put in the Record the \nunemployment compensation extension which occurred, believe it or not, \nwhen the rule of law in the Senate said you cannot spend any more money \nbecause you would violate the pay-as-you-go requirement, much like we \nare going to have with this constitutional amendment, and somebody said \nwe have to pay for unemployment, we still need 6 or 8 months of \nextended benefits. What do we do? What do we do? Eighty-eight Senators \nvoted to do it; 88 Senators voted to do that because it was needed.\n  Now, that is the what if. If we have not planned to take care of \nthat, we will vote on it, just like we do everything else. And who \nknows, we may even do the next one by a simple majority for we might \ncut something and say cut this and pay for something that is more \nimportant. We do not choose to do that very often even in crisis in our \ngreat country and in our great Senate and House.\n We choose to say we have to spend some more because there is a crisis \nupon us.\n\n  There are stabilizers in our economy now. Where I now see this new \ndiagram of how our economy has been up and down since the turn of the \ncentury, including the Great Depression, and it used to be that our \neconomy went in broad sweeps like this and now in the last few years we \nare just in narrow sweeps like this because we have a lot of \nstabilizers in it. The biggest one is the Federal Reserve Board. It now \ncontrols things so we do not have those big ups and downs. I do not \nthink we are ever going to have them again. Is it suggested that the \nstabilizers in our Government--unemployment compensation, the Federal \nReserve Board putting more money on the market or making less \navailable, reducing short-term interest rates if they can, in crises, \nextending unemployment when we need to, making sure that banks really \ncannot go totally broke from the standpoint of diminishing our currency \nvalue--we have all those things in place. Are we going to wipe all \nthose out just because we are insisting that it is enough to spend $1.6 \ntrillion and perhaps we should not spend $1.7 trillion? Should we not \nbe prudent enough to keep the stabilizers in?\n  So I believe those arguments are truly, truly red herrings. For those \nwho think we ought to control the American economy by turning spending \non and off, the Keynesian idea of economics, frankly they will remain \npeople who think that is what we ought to do. And there will remain \nthose who do not think we ought to do that. And, frankly, I am \nconfident that we are going to find our way within the implementing \nlanguage for this amendment to do what we must to be prudent and \nrational with reference to a strong American economy.\n  I would like to make two other points. First, all of the changes \nrequired to reach results within the framework of this constitutional \namendment require simple majorities. It was thought at one point the \nConstitution may have in it three-fifths vote on taxes. That is not in \nthe Constitution, in this amendment. So whatever you want to change to \nmake the deficit go up or down, tax more, cut more, create less of an \nentitlement or a bigger entitlement--those are all done by simple \nmajority. It is the residual of the simple majority votes that end up \nwith the deficit being too big or too little.\n  My final point is it is amazing to this Senator that there is now an \nargument that we should not have a three-fifths vote to borrow more \nmoney and break the concept of a balanced budget at a point in time. \nThere is an argument we should not have three-fifths.\n  My friends and fellow Americans, you must be bound by something. The \nsimple majority got us where we are, voting for everything and refusing \nto cut; voting for taxes, and then not voting to cut spending. Those \nare all a result of simple majority votes.\n  Should we have a constitutional amendment--what a joke--that says you \nmust be in balance unless a simple \n[[Page S3185]] majority says you do not have to be? Why go through the \ntrouble of passing it? That is the rule today. That is what Senator \nHarry Byrd from Virginia did 18 years ago in the U.S. Senate. He passed \na substantive law of the land that said you shall no longer have any \ndeficits, starting 1 year from now.\n  That stayed on the books while we incurred deficits, because when \nCongress votes the last vote, the last law governs. So if we had a \nconstitutional amendment that did not have some kind of supermajority, \nwhere would it stand on a roster of enforceability, of something with \nteeth? It would have zero teeth.\n  So, for those who do not like the three-fifths, they must be saying \none of two things. We will really solve the budget with simple majority \nvotes, although we have been unable to do it heretofore; it will be \ndone. Or they must be saying it should be stronger than three-fifths. I \nthought that was an argument I might hear. I thought I might hear an \nargument that there should be no way to avoid a balanced budget--three-\nfifths, six-fifths, who cares? You cannot do it.\n  This amendment is pretty well thought out. Because most things will \nget done by simple majorities around here, which is the good way to do \nit, the democratic way, the majoritarian vote idea is a paramount idea \nin American democracy. However, we are merely suggesting that the debt \nis getting too big. The annual deficits seem never to be controllable. \nSo when it comes to borrowing money to pay for this deficit, increasing \nthe debt, that you have to have a supermajority. I think it is the only \nway we are going to get there. In fact, I will confess when they were \nlooking for ways to enforce a constitutional amendment, and if you look \nback in history we have had a number of them, they have been \nenforceable by different mechanisms, I concurred wholeheartedly as \nbudget chairman that this was probably the best way--put a limitation \non the public debt.\n  I believe when we are finished arguing tomorrow about the unified \nbudget and Social Security--and I hope to bring that to the floor and \ntalk about it--that essentially everyone will understand that the \nunified budget governs everything in it and that essentially if you \nwant to change things you change them by simple majority and you are \nnot going to borrow any more or any less, based upon the Social \nSecurity trust fund, because those calculations are already in the \nunified budget concept by definition.\n  I will go into that in more detail tomorrow because I believe that is \nthe case. I do not believe the argument that you can borrow all you \nwant from Social Security because you are only governed under this \namendment when increasing the publicly held debt; I do not think that \nis a valid argument. I think they are one and the same when it comes to \nthe unified budget. It is no easier to do one or the other under the \nunified budget and I will try to do a better job on that tomorrow.\n  So, in conclusion, this Senator has been through many, many ``what \nifs?'' Many times we have said what if we would have done this, we \nwould be in better shape than we are. What if the 1986 budget that \nSenator Dole and I put through the Senate had been accomplished, where \nwould we be? We would be very far along in terms of the deficit, \nridding ourselves of it. But it did not happen. So the what ifs on the \nside of the equation that says what if we do not do this, put this \nconstitutional amendment in place, far outweigh the other what ifs \nabout how we will solve some other smaller problem within the huge, \nhuge notion of borrowing to pay for our current debts and interest that \nwe have incurred.\n  I will close today by suggesting to the senior citizens of the United \nStates, if I were advising what policy should be adopted I would say \nwhatever policy the Congress of the United States and the President are \ngoing to be firmly committed to that is most apt to have sustained \neconomic growth over a 20- or 25-year period of time. Whatever that \npolicy is, with reference to fiscal policy, we better support it. I \nwill guarantee that for all that is being said on the floor about the \nfuture of the Social Security trust fund and how much have we borrowed \nand how much have we not borrowed and what are we going to do 12 years \nfrom now and 20 years from now, I will say to every senior in America \nthere is little chance that what is expected of Social Security will \never occur in a 20- or 25-year timeframe, unless you can extract from \nyour legislators and policymakers that they have done the very best \nthey can to create an environment for sustained economic growth. \nWithout it Social Security is doomed, the pensions of the future are \ndoomed, and the trust fund is not going to mean much.\n  I believe a balanced budget approach like this is a start down the \nroad of the best fiscal policy we can have, comparing what we have been \nable to do and what we have promoted and propped up and levied against \nthe people of this country over the past 20 to 25 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n                         against the amendment\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, after much deliberation, I have concluded \nthat I should not support the balanced budget amendment and will vote \nagainst it when the final vote is taken in the Senate tomorrow.\n  The proposed amendment is appealing on the surface, but underneath \nthere are a host of problems. I believe its objectives are unrealistic \nand possibly detrimental, and I fear that it could place intolerable \nburdens on the States.\n  I find myself in basic disagreement with the philosophy of the \nproposed amendment. As our distinguished colleague from New York, Mr. \nMoynihan, has so eloquently reminded us, the Federal budget is not \nsupposed to be in perpetual balance. Those of us who experienced the \neconomic cycles preceding World War II have a special respect for the \nwisdom of John Maynard Keynes, who showed us that government should \nsave when times are good so that it can spend when times are bad.\n  The balanced budget amendment is the antithesis of that sensible \ndoctrine. Its ritualistic requirement for balance in each fiscal year \ndisregards the random vagaries of economic cycles, precluding the \ntimely operation of automatic stabilizers such as unemployment \ninsurance and bank deposit insurance during downsizings when they are \nmost needed.\n  Likewise, the ritual requirement to achieve balance might deter the \naccumulation of budget surpluses in good years, since the pending \namendment might tend to promote unreasoning tax slashes, instead of the \nprudent salting away of a surplus.\n  I also fear that the rapid withdrawal of some $1.6 trillion in \nFederal spending in the arbitrary time frame of the next 7 years could \nvirtually wreck the economy, especially if it should coincide with a \nperiod of high interest rates or a recession. And I am particularly \nconcerned about the impact of a cumulative loss of $1.8 billion in \nFederal spending to the small State of Rhode Island over the same \ntimeframe.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I recoil at the notion of using our \nConstitution for the purpose of imposing bookkeeping rules. I doubt \nthat this amendment will stand the test of timelessness which has \nsustained the wisdom of the Framers for 200 years.\n  From the perspective of the year 2095, it may appear rather anomalous \nthat the U.S. Senate spent the month of February 1995 trying to mandate \nfor all time that our books should be balanced, down to the last dollar \nand cent, at the end of each 12-month period. My guess is that--if the \namendment is approved--a disenchanted electorate will have repealed it \nlong before the century passes.\n  Of course, we can and should continue to do everything we can to cut \nGovernment spending and reduce deficits. But we already have ample \nauthority to do so and should simply get on with the task.\n  In my mind, there is no need for a constitutional amendment. The \nConstitution should not contain a balanced budget amendment, and I \nwould trust that it does not succeed. I realize the political appeal of \nthe very title of a balanced budget amendment is immense. It is not an \nopen and shut case one way or the other. Many of us have proposed \ndifferent ways at different times. I voted for it in the past. But it \nis a close call. But my conclusion is that the best interests of the \nNation would be served by not passing the balanced budget amendment.\n  [[Page S3186]] The judgment against this proposal was best summed up \nby the columnist David Broder when he wrote that it is ``a bad idea \nwhose time has gone.'' The time and place to stop it is here and now. I \nurge its rejection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me.\n  Mr. President, before I make a few short remarks, I would like, if I \nmight, to compliment the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island. He \nand I have talked about this issue of the balanced budget on several \noccasions. I have been in what you might call sort of soul-searching \nmeetings with the Senator from Rhode Island. I have watched him--I do \nnot want to say in his agony--in attempting to reach a decision about \nhis vote. But I certainly have seen him trying to search for the proper \nrole to take and the proper answer to give to his constituents and ours \nwith regard to this all-important vote that we will take tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, please allow me to compliment my very distinguished \nfriend from Rhode Island, not only on his decision, but on the very \nthoughtful way in which that decision was reached.\n  Mr. PELL. I thank my friend, the Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 307\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, on Friday I talked briefly about an \namendment that I am going to call up for a vote tomorrow. The number of \nthis amendment, for the purposes of our staff who might be watching the \nmonitor at this time, is amendment number 307.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. In fact, it is only one \nsentence long. I am going to take the liberty of reading amendment 307 \nthat we will consider tomorrow, and I will do that at this time. On \npage 3 of the constitutional amendment, between lines 8 and 9, the \nfollowing sentence would be inserted:\n\n       It is the intent of Congress that each State should, as a \n     part of the ratification process, submit to Congress \n     recommendations for reductions in direct and indirect Federal \n     funds provided to the State and its residents (based on the \n     State's allocation of Federal funds) necessary to balance the \n     State's share of the Federal deficit.\n\n  That new sentence I would attempt to add by amendment 307 to the \nproposed constitutional amendment before us at this time.\n  Mr. President, I call this--and I think I can call it this in all \ntruth and honesty--a States' rights amendment. This is an amendment \nthat would belong to the people as their right to tell the Congress how \nthe cuts should be made in our respective States.\n  Back in the middle part of January the Department of Treasury came \nout with what I consider to be a very thorough study of how each State \nwould be impacted and affected by a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget by the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, I hold this study in my hand. And from time to time, I \nhave been given the opportunity to discuss with my colleagues in the \nSenate how each of our States represented by this body would be \naffected by this particular amendment that will be voted on sometime \nduring the course of the legislative day tomorrow.\n  For example, the Treasury Department has indicated that the State of \nArkansas from which I come, a small State of around 2.5 million people, \nwould have to increase State taxes--not Federal taxes, State taxes--by \n16.5 percent across the board to make up for the loss of grants, should \nthe balanced budget amendment pass, and the Federal budget is balanced \nby the year 2002.\n  Also, Mr. President, we would see a cut in about $1.1 billion a year \nin Medicare benefits to our State, and another $1.1 billion per year in \nother programs where the Government allocates the money to the States.\n  There are going to be severe cuts to each State. My amendment \nbasically would say that the people of the State--through or via their \nown State legislatures sitting at the proper time, during the debate on \nwhether or not to ratify this amendment by the respective States, would \ntell their State legislators sitting in their respective general \nassemblies how the people feel these allocations should be effectuated \nin the State.\n  The State legislatures would be looking at the allocation of cuts \nbased upon the total Federal funds received today. That would be the \nbasis of the formula that the States would be employing in recommending \nto the Federal Government, the Federal Congress, the national Congress, \nhow these Federal funds, these cuts, should be implemented out in the \nStates.\n  This would give the people of our country a very, very rare \nopportunity. It would provide our people the opportunity to tell \nCongress where these cuts should be made. It would provide the people \nof America the right basically to petition Congress,\n in an informal, nonbinding way, say as what we believe out in the \ncountry, the priorities should be in allocating cuts in Federal \nspending back to the States.\n\n  Mr. President, we have just gone through a very, very lengthy several \ndays of session in the Senate with regard to the issue of unfunded \nmandates. Let me say that this is not an unfunded mandate. This is not \neven a mandate. This is something merely declaring the intent of the \nCongress, that the States would have the opportunity to show us where \nthese cuts and where this pain could be best allocated. We think it is \nfair; we think it is simple. It speaks to the issue in one simple \nsentence that we hope will be accepted by this body tomorrow.\n  Some might say, if we accept this amendment, even though it is just \none sentence, then we are going to have to go back and have a \nconference with the House of Representatives to reconcile any \ndifferences. We would do this because we have dared to differ with the \nHouse just by adding this one sentence. Mr. President, I do not really \nbuy that argument, because it is very rare indeed that we approach the \neve of a historic vote on an amendment such as this, which will change \nforever the basic relationships of the three branches of Government. We \nwould be forever changing the way Government deals with how we finance, \nhow we structure the American economic system.\n  This is a crucial, critical vote tomorrow. In the 1 or 2 days' time \nthat might be expended in a conference between House and Senate \nconferees--conferences are done all the time; it is normal and it is \nnatural to have conferences on differences between the two bodies--I \nfeel they can work out. If not this language, at least the spirit of \nthis language to be encompassed in the final draft of the amendment, so \nas to give the people of America the opportunity to speak to the \nCongress, to say where these cuts should occur.\n  Mr. President, once again, the people of the State would speak during \nthe ratification process. This is presupposing--maybe wrongfully, I do \nnot know--that there will be 67 votes tomorrow to ratify this amendment \nto balance the budget. But, Mr. President, in my opinion, it is very, \nvery important because we have now lost the fight on the people's right \nto know how Congress will balance the Federal budget, and at least we \nwill have some safeguard, some measure of the impact on the States, \nshould this amendment receive 67 votes. And before the States ratify or \nfail to ratify this amendment, we would have the opportunity for the \npeople to express to us how they feel as to the allocation of this pain \nthat we will feel.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude by saying that this is, as we have all \nknown for a long time, going to be a very close vote. We are seeing \nmany phone calls come into our offices, and letters and telegrams; \nthere is no question about that. That should be encouraged because the \npeople should express how they feel about altering the Constitution of \nthe United States in this way. But I am just very hopeful that all of \nthe people in the country who are watching this particular debate on \nthis issue of the balanced budget amendment, I am just hoping, Mr. \nPresident, they will realize that most of us in this body want and \ndesire and are committed to a balanced budget. Some of us do not feel \nat this time that the proper way to achieve that balanced budget is to \nput it in the Federal Constitution.\n  I, for one, do not feel that we should wait until the year 2002 to \nbegin trying to balance the budget. I think that we have to begin that \nprocess now, as we did in 1990, as we did in 1993. We have to continue \non that cycle in order to \n[[Page S3187]] find ourselves, to place ourselves on the glidepath to a \nbalanced budget. I think, too, that many people who might be watching \nthis argument must realize that we cannot in this country violate a 60-\nyear-old contract that we have had and have maintained with the people \nof this country relative to their Social Security trust funds, which \nsome fear will be used to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, we know that in this amendment, we have voted down the \namendment which would have exempted Social Security funds from the \nbalanced budget amendment. I say, and say without reservation, that \nthis was one of the more critical votes that we dissected and explored \nwith regard to this constitutional amendment.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I think there is another issue that hangs out \nthere and haunts us and, in fact, taints this constitutional amendment \nas proposed. This is the issue of the judiciary's role in interpreting \nwhat we did, and also, the role that the Federal judges might well play \nin implementing the constitutional amendment to balance the budget, and \ntheir having the ability to raise taxes to balance the Federal budget.\n  Mr. President, I am not talking about the U.S. Supreme Court having \nthat ability. I am talking about Federal district judges perhaps having \nthe opportunity, or seizing the opportunity, to come forward and say \nthat the Congress has not balanced the budget; therefore I, acting \nunder the authority vested in me as a Federal district judge in \nNashville, TN, or Little Rock, AR, or Oshkosh, WI, or wherever the case \nmay have arisen, to enjoin the issue of taxation.\n  Under the constitutional amendment, we are going to see taxation \nwithout representation, Mr. President--that is my firm belief--in the \nevent that we pass the Federal balanced budget constitutional amendment \non tomorrow.\n  Tomorrow is a critical vote, and I just hope that the people of our \ncountry will realize that this has not been a delaying tactic, that we \nhave wanted to fully explore the momentous decision that we have to \nmake on tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I respectfully submit that on both sides of the aisle, \nwe have conducted this debate in a manner where I hope the people--\nwhether they agree or disagree with our decision--will at least say \nthat the U.S. Senate is a great deliberative body and that we have \ncarried out our mission, I hope, with sincerity and a commitment to the \ncause that we are attempting to serve.\n  Mr. President, I see my very good friend from Connecticut, and he is \nnot ready to speak just now. Therefore, I will suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise again today to discuss the balanced \nbudget amendment and to provide what I hope will be some constitutional \nhistorical perspective on this issue.\n  Let me begin by commending my colleagues for the fact that we have \nhad an opportunity now over the past several weeks to thoroughly debate \nand discuss this issue. As my colleague from Arkansas just noted, I \nthink the institution has been well served by this debate. It is \nexactly what the framers intended; that, on matters of deep and \nprofound concern to the Republic, this body act in a deliberate \nfashion. And there can be no matter more serious than an effort to \namend the Constitution of the United States. And certainly, when we \nattempt to do so, a thorough and complete debate and discussion of the \nimplications of that decision ought to be the business of this body for \nhowever long it takes.\n  I particularly want to commend the efforts of my colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd, who is, I believe all recognize in this body, \nregardless of party, truly one of the great historians, one of the \ngreat minds when it comes to the Constitution, and to the rules of the \nSenate. I suspect that all of our colleagues have benefited directly \nfrom his historical perspective and his leadership on making Members \naware of the implications of a constitutional amendment of this \nsignificance.\n  Mr. President, the congressional leadership of the new majority is \nnow advocating the most sweeping rewrite of the U.S. Constitution in \ntwo centuries. In addition to the matter before us--the balanced budget \namendment--many in the new leadership are advocating amendments on tax \nlimitation, term limits, line-item veto, unfunded mandates, school \nprayer, and flag burning. Mr. President, that is seven constitutional \namendments that the new Republican leadership hopes to pass in this \nCongress.\n  Other than the Bill of Rights, composed of 10 amendments, all \nratified in 1791, making so many changes to the Constitution so fast \nwould be utterly and totally unprecedented.\n  Throughout our history, we have changed the Constitution only \noccasionally. Since 1791, we have amended the document an average of \nonly once every 12 years. We amended the constitution only four times \nduring the entire 19th century--that is three fewer amendments than the \nnew majority leadership wants to adopt in the next 2 years alone.\n  It is certainly not unusual for the winning party in an election in \nthis country to seek adoption of its legislative agenda. That is \ndemocracy and that is as it should be. What is unusual, Mr. President, \nabout the new leadership's plans is the desire to enact its agenda not \nby statute but into the permanent Constitution of this Nation, the \norganic law of our country.\n  These proposals are even more surprising, I might add, coming from \nsome who are self-styled conservatives who profess to believe in \ncautious, reasoned, and judicious change.\n  The Constitution is not a set of fraternity bylaws to be amended with \neach new pledge class. It should reflect not the popular winds of the \ntime, but the sacred principles of all time.\n  As a country, we have never supported governing by means of \nconstitutional amendment. Since the adoption of the U.S. Constitution, \n10,831 constitutional amendments have been proposed in the U.S. \nCongress, but only 17 of those amendments have ever been ratified, if \nyou exclude the Bill of Rights. That is fewer than one-quarter of 1 \npercent of all amendments ever proposed.\n  Why do I mention that? The procedural hurdles to ratification of \nconstitutional amendments are very, very hard for a very, very good \nreason. An amendment that may look perfectly reasonable today may prove \nto be unnecessary or even dangerous, not to mention silly, down the \nroad.\n  A few examples from history I think will make this point.\n  In 1808, one of my predecessors from Connecticut, Senator Hillhouse, \nproposed to limit the President's annual salary to $15,000 a year by \nwriting it into the Constitution of the United States. Now, I am \nhesitant about citing that example because it may enjoy some popular \nsupport today, given the reactions the people have to people serving in \npublic life. But Senator Hillhouse figured that surely this was a \ngenerous offer at the time.\n  In 1838, the Nation was scandalized when one Member of Congress \nkilled one of his colleagues during a duel. This led to the \nintroduction of a constitutional amendment to bar individuals \nimplicated in dueling from ever holding elective office by changing the \nConstitution.\n  In the latter half of the 19th century, a great concern over the \nabuse of patronage led to repeated amendments mandating the popular \nelection of postmasters and deputy postmasters in the country. Imagine \nwhat that would do to the political process today?\n  In the opening decades of the 20th century, there was increasing \nalarm over the number of divorces in the country that led Senator \nRansdell of Louisiana to offer a constitutional amendment to prohibit \ndivorce in the United States.\n  In 1919, a growing concern over the evils of drinking led to the 18th \namendment, prohibiting the sale or manufacture of alcoholic beverages \nin the United States. The amendment, as most will recall, was a \nfailure--prohibition was widely flouted. Congress's only choice was the \nunseemly one of adopting yet a new constitutional amendment to repeal \nthe previous one.\n  [[Page S3188]] My point, Mr. President, in mentioning these \namendments is not to ridicule those who offered them nor to question \ntheir motives at the time. In fact, many of these proposals were \nundoubtedly reasonable, or at least thought to be so, at the time they \nwere suggested. But, Mr. President, as I recite them, I think all would \nagree that they would not have stood the test of time.\n  Over time, I believe that a balanced budget amendment will fare no \nbetter.\n  I would like to take a few moments, if I could, and add a little \nhistorical perspective to our debate on balanced budgets.\n  Much has been said in the last few days and weeks about our current \nFederal deficit and debt problems. I would concur with my colleagues \nabout the importance of reducing our debt. It is clearly a drag on our \neconomy and a burden on all Americans.\n  I, however, strongly differ, Mr. President, with my colleagues in \ntheir interpretation of our current deficit problems as a recent \ndevelopment in our Nation's history.\n  This chart to my left, Mr. President, lays out the historical \nperspective, beginning in 1794 and moving up to 1994 of surpluses and \ndeficits as a percentage of our spending.\n  This chart reveals that there have been wide variations in spending \npatterns throughout our history. We have had surpluses as high as 102 \npercent of Federal spending in 1835--in this area--and deficits as \ngreat as 89 percent of Federal spending in 1862 during the Civil War--\nthis bottom line down here.\n  The chart also illustrates that our current difficulties are small \nrelative to deficits that our Nation has experienced in the past. When \nwe compare the high-water marks of past deficit spending with the worst \nof the Reagan era deficits, we find that the depth of our current \ndeficit cycle is much smaller.\n  That is the period from here, beginning at about 1959, and going to \nthe present, these smaller lines back and forth.\n  In 1983, at the height of our current deficit problems, the Federal \ndeficit was 26 percent of overall spending. It is now about 13 percent \nof overall spending. Let me quickly add, there is no question that \nthese rates are far too high, but they have been far worse--and we have \nrecovered.\n  We have run deficits in half of our last 200 years. Most of the major \nbumps and squiggles that you see on the chart are readily explainable. \nThe War of 1812, the panic of 1837, and the depression that followed--I \nhave already mentioned the Civil War, the bottom line here--World War \nI, over here, and World War II, as well, where deficits were incurred.\n  Without the so-called discipline of a balanced budget amendment, we \nwere able to get out of those difficult deficit cycles.\n  One huge deficit swing that is not reported on this chart is \nPresident Thomas Jefferson's 1803 decision to make the Louisiana \nPurchase.\n  Jefferson borrowed $15 million, an amount $4 million greater than the \nentire Federal budget for that year, to acquire the new territory.\n  Based on a letter he wrote, a number of my colleagues have cited \nJefferson as a supporter of a balanced budget amendment.\n  I think my colleague from Texas, Senator Gramm, is one who made \nspecific reference to it. I point out that Thomas Jefferson would have \nfound it a good bit more difficult to make this purchase if a vote on \nwaiving the Constitution to permit an unbalanced budget had been \nrequired in 1805. Today our colleague from Texas might be running for \nthe Presidency of Texas rather than the Presidency of the United \nStates.\n  The Louisiana Purchase does not show up on the chart because of an \naccounting distinction. The appropriation is not shown here because our \nchart excludes receipts from borrowing. If borrowing had been included, \nthe Louisiana Purchase would be twice as deep as the largest dip in the \nchart caused by the Civil War.\n  Jefferson knew that the Constitution did not explicitly grant \nauthority to purchase new land, and that concerned him. He considered a \nconstitutional amendment to permit such authority. But he realized, Mr. \nPresident, that the opportunity to buy the new land could be lost \nthrough a lengthy ratifying process. So despite his constitutional \nreservations, he sought congressional approval to add both vast new \nterritory and a staggering public debt to our young Nation.\n  Mr. President, the historical perspective reinforces, I think, a very \nimportant point. Balanced budgets have not been a natural part of our \nnational experience. Nor should we expect them to be.\n  Clearly, balanced budgets are desirable. I do not think there is any \ndebate about that point. But they are not our only goal. Providing \neconomic and military stability, raising living standards, promoting \nadequate savings and investment, and reacting repeatedly to unforeseen \nevents, are also critically important objectives.\n  It is unrealistic, in my view, to expect any great nation to achieve \nall of these goals in every given year. In America, we elect our \nrepresentatives to make difficult decisions and to balance competing \nneeds. If we amend our Constitution to require balanced budgets we \nelevate one goal above other equally important objectives. We \nfundamentally change our ability to respond to complex and changing \ncircumstances.\n  It is a law of physics, Mr. President, and of life, that every action \nhas a reaction. Some we can anticipate, others we cannot. One reaction \nwe can expect is that balancing our budget in economic recessions will \ndestabilize our economy and increase the volatility of the financial \nmarkets.\n  Laura Tyson, the President's Chief Economic Adviser, recently noted \nthat had a balanced budget requirement been in effect during the last \nrecession, it would have thrown 800,000 people in this country out of \nwork. Historically, deficit spending has functioned as an important \nfiscal tool to stabilize the economy and moderate fluctuations in the \nbusiness cycle.\n  When the economy is in recession, the Federal Government takes in \nless money. That is stating the obvious. A balanced budget requirement \nwould compel Congress to match declining revenues with increased taxes \nor spending cuts. In the process, Mr. President, it would force the \nCongress to renege on promises to provide a critical safety net to our \ncitizens just when it is needed the most, and it would impede our \nability to hasten recovery by providing a fiscal stimulus when it, too, \nwas needed most.\n  Changing the Constitution is not like adopting a simple statute that \ncan be modified or appealed in that Congress or succeeding Congresses. \nConstitutional amendments must be held to the highest possible \nstandard. Indeed, the language we insert into the Constitution will \nvery likely stay there as long as this Republic stands. Generation \nafter generation will live with the consequences of our constitutional \ndecisions.\n  Henry Clay said, 140 years ago:\n\n       The Constitution of the United States was made not merely \n     for the generation that then existed, but for posterity--\n     unlimited, undefined, endless, perpetual prosperity.\n\n  The key to the Constitution's ability to endure is its simplicity, \nMr. President. That is why making the Constitution too long and too \nspecific runs the risk of damaging the entire document. The Framers \nunderstood that danger when they wrote the Constitution two centuries \nago.\n  Edmund Randolph of Virginia was one of a handful of delegates to the \nConstitutional Convention charged with turning the general principles \nagreed upon into constitutional language. Before getting down to \ndrafting, Randolph briefly spelled out his philosophy of Constitution \nwriting:\n\n       In the draft of a fundamental constitution, two things \n     deserve attention: (1) To insert essential principles only, \n     lest the operations of Government should be clogged by \n     rendering those provisions permanent and unalterable, which \n     ought to be accommodated to times and events; and (2) to use \n     simple and precise language, and general propositions, \n     according to the example of the several constitutions of the \n     several States; for the construction of a constitution \n     necessarily differs from that of law.\n\n  While the U.S. Constitution has endured, many of our State \nconstitutions have come and gone. As the constitutional scholar Martin \nLandau has pointed out, there have been more than 200 State \nconstitutional conventions since 1789, as States have had to shelve \n[[Page S3189]] detailed Constitutions that became obsolete and overly \nrestrictive. As Landau writes:\n\n       State Constitutions, notoriously complicated, cluttered, \n     and rigid, have come and gone--tossed away as outmoded, \n     inelastic, and maladaptive instruments.\n\n  That is a fate, Mr. President, we do not want to visit on our \nnational Constitution. We must ensure that it remains a brief, lucid \nstatement of general principles, not a highly specific legislative \nvehicle.\n  I invite my colleagues to read the entire Constitution with all of \nits amendments and then immediately read this proposed amendment. Like \nme, I think you may find this to be a jarring exercise, moving from the \nsimple elegance of our existing Constitution to the arcane complexity \nof this proposed addition.\n  This balanced budget amendment has eight sections and 292 words in \nit. That is more words, Mr. President, than the first five amendments \nthat establish some of our most enduring and fundamental liberties: The \nfreedom of speech, the freedom of religion, the freedom of assembly, \nthe right to petition the Government, the right to bear arms, freedom \nfrom unreasonable search and seizure, and the right to a jury trial. \nThere are less words included in those five amendments than is proposed \nby this amendment.\n  Mr. President, our current deficits are too high. We all know that. \nThey need to be reduced. As a direct result of President Clinton's \nleadership, we have made significant progress on this problem. The \ndeficits are declining for 3 straight years in a row, the first time, I \nmight add, that that has happened since the Truman administration.\n  For the first time since the 1960's, the Federal Government is \ncollecting more in revenues than it is spending on programs. Our most \nrecent deficits are not due to overspending on Federal programs but \nrather to the payment of interest on the debt accumulated during the \n1980's. According to the Council of Economic Advisers, our budget would \nbe in balance by 1996 if it were not for required interest payments on \nthe debt run up from 1981 to 1992.\n  It is important, though, that we take a broad view of deficit \nspending and learn from our past history. I refer my colleagues again \nto this chart of 200 years of Federal spending. Throughout our entire \nhistory, we have experienced great peaks and valleys in Federal \nspending patterns. Over the last 40 or 50 years we have had relative \nstability. This amendment threatens to compromise our economic \nstability and to do great damage to our economy.\n  We ought not to look just at this most recent period and ignore the \nspending patterns throughout our history. And, we ought not to look at \nmost recent experience and deny 205 years of constitutional history in \nthe process. That would be a grave mistake.\n  Mr. President, we have a serious obligation to confront our fiscal \ndifficulties. We do not have the right to visit on the Constitution of \nthe United States a highly questionable solution to a contemporary \nproblem. The answer to our present-day frustrations should not be \nsought by cluttering up the perpetual life of our democracy. To do so, \nI believe, would be a decision that we will live to severely, severely \nregret.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this proposal when the vote occurs \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in very strong support of a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  I will begin by asking unanimous consent that this letter that was \nreleased today signed by 219 economists from throughout the country who \nhave endorsed the balanced budget amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Balanced Budget Amendment--An Open Letter To Congress, February, 1995\n\n       It is time to acknowledge that mere statutes that purport \n     to control federal spending or deficits have failed. It is \n     time to adopt constitutional control through a Balanced \n     Budget Amendment. In supporting such an amendment, Congress \n     can control its spending proclivities by setting up control \n     machinery external to its own internal operations, machinery \n     that will not be so easily neglected and abandoned.\n       Why do we need the Balanced Budget Amendment now, when no \n     such constitutional provision existed for two centuries? The \n     answer is clear. Up until recent decades, the principle that \n     government should balance its budget in peacetime was, \n     indeed, a part of our effective constitution, even if not \n     formally written down. Before the Keynesian-inspired shift in \n     thinking about fiscal matters, it was universally considered \n     immoral to incur debts, except in periods of emergency (wars \n     or major depressions). We have lost the moral sense of fiscal \n     responsibility that served to make formal constitutional \n     constraints unnecessary. We cannot legislate a change in \n     political morality; we can put formal constitutional \n     constraints into place.\n       The effects of the Balanced Budget Amendment would be both \n     real and symbolic. Elected politicians would be required to \n     make fiscal choices within meaningfully-constructed \n     boundaries; they would be required to weigh predicted \n     benefits against predicted tax costs. They would be forced to \n     behave ``responsibly,'' as this word is understood by the \n     citizenry, and knowledge of this fact would do much to \n     restore the confidence of citizens in governmental processes.\n       It is important to recognize that the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment imposes procedural constraints on the making of \n     budgetary choices. It does not take away the power of the \n     Congress to spend or tax. The amendment requires only that \n     the Congress and the Executive spend no more than what they \n     collect in taxes. In its simplest terms, such an amendment \n     amounts to little more than ``honesty in budgeting.''\n       Of course, we always pay for what we spend through \n     government, as anywhere else. But those who pay for the \n     government spending that is financed by borrowing are \n     taxpayers in future years, those who must pay taxes to meet \n     the ever-mounting interest obligations that are already far \n     too large an item in the federal budget. The immorality of \n     the intergenerational transfer that deficit financing \n     represents cries out the correction.\n       Some opponents of the Balanced Budget Amendment argue that \n     the interest burden should be measured in terms of percentage \n     of national product, and, so long as this ratio does not \n     increase, all is well. This argument is totally untenable \n     because it ignores the effects of both inflation and real \n     economic growth. So long as government debt is denominated in \n     dollars, sufficiently rapid inflation can, for a short \n     period, reduce the interest burden substantially, in terms of \n     the ratio to product. But surely default by way of inflation \n     is the worst of all possible ways of dealing with the fiscal \n     crisis that the deficit regime represents.\n       Opponents also often suggest that Congress and the \n     Executive must maintain the budgetary flexibility to respond \n     to emergency needs for expanding rates of spending. This \n     prospect is fully recognized, and the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment includes a provision that allows for approval of \n     debt or deficits by a three-fifths vote of those elected to \n     each house of Congress.\n       When all is said and done, there is no rational argument \n     against the Balanced Budget Amendment. Simple observation of \n     the fiscal record of recent years tells us that the \n     procedures through which fiscal choices are made are not \n     working. The problem is not one that involves the wrong \n     political leaders or the wrong parties. The problem is one \n     where those whom we elect are required to function under the \n     wrong set of rules, the wrong procedures. It is high time to \n     get our fiscal house in order.\n       We can only imagine the increase in investor and business \n     confidence, both domestic and foreign, that enactment of a \n     Balanced Budget Amendment would produce. Perhaps even more \n     importantly, we could all regain confidence in ourselves, as \n     a free people under responsible constitutional government.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this particular letter was solicited by \nthe American Legislative Exchange Council and I believe, when read, \nwill indicate the strong support these economists have for the balanced \nbudget amendment and why they feel it is necessary.\n  I agree with the statement of the Senator from Connecticut that \ntomorrow will be a very historic day. He and I come down on different \nsides of this issue. Many of his comments and many of the comments that \nhave been made in the last 5 weeks on this floor against the balanced \nbudget amendment may seem to make some sense. And quite frankly, I do \nnot believe anyone in this Chamber is happy about the fact that at this \npoint in our history, we have come to the point where we have to pass, \nor at least many of us believe we have to pass, a balanced budget \namendment.\n  Never before have we been this close to passing a balanced budget \namendment and, quite candidly, I am not sure if we do not pass it \ntomorrow we will ever really have a good opportunity to do it again. \nFor the balanced budget \n[[Page S3190]] amendment to pass, the time is now. If we cannot pass a \nbalanced budget amendment in the current political climate in this \ncountry--after having seen what happened in 1992 when everyone in this \ncountry voted for change in frustration and then in 1994 where people \nagain voted for change, where today 80 percent of the American people \nwant a balanced budget amendment--if we cannot pass it today, I am not \nsure that we ever can.\n  Last November, the American people voted for change. For 25 \nconsecutive years, Congress has failed to balance the budget. The last \ntime we balanced a budget in this country I was a senior in high \nschool, 25 years ago. Congress has amassed a $4.7 trillion national \ndebt that our children and our grandchildren and our great \ngrandchildren are going to have to deal with. That, Mr. President, is \nwhat the American people voted to change in 1994.\n  For decades, they have heard promises from Congress. The American \npeople, people that I talk to, are tired of promises. They want action. \nThey are tired of words. They want a balanced budget and they want a \nbalanced budget amendment. They know that Congress is simply incapable \nof balancing the budget unless it is forced to balance the budget. \nEighty percent of the American people support the balanced budget \namendment because they realize that unless we change the budget process \nin a fundamental way, we are not going to change the result of the \nbudget process. Let us make no mistake about this, only a \nconstitutional amendment can create this fundamental change.\n  As long ago as 1921, Congress was trying to change the budget process \nby statute. This strategy clearly has not worked. At least six \ndifferent times, maybe more, this Congress has passed statutory \nbalanced budget requirements, all to no avail. History proves that \nCongress cannot balance the budget by statute, and it has been true no \nmatter which party was in power. When we had a Republican President, we \nhad a deficit. When we had a Democrat President, we have had a deficit. \nWhen we had a Democrat Senate, we had a deficit and, yes, even with a \nRepublican Senate, we have had a deficit, too.\n  There is no better evidence of the bankruptcy of this statutory \napproach than the current budget that was sent to Capitol Hill by the \nPresident. The President's budget proposes deficits in the neighborhood \nof $200 billion, but even more shocking, there really is no serious \nattempt to balance the budget in what people on Capitol Hill refer to \nas the outyears and what people away from the beltway refer to as the \nfuture.\n  As far, Mr. President, as the eye can see with the President's budget \nproposals, we have nothing but red ink. This budget proposal proves \nbeyond a shadow of a doubt that America's fiscal policy is \nfundamentally misguided. Clearly, we need to change course, and if we \ndo not change course, if the balanced budget amendment is voted down, \nthe result will be a bleak future, indeed, for the next generation of \nAmericans.\n  We are already paying over $235 billion--$235 billion--a year in \ninterest on the national debt. That is eight times what we currently \ninvest in education. It is 50 times what we invest in job training \nprograms. Every year we add to this mountain of debt, every year we are \ncommitting more of tomorrow's resources, our children's resources, to \npay for Congress' failures today.\n  By the year 2003, just 8 years from now, spending on entitlements and \ninterest alone will exceed 70 percent of the whole Federal budget. Take \nout defense and you leave just 15 percent of the budget for all the \ndiscretionary spending--all the discretionary spending--on our domestic \nneeds; less than 15 percent cumulative total for education, for job \ntraining, for Women, Infants and Children Program, and for all the \nother programs that help the American people at home; just 15 percent \nof the budget for all these programs combined.\n  We have heard a lot of talk on the floor about how a balanced budget \namendment will stop us from being able to help the neediest in society, \nhow a balanced budget amendment will unduly penalize our children, and \nhow it will make it very, very difficult for us to invest in our \nfuture. I believe that just the opposite is true; that unless we pass a \nbalanced budget amendment, future Congresses, future generations will \nhave no money left to invest in our young people.\n  Mr. President, following up on these figures, if you go out to the \nyear 2012, just 17 years from today, there will be nothing left in the \nbudget for these social needs--zero, no money at all for our children. \nEvery last red cent in the Federal budget will go to entitlements and \ninterest payments.\n  The year 2012 has special significance for my wife and myself, \nbecause just a year before that, our grandson, Albert, will graduate \nfrom high school. In the year 2012, our daughter, Anna, should be in \nher first year of college. If we do not act today, Albert, Anna, and \nother children will pay a severe human cost.\n Tomorrow we face a decision about their future, and it is of historic \nsignificance. Let us prove by our vote tomorrow that we can put \npartisanship aside and that we can for once act together in the long-\nterm best interest of our country and of our children.\n\n  Mr. President, let us just admit that well-intentioned people of both \nparties, of both parties, have failed to enact a responsible Federal \nbudget. Therefore, let us do what is necessary to fix the problem. If \nwe do not do it today, it may never happen. And future Americans will \nask why, why, why the Congress, faced with a clear and well informed \nmandate from the American people, chose once again to defend a fiscal \nprocess that had already created a debt of nearly $5 trillion.\n  Some people would have us believe that this constitutional amendment \nis a quick fix; that it will not solve the real problems of fiscal \npolicy, but when I go home to Ohio that is not what I hear. That is not \nwhat I hear from people back home. This is not something the people of \nOhio want to do any more than we do. It is something, however, that \nthey are convinced we have to do as a last resort.\n  In the short term, passing the balanced budget amendment is no quick \nfix. It will create a monumental challenge for this very Congress \nbecause for the first time in a generation we will not be permitted to \ntake unlimited spending demands and just tack them on to the deficit. \nFuture Congresses will have to deliberate, will have to make the best \nchoices they can and will have to be judged by the American people on \nthe results that are produced.\n  Over the short term this will not be pleasant, but over the long term \nthis constitutional amendment is the greatest gift we can make to \nfuture generations. Last week, a columnist in the Wall Street Journal \nwarned Senators that their grandchildren will remember the votes they \ncast on this amendment. I believe the author of that article was \ncorrect. That is why I am proud to vote yes on this very historic \nmeasure. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the balanced budget \namendment.\n  We will have talked about it tomorrow for 30 days. We talked about \nthe pros and cons. We have debated and discussed it. Actually, I \nsuspect it is fair to say that most everything that can be said has \nbeen said. I suppose the thing that has not happened is not everybody \nsaid it yet, and that seems to be why we go on as we do. It is not a \nnew topic. It is not as if this issue just came up. It has been talked \nabout for years. As a matter of fact, it has been voted on in the last \nseveral years.\n  Mr. President, you and I came from the House. We talked about it last \nyear. We voted on it last year. It was voted on here. So it is not a \nnew topic.\n  Interestingly enough, everyone who rises says, yes, I want to balance \nthe budget; of course, we need to balance the budget. But we have been \n26 years and have not balanced the budget. They rise and say, well, but \nwe do not need an artificial discipline to do that; we just simply need \nto do it.\n  It is true. We have not done it. We have not done it for 26 years.\n  Many who oppose it have been here for a very long time, and I am not \ncritical of that. But it has not happened. Many who oppose it have been \nin very important positions dealing with the budget. They have not \nbalanced it. And you can argue about the reasons why. You can argue \nthat it is difficult to have an amendment in the Constitution. But the \nfact is if you want to change the way things happen you \n[[Page S3191]] have to change the process. You cannot continue to do \nthings the same way you have been doing them for 26 years and expect \nsome kind of different result.\n  I think the people of this country expect the decision. I am \ndelighted that we are coming to a decision tomorrow. I think we have \nbeen too long.\n  I respect the notion that the Senate is here to deliberate, to take \nlonger, I suspect, than the House typically takes. Nevertheless, there \ncomes a time when the question needs to be brought to a decision, and \nthat is what voting is for and we are going to do that.\n  I have a hunch that many of the things we have talked about have \nreally been sort of a reason, a justification for voting no when in \nfact the big difference is a philosophical difference. It seems to me \nthere is a great deal more involved here. As important as the financial \naspect is, as important as the morality of being fiscally responsible \nis, there is also a broader question. That question is what kind of a \nFederal Government do you see us having? What do you see as the role of \nthe Federal Government? Do you see it as an ever-increasing bureaucracy \nthat grows continuously year after year?\n  If you take a look at a chart--I did not bring a chart--of spending, \nspending has continued to go up. Last year and even this year, in this \nbudget, in my hometown paper it said administration cuts. It leads you \nto believe there is less spending than the year before. Not so. \nSpending has gone up. Spending is going up 5.5 percent. Spending has \ngone up every year. Spending will go up under the budgets that are \nbeing talked about in the House. So spending continues to go up.\n  There is a philosophical difference, however, as to whether you see \nthe Government as ever growing or whether you see it as being limited, \nwhether there ought to be a transfer or movement toward emphasizing \nState and local governments more, the private sector more, more \npersonal responsibility, or do we continue to do more and more in the \nFederal Government. That is part of what we are talking about here--not \nonly the money but also the role of the Federal Government.\n  We have heard a great deal just today about how there are exceptions, \nthere are times when things need to be done, and that is, indeed, true. \nIt also in the budget amendment allows for exceptions. It allows for \nchanges. It does take a majority, or a supermajority to do it. But \nthere is no reason why it cannot be done if it is justifiable and, \nindeed, it can be.\n  People and the legislatures of this country I think deserve an \nopportunity to vote on a constitutional amendment, if it goes there, \nand it should. We have talked about the Founding Fathers having not put \nit into the Constitution, but I recall Thomas Jefferson said if there \nwas one change he could make, it would be to limit overspending.\n  I had the honor the other day to read George Washington's Farewell \nAddress again, and he spoke to it. Let me quote.\n\n       As a very important source of strength and security, \n     cherish public credit. One method of preserving it is to use \n     it as sparingly as possible, avoiding occasions of expense by \n     cultivating peace, but remembering, also, that timely \n     disbursements, to prepare for danger, frequently prevent much \n     greater disbursements to repel it.\n\n  And then he said:\n\n       Avoiding likewise the accumulation of debt, not only by \n     shunning occasions of expense, but by vigorous exertions, in \n     time of peace, to discharge the debts. . . .\n\n  We have not done that. And that is what this is all about. This \nprovides the discipline to make the tough decisions that we have to \nmake.\n  So there are reasons to do it. It is morally and fiscally \nresponsible. Ask anyone should we balance the budget, should we spend \nmore than we take in on a consistent, 26-year basis? The answer is no, \nof course not.\n  Ask anyone, should we have to balance the budget? The answer is yes, \nof course, we should. We hear it every day: I am for a balanced budget. \nWe do not do it. There is no reason to expect that we will unless we \nchange the process. Is the current situation out of control? Of course, \nit is.\n  Do the States do it? Of course, they do. I come from a legislature in \nwhich the Constitution provides for a balanced budget. We do it. We \nlive with it. It works. And we can deal with it.\n  So, tomorrow we vote, and I am delighted for that. I think it will be \na very important vote. I think it will be a crucial vote. I think it is \na vote that helps not only to shape the future in terms of spending but \nto shape the future in terms of the kind of Government and the \nextensiveness of Government that we have. If there was one thing that \nwas clear from this November's election, at least the people whom I \nrepresent said we have too much Government and it costs too much. We \nhave too much Government and it costs too much. That is what this vote \nis about, doing something about that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, there is no greater problem facing the \ncountry today than our continued failure to balance the Federal budget. \nUnfortunately, this is not a new phenomenon, as has been pointed out \nhere on the floor by earlier speakers. Over the past 33 years, we have \nbalanced the budget once and that was a quarter of a century ago in \n1969. Had the Social Security program not generated a surplus, we would \nnot have balanced the budget in that year either. Furthermore, the \nforecast put out by the Congressional Budget Office and the \nadministration show that absent dramatic action on our part, these \ndeficits are not going to end any time soon. It is not that we are just \non the edge of ending the deficits through normal action, absent this \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  For example, CBO predicts that the deficit in the year 2005, 10 years \nfrom now, could be as high as $421 billion. The President's budget, \nwhich was released early this month, forecasts Federal deficits of \napproximately $200 billion for each of the next 5 years. So in the next \n5 years the President himself predicts we are going to have $200 \nbillion of deficits. The Congressional Budget Office says 10 years from \nnow those $200 billion deficits are going to rise to $421 billion a \nyear.\n  Even worse than this dire prediction of what is going to happen is \nthat the President has taken little action to address this problem. The \n$81 billion of deficit reduction in the President's plan is really \nrelatively minor when it is realized that this $81 billion of deficit \nreduction occurs over 5 years, and, $60 billion of those savings come \nfrom keeping spending at the current level, not from making any cuts; \njust from keeping it where it is.\n  Why is it bad that the Federal Government routinely spends more than \nit takes in? We are told in soothing tones by the administration that \nit is very important to note that the deficits for each year in the \nfuture are going to be a lower percentage of the gross domestic \nproduct. That is somehow meant to be grand news. What the \nadministration tells us is do not worry, that for each of the future \nyears the deficits are going to be a smaller part, an ever decreasing \npart of the Federal budget each year. Somehow that is meant to be good \nnews, even though the dollar amounts of the deficits constantly grow.\n  The problem is that every year we run a deficit we have to borrow to \nfund the shortfall. From the beginning of our country until today, we \nhave incurred a debt--I believe the Senator from Ohio touched on this--\nwe have incurred a debt of about $5 trillion with the overwhelming \nportion of that accumulated over the past 15 years. The cost of \nservicing that debt, the gross interest, will total $339 billion in \n1995. In 1995, just to pay the gross interest on the debt is $339 \nbillion. This is the second largest expenditure in the Federal budget \nafter Social Security. To put this number in perspective, our gross \ninterest expense for 1994, this $339 billion, is more than the entire \nbudget of the country 20 years ago. Just imagine if we were not \nspending that $339 billion, what we could do to improve our education, \nor to spend some of that money--not all of it but some of it--to help \nour education, help our health care system, or to bolster our efforts \nto fight crime.\n  Aside from diverting resources that could be used for much better \npurposes, the deficit also puts a tremendous strain on our national \neconomy. The most notable effect of this is on our interest rates. Alan \nGreenspan, who is \n[[Page S3192]] Chairman of the Federal Reserve, recently testified \nbefore the Finance Committee. This is what he said:\n\n       Investors here and abroad are exacting from issuers of \n     dollar-denominated debt an extra inflation risk premium that \n     reflects not their estimate of the most likely rate of price \n     level increase over the life of the obligation, but the \n     possibility it could prove to be significantly greater.\n\n  Let us translate that into English we all can understand. What Mr. \nGreenspan was talking about was a risk premium. What is a risk premium? \nA risk premium is the extra amount that anyone who issues debt, anyone \nwho issues a long-term bond, must pay in interest because the buyers of \nthat bond can predict with some measure of surety what the rates will \nbe in the future but they have to add to it a factor, what Mr. \nGreenspan called the risk premium, because the country is running such \nlarge deficits that the fear of inflation is always there; the fear \nthat inflation will come, that the Government will print money in order \nto get rid of this deficit. Thus this risk premium is added to any \nissuance--Ford Motor Co. or the U.S. Government--anybody who issues \nbonds that might last, for example, 20 years. If the buyer of that bond \nwere assured that this country was on a process of balancing its \nbudget, then he would not seek that risk premium and the bonds could be \nissued at a lower interest rate. Thus these artificially high interest \nrates affect all Americans. Families pay a risk premium when they \nborrow money for a home or when they borrow money for a new car or to \nfinance their children's education.\n  The Federal deficit also has a negative effect on future economic \ngrowth. Our potential to expand the economy in the United States is \ndirectly linked to the amount we invest in physical and human capital. \nWhat are we talking about, physical or human capital? We are talking \nabout new machinery or we are talking about training the work force, \nbringing its skills up to date. We are talking about providing a \nfoundation for increasing our output of goods and services. With this \nhigher productivity comes a higher standard of living in our country. \nTo achieve this, however, we must have a pool of national savings from \nwhich the investment can be made.\n  Unfortunately, our national savings rate has declined dramatically \nover the last decade, partly because the Federal Government has engaged \nin what is known as dissaving. In other words, it is not saving money, \nit is borrowing money through this deficit spending. The Federal \nGovernment's reliance on borrowing to pay its bills crowds out the \nprivate sector. The Federal Government comes in, has to borrow money--\nobviously there is not money left to lend at a low rate to you and me \nand businesses and others who want to borrow.\n  The worst consequence of this fiscal irresponsibility is that we are \njeopardizing the economic futures of our children and grandchildren. We \nare living beyond our means and we are passing the bill to these future \ngenerations.\n  Recently I ran across a paper which discussed the idea of \ngenerational accounting. What does this mean? It is the process of \nmeasuring how Government policies affect the distribution of income and \nwealth among different generations. To make this comparison, the \nauthors calculated the lifetime net tax rates. My generation--I was \nborn in the 1920's--is facing a net tax rate over our lifetimes of 26 \npercent. Of everything we earn, 26 percent will go for taxes. For \nsomebody who is born in 1991, the lifetime net tax rate is not 26 \npercent, it is 34 percent. That is not so bad, you say--34 percent. I \ncan handle that, perhaps.\n  But according to this analysis, if we do not take action to improve \nthe Federal domestic situation, future generations, generations born, \ngrandchildren born, children born, individuals born, starting in 1995, \n1996, 1997 will face lifetime tax rates not of 26 percent, not of 34 \npercent, but of 70 percent. In other words, future generations can look \nforward to handing over 70 cents of every dollar earned to the \nGovernment if we do not reverse our course.\n  For the past few years the administration has also included a \ngenerational analysis in its budget documents. Unfortunately, the \nPresident chose to delete that section from this year's budget. But the \nfigures were similar to the ones I just pointed out. Why will future \ngenerations face such a daunting tax bill? Consider the obligations we \nhave levied upon them. The Social Security program has been generating \nsurpluses.\n  The surpluses will turn. They will no longer start, will end, and \npretty soon the program will not be bringing in surpluses. That is in \nthe year 2013. That leaves workers in the middle of the next century \nwith a hefty bill to pay to provide retirement benefits for those who \nare retiring today. On top of that, we have incurred this $5 trillion \nin debt, which I mentioned before. That is likely to increase by $750 \nbillion even with the passage of this balanced budget amendment. \nObviously, at some point, all of this has to be repaid.\n  What exactly does the balanced budget do? Very simply, it prohibits \nFederal outlays from exceeding Federal receipts unless a three-fifths \nmajority of both Houses of Congress approves a specific deficit. In \nother words, it says that Congress can only spend what it is willing to \ncollect in taxes, unless Congress determines a specific reason for and \na legitimate reason for running a deficit. This could happen if there \nis a recession, if there is a natural disaster. Absent those \nsituations, the country has to run a balanced budget.\n  This amendment will make fiscal responsibility the norm rather than \nthe exception. As has been said, the Federal Government has run a \ndeficit for 25 straight years. There have been Republican Presidents. \nThere have been Democratic Presidents. There have been Republican \nSenators. There have been Democratic Senators. Neither body is free \nfrom blame. The truth is there has not been the will to make the tough \ndecisions to balance the budget.\n  I listen to these people say there is no need to have this, that all \nwe have to do is show some courage. But the truth of the matter is, we \nhave not shown that courage. So we have to go to this artificial \nprocedure, and the Senator from Connecticut says it has more words than \nthe first five amendments. So what? What does that prove?\n  The amendment before us today demands the same fiscal responsibility \nfrom the President that it establishes for Congress. The administration \nhas to submit a balanced budget.\n  I am grateful that the sponsors have not sought to include a three-\nfifths majority requirement for raising revenue. That was discussed. \nYou have to have 60 votes to increase taxes. That was rejected by the \nHouse, and rightfully so. That provision would be disastrous for this \ncountry because it would significantly hamper our ability to govern. \nFacing a deficit, Congress would in all likelihood be forced to cut \nspending rather than to raise revenue because the latter--to raise \nrevenue--requires 60 votes.\n  I support spending cuts over tax increases but feel it would be \nunwise to tilt the playing field against raising revenue. In other \nwords, you need 60 votes to increase taxes but you only need 51 votes \nto cut spending. I would not support this amendment if it had the \nthree-fifths majority for raising revenue. But fortunately, it is not \nin there.\n  The amendment includes a process whereby the requirements can be \nwaived by a simple majority for any year in which the country is in war \nor when the United States is engaged in a military conflict. I think \nthese are legitimate circumstances.\n  In section 7 of the amendment, it states that the total receipts, all \nreceipts, of the U.S. Government except those derived from borrowing \nand total outlays should include outlays for the U.S. Government except \nthose for the repayment of debt principal. What this means is that \nevery dollar that comes in to the Treasury and every dollar that goes \nout of the Treasury will be counted in determining whether the budget \nis balanced.\n  Again, this makes sense. This is the way we run our families. We \ncount the dollars that come in and the dollars that go out, except for \nborrowing, obviously.\n  Much of the efforts to derail this resolution has centered on \nexcluding certain programs from the balanced budget amendment. This all \nstarted in the Judiciary Committee when an effort was made to exclude \nSocial Security. I find this inconceivable. Why would we adopt as part \nof the Constitution an exclusion for Social Security or any \n[[Page S3193]] other aspect of the Federal budget? I am for protecting \nthe fiscal soundness of the Social Security system. But it is absurd to \nexempt a program that represents 29 percent of all Federal receipts and \n22 percent of all outlays. A big chunk of the budget would be \ndisregarded in all of this process, if that had been adopted. Thank \ngoodness, it was rejected.\n  Exempting Social Security receipts would provide a perverse incentive \nfor future Congresses to shift Social Security revenues to the general \nfund. This should be very attractive since the program currently \ncollects more in revenue than it pays out in benefits. But this would \nundermine the actuarial balance of the Social Security trust fund, and \nwould certainly require draconian changes in the future in order to \nstave off bankruptcy when the baby boomers retire.\n  Critics of the balanced budget amendment have argued that it is a \nsham, that it avoids, as I mentioned previously, the tough choices \nrequired to balance the budget. I disagree. What this represents is the \nfirst and most important step in a long and difficult journey to fiscal \nresponsibility. It symbolizes the tide has finally changed; we are \ncommitted to living within our means, and we are willing to embody that \nprinciple in the basic document of the Nation, on which the foundation \nof all our Government rests; namely, the Constitution.\n  Other fiscal disciplines we have enacted, while they are important--\nand I voted for every single one them--have not done the job. The \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit control laws, the firewalls, the \ndiscretionary spending caps, the pay-as-you-go rules--all of these we \nhave tried. As I say, I voted for every single one of them, and have \nsupported them when they have attempted to be amended. But they failed \nto break the attractive lure of deficit spending.\n  Opponents have also argued we should not pass a balanced budget \namendment until the supporters of it outline specifically how we reach \nthat goal. This is nonsense, in my judgment. It is like a doctor saying \nyou have to lose 40 pounds. ``I am not going to lose 40 pounds until \nyou tell me specifically how I am going to do it.'' Well, the objective \nis, if you want to keep your health, you had better lose that 40 \npounds. There are a variety of ways you can do it. You can work those \nout yourself, as long as you get there, to lose the 40 pounds. You can \ngo on a diet. You can eat less. You can go through health plans. You \ncan exercise more. You can try different approaches. But the end result \nis you have to get there. That is what we have said.\n  The so-called right-to-know amendment to the resolution before us \nreally is a smokescreen thrown up by those who had no intention of \nsupporting this proposal, whether or not we had outlined the specifics \nas to how we are going to get there. The fact is, there is no agreement \nupon the path to reach a balanced budget. The path that I would \nsubscribe to is likely different from the path that others would \nsubscribe to. Any plan will be the product of numerous compromises and \nthe give and take of a normal political process. All that is going to \ntake place once the requirement is established.\n  To those who do not support the resolution before us, the question \nis: What would you do? How would you get there? Are you content with \nthe current situation where the annual deficits exceed $200 billion, \nand in the foreseeable future going up greater than that? Ten years \nfrom now, it will be $451 billion, as I said. Do people believe we can \nput this problem off for another day; that somehow it is going to get \neasier? Do you believe we are improving our children's future by \ndropping this massive debt in their laps? Every previous effort to \nbalance the budget without an amendment to the Constitution has been a \nfailure, as I mentioned. Why has that been the case? The answer is \nsimple. Once the targets become too difficult to meet, Congress changes \nthe law or budgets.\n  This resolution makes it difficult for us to avoid our \nresponsibilities. The task is monumental, but the consequences for our \nfailure are far worse. If this amendment is defeated, the ones who will \nbe hurt the most are future generations of this country.\n  So for our children's and our grandchildren's sake, and for those of \nfuture generations, I fervently hope that this balanced budget \namendment is approved here, and approved in the States likewise.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I do not think I have \nseen a time in my life when we have approached a crossroads where the \ndecision could be clearer, especially when we have people all over this \ncountry at all levels of government--from the county level, the city \nlevel, the State level--reassessing the primary role of government. \nWhat is the mission of government? What is the mission of a city \ngovernment, of a county government, or of the government that most of--\nand, of course, the legislatures that are in session across our Nation \ntoday\n reassessing the role and what their missions really are? And, yes, we \nare going through that here in this town, the role of the Federal \nGovernment. There will be some who will simplify things and say that \nthe role of the Federal Government is simply to deliver my mail and \nprotect my shores. Other than that, that is about as much as I need out \nof Washington, DC. But we know it goes a little further than that. \nAnybody that has any degree of responsibility understands there is more \nto it than that. Nonetheless, the elections of November 8, as bad as \nsomeone would like to admit, did tell us to sit down and rethink just \nexactly what the role and mission of the Federal Government really are.\n\n  I can honestly say that this issue has really been talked about and \nstudied for the last 4 weeks, completely aired on all ramifications of \nit, and that is the way the Senate is supposed to work. I could not \nagree more with my friend from West Virginia, who probably has the \nstrongest sense of the duty and the responsibility of this body. I \nthink we on this side of the aisle have approached it the same way. \nThere has been no real serious move to cut off debate, as we want to \nhear all sides of this story, because we are talking about a subject \nthat has very serious ramifications from this town, to the White House, \nto the courthouse. But we must take stock, and it is what I believe \nwould put America back onto the road of steady economic growth and \nstability.\n  After years of talking about balancing the budget, instead of just \ntinkering around the edges of the deficit, it is time now to take \naction. It will impose a discipline on the budget process, and it will \nimpose a discipline on this Congress. Past efforts to balance the \nbudget have just been able just maybe, at times, to put dents in the \ndeficit, but no dent at all in the national debt that keeps climbing. \nWe hear two words being interchanged a lot in our news accounts--debt \nand deficit. They say, if you cut the deficit, you are cutting the \ndebt. Well, basically you are only cutting the degree to which debt is \naccumulated. We deficit spend and we create or accumulate debt.\n  So this will put more than a dent in it, we hope. This measure would \nactually put some teeth into the efforts to balance the budget. In \nother words, we might turn the old saying around and say the bite will \nbe worse than the bark. So on this issue the bottom line is one of \nresponsibility--responsibility to every citizen in our country and \nfuture generations and to economic prosperity. It is time that Congress \nlives up to its future obligations and, of course, take responsibility \nfor our actions. We have to ask the American people to help us. This is \na crisis. It is as much a crisis to our economic freedom as it is if we \nwere in war and our political freedoms were at stake.\n  I am being told by the citizens of Montana, yes, we are willing to \nfight this with you. We cannot do it alone here in this body or in the \nother body, the House of Representatives, or in this Government, unless \nwe get support and cooperation from every citizen across this great \nland. They understand what is at stake. They understand that it takes \nsacrifice. They understand in their daily dealings with everybody else \nin the business world, or the paternal world, that they have some \nobligation to their communities, their churches, their schools, and \ntheir \n[[Page S3194]] friends, and they are willing to go down the road \nshoulder to shoulder and help us get this done. It is obligations, and \nnot only ours here, but also for every man, woman, and child that lives \nin this great country. We have been living on the credit card for quite \na while. Now is the time to put away those credit cards, get serious \nabout paying off the overdue account, the incessant spending; and \nborrowing, of course, must cease. The debt of more than $4.7 trillion \nis going to continue to climb, unless we get America's help--help to \nkeep this Government from this business of spend and borrow, spend and \nborrow.\n  There have been a couple of packages that have come up that had tax \nhikes in them in the last 5 years that I can remember. I voted against \neach one of those because not only inside that was taxes, new taxes \nimposed on this country in one way or the other; some called it user \nfees, and some were called something else. Nonetheless, it was an \nincrease in taxes because there was no cutting on the other side.\n  I have heard a lot of folks stand on this floor and be critical of \nthe Reagan years when we, yes, cut taxes, but we did not stop our \nspending. There is enough blame in that to go around for everybody. I \nwas not here then.\n  So we will break the cycle of continued deficit spending at the risk \nof our long-term economic security. We cannot and must not ruin our \nhealth now for short-term gains. So the reckless spending must come \nfirst and be put under control. For as long as I have been here, I have \nbeen concerned with spending. It is difficult to challenge the balance \nof the needs of our country with revenues we do not have without \nresorting sometimes to more taxes or higher debt. We had an obligation \nand we had to fulfill that obligation. Now we must find a way to \nbalance obligation with responsibility.\n  We have heard the arguments here against the balanced budget \namendment. The arguments show more than anything else how this is not a \ngimmick. There are those we have heard say this is a political gimmick \nand that we are posturing with the American people. But I tell the \nAmerican people that nothing could be further from the truth. Forty-\nseven other States, including my State of Montana, already maintain a \nbalanced budget. I was a Yellowstone County commissioner, the largest \ncounty in Montana. We were forced to live within that budget. We had a \nspecial initiative called 105 that we could not raise property taxes in \norder to provide the needs and services in a county called I-105.\n  We dealt with that. We also had, in the middle of the 1980's, a \ndeclining tax base. Agricultural land went in the tank. We maintained \nthat. We were forced to balance the budget, so we made some of those \nvery, very, very tough decisions.\n  And those people who were in charge of the different departments in \nthe county came in and said, ``OK, we can do it with this, if there are \npromises for later.'' But we could not promise anything later, so we \nlived within that budget.\n  I tried to keep my own family on a budget and every time we got off \nof it, we paid for it. We paid for it every time.\n  So it is time the Federal Government becomes an institution which has \nto take care of its checkbook, too. The challenge lies with all of us. \nThe challenge is the spending priorities for our Nation. It will force \nus to set priorities to see what this mission is all about, this goal \nor role of Government.\n  The Federal Government consumes 23 percent of the GDP now. The \ncurrent projected growth rate of spending at 2 percent a year is a lot \nfaster, 2 percent faster, than our economy. So what do you do? You pull \nup your belt and the reins at the same time.\n  If seems funny to me that we are reluctant to set priorities. What is \nreally important to us as a community? Would it surprise you that there \nare actually organizations that are not Government organizations that \nare willing to assume the responsibility of taking care of those things \nthat add to the quality of life of our own neighborhoods and much our \nown communities? Would it surprise you that service clubs and many \norganizations and our churches and how many fraternal organizations are \nwilling to take on a little bit of responsibility for the quality of \nlife of all the citizens that live in that community? They are not \nasking the Government for anything. They say, ``Just stand back. Let us \ntake care of ourselves.''\n  You know, we used to do that. We used to build great homes. We used \nto build facilities to take care of our own, so to speak. What happened \nto that? Did Big Brother step in and say, ``We can do it better,'' and \nso they loosened the ties that we had in our communities?\n  They worked pretty good for a long time; built a great and free \nnation. No other nation is as free economically, politically, or even \nin private rights as this country is. No other country can feed and \nclothe itself as well as this country can. No other country has a food \nproduction and processing and distribution system like this country \nhas.\n  Government did not build it. Americans built it, because of not only \na sense of duty but also a sense of feeding and clothing ourselves in \nthis great society.\n  So there is plenty of room to cut in the $1.6 trillion budget. I am \nsure that we can cut out a little waste and look at the priorities that \nwe are going to have to set in order to keep this society on an even \nkeel.\n  Balancing the budget is going to take some hard decisions, some \npolitical, very distasteful decisions, but the reward will be a \nbalanced budget and a more prosperous America. And the real growth of \nAmerica will start at the grassroots.\n  It may surprise more of our friends that the new wealth created by \nany society, the new wealth starts with the soil. It is renewable. It \ncomes every year. And, God willing, it will feed and clothe us forever. \nAs we look at that, then we must get our house in order here.\n  So I beg my colleagues, I implore them, to pass this balanced budget \namendment. There will not be a more important vote that you will cast \nfor responsibility--and, yes, an obligation to the American people--\nthan this vote you will cast this week on the balanced budget \namendment.\n  I want to congratulate my friend from Illinois, Paul Simon, who is on \nthe floor, for the work he has done with this. His roots are in \nsouthern Illinois, where traditions of communities and families go \ndeep, a great sense and a great tide of the land, middle America, that \nunderstands what communities are all about. They know it takes money to \nprovide Government services. They also know it takes responsibility and \na little bit of reality to make it work here in America.\n  This is an important vote. It is an important vote for all of us who \ncall ourselves Americans.\n  I know that there are those who would make the argument that we are \ntinkering around with the Constitution. But I think it was even \nJefferson who feared the day when we could learn to borrow money \nagainst future collections on taxes.\n  Even George Washington--and the other day, Senator Craig Thomas, of \nWyoming, read George Washington's Farewell Address; and I had the great \nprivilege of reading that myself--one of his fears was public debt.\n  But Jefferson went on to say that this Constitution every now and \nagain needs to reflect the needs of the time, to be changed to deal \nwith the needs or the emergencies of the time. So those who would fear \nchange, I do not think this change is not unwarranted.\n  A vote ``yes'' on this amendment would do much to restore the \naccountability and responsibility of this Congress in the eyes of all \ncitizens in this country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise today, once again, one final time, in strong support of the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution and to urge my colleagues \nto support this amendment.\n  Last November the American people sent a clear signal to Washington. \nThey made clear that they are tired of business as usual. They made \nclear that they no longer will accept, or re-elect, representatives who \ndo not take \n[[Page S3195]] their responsibilities seriously. They made clear that \nwe must put our financial house in order.\n  Only when we have re-established order can we again represent the \npeople's interests as we should. Only when we have re-established the \ndiscipline necessary to make hard choices can we begin again to \nrecognize what is important and what is not so important.\n  Only when we begin to balance our own budgets--to sit down and decide \nhow much of the people's money we can afford to spend--will we again \nhave fully earned their trust.\n  The simple fact is that we are spending more than we should as a \ngovernment. We are spending the people's money on things the people do \nnot need, or that the people of a free country can more safely and \nefficiently provide for themselves.\n  The people demanded a more efficient government this past November. \nThey also demanded a smaller Government. One that is more careful in \nhow it spends their money and more careful not to interfere unduly with \ntheir lives.\n  We have a bloated, inefficient Government because for decades \nCongress has not felt the need to sit down and decide what it has a \nright to spend the people's money on, and what we must, as a \ngovernment, do without.\n  You see, those who oppose the balance budget amendment, or complain \nthat it will cause too much pain, ignore the pain our current \nirresponsible deficit spending already causes. Our spiraling debt \ninflates interest rates, it causes economic dislocation--and higher \ntaxes on the American people. Worse, it leaves our children and \ngrandchildren a legacy of debt.\n  After all, every year we must pay hundreds of billions of dollars to \nretire old debt, even as we add new debt. Our current irresponsible \nspending causes economic pain; pain which will only get worse if we \nallow it to continue.\n  This amendment will not suddenly eliminate Federal spending. It will \nnot even suddenly eliminate deficit spending. Until the year 2002 we \nwill continue to spend more than we take in--only at a less horrifying \npace. But this amendment will reintroduce discipline to the budgeting \nprocess and help us get a grip, once again, on our spending priorities.\n  It will force those of us in this Chamber to actually sit down and \ndecide what our priorities ought to be. Instead of spending money on \neverything, we will, for a change, debate which programs we should, and \nshould not, fund at the taxpayers' expense.\n  The amendment will help reduce the size of Government by severely \nlimiting the option to borrow money. Currently, when faced with demands \nfor more spending, the Congress makes the easy choice to borrow money. \nUnder the balanced budget amendment, Congress will be forced to make \nthe tough choices.\n  In this way, unless we are in the midst of a crisis severe enough to \nproduce a supermajority in favor of deficit spending, Congress will be \nforced to control its appetite for spending, or select the even less \ndesirable alternative of raising taxes.\n  No longer will we be able to borrow against our childrens' future. No \nlonger will we be able to continue increasing the size of Government, \noblivious to its costs to our pocketbooks and our liberties. No longer \nwill Government be able to duck responsibility for the way it spends \nthe people's money.\n  Mr. President, I remember well what the folks in Michigan told me \nwhen I was campaigning for the Senate a few months back. From Detroit \nto the Upper Peninsula, from Grand Rapids to Saginaw, Michiganders all \nexpressed the same confusion about the way Congress does business. They \ncould not understand why Congress could not operate the way they did in \ntheir families or the way businesses did in trying to meet a bottom \nline.\n  The people did not ask for a fancier bookkeeping method that will \nmake it look as if the budget is balanced when it really is not. They \ndid not ask for a balanced budget except for this or that program. A \nbalanced budget means just that. If you put spending programs off \nbudget you are simply fooling yourself and the American people.\n  But the people were not asking that we budget exactly as if we were a \nfamily. The big difference between Congress and a family is that a \nfamily is spending its own money. Congress, on the other hand, is \nspending money entrusted to it by the people.\n  If a family decides to buy a home it will go into debt as it invests \nfor the future. But the Government is not a family. Government is the \nservant of families. It is our duty to spend no more of families' hard-\nearned money than we need to.\n  And massive public spending projects all too often are boondoggles \nrather than good investments for America's families.\n  In fact, it seems to me we should not even need to debate the need \nfor a balanced budget amendment because over the last 25 years Congress \nhas proved that it is incapable of managing effectively the Nation's \npursestrings.\n  And President Clinton's latest budget makes clear that he has no \nintention of doing anything to fight the deficit in the years ahead. \nAccording to his own budget projections, Federal spending will grow \nfrom $1.5 trillion in 1995 to over $1.9 trillion at the turn of the \ncentury.\n  Deficits will remain near $200 billion in every year through the year \n2000. That means that between now and the end of the century we will \nadd well over $1 trillion to the deficit.\n  I think that the choice is clear. Either we continue spending \ntrillions of dollars we do not have, or we get our financial house in \norder. Either we give up on the idea of getting our spending under \ncontrol, or we pass a balanced budget amendment. Either we do the job \nwe were sent here to do, or we continue to spend our childrens' and \ngrandchildrens' money and leave them to foot the bill.\n  Now, some of my colleagues have said that they like the idea of a \nbalanced budget--but they fear one or another horrible unintended \nconsequence of this amendment. From judicial budget writing to \nPresidential impoundment, some Senators fear there are dangers lurking \nin this amendment, dangers to our status as an institution and to the \nRepublic itself.\n  Mr. President, we must not shrink before these phantom dangers. This \namendment is a model of clear, concise drafting. It does a single \nthing, and does it well. It says that Congress now must balance its \nbudgets the same way families and businesses do--by spending no more \nthan it takes in.\n  I will not restate all the arguments again here. But it is clear to \nme that this simple, policy-centered amendment will provide the \ndiscipline we in this institution need to rethink our priorities and \nget spending under control--and nothing else.\n  We should concern ourselves less with phantoms and more with our \nresponsibilities to our Nation and to our families.\n  Mr. President: My family is important to me. I work in large part so \nthat I can pass on something to them. I hope I can pass on a little \nwisdom. I want to make sure I pass on some decent habits of hard work \nand honesty. And I also want to pass on as much economic opportunity \nand security to them as I can.\n  Trillions of dollars in debt is not my idea of a good inheritance to \nleave to my kids. Neither is a government that has gotten out of \ncontrol, that spends money with little idea of what is important, that \nhas no discipline in its budgeting procedures, that interferes with the \ndaily lives of its citizens simply because to do so is cost-free.\n  Let Members protect our children from debt and from irresponsible \ngovernment. Let Members limit government and expand freedom. Let \nMembers pass the balanced budget amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I probably agree with the editors in the \nNew York Times 90 percent of the time. Today they have an editorial on \n``Unbalanced Amendment,'' which shows an emotional attachment to a \nposition that I do not think is very rational. I ask unanimous consent \nthat their editorial, be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Unbalanced Amendment\n\n       Tomorrow's vote in the Senate on the balanced-budget \n     amendment is crucial for the Republican agenda to chop \n     Government programs into bits. The outcome is also crucial \n     [[Page S3196]] to the nation because the pernicious amendment \n     would do enormous fiscal damage. Proponents are alarmingly \n     within three votes of winning.\n       The core of the amendment would require the Government to \n     balance its books unless three-fifths of the House and Senate \n     vote to run a deficit. To the wavering Democrats--John Breaux \n     of Louisiana, Sam Nunn of Georgia, Wendell Ford of Kentucky, \n     and Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota--here are \n     five unassailable reasons to vote no.\n       Unnecessary.--Federal deficits have indeed been too high. \n     That poses a threat that borrowing will siphon savings away \n     from productive private investments.\n       But the fact that borrowing must be contained does not \n     imply it ought to be eliminated--any more than family \n     borrowing, to buy a house or pay college tuition, need be \n     eliminated. A prudent rule would keep Federal debt growing \n     less quickly than incomes. This rule would justify deficits \n     of about $200 billion a year, close to current levels.\n       Misleading.--Proponents claim the amendment would protect \n     future generations against ruinous interest payments. True, \n     today's children will owe taxes when they grow up to pay \n     interest on Federal debt. But proponents ignore the fact that \n     the tax payments will flow right back to these children as \n     owners of Government bonds.\n       Unenforceable.--Because key terms of the amendment--like \n     outlays and receipts--are undefined, Congress will be able to \n     manipulate and evade. Can Congress create independent \n     agencies or find other ways to spend and borrow off the \n     Government books? A Senate committee has already written into \n     the legislative record, used to guide future court decisions, \n     that the Tennessee Valley Authority would be exempt from the \n     amendment. It should take lawyers five minutes to stretch \n     whatever ``principle'' guides that exception to scores of \n     other Government programs.\n       The amendment also fails to provide an enforcement \n     mechanism. It might simply become an empty gesture or, worse \n     yet, the courts might step in to tell Congress how much it \n     should tax and where it should spend.\n       Irrational.--Federal bookkeeping lumps ordinary spending \n     with long-term public investments. Congress, forced by the \n     amendment to cut quickly, would go after hugely expensive, \n     though vitally important, investments, such as scientific \n     research, costly laboratories and equipment, job training or \n     other investments that would not produce benefits for years, \n     if not decades.\n       Reckless.--When the economy slows, tax revenues fall off \n     and spending on unemployment insurance and food stamps rises. \n     This automatic rise in the deficit, by triggering spending, \n     serves to mitigate the slowdown. But under the proposed \n     amendment, Congress could easily turn a mild downturn into \n     something worse. Unless a three-fifths supermajority saves \n     the day, Congress would have to raise taxes and cut spending \n     in a slow economy--the opposite of responsible stewardship.\n       Take another unintended consequence. When savings and loans \n     went bankrupt during the 1980's, the Federal Government \n     bailed out depositors with borrowed money, thereby preventing \n     a banking panic. But under the proposed amendment, the \n     Government could not react instantly unless a supermajority \n     in Congress approved.\n       The balanced-budget amendment appeals to taxpayers who \n     demand that the Government spend their money wisely. But \n     Senators Nunn, Ford, Conrad, Dorgan and Breaux need to \n     recognize that this honorable sentiment cannot be wisely \n     embedded into the Constitution.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I would like to comment on the editorial.\n  First, they say it is unnecessary. Federal deficits have indeed been \ntoo high. That poses a threat that borrowing will siphon savings away \nfrom productive private investments.\n  Clearly, that has happened already. The Federal Reserve Bank of New \nYork said between 1978 and 1988 the deficit cost 5 percent growth in \nour national income.\n\n       But the fact that borrowing must be contained does not \n     imply it ought to be eliminated--any more than family \n     borrowing, to buy a house or pay tuition need be eliminated.\n\n  I will get into that because that is stressed later.\n\n       A prudent rule would keep Federal debt growing less quickly \n     than incomes. This rule would justify deficits of about $200 \n     billion a year, close to current levels.\n\n  That is what the GAO calls stumbling along at the present level. But, \nin fact, the CBO forecast is that those deficits are going to escalate, \nand escalate significantly. We have shown we do not have the political \nwill to do anything about it.\n  That is the simple reality. In 1986, this House, by one vote, failed \nto pass the balanced budget amendment. Then the debt was $2 trillion. \nNow it is $4.8 trillion and we are hearing the same arguments again, \nthat we can do this without a balanced budget amendment.\n  Second, they say the amendment is misleading.\n\n       Proponents claim the amendment would protect future \n     generations against ruinous interest payments. True, today's \n     children will owe taxes when they grow up to pay interest on \n     Federal debt. But proponents ignore the fact that the tax \n     payments will flow right back to these children as owners of \n     Government bonds.\n\n  I would make three points here. One is, Thomas Jefferson said one \ngeneration should no more be willing to accept the debts of a previous \ngeneration than the debts of another country. Thomas Jefferson was \nright. Second, this argument that this interest just flows back into \nour own hands ignores the reality that we have somewhere between $650 \nand $800 billion owned by other countries, people in other countries. \nIn fact, foreign aid to the wealthy of other countries is at least \ndouble the foreign economic assistance we give to poor people. And that \nforeign economic assistance to the wealthy is through our indebtedness. \nThird, this editorial ignores the redistribution effect of the \ninterest.\n  Who pays the interest in our country? By and large, people of limited \nmeans. Who collects the interest? Those who have enough means to own \nthe T-bills. That is not the average citizen.\n  That is redistributing money to those who are more fortunate. It is \ninteresting, of the $339 billion we are estimated to pay for interest \nthis year, that is roughly twice what we will spend on our poverty \nprograms,\n 11 times what we will spend on education, and 22 times what we spend \non foreign economic assistance.\n\n  Then they say it is unenforceable. If it were unenforceable, my good \nfriend--and he is my friend--Senator Byrd, would not be fighting this \namendment like he is. Of course, it is enforceable. They say the \namendment fails to provide an enforcement mechanism. When you require a \nthree-fifths vote for the increase of the debt, you have a very \npowerful enforcement mechanism.\n  They say it is irrational, Federal bookkeeping lumping ordinary \nspending with long-term public investments, a point they made earlier. \nThe reality is, while a family has to borrow for a home or a college \neducation, the Federal Government does not, and frankly, even a State \nthe size of Illinois does not have to. I served in the State \nlegislature for 14 years and served 4 years as Lieutenant Governor. A \nState the size of Missouri--and I do not mean this disrespectfully of \nthe State of the Presiding Officer--is in a little different situation \nthan a large State. But in the State of Illinois, frankly, we do not \nneed to do it and the Federal Government does not need to do it.\n  It is interesting that the long-term investment has gone down as the \ndeficit has gone up. In fact, the argument is just the reverse, and I \nwould point out also--and I mentioned this on the floor several times, \nand the Presiding Officer has heard me mention this, I am sure--when \nPresident Eisenhower, to his great credit, proposed the Interstate \nHighway System, the largest single capital project in the history of \nhumanity, he suggested issuing bonds. Senator Albert Gore, Sr., the \nfather of our present Vice President said, ``Let's not issue bonds. \nLet's increase the gasoline tax and do it on a pay-as-you-go basis.'' \nFortunately, he prevailed.\n  As of a year and a half ago, the estimate was we had saved $750 \nbillion in interest.\n  Then they say it is reckless; when the economy slows, tax revenues \nfall off and spending on unemployment insurance and food stamps rise. \nThis automatic rise in the deficit by triggering spending serves to \nmitigate the slowdown. Study after study, including the unanimous \nreport of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, then chaired by \nSenator Lloyd Bentsen, said we respond too slowly in emergencies. And \nbecause of the deficit, we have simply been unable to respond.\n  When President Clinton suggested that we spend $15 billion on a jobs \nprogram to stimulate the economy, and $15 billion is not much in a $6 \ntrillion economy, we were not able to get $15 billion passed. I voted \nfor it, but we could not do it.\n  Former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Fred Bergsten, who served \nunder Jimmy Carter, said that if we would plan for a 2-percent surplus \nand \n[[Page S3197]] then we could have a triggering mechanism so the \nPresident could respond when unemployment passed a certain level in any \nregion, then we could respond quickly. We can respond just as quickly \nand more quickly with a constitutional amendment.\n  Finally, let me make three other points. One is the New York Times \neditorials have consistently ignored economic history, and I have to \nsay the Washington Post editorials have done the same. They just act as \nthough we are dealing by ourselves with an absolutely new initiative \nand no other nation has ever gone through this debt before.\n  The reality of the history of nations is that they pile up debts and \npile up debts and then they become so bad they start monetizing the \ndebt; they start printing money. And we are headed to do the same \nthing. Nations have done that historically when they get around 9, 10, \n11 percent, except in a wartime situation where there is a freeze on \nprivate and public spending.\n  We are heading, according to CBO, to 18 percent. We can take a chance \nthat we will be the first Nation in history to be able to do that \nwithout monetizing the debt. But what a chance for the future of these \npages and my children and my grandchildren. We should not be doing it.\n  Second, it ignores the reality that the General Accounting Office and \nCBO and Data Resources, Inc. and everyone says if we balance the \nbudget, we will improve the standard of living of our country. GAO says \nbalance the budget and in two decades you will have an increase in the \nstandard of living of approximately 36 percent. That type of economic \ninformation is totally ignored by this New York Times editorial.\n  And finally, not so much in this editorial but in others, and all the \nhorror stories that have been spread around here about what is going to \nhappen to social spending, what is going to happen to this or what is \ngoing to happen to that, how do we get there? There are two options.\n  One is if you do not make any changes in Social Security and if \ninterest rates do not go down, and every projection is that they will \ngo down but you would have some savings on interest because you would \nnot have as much of a large deficit, we would have to limit non-Social-\nSecurity spending growth to 1.7 percent between now and the year 2002. \nThat is doable.\n  Let me put it another way. Revenue in the year 2002 will be \napproximately $300 billion greater than what we will spend this year. \nWhat we have to do between now and the year 2002 is to control the \ngrowth of spending so it does not exceed that amount. That is doable.\n  Is it going to cause a little pain? Of course, it will. If there were \nnot pain, why, we could pass a balanced budget; we would have done it a \nlong time ago. We need the discipline of something to force us to do \nthe right thing. So my hope is that tomorrow we will do the right \nthing. This is my 21st year in Congress. This is the most important \nvote I will have cast in those 21 years. We are talking about the \nfuture of our country.\n  We make a lot of short-term decisions because of one thing or \nanother, and I am as guilty of that as anyone. Here is one where we \nought to ask ourselves not which party is going to benefit, not what it \nis going to do to each of us politically--and I realize it is easy for \nme since I am not going to be running for reelection--we ought to be \nasking what is going to happen to the future of our country. I think if \nwe ask that question and dig, the answer is fairly obvious.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the real question here has been brought out \nrepeatedly in this debate. What we have heard over and over and over \nagain is that we need the balanced budget amendment because we need \nsomething to force us to act responsibly; we need something to give us \npolitical courage; we need something that says, ``I am going to put a \ngun to my head and I'm going to say I'll shoot if you don't prevent me \nfrom spending again.''\n  We need the discipline. We have heard that word over and over. And we \nhave heard repeatedly, both here and over in the House, the term \n``political will.'' They say this forces us to have the ``political \nwill.''\n  Well, Mr. President, I do not believe that anyone worthy of being a \nU.S. Senator needs such legislation to gain political will--if they are \ndoing their job properly. We are capable of spelling out just what \nsteps we need to take, and our knees will not buckle when we know the \ntruth, as was stated by one of the Members of the House. How do I know \nthat? Because just 2 short years ago, the Congress voted for the \nlargest deficit reduction package in history. Why so many people refuse \nto remember that, I do not know.\n  With passage of that single bill, the budget deficit was cut by over \n$500 billion. And, I must add, we had to do it without a single \nRepublican vote in either the House or the Senate. In fact, the Vice \nPresident had to break the tie in the Senate.\n  President Clinton said 2 years ago, in both public and private \nconversations, that the most important thing is health of the economy.\n  His campaign commitment on deficit reduction was not just election \nyear rhetoric. In the first year of his Presidency, he presented a \nclear agenda for deficit reduction. He offered us real specifics, not a \nlot of rhetoric but real specifics--a program that combined both \nspending cuts and new taxes. He had the guts to do that.\n  Mr. President, how did we do that? The President made his proposals. \nThe Democratic Congress responded, and said OK, we will take on your \ndeficit reduction agenda. We know it is going to mean tough votes, but \nwe are going to do this.\n  So it came up here to the Hill, and we farmed it out to various \ncommittees, and the committees were given assignments, so much of a cut \nper committee. And those were tough cuts and tough votes--tough, tough \nvotes. And they were brought back here to the floor where we voted them \nout of the Senate. They went to conference with the House, and the \nconference package came back. And we voted it out--a tough vote as \nreflected by the fact some Members of the Senate were probably not \nreelected because of their vote on this package.\n  I do not know why--with the deficit reduction record we've achieved \nover the past couple of years--the Republicans do not do the same thing \nright now. Instead of talking about grand ideals--be specific. Do not \nsay trust us and we will tell you later how we are going to do this. \nThat is not how we did it during that reconciliation vote in August \n1993, less than 2 years ago. We stood up and made the hard choices at \nthat time, and that is what we should do in dealing with the deficit. \nThat was a tough package in the Senate and in the House. In fact, it \ncame up to a 50-50 tie, one of the more dramatic moments in recent \nyears in the Senate, and the Vice President had to break the tie during \nthe vote in the Senate.\n  Now, that bill became law despite the lack of bipartisan support, and \nwe are now seeing our third year of declining deficits. Why do people \nignore that? When that bill was passed, our deficits were going up and \nthey were estimated to be close to $300 billion a year. The next year \nthey went down to $250 billion. They are estimated to be around $190 \nbillion a year now. But the proponents of this bill make a lot out of \nthe fact that the President said, well, we are going to have deficits \nof $200 billion a year from here out into the near future.\n  I do not like that either, but I can tell you what we ought to be \nconcentrating on. Instead of a balanced budget amendment with all of \nits disadvantages, we should be concentrating on how to continue this \ntrend of deficit reduction. For the first time since Harry Truman, we \nhave seen consecutive years of deficit reduction.\n  The President deserves a lot of credit for that, and the Democratic \nCongress deserves a lot of credit for that because we are the ones who \nput it through. I think we should be taking great pride in that.\n  We do not need a balanced budget amendment to give us guts. Political \ncourage should not stop at the middle aisle in this Chamber. It should \nbe all across this Chamber. We demonstrated less than 2 years ago that \nthat is the way to cut the deficit; not by some legislation that is \nsupposed to instill a false sense of courage or a political will that \nwe would lack otherwise. This new \n[[Page S3198]] sense of courage is supposed to come from the fact that \nwe will blame hard choices on the balanced budget amendment.\n  We do not have to say that we lack responsibility or political will. \nWe can do it. We know we can do it because the Democrats in this Senate \ndid it before. And we can be very, very proud of that.\n  Mr. President, when we have asked for specifics during this lengthy \ndebate on whether taxes would be raised or on what would be cut, we \nhave been stonewalled on the other side and amendment after amendment \nafter amendment has been voted down to show that they mean business \nover there. They are not going to tell us how we will go about cutting \nprograms or what will be threatened. They just want the balanced budget \namendment to hide behind.\n  Now, what if I would say to those watching at home, your Social \nSecurity is going to be cut.\n  Oh, no, no, no, the proponents of the amendment say, we plan to take \nthat off the table. That is going to be off budget.\n  Well, if that is the case, then your Medicare is going to be cut. Oh, \nno, no, no, they say, that is not going to be cut. We are going to \nleave that off budget over here some place. Well, we know that national \ndefense needs to be continued. It is not going to be cut substantially. \nIn fact, the proposal is to increase national defense just a little \nbit, and I go along with that.\n  Now, if you take Social Security, you take Medicare, and you take \ndefense off, what does that result in? I can tell you, if you are going \nto put a balanced budget amendment in, it means that every other \nfunction in the budget has to be cut by well over 30 percent-- every \nother function: AIDS research, cancer research, you name it.\n  Oh, well, we would not cut those. That means something else then is \ngoing to get cut double so you can keep up with AIDS research and \ncancer research and the other programs we would like to keep.\n  Now, what if we included a couple of the other things I think would \nprobably not be voted out here. Take tax cuts. Those are going to be \nput in. Take veterans programs, veterans retirement off, civilian \nretirement for civil service people who have retired. If you just add \nthose things to it, do you know what we come up with?\n  We come up with the fact that every other function in the Federal \nGovernment would have to be cut by over 50 percent--every other \nfunction of Government--including health and safety matters--every \nother function of Government. And yet we are supposed to vote for this \nand say we are going to put a gun to our heads and say we are going to \nforce ourselves into this straitjacket so we will have this balanced \nbudget amendment to hide behind when we start cutting such programs.\n  Mr. President, I disagree with this approach. We need to be honest. \nIf certain programs are going to be on the table, the American people \nneed to know they will not be sacrosanct.\n  But some people who say we would not dare cut Social Security would--\nthese same Senators--would not vote to exempt Social Security from the \nbalanced budget amendment here on the Senate floor just last week. They \nwould not vote to set Social Security aside. No, it is still on the \ntable. So believe me, whether they like to say so or not, your Social \nSecurity benefits are in danger because everything is still in play. \nEverything is still in play. And to the States that are so concerned \nabout unfunded mandates out there, wait until you look at that billions \nof dollars you are receiving every year for environmental concerns--\njust for environmental concerns such as clean air and clean water.\n  What happens to that? You can bet that is going to get cut back, and \nso all the Governors who have been here so concerned about this--and \nsome of them supporting a balanced budget amendment--better look to \nwhat is going to happen to their Federal funding once something like \nthis goes through.\n  Mr. President, I believe we have had a good debate here in the Senate \non the balanced budget amendment. We did not push it through for the \nsake of press releases and false deadlines. We did not set ourselves so \nmany days and say we have to do this or else, because we take \namendments to the Constitution very seriously in the Senate--very, very \nseriously indeed.\n  I believe that the debate in the Senate has served to unearth some \nother very serious flaws with the balanced budget amendment. I wish to \nspell out what some of these other problems are besides the ones I have \nalready mentioned--and to explain why I believe they make this balanced \nbudget amendment unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, as I stated earlier, the first step should have been \nto map out a plan to reach a balanced budget. That is why I supported \nthe so-called right-to-know-amendment offered by the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle. We are now hearing there will be \nplans announced at a later date to balance the budget by the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, when I talk to people back home in Ohio and when I \nvisit back home in Ohio, people throughout Ohio feel they have a right \nto know up front how their lives are going to be affected, how their \nSocial Security will be affected, how their Medicare will be affected, \nhow their retirement will be affected, how their children will be \naffected.\n They want to know up front how we intend to achieve a balanced budget.\n\n  Mr. President, while we debate the balanced budget amendment, we are \nseeing more headlines about tax cuts than about deficit reduction. Many \nof the proponents of the amendment, who should be laying out deficit-\nreduction proposals, are busy preparing tax-cut plans. Does that sound \nfamiliar? It reminds me of the very strategy that added more than $3.5 \ntrillion to our national debt. Then, like today, there was a lot of \ntalk about balancing the budget but almost no talk about how to get \nthere. Instead we had feel-good budget plans. Cut taxes, smile, be \nhappy--it is morning in America.\n  What did we do back then? We cut taxes by one-fourth over a 3-year \nperiod of time, 5 percent the first year, 10 percent for each of the \nnext 2 years. That was supposed to result in such economic growth we \nwould not wind up losing money, we would wind up earning more in \nrevenue because of the increased economic activity.\n  It just did not work. That is what gave us the additional $3.8 \ntrillion in debt that occurred over the 12 years before the Clinton \nadministration. I take some Democratic responsibility for some of that, \nand for this reason. Back during the Jimmy Carter years when he was \nPresident, remember, we had 21-percent interest rates and 17-percent \ninflation rates for a while. Everybody was scared. I was, too. I was \nafraid what money I had was in jeopardy during a situation like that. I \nthink that lack of control of the national economy is one of the things \nthat led to the election of President Ronald Reagan. Then he came in \nand made his big proposals for supply-side economics, and those went \ninto effect, and we have seen the budget deficit going up--not only the \nbudget deficit but the national debt going up ever since.\n  If we do everything the proponents say they want to do, take defense, \nSocial Security, and Medicare off the table, we are faced with a \nprospect, as I said earlier, of more than 30-percent cuts. Everything \nelse in the Federal budget would have to have about by more than 30 \npercent cut.\n  And as I've said, we are not entirely sure if that will be the case \nbecause the same proponents of the amendment who say they feel Social \nSecurity should be off the table, voted against an amendment to exempt \nSocial Security from the balanced budget amendment. They say the same \nabout veterans benefits. They say they will not cut veterans programs. \nBut then they turn around and vote down an amendment to exempt veterans \nprograms. So nobody is exactly sure where they stand with this \namendment. It is all speculation because no one is being told what will \nbe cut, whether taxes will be raised or anything else, for that matter.\n  I submit that my constituents in Ohio are the taxpayers and they have \na right to know in advance what the impact is going to be on their \nlives if we put the balanced budget amendment into effect. We can spell \nout for the American people how we will reduce the budget. We do not \nneed a balanced budget amendment. We on the Democratic side did that in \nthe summer of \n[[Page S3199]] 1993. President Clinton made his proposals that led to \ndeficit reduction of more than. We did it, and we did it without a \nsingle Republican vote from the other side of the aisle.\n  So this idea that we do not have political courage, we do not have \nguts enough to make some of these hard decisions, fall on deaf ears, as \nfar as I am concerned. We did it and we can do it again. What I would \nlike to see, instead of these $200 billion deficits continuing as \nprojected, is for us to come up with real proposals for continued \nreductions. What we should be doing instead of debating a balanced \nbudget amendment, is try to decide how we will keep that reduction \ngoing.\n  I want to see us achieve a balanced budget by the year 2002. I think \nwe should start moving in that direction immediately--start working on \nit right now. I intend to support an amendment offered by my \ndistinguished colleague from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, which will \nrequire that our congressional budget resolutions from here on map out \nspecifically how to reach a balanced budget by the year 2000.\n  Do we have courage enough to do that? I hope we do. Real political \ncourage is a true alternative to the balanced budget amendment. The \nproblem with the balanced budget amendment is that it brings with it so \nmany unintended consequences. First, it threatens the separation of \npowers, so carefully laid out in the Constitution. According to former \nsolicitor and Federal Judge Robert Bork, the balanced budget amendment, \nand I quote him, ``Would likely result in hundreds if not thousands of \nlawsuits around the country, many of them on inconsistent theories, and \nproviding inconsistent results.''\n  In fact, the judicial consequences of the proposed amendment have \nbrought together an unexpected alliance of legal scholars who oppose \nthe amendment. Conservatives such as Bork and Robert Fried and liberals \nsuch as Archibald Cox and Laurence Tribe all think it is a serious \nmistake.\n  I fear activist Federal judges, trying to enforce the balanced budget \namendment, would place themselves in the role of elected officials. \nThese judges, appointed for life and insulated from the people, could \nusurp the power to tax and spend from elected officials. I believe our \nFounding Fathers, who fought a revolution against taxation without \nrepresentation, would be shocked at that potential prospect. If the \njudiciary had a case before them and said, OK the Congress has not \nbalanced this budget as the Constitution requires, what shall we do? \nWould they then say we will just cut certain programs? Or will they say \none of the options is to tax? They might give the remedy. No one says \nthey cannot do that. How do we deal with that? Some say the Missouri \nversus Jenkins precedent which opened up such a possibility should not \nbe read in this way. Some state the courts have grown less activist and \nless likely to enter this sphere.\n  I remind my colleagues, the Constitution will last throughout future \ngenerations of Americans. The judiciary of the future may or may not be \nactivist, and it will be interpreting evolving precedents that we \ncannot predict. That is why I have and will continue to support \namendments to the balanced budget amendment to add predictability to \nthe area of judicial review and ensure the balanced budget amendment \nwill not simply become a full employment act for lawyers.\n  I am also deeply concerned about the impact of the amendment during \ntough economic times. There has been a great deal of discussion on the \nfloor about this topic by other Senators. In times of economic \ndownturn, our economy would be placed on autopilot. The economic \ndownturn would cause an unpredictable hemorrhage of revenues. Tax \nincreases and massive spending cuts would be forced just at the time \nwhen a fragile economy could not sustain them. We could not do the \ncountercyclical spending that has held us out of more depressions since \nthose days of the Great Depression. And that is just what turned a \nrecession into the Great Depression in the 1930's, that lack of ability \nto make countercyclical spending.\n  The supermajority requirements of the amendment would have a minority \nof legislators, deciding the fate of all Americans during these times. \nThis same minority would be deciding the fate of Ohioans--or people \nanyplace else in the country, for that matter--who are hit by natural \ndisasters. Over the years, tornadoes and floods have ravaged different \nparts of the country, as well as my own State of Ohio. The Federal \nGovernment always came to our aid. With this amendment in place, \nlegislators who have never been to Ohio nor visited other areas \nimpacted by disasters, would suddenly have veto power over Government \ncompassion. Tough luck, you are on your own.\n  That is why I support an amendment offered by my friend from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer, to provide flexibility in cases of natural \ndisaster.\n  Another area of very great concern to me also is that of national \ndefense.\n  The amendment has a military conflict waiver which is extremely \nimportant but it certainly does not go far enough. What happens if \nAmerica faces a military threat, not a conflict? Will we be able to \ngear our forces up in time? If you look back over our military history \nat military spending, we have operated since the days of the Spanish-\nAmerican War on basically a 17-year cycle. It is really striking to \nlook at the figures. Almost on an exact 17-year cycle we have seen \nbuildup of 7 years, followed by a 10-year reduction in the military: 7-\nyear buildup, then a 10-year builddown. Military spending follows that \npersistent trend almost exactly--except for World War II, where the \npeak was displaced by about 4 years. But every 17 years, we seem to \ndecide the world is safe and that we can cut back on our military \nbudget. Then something always happens which makes us reconsider, and we \nbegin building up again to prepare for whatever the new threat is; \nthreats that we could not foresee, threats that we could not define \nwhen we made the cuts to begin with.\n  Military preparedness is not something that just happens overnight \nwhen we suddenly see a new threat. Congress is charged in the \nConstitution with the awesome responsibility of providing for the \ncommon defense of all of our people. Yet today, we are debating an \namendment to the Constitution which I fear may not allow Congress to \nlive up to that responsibility. There are trouble spots throughout the \nworld that could erupt at any time.\n  What will our adversaries think if they know we have no ability to \nrise to the occasion? What about our allies? I know that many here in \nCongress signed the Contract With America. But we all took an oath to \nsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States. That \ncertainly takes precedent over the Contract With America.\n  Mr. President, I want us to achieve a balanced budget. We took an \nimportant step toward a balanced budget 2 years ago. We need to take \nthe same sort of action in this Congress. I simply do not believe that \nthis balanced budget amendment, as it currently is crafted, is a wise \ncourse to follow. We have had 3 consecutive years of deficit reduction. \nIt went from about $300 billion, down to a little under $250 billion, \ndown to about $190 billion right now. What we need to do is plan to \ncontinue that, not just going out with $200 billion into the indefinite \nfuture, as the President's budget has proposed.\n  Mr. President, I come back again to where I started my remarks; that \nis, to ask: Why do we need this amendment to our Constitution? We are \ntold by the other side that we need it for political courage, we need \nit for political will, we need it for discipline. We demonstrated \npolitical courage, political will, and discipline less than 2 years ago \nin this very Chamber when we voted a $500 billion budget deficit \nreduction package. That was a tough package. Putting it together \ninvolved many tough votes. We did it upfront in a responsible manner. \nWe were honest. People knew exactly what we were voting on. We were \naccountable to the people we represent. We went home and explained why \nwe voted the way we did. We did not hide behind some balanced budget \namendment that gives cover for those hard votes.\n  I think the way to go is to repeat what we did less than 2 years ago \non this floor, and lay out a plan of how we will continue the deficit \nreduction program that President Clinton first presented, and we \nenacted into law. It has been effective; it has worked.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  [[Page S3200]] Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  It's is no exaggeration to suggest Mr. President, the Senate is about \nto make one of the most momentous decisions in the history of the \nNation--on the question of whether to add a balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution.\n  On the eve of this significant vote, it is instructive to consider \nthe counsel of our Founding Fathers on this matter. Thomas Jefferson \nsaid in 1816 that ``To preserve our independence, we must not let our \nrulers load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election between \neconomy and liberty, or profusion and servitude.''\n  Mr. Jefferson thereby laid out the choice before the Senate--liberty \nor servitude. Congress, having become enslaved to deficit spending, has \nrefused for decades to stop the practice of spending money it does not \nhave.\n  How enormous is the Federal debt? For nearly 3 years, Mr. President, \nI have made a daily report to the Senate regarding the Federal debt--\ndown to the penny as of the close of business the preceding day. As of \nclose of business this past Friday, February 24, the debt stood at \n$4,838,340,250,340.71. On a per capita basis, every man, woman, and \nchild in America owes $18,366.42.\n  The taxpayers had to fork over $203 billion in 1994 just to pay the \ninterest on this massive debt, and that, on a per capita basis, amounts \nto $1,138.76 for every American man, woman, and child.\n  One looks back in time to see where we stood.\n  Mr. President, when I was sworn in as a Senator in January 1973, I \nwas distressed that long ago, that Congress had been spending far more \nthan it took in--year after year. Deficit spending had become a way of \nlegislative life.\n  So on July 19, 1973, I offered S. 2215, a bill to require a balanced \nbudget. It was cosponsored by the then distinguished Senator Harry F. \nByrd. On that day, July 19, 1973--if you can believe this--the Federal \ndebt stood at a relatively small figure of $455,570,163,323.85. Today, \n22 years later, the Federal debt has skyrocketed to $4.3 trillion. The \nhistorical tables of the 1996 budget reveal that the interest on the \nmoney borrowed by Congress since 1973, cost the taxpayers \n$3,209,417,000,000.\n  Imagine if Congress had passed a balanced budget amendment in 1973 as \nproposed by Senator Harry F. Byrd and me, the American taxpayers could \nhave been saved more than $3.2 trillion in interest alone.\n  The American people have difficulty comprehending the enormity of a \ntrillion dollars. I went into the cloakroom the other day, and several \nSenators were sitting around. I said, ``How many million are in a \ntrillion?'' One said ``100,000.'' Another one said, ``I do not know.'' \nAnd a third one said, ``Don't give us that. What is it?\"\n  I said, ``There are 1 million millions in a trillion.'' Bear in mind \nthat the U.S. Government--meaning the taxpayers of this country--owes \n$4.8 trillion. That dead cat lies at the doorstep of the U.S. Senate \nand the House of Representatives. We cannot get around it. No President \ncan spend a dime that is not first authorized and appropriated by the \nCongress of the United States.\n  If I may return for a moment to one of my American heroes, Mr. \nJefferson, he also said that ``The question whether one generation has \nthe right to bind another by the deficit it imposes is a question of \nsuch consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles of \ngovernment. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle \nposterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves.''\n  Amen, Thomas Jefferson.\n  That just about tells it all, certainly in terms of the moral \ninjustice that we have been heaping upon our children and their \nchildren and their children. Nobody suggests that balancing the budget \nwill be easy. It will be tough. It really boils down to a matter of \ndoing what we were elected to do, and that is leveling with the people \nof this country.\n  I can debate for hours the contention that accepting a balanced \nbudget amendment is not constitutional. However, statements like that \ndo not make sense. I do not denigrate anybody who uses their best \nargument to try to defeat something that I happen to believe in.\n  There was another eloquent President, by the way, who spoke one time \nof a rendezvous with destiny. What destiny will the U.S. Senate choose \ntomorrow? What legacy will we vote tomorrow for generations yet to \ncome?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of S. 2215, the \nbalanced budget bill offered by the then Senator Harry Byrd, Jr., and \nmyself, on July 1973 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2215\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That this \n     Act may be cited as the ``Emergency Anti-Inflation Act of \n     1973''.\n\n\n                          findings and purpose\n\n       Section 1. (a) The Congress of the United States hereby \n     determines that--\n       (1) the Federal Government is now and has been expending \n     funds during the fiscal yer for nontrust fund budget items in \n     excess of revenues received from all nontrust sources,\n       (2) such fiscal policy by the Federal Government has \n     resulted in substantial borrowing from both public and \n     private sources,\n       (3) the aggregate of such borrowing has resulted in an \n     exorbitant national debt totaling more than $450,000,000,000,\n       (4) this debt will continue to increase so long as the \n     Federal Government spends more than it receives,\n       (5) the Federal Government is now paying annual interest on \n     the national debt in excess of $20,000,000,000, and\n       (6) this interest payment is annually increasing as a fixed \n     expenditure in the Federal budget.\n       (b) The Congress further determines that--\n       (1) deficit spending by the Federal Government has resulted \n     in inflation in the Nation's economy and a lessening in the \n     value of the dollar in terms of its ability to purchase goods \n     and services in foreign and domestic markets,\n       (2) unless this deficit spending on the part of the Federal \n     Government is discontinued a severe economic depression will \n     result.\n       (c) The purpose of this Act is to require the President to \n     submit to the Congress a budget in which nontrust fund \n     expenditures do not exceed revenues received by the \n     Government from nontrust sources.\n       Sec. 2. The nontrust fund expenditures of the Government of \n     the United States during each fiscal year shall not exceed \n     its revenues from all nontrust sources for such year.\n       Sec. 3. (a) The President shall submit a budget pursuant to \n     the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, as amended, in which \n     nontrust fund expenditures do not exceed nontrust fund \n     revenues for each fiscal year.\n       (b) The provisions of this section may be adjusted to \n     reflect any additional revenues of the Government received \n     during a fiscal year resulting from tax legislation enacted \n     after the submission of the budget for such fiscal year.\n       Sec. 4. This Act shall apply only in respect of fiscal \n     years beginning after June 30, 1974.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is not usual to hear the Senator from \nNorth Carolina quote Franklin Delano Roosevelt, but I appreciated \nlistening to his presentation and, as always, his presentation is \ninteresting and heartfelt.\n  The issue that we debate today in the Congress is not an ordinary \nissue or one of passing interest. It is about changing the U.S. \nConstitution. I know there are some people who serve in this body who \nsupport a menu of changes to the Constitution. You name it, they \nsupport it. The Senator from Arkansas said the other day--and I have \nnot counted them--there has been nearly one proposal to change the \nConstitution every day that we have been in session since the first of \nthe year, and 11,000 proposals have been offered to change the \nConstitution since the Constitution was written.\n  I have described on this floor before a day in my life that I shall \nalways remember. I was one of 55 persons to go back to an assembly room \nin Constitution Hall and celebrate the 200th birthday of the writing of \nthe Constitution. Two-hundred years previous, fifty-five white, largely \noverweight men, sat in that room in Philadelphia. We know that because \nwe know who was there. We know the stories about how they had to keep \nthe shades drawn during that hot Philadelphia summer in that room, \nbecause it got very warm while \n[[Page S3201]] they were trying to craft a Constitution. There were \nsome of the most brilliant minds in the history of this country \nconvening there. Absent, of course, was Thomas Jefferson, who was in \nEurope at the time. But he contributed nonetheless substantially to the \nBill of Rights and especially to the writing of the first amendment's \nfree speech clause.\n  As I said, there are some who seem to want to support virtually every \nproposed change to the Constitution, like human weather vanes spinning \nin the winds of the public passion of the moment. Others are opposed to \nchanging the Constitution under any case, ever. The Founding Fathers \nwho wrote the Constitution actually provided for a process to make \nchanges to it. Still, they made it very difficult, and changes have \nbeen made only on very rare occasions. We are trying to decide today \nand tomorrow whether this should be one of those occasions.\n  I am not someone who believes that we should reject change in every \ncircumstance. But I am, I suppose, a conservative, if you can forgive \nthe use of the word in this Chamber, because it is confusing to try to \nunderstand these days who conservatives and liberals really are. I am \nconservative when it comes to changing the Constitution. I believe it \nought to be done only on rare occasions and only in circumstances of \nextraordinary need. Harold Wilson once talked about the only human \ninstitution which rejects progress or change is the cemetery. Change is \na part of our lives. Yes, indeed, even change in the Constitution may \nbe part of our lives when it is necessary.\n  Each of us, as other speakers have indicated, takes an oath when we \ncome to the Senate to serve, and that oath is to uphold the \nConstitution. I do not think anyone takes that oath lightly. All of us \nunderstand the circumstances and the meaning of that oath. All of us \nunderstand, as well, that it is not just public passion that should \npersuade this body or the House to decide to change the Constitution. \nOur system of Government, I think, has worked for over 200 years \nbecause people have had faith in this system.\n  When I sat there in that room, 200 years after the writing of the \nConstitution, 55 of us went back in to recreate the event on its 200th \nbirthday. As I indicated, it was written by 55 white men. So 55 of us--\nmen, women, and minorities--went back into that room, and in a very \nsolemn ceremony, celebrated the 200th anniversary of the writing of \nthis wonderful document. I grew up in a small town, went to a small \nschool and studied George Washington, and here I was in this chamber \nwhere George Washington's chair was at the front of the room--the very \nchair he sat in while presiding over the Constitutional Convention; it \nwas still in the front of this room. Franklin sat over there, and \nMadison, Mason. It was a wonderful experience to sit in that room. It \nkind of gave you goose bumps to understand the history that was created \nthere--the crafting of a document called the Constitution, which has \nrepresented the framework of self-government in the most successful way \nin recorded human history. There is no record of a society that has \npracticed self-government as successfully as has this country.\n  So I think now about sitting in that room and I think about the \npeople who must have sat there 200 years ago as they tried to \nunderstand what kind of a framework would work. What kind of fabric \nwould reach over a couple of centuries and more--maybe a couple of more \ncenturies--and allow for our system of government to work? And one must \nadmit that even with 11,000 different proposals to change the \nConstitution, those who wrote it originally did a masterful job. It is \nan extraordinary document in the history of civilization.\n  As I have said, it works because in people's minds and hearts there \nrepresents an acceptance that self-government is something they agree \nwith and believe in and think represents the best hope for this country \nto make progress. We are now, as all of us understand, facing a \ndifficult set of circumstances in our country. We face, I think, a debt \ncrisis of sorts. It is a debt crisis with respect to fiscal policy--\nthat is, the Government spends more money than it takes in, and a debt \ncrisis, additionally, in our trade policy. This year was the largest \ntrade deficit in the history of this country, or any country, for that \nmatter.\n  How did we come to that point and what causes all of this? It is \ninteresting if you listen to some of the political dialog. And this is \ndone deliberately, and I understand that. It is, gee, you know \nsomething, the Members of Congress come to take their seat in the U.S. \nSenate Chamber and the first thing they want to do is cast another vote \nto spend more money. But all of us understand what happens. The reason \nwe spend more money this year than last year is that there is an \nautomatic pilot on entitlements, and this year we will spend much, much \nmore on health care than last year.\n  Why? For two reasons.\n  In Medicaid, more people are poorer and the health costs are going \nup. In Medicare, more people are reaching Medicare age, more people are \ntriggering that eligibility, and health care costs are going up. \nTherefore, we spent a lot more on health care this year than we did \nlast year because health care costs in many cases have been running \ndouble and triple the rate of inflation and there is never a vote on \nthat, just to use health care as an example. That is on automatic pilot \nand it increases and increases and increases.\n  And so the point of it is, it is not a case where there are 100 \npeople voting to say, ``Yes, let's increase that.'' It is an \nentitlement program that is now latched to inflation and whose costs \nmove up every single year.\n  Revenue does not do the same. In fact, the income tax system and the \npersonal exemption, for example, is indexed exactly the other way. As \ninflation increases, you then increase the personal exemption, so there \nis not an automatic increase in revenue. So you have an automatic \nincrease in the cost of entitlements because of inflation because they \nare hooked to it and accelerate, and the revenue system is hooked just \nthe opposite way so that it will not increase automatically. And we \nhave created then this mismatch in policy and it just cannot exist; it \ncannot continue to exist.\n  I think all of us in this Chamber understand we have a circumstance \nin this country where we routinely have higher expenditures than we \nhave revenue. And what happens to the difference? Well, we simply \ncharge it. We issue more bonds and the children then are faced with \nmore and more debt.\n  The deficit at this point is roughly $180 billion. But that is not \nthe honest deficit. The honest deficit at this point would be the $180 \nbillion, plus the $70 billion in Social Security surplus this year. \nThat is used to reduce the $250 billion back to $180 billion. The real \ndeficit is about $250 billion.\n  That is the way the accounting system works, unfortunately. It should \nnot work that way. We need to try to address that.\n  We have a Social Security system that is now raising more money than \nit expends. The reason we have that is because Congress decided in 1983 \nthat we were going to face a crisis in Social Security at some point \nand we had to start saving for it.\n  In 1983, I was serving on the House Ways and Means Committee. We had \nto write the Social Security reform bill. A lot of people do not \nunderstand the magnitude of that bill. It increased FICA taxes for both \nthe employee and the employer. Certainly, all of them understand that. \nIt even stretched out the retirement age from 65 to 67. I bet a lot of \npeople do not know that is in the law. But it begins after the turn of \nthe century. It is phased in very gradually.\n  But this Social Security reform package made a lot of changes. One \nintent of that package was to try to require a savings each year in \norder to meet the need when the baby boomers retired after the turn of \nthe century, when the largest baby crop in American history hits \nretirement. Then we have serious financial problems with Social \nSecurity.\n  So the approach to reform that and respond to it was to say, ``Let us \nhave each year a forced savings in the Social Security system.'' And \nthis year, incidentally, it is about $69 billion. We will take in $69 \nbillion more in the Social Security system in revenue than we will \nspend out. Therefore, the surplus this one year will be nearly $70 \nbillion.\n  [[Page S3202]] Why are we doing that? Again, to save it for after the \nturn of the century when we are going to need it.\n  Now, is it being saved? No; I mean, technically there is a bond that \ngoes in the trust fund but, as all of us understand, the money is still \nused and it is customarily referred to as a pool of money that reduces \nwhat we call the Federal deficit. The Social Security revenues are used \nas an offset to reduce the operating budget deficit of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  And the fact is that we cannot continue to do that. That breaks the \npromise with the workers. It breaks the promise with the senior \ncitizens. Either we are going to save the money or we are not going to \nsave the money. But let us not have a charade in which we say we are \ngoing to tax you to raise more money than we need to spend at this \npoint and we promise to save it, but we really will not because it will \nbe used to offset spending.\n  Well, I think that there is general agreement by Members in this \nChamber that we have a debt crisis, a real problem. And what do we do \nabout it?\n  We just heard the speaker before the last, Senator Glenn from Ohio. \nHe accurately portrayed 2 years ago, when we had a very significant \nbudget debate and we were asked to vote on a budget bill that cut the \ndeficit over 5 years by $500 billion, we had to find all the votes for \nit on this side of the aisle. Not even one vote--one would expect \nsomebody would vote wrong accidentally from time to time; you know, \njust not quite understand it. You expect to get one vote from the other \nside just as a result of an accident. But we could not even get one \nvote.\n  So we had to figure out how we could come up with a plan that cut the \nbudget deficit by $500 billion. Some of it was not very popular. But I \nwas perfectly happy to do that because that is our job. We are required \nto do that. We ought to do a lot more of it. And we did it. So we \npassed this Budget Deficit Reduction Act and the deficit has gone down.\n  I mean, the deficit was around $270 billion. It has gone down about \n$90 billion or so. Actually, the real deficit is $250 billion. And, you \nknow, if you take the Social Security out, it was over $300 billion. \nNow it is down to about $250 billion.\n  But the point is, the deficit reduction package reduced the Federal \ndeficit, but people did not like it very well because the medicine is \nnot medicine that tastes very good. It is bitter-tasting medicine.\n  So we have come here today with another set of challenges and that \nis, following on the heels of 2 years ago when we passed the Deficit \nReduction Act, and understanding that we did not pass health care \nreform and understanding that health care costs keep going up, not just \nup a bit but way up in the long term, the question is how do you then \nrespond to an even greater challenge in the outyears? Do you continue \nto have increasing Federal deficits now in the outyears, because we \nhave not been able to control health care costs? Or do we find a way to \ndo something about that?\n  Some say, ``Well, let's change the Constitution. Let's put in the \nConstitution a requirement that in 7 years, we balance the budget.''\n  I am willing to consider that. I have voted for a constitutional \namendment in the past. I hope I will vote for one in the future, and I \nmay vote for this one, depending on a couple of caveats. I am going to \nraise those questions today, as I have raised them earlier today with \nthose who have been the principal authors of this legislation.\n  The question is not whether we do something. The question is how we \ndo something about this debt crisis. Do we pass a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget? If we do, what kind of amendment will \nwe pass?\n  Will we, after we consider a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget and vote on it, if we enact it, restore some thread of \nconfidence with the American people?\n  No, we will not have done anything, not even one penny's worth of \nprogress to responding to the debt issue, by passing the constitutional \namendment. No one here would stand, in my judgment, and allege that \ndoing anything to deal with the deficit is going to be a part of this \nconstitutional amendment.\n  The fact is, the amendment is simply words that will be a part of the \nconstitution. Now, that is important, very important. But, in and of \nitself, it does nothing to advance even one penny's worth towards \nreducing the deficit. That will have to be accomplished by a series of \nother steps, including taxing and spending decisions that the Congress \nwill have to confront. It can confront them with or without a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  The question is, what would provide the greatest likelihood to \nadvance toward the solution to this debt problem?\n  And let me ask a couple of questions that I have asked rhetorically \ntoday of those who are the principal sponsors.\n  The first has to do with Social Security. I know that we are told \nthat the Social Security System is a system that is important to \neveryone in this Chamber, and everyone believes that we ought to \nprotect and preserve the system. We continue to hear that time and time \nagain.\n  We also hear virtually everyone say that the design to collect more \nmoney now for the Social Security System and have an enforced surplus \nto be saved until after the turn of the century when we need it is a \ndesign that virtually everyone subscribes to and believes in.\n  So we had a vote on this constitutional amendment, on an amendment \noffered by Senator Reid, that said, ``All right. Let's change this so \nthat the definition of expenditures and receipts in the constitutional \namendment to balance the budget does not include expenditures and \nreceipts of the Social Security System.''\n  The reason? Because if you include expenditures and receipts of the \nSocial Security System--a system which, incidentally, is going to run \nvery large surpluses in the coming years that we are going to need to \nsave--if you do that, what you do is you create a circumstance by \ndesign that says we will balance the budget by using the Social \nSecurity trust funds to do so.\n  Well, you know, you would have to keep faith with one or the other, \nbut you cannot keep faith with both. Either we say to the senior \ncitizens and the workers who contribute the money that goes into this \ntrust fund that this is saved and we pledge that it is a dedicated tax \nput in a trust fund to be used only for one purpose, or we do not.\n  Then you say: Well, we are collecting this dedicated tax. Yes, it is \nregressive. Yes, we agreed to do it for Social Security, but we have \nchanged our minds. It is now going to be part of the operating budget \ndeficit and it will be used to lower the general operating budget \ndeficit of the United States.\n One of the two will be the case.\n\n  The question the Senate has to answer is which one of those two? We \nare told, ``Well, we really cannot do much about that at this point. \nMaybe that could be accomplished in implementing legislation in which \nwe describe what expenditures and receipts mean.''\n  If that is possible, and it may be possible that we describe what \nexpenditures and receipts mean in the implementing legislation and they \ndo not mean Social Security receipts and expenditures, then that will \nsolve the problem, in my judgment. That can be done by passing that \nportion of the implementing legislation prior to the vote tomorrow on \nthe constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  There is a way for that to be accomplished. If that is accomplished, \nthat will resolve my concerns with respect to the use of the Social \nSecurity revenues because the Senate will have spoken on that issue. \nBut the Senate has to make a decision: Is it going to allow in this \namendment the use of the Social Security reserves or surpluses to \nbalance the operating budget deficit, or is it going to use them to \nsave for the future?\n  It is not going to be both. It will be one or the other. We have \nalready had one occasion in which the implication was that we would use \nthe Social Security surpluses or trust funds to balance the operating \nbudget deficit. If that is the case, that is not satisfactory to me.\n  If, on the other hand, we are willing to say in implementing \nlegislation, prior to the vote tomorrow, that expenditures and receipts \nfrom the Social Security System are not included in the constitutional \namendment as expenditures and receipts, as a matter of definition, then \nthat resolves the problem, at least from my standpoint.\n  So the question whether that is resolved is not up to me. The \nquestion of \n[[Page S3203]] whether that is resolved is a matter of intent with \nrespect to those who offer the amendment and whether we can, through \namendment tomorrow, by passing part of the implementing legislation, \ndeal with that issue.\n  Let me mention the second issue that has been well discussed, and \nthat is the issue of enforcement. Senator Nunn has raised, and I think \nappropriately so, the question of how will the constitutional amendment \nbe enforced? Are we creating a constitutional amendment on fiscal \npolicy and asking the courts to be involved in taxing and spending \ndecisions, if, in fact, the Congress does not respond appropriately to \nwhat the Constitution requires?\n  If the answer to that is, yes, we will have the courts enforce the \nconstitutional provision on the balanced budget, then I think there is \nserious concern by a number of other Senators. This can be resolved \neasily, and it can be resolved quickly. It can be resolved by precisely \nthe addition of the amendment that was accepted last year ago when we \ndebated this.\n  Senator Danforth offered and the Senate accepted the provision on \nenforcement that deals with the declaratory judgment capability. That \nis exactly the way to solve this. Senator Nunn has raised the issue. \nOthers have. I say from my standpoint, we really ought to respond to \nthis issue in a forthright way. I think it can be responded to in a \nforthright way. If that is the case, if that is dealt with, then, once \nagain, I raise no objections about that issue.\n  I would like very much to see Congress advance a solution to this \ndebt crisis. That solution may very well be a constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget. But I would not be comfortable supporting a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget if riding on that vote \nwas $3/4 trillion of Social Security revenue used in the future to \noffset operating budget expenditures in order to show a lower deficit \nfor the Federal Government but which, at the same time, would mean we \nwould not have saved in the Social Security system that which we \npromised to save.\n  It seems to me that the fate of this constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget will be determined tomorrow by a judgment made by \nthose who offer the amendment on how they resolve, at least from my \nstandpoint, those two questions. What is the will of the Senate with \nrespect to the use of $3/4 trillion of Social Security funds? Are those \ntrust funds going to be used to balance the operating budget deficit, \nor are they going to be saved?\n  We are told it is hard to sift through all of this. It is hard \nbecause of procedural circumstances. We are told that it is difficult \nto do these things. Look, when we are passing a change in the U.S. \nConstitution, this Senate should work its will to make sure that that \nchange is exactly the kind of change we want and the country needs.\n  The last thing I want to do is make a mistake in amending the U.S. \nConstitution, because that is a mistake that cannot easily be \ncorrected. This is not, in my judgment, bumper sticker politics or \nsloganeering. It is deadly serious business when we are talking about \nchanging the basic Constitution of this country.\n  I have said before and I will say again, I think the debt crisis in \nthis country is sufficiently serious to warrant this serious discussion \nabout changing the Constitution, and I would be a part of those who are \nwilling to change the Constitution if the two issues I have mentioned \nare resolved. If they are not resolved, I will not be a part of that \nchange. The decision is not a decision I will make. The decision is a \ndecision that will be made by those who are crafting this and whether \nthey will allow the will of the Senate to be expressed on this issue of \nthe use of $3 to $4 trillion of Social Security funds and on the issue \nof enforcement.\n  Some say, ``Well, you voted for the balanced budget amendment \npreviously.'' Yes, I have. It was different in the sense that it \ncontained the enforcement provision provided by Senator Danforth. This \ndoes not. If they do that, it will make me more comfortable.\n  And one other thing has changed that is fundamental. We now have \nsomething called a Contract With America which proposes at the same \ntime that we face a serious debt crisis in our country, a massive tax \ncut, ingeniously, in the mind of some, concocted so that a smaller part \nof it occurs in the first 5 years of budget scoring and a much larger \nportion occurs in the second 5 years, a tax-cut proposal that will \nreduce revenues in 10 years by some $3 to $4 trillion, it is estimated.\n  I think it is very difficult to have a serious discussion about a tax \ncut at a time when we are also having a serious discussion about \nchanging the Constitution because this country has a debt crisis. In my \nown view, the job of the U.S. Senate is to find a way to cut spending. \nAnd, yes, we ought to be tough and cut spending and cut spending, and \nuse the money to cut the deficit.\n  Now, there is a judicious way to cut spending and another way to cut \nspending. You do not have to do it with a meat ax, and you can do it \nwith some judgment and some discipline. I confess that I am confused by \nthose who are the loudest voices for changing the Constitution so that \nwe would require a balanced budget, and who on the other side of their \ncoverall pockets are saying, ``We also want a $3 to $4 trillion tax \ncut. And we want more defense spending, and we also, by the way, want \nto resurrect Star Wars at the same time.''\n  I have no idea where these arithmetic books come from, but they did \nnot use them in my home school. I hope, as we work through all of this \nagenda, that we will come to a more focused agenda; that is, a \ndetermination by all Members, to head towards the same common goal: \nRelieve this country of a debt crisis that is getting worse, see if we \ncan move towards a balanced budget, and try to do the right thing for \nthis country's future.\n  I am willing to take risks. And I think we should be willing to take \nrisks these days to try to respond to this problem; if not for us, then \ncertainly for our children. But I am not willing to cast a vote for a \nconstitutional amendment unless it is the right constitutional \namendment, and I am hoping that, in the coming day or so, a couple of \nthe problems that we have had discussed at length discussions can be \naddressed. If that is the case, I will vote for the constitutional \namendment. If it is not the case, then those who have written this \nproposal will end up short of votes to pass this proposal.\n  Mr. President, I will be on the floor again tomorrow, and I assume we \nwill have additional discussions. I say again that the decision of \nwhether this constitutional amendment to balance the budget is enacted \nby the Senate is a decision that will be made by those who advance it, \nand whether or not they will allow the Senate to work its will on these \ntwo questions, from my standpoint, the use of the Social Security \nreserves and trust funds and, also, the question of enforcement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I have listened with great interest to the \nremarks of the distinguished Senator from North Dakota who, it seems to \nme, has made three points or sets of reservations about the balanced \nbudget amendment rather than two.\n  One is the failure to exempt Social Security from all calculations \nunder the amendment; the second is the absence of any provision in the \namendment that will prevent the courts of the United States from \narrogating to themselves the right to write balanced budgets; and third \nis the impact on attempting to balance the budgets of various proposals \nin the House of Representatives for reductions in taxes.\n  I say with all the sincerity at my command with respect to those \nconcerns of the Senator that two of the three, it seems to me, rather \nargue in favor of supporting this constitutional amendment than they do \nagainst it. The third is, as I believe the Senator from North Dakota \nknows, a concern which I share and share deeply.\n  Let me take the first two points first. The first question that \narises with respect to Social Security is, is the Social Security \nSystem protected in some way by a defeat of this constitutional \namendment in a way that it is not by its passage? Well, Mr. President, \nthe answer to that question is clearly no. In fact, I am convinced that \nthe Social Security System of this \n[[Page S3204]] country will be stronger and more secure with the \npassage of this constitutional amendment in its present form than it \nwill be either without a constitutional amendment at all or, \nalternatively, with a specific exemption in the constitutional \namendment itself.\n  It is clear that the Senator from North Dakota, who is genuinely \nagonized by the choice in front of him, does wish that we balance our \nbudget, does feel that the present system has failed to do so. And yet \nwith each year that passes under the present system, the pressure on \nSocial Security and, for that matter, on all other vital forms of \nspending in the United States, increases by reason of the failure of \nthis and other administrations and the Congress to deal with problems \nof the deficit.\n  No one can feel that early in the next century when this country, if \nwe make no changes in the way in which we operate, will literally have \nno money left for anything other than a handful of entitlements, no \nperson can feel that under those circumstances Social Security will not \nbe changed. It will, and it will be changed to the detriment of the \nrecipients of Social Security retirement income.\n  Bringing our fiscal house in order, therefore, protects rather than \nthreatens the Social Security System. And if, as I believe and the \nSenator from North Dakota believes, that we are not going to bring our \nhouse in order unless we establish some kind of external discipline, \nwhy then, Mr. President, the passage of this amendment in its present \nform is a protection for Social Security rather than a threat to it.\n  An addition to this amendment of a specific exemption for Social \nSecurity, I think, perhaps threatens the system even more because it \nwill provide, by such a huge exception to the requirement for a \nbalanced budget, an overwhelming temptation directed at future \nCongresses to redefine what is in Social Security, to include in the \nsystem all kinds of benefits which will go to the same classes of \npeople who benefit from Social Security today that are not now defined \nas Social Security or, alternatively, in order to balance the budget, a \nreduction in the Social Security payroll tax and, therefore, in present \nsurpluses in that system and a transfer of that taxing authority to the \ngeneral fund in order to balance the budget.\n  So an exemption of Social Security written into the Constitution will \nnot protect the system. A rejection of the constitutional amendment \nwill not protect the system. The system will, I am convinced, be \nprotected best by treating the budget deficit for what it is: A \nterrible threat to the country, a threat which Congress and Presidents \nhave been unable or unwilling to meet in the past, and dealing with it \nthrough a constitutional amendment which requires all parties, everyone \nin the country, but most particularly future Presidents and future \nMembers of Congress to be a part of the solution rather than a part of \nthe problem.\n  The difficulty, of course, is that Social Security receipts and \ndisbursements are receipts and disbursements of the United States. The \npayroll tax is a tax. Disbursements are disbursements. Markets, the \neconomy of the United States, are not fooled by saying that money goes \ninto and comes out of one pocket rather than another. If we are to \nbalance the budget, we must balance it with all receipts and all \nexpenditures, and those who are recipients of Social Security will be \nbest off if we recognize that fact because if we fail to do so, they \nwill be threatened along with everyone else.\n  On a second subject, Mr. President, I had not previously heard that \none of the arguments against this constitutional amendment is a set of \nproposals in the House of Representatives with respect to tax cuts. The \nPresident of the United States himself in his budget submission has \nproposed tax reductions somewhat more modest than those in the so-\ncalled Contract With America, probably less effective in rebuilding our \neconomy and opportunity for economic growth in the United States.\n  But again, with respect to a more liberal Member on the other side of \nthe aisle who opposes the tax reductions contained in the Contract With \nAmerica, it would seem to me that the existence of those promises would \nbe rather an argument in favor of this constitutional amendment than an \nargument against it, since it is obvious that a requirement that the \nbudget be balanced by the year 2002, as a matter of constitutional law, \nwill require all Members of Congress--those who favor tax reductions \nand those who do not--to look much more carefully at the budget \nimplications of each and every action, whether that action refers to \nspending or to taxing policies.\n  The third point made by the Senator from North Dakota, on the other \nhand, is one with which this Senator agrees. This Senator was one of \nseveral on this side of the aisle who voted in favor of an amendment \nproposed by the distinguished senior Senator from Louisiana a week or \nso ago to make clear that the responsibility for budget decisions, \nafter the passage of this amendment, rests exactly where it does now: \nWith the President and with the Congress of the United States, subject \nto the heavy discipline this amendment requires.\n  I do not wish courts substituting their judgment for the judgment of \nthose who are elected by the people of the United States to make these \nvital and important decisions for the people of the country by any \nstretch of the imagination. And I hope--I think it is perhaps \npossible--that that kind of change may be made in this constitutional \namendment. I am delighted with the thoughtful attitude toward it by the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  That is a proposal which, in my mind, would strengthen this \nconstitutional amendment. The other proposal would weaken it and would \nweaken the Social Security System at the same time.\n  Now, having listened to the last hour or so of debate on this floor, \nI am reminded of the set of categories with which I was impressed on \nthe very first day of the debate on this constitutional amendment; and \nthat is that Members of this body are divided into three groups with \nrespect to the budget of the United States.\n  There is clearly a group of liberal Members, that does not include \nthe Senator from North Dakota, that simply does not believe in a \nbalanced budget at all, who like the status quo, who favor the present \nsystem, who believe that deficits are not harmful to economic growth or \nto the prosperity of the people of the United States of America.\n  Those Members are and should be opposed to a constitutional amendment \nwhich makes an unbalanced budget a much more difficult task to \nundertake than it is at the present time.\n  There is, in addition, Mr. President, a second group, a group \nrepresented at least in the original instance by the remarks of the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Ohio about 1 hour ago, who tell us \nthat they believe deeply and passionately in a balanced budget but that \nwe ought to do it ourselves; that we should not engage in a change in \nthe Constitution; that it is simply a matter of discipline.\n  Then there is the third and largest group--whether it includes 67 \nMembers or not will be determined about 24 hours from right now--a \nthird and larger group which believes that the present system is \nbroken, that a balanced budget is desirable--in fact it is imperative \nif we are to do our duty to generations yet to come--which in many \ncases has tried varying formulae for bringing the budget into balance \nwithout a change in the fundamental system itself and observe simply as \na result of our history that it has not worked; that the system is \nbroken; that we need a radical change, a new direction; and that that \nnew direction is represented by the amendment to the Constitution which \nis before us right now.\n  The difficulty with opposition to this amendment, in my view, Mr. \nPresident, is just this. The first and second categories tend to have a \nfuzzy distinction between them, tend to meld into one another. The \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio began his speech by demanding a \ndiscipline on the part of Members of the Congress: do the job \nourselves, do what we were sent here to do, do not ask for \nconstitutional changes in order to do it. Then he launched into a \ncriticism of all of the possible ways of reducing spending so that the \nbudget might be balanced. He seemed to move, in other words, from \ncategory 2 into category 1. We should discipline ourselves; we should \nbalance the budget on our own hook; but it would be a terrible threat \nto deal with any of the \n[[Page S3205]] really expensive spending programs which in total result \nin our having a budget that is unbalanced.\n  It is in that second category, it seems to me now, that the President \nof the United States falls. We have heard a great deal about the fiscal \ndiscipline and the political courage that was involved in passing the \nbudget here just 2 years ago which significantly increased taxes \nwithout significantly reducing spending and resulted in, or was \ncoincident with at the time of rising economic growth, a relatively \nmodest decline in the budget deficit.\n  However, that budget year is over, and we now have a proposal from \nthe President that never, even under very rosy economic growth \nprojections, results in a budget deficit of significantly less than \n$200 billion a year as far as the eye can see--5 years, 10 years, \nbeyond that period of time--which suggests some modest tax reductions \nand even more modest spending reductions. It overwhelmingly lacks \ncourage, a status quo budget, and it is perhaps the best single \nillustration of why we must pass this constitutional amendment.\n  When a President, who made deficit reduction the heart of his message \nduring his first year as President, abandons that goal totally, lock, \nstock, and barrel, by the third year of his Presidency, it is clear we \nneed to change the system under which we operate.\n  Of course, it is exactly that change which is proposed in this \nconstitutional amendment. The dynamics of its passage and its \nratification by the people of the United States will clearly be \ndramatic. If this proposal were a part of the Constitution of the \nUnited States today, the President of the United States could not \nvalidly have submitted the budget to us which he has before us right \nnow. He would be required by his oath of office, by the Constitution of \nthe United States itself, to be a part of the solution rather than part \nof the problem. Political cowardice would instead be political folly, \nan abandonment of a constitutional duty.\n  Many of us here might not like the proposals of this President with \nrespect to balancing the budget, but he would have been required to \npropose such a course of action. And for those of us who dislike it, we \nwould have been required to come up with an alternative.\n  Now, anyone can speak of the desirability of balancing the budget in \nthe abstract and the lack of desirability of cutting any spending \nprograms in reality, and there is no penalty for taking such a course \nof action. As and when this proposal becomes a part of the Constitution \nof the United States, there will be a huge penalty for such a course of \naction. Presidents and Members of Congress will be required to come up \nwith budgets that either reduce spending or increase taxes or both. And \nif at some time there is a return to the majority of those who believe \nin higher taxes--a group clearly not in the majority today--they will \nbe able to do so. There is nothing in this constitutional amendment \nthat prevents balancing the budget on the backs of taxpayers of the \nUnited States. There is a clear majority in this body right now who \nwill not do so. But if an election campaign is run successfully on the \nproposition that we need higher taxes, a Congress which wins on that \nplatform will be able to do so. By the same token, those who believe \nthat spending needs to be cut will be under the gun; they will be \nrequired to produce; and the President will be required to come up with \nsome kind of proposal or another, better and more responsible than the \nproposal that we received from this President this year.\n  The dynamics of this constitutional amendment, Mr. President, are \nsimply this: Everyone in elected office will have to be a part of the \nsolution. Everyone will have to be a part of the game rather than \nallowing the challenge simply to be kicked down the road, left to the \nnext administration, to the next Congress, to the next group of people \nwho come here.\n  How much better off we would be had a proposal such as this been \npassed some years ago, but if we have learned anything in the course of \nthe last decade or decade and a half, it is that the most sincere \nstatutory solutions, like Gramm-Rudman, do not work because they get \nabandoned as soon as the shoe begins to pinch.\n  There is, in my view, no solution to the fiscal problems facing this \ncountry--no solution that will free our economy, no solution that will \ncreate more and more opportunities for the present generations and \ngenerations yet to come except to make the kind of changes proposed in \nthis constitutional amendment.\n  It is clear that tomorrow's vote is going to be absolutely vital for \nthe future of this country. It is clear that a majority of the people \nof the country want this constitutional amendment. It is clear that a \nmajority of the Members of this body want that constitutional \namendment.\n  What remains unclear is whether the necessary two-thirds in this body \nwill follow logic, reason, and the will of their constituents and refer \nthis constitutional amendment to the States of the United States for \nratification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate what the Senator from \nWashington has just been saying. I have been on the floor listening to \nhim. He is one of the people I admire most in this body. He has been \nthe attorney general of his State. He knows the legalities and the \nimportance of doing this as a constitutional amendment. I am very \npleased he is one of the leaders in this effort.\n  I would just like to say it is the most important vote that I will \ncast in my public life. That is how important the vote tomorrow is, in \nmy opinion, for our future generations of this country. So I do think \nwe need to focus on the basic issues.\n  The first one is why? Why do we need this to be a constitutional \namendment? The national debt is a cancer on this country and we are \npassing it to our children and grandchildren. It is now over $4 \ntrillion; $17,600 for every man, woman, and child in this country. For \na family of four this is over $70,000 in debt. If a family of four has \na $70,000 debt, that is a big responsibility. That is a burden on the \nshoulders of that family. You have to pay it out over time and it is \nnot easy. In fact, every family of four in this country has the $70,000 \ndebt that we will only be able to erase if we pass this amendment \ntomorrow. It is soaking up capital that we need for investment in our \nbusinesses, and it is 26 percent of our budget that we are paying in \ninterest.\n  That money could be going into investment capital for investment in \nequipment that would create jobs, that would help our economy and would \nhelp the people of our country get back to work. But instead, that \nmoney is just going to pay interest on the national debt.\n  It has been getting worse just in the last few years. Since 1975, 20 \nyears ago, our per capita debt has increased more than sevenfold. So it \nis something that is getting worse, not better. In fact, the per capita \ndebt has increased $900 just since we started debating this amendment \nearlier this month. It is $900. You have seen the charts. It just keeps \ngoing up as we talk. We must take drastic action. This is for the \nConstitution.\n  Let us take some of their arguments. Their arguments are: Do it by \nstatute. We can do it if we have the resolve to do it. But in fact we \nhave tried for the last 30 years to do what was right and Congress \nfound it was always easier to spend than it was to cut. They found it \nwas even easier to tax than to curb that voracious appetite for \nspending. I think we have to take the very important step of getting \nthis country back on track. We have tried to do it by statute. We tried \nGramm-Rudman. We tried the 1990 budget agreement. But every time \nsomething comes up and Congress wimps out and we do not start balancing \nthe budget. We must have a constitutional mandate if it is really going \nto work. We have tried everything else. If we are going to do what is \nright we must do it by amendment.\n  Some of the opponents say: Tell us where you are going to cut. We \nwill probably vote with you if we know where you are going to cut. It \nwould be a year from now before we could get through all of these \narguments and then go to the argument of how we are going to make these \ncuts on sort of a try it basis, not for real.\n  No, every business and every household in America cuts their budget \nthe same way. They determine what is the priority, what is the revenue, \nand then \n[[Page S3206]] they say: OK, here is what we have to spend. They do not \nsay here is what I would like to spend and I will just take care of it \nlater. They do what every State does, they find out what the revenue is \nand then they prioritize their needs. I do not know why the Federal \nGovernment does not get it. I do not know why the U.S. Congress cannot \nfigure out that we, too, can do what every State, every business and \nevery household in America does and that is determine what the revenue \nis and then decide what the spending priorities are. That is the \nresponsible way to approach the budget.\n  There have been legitimate arguments on the issue of exempting Social \nSecurity. I think a lot of people have thought why do you not set \nSocial Security aside? Of course we believe Social Security is \ninviolate. But we are talking about amending our Constitution. We have \nseen what Congress has already done to Social Security without one vote \nby any Republican in the Congress, on the House side or the Senate \nside. Taxes were increased on Social Security.\n  I do not think we can assume Congress is going to do the responsible \nthing. Let us see what would happen if we exempted Social Security. All \nof a sudden more things would be moved into Social Security. We would \nhave Social Security take up welfare; perhaps Medicaid. Everything that \nCongress wanted to stuff outside of the quota that will be established \nwith a balanced budget amendment would just be locked into Social \nSecurity and there is nothing to prevent it.\n  If you are going to exempt anything you cannot have a balanced budget \namendment. It will not be effective if anything is exempted out because \nwhatever it is will then get everything that Congress wants to put in \nthat will not count against the restraints that we will put on \nourselves through a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution.\n  I am going to support Social Security and the veracity of our Social \nSecurity system as long as I am in public life. But if we take that \noutside of this constitutional amendment we will not protect Social \nSecurity. It will be the opposite. We will make Social Security more \nprecarious than it is now because we will not have the ability to say: \nThis is the budget. Here is the revenue. And we are going to live \nwithin our means like every family and every business and every State \nin this country strives to do.\n  Senator Paul Simon, the Senator from Illinois, has been one of the \nprime movers in the balanced budget amendment. I admire and respect him \ngreatly. Last year, when he cosponsored this amendment, he got all \nwound up and he said the reason that there were so many heroes at the \nAlamo is because there was no back door.\n  I love Senator Simon but I had to come down on the floor and say to \nmy distinguished colleague that his facts were wrong but his point was \nright. The fact is, there was a back door at the Alamo. It was a line \ndrawn in the sand and every man at the Alamo was given the choice of \ncrossing the line to fight for the independence of Texas, or to leave \nat that time. And every man at the Alamo voluntarily walked across that \nline, and Jim Bowie was carried in his stretcher across that line, to \nsay we are going to commit ourselves to fight for the independence of \nTexas and we are going to voluntarily close that door. So they were \nheroes. They were real American heroes.\n  But Senator Simon was making a point, and the point was right. That \nis the same thing that we can do right here tomorrow; that is, close \nthe back door, become a hero. The vote tomorrow is what is right for \nthe long-term future of this country. That is what will close the door, \nand we will do it in a responsible manner because it is the right thing \nto do for our children to stop this $18,000 debt that they have over \ntheir heads right now. Yes. This is the most important vote that we \nwill ever cast.\n  Thomas Jefferson, one of our Founding Fathers, must have feared that, \nin all of the thinking about what might come in the future, perhaps \nthere would be a tendency to spend more money because he probably \nsensed that it is human nature to want to spend the money to do the \ngood things that all of us would like to do. Two hundred years ago, \nThomas Jefferson said:\n\n        The question whether one generation has the right to bind \n     another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts and morally bound to pay them \n     ourselves.\n\n  Thomas Jefferson went on to say:\n\n       There does not exist an engine so corruptive of the \n     government and so demoralizing of the nation as a public \n     debt. It will bring us more ruin at home than all of the \n     enemies from abroad.\n\n  He realized that this is not something that should be done just by \nstatute. If it is really going to have teeth, he questioned whether it \nshould not go into the framework of our Government, the policy \nstatements that will last through the generations. And I think his \ninstincts were right, and they have been proven so as our country has \ngone headlong into over a $4 trillion debt. While Thomas Jefferson was \nvery farsighted, I do not think even he could have foreseen a $4 \ntrillion debt. But he knew that there was the possibility that weak \nCongresses would spend now and pay later.\n  We have the ability to do what I think Thomas Jefferson thought we \nshould have done in the first place; that is, put in our framework of \nGovernment, if we think something is so important, that we will put it \non our priority list and we will pay for it now, and if it is not that \nimportant, it does not meet the test of responsible governing.\n  So I hope that we will take this monumental opportunity that we have \ntomorrow. It is probably the best chance we are going to have in my \nlifetime to do what is right to get this country back on track and to \npass a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution so that our State \nlegislatures, while they are meeting now, will have the opportunity to \nratify or not ratify, but will have the opportunity to vote on this \nvery important framework of Government issue. And I hope we do the \nright thing.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bond). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there are three amendments that I have \noffered which I want to describe tonight to the body.\n  First, I am offering two amendments regarding the vote of the Vice \nPresident of the United States in the two situations in which the \nbalanced budget amendment calls for a constitutional majority. Section \n4 states:\n\n       No bill to increase revenues shall become law unless \n     approved by a majority of the whole number of each House by a \n     rollcall vote.\n\n  Section 5 states:\n\n       Provisions of this article may be waived for any fiscal \n     year in which the United States is engaged in military \n     conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat \n     to national security and is so declared by a joint resolution \n     adopted by a majority of the whole number of each House which \n     becomes law.\n\n  So the question has arisen in debate as to whether or not the \nlanguage in these provisions ``the whole number of each House'' would \ndeny the Vice President of the United States a vote to break a 50-to-50 \ntie. While it is clear that 51 votes would be necessary under this \nprovision, it is unclear whether the Vice President would be denied a \nvote in an equal division of 50 to 50. Why should he or she be so \ndenied? The Vice President is not denied a vote in a 50-to-50 tie \nsituation anywhere else in the Constitution. The proponents of the \nbalanced budget amendment in the House and the Senate have not agreed \nabout the effect of this language. In the House of Representatives, the \nchief sponsor of this constitutional amendment, Representative Schaefer \nof Colorado, stated in the Congressional Record on January 26:\n\n       This language is not intended to preclude the Vice \n     President in his or her constitutional capacity as President \n     of the Senate from casting a tie-breaking vote that would \n     produce a 51-50 result.\n\n  Representative Schaefer goes on to say:\n\n       Nothing in section 4 of the substitute takes away the Vice \n     President's right to vote under such circumstances.\n\n  However, the principal Senate sponsor, the Senator from Utah, stated \non the floor of the Senate on February 16 \n[[Page S3207]] that the Vice President would be denied the deciding \nvote in a 50-50 situation. He went on to cite the example of the \nPresident's 1993 deficit reduction package, which was passed by a 51 to \n50 vote with the Vice President casting the deciding vote, as \nlegislation which would not have passed had this constitutional \namendment then been in effect.\n  Mr. President, the two amendments which I have offered are very \nstraightforward. One makes it clear that the Vice President has a vote. \nIf that fails, the other would say that he does not.\n  Think for a moment about a future situation like the Persian Gulf \nwar. A future President required to make a decision about the \ndeployment of thousands of American troops, in a situation in which he \nmight not know if they would be attacked or required to enter into \nhostilities, might well not be able to assess whether the outlays \nrequired to support those troops would exceed the balanced budget \nbecause he does not know if hostilities will occur. But he would be \nreluctant, properly, to deploy those troops without the certain \nknowledge that they would be unequivocally given the necessary \nresources to support them in the field, if attacked or if needed. \nApproval of such authority might be a close question as it was in the \ncase of the gulf war.\n  What if we faced a 50-to-50 vote to waive under section 5? With the \nlanguage unclear, is it not likely that the Vice President would be in \nthe chair, and that he or she would vote? Would there then be a point \nof order raised that his vote was unconstitutional under section 5? \nWhat if the Senate voted 50 to 50 on the constitutional point of order? \nThe Vice President might then break that tie. Might not the law \nproviding the waiver then be subject to a lawsuit arguing that it was \nunconstitutional because the Vice President had voted? Should we invite \nthis sort of constitutional crisis by leaving ambiguity in the \namendment? I say no.\n  I would prefer that we approve the first of these amendments, thus \npreserving a vote for the Vice President. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst tabling amendment No. 310. However, Mr. President, I hope that \nthose who believe that the Vice President should have no vote in such \ncircumstances would support amendment No. 311.\n  Logically, every Senator, in my view, should support one amendment or \nthe other. A vote to table both is a vote to leave this proposed \nconstitutional amendment ambiguous on a matter of considerable \nimportance. I will reiterate one critical point. The chief sponsors in \nthe House have specifically indicated in a formal answer on the record \nthat it is not intended to deny the Vice President a vote in these \ncircumstances. The chief sponsors in the Senate have denied that it is \nintended to deny the Vice President a vote in these circumstances. This \nis not a record which should be allowed to remain in this condition. \nThe stakes are simply too huge and we should clarify this one way or \nthe other.\n  Mr. President, the constitutional amendment we would be voting on \ntomorrow does not balance the budget. By its own terms, some future \nCongress would still need to adopt enforcement and implementation \nlegislation to achieve a balanced budget. The argument has been made \nthat we have tried everything. We have tried legislation; we have tried \nstatutes; we have tried passing laws. Why not a constitutional \namendment?\n  The argument goes: ``We can't depend on legislation, so let's try a \nconstitutional amendment.''\n  So what does the constitutional amendment do? It depends on the same \nkind of legislation. The exact same kind of legislation needs to be \nenacted under the terms of this constitutional amendment which the \nsponsors of the amendment say has previously been ineffective.\n  The constitutional amendment may sound fiscally conservative, but it \nwill delay the day of reckoning for up to 7 years and it will still \ndepend upon congressional action for there to be a reckoning even then.\n  I have offered an amendment to the constitutional amendment. My \namendment would require this Congress to pass the needed enforcement \nlegislation and not pass the buck to a future Congress to pass the \nenforcement legislation, which is so critical if this constitutional \namendment be effective.\n  My amendment provides that the constitutional amendment, if we adopt \nit tomorrow, would be submitted to the States for ratification only \nafter we have enacted legislation specifying the means for implementing \nand enforcing its call for a balanced budget.\n  Now, there are two advantages to this approach. First, it places the \nresponsibility on us instead of leaving it to the future. Second, the \nStates would be informed how the enforcement mechanism would work so \nthey could consider that in their ratification deliberations.\n  First, Mr. President, there is no doubt that for this amendment to be \neffective, a Congress must pass enforcement or implementing \nlegislation. Section 6 reads that:\n\n       The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by \n     appropriate legislation.\n\n  This is different from most other amendments to the Constitution and \nmost other provisions in the Constitution.\n  For instance, the 14th amendment says that ``Congress shall have the \npower to enforce,'' but it is not dependent upon the Congress adopting \nlegislation. The 15th amendment says that ``Congress shall have the \npower to enforce.'' Again, a court decision has decided it is not \ndependent upon Congress adopting enforcement language. The 19th \namendment, ``Congress shall have the power to enforce''; the 23rd \namendment, ``Congress shall have the power to enforce''; the 24th \namendment, ``Congress shall have the power to enforce''; the 26th \namendment, ``Congress shall have the power to enforce''; the 18th \namendment, ``Congress and the several States shall have concurrent \npower to enforce.''\n  The 13th amendment, the amendment which abolished slavery, provides \nthat ``Congress shall have the power to enforce.'' But the 13th \namendment, like the others I have described, is not dependent on \nlegislation. It is enforceable without legislation.\n  It would be unthinkable, I believe, for any of us to believe that the \n13th amendment, or an amendment like it, would pass which said \nsomething like the following: Slavery will be abolished in this country \nwhen Congress enacts legislation to abolish it.\n  The 13th amendment and the other amendments which I have described \nare self-enforcing. They do not depend upon legislation for them to be \nenforced.\n  Mr. President, the importance of the need for Congress to adopt \nimplementing legislation has been discussed and described by many, many \npeople. The most recent Director of the Congressional Budget Office, \nMr. Reischauer, said the following about this issue. He said, ``First \nof all,'' and here I think he is in agreement with most, if not all, of \nus, ``a large reduction in Government borrowing is highly desirable.'' \nBut then he said that ``A balanced budget amendment, on its own, does \nnot advance the chances for lowering Federal borrowing.''\n  ``A balanced budget amendment, on its own, does not advance the \nchances for lowering Federal borrowing.'' He put it another way in his \ntestimony. That ``A balanced budget amendment, in and of itself, is not \na solution, rather it is only a repetition in an even louder voice of \nan intention that has been stated over and over again during the course \nof the last 50 years.'' He went on to say that ``A balanced budget \namendment, in and of itself, will neither produce a plan nor allocate \nresponsibility for producing.'' In perhaps his most pointed comment, he \nsaid that ``Without credible legislation for the transition that \nembodies an effective mechanism for enforcement''--an effective \nmechanism for enforcement-- ``Government borrowing is not going to be \ncut.'' And he concluded that thought by saying, ``But the transitional \nlegislation and the enforcement mechanism are 95 percent of the battle. \nIf we could get agreement on those,'' he said, ``we would not need a \nconstitutional amendment.''\n  Yet, this constitutional amendment depends on there being an \nagreement on an enforcement mechanism by a future Congress.\n  Supporters and sponsors of this legislation have said in the past, \nover the years that this constitutional amendment was being considered, \nthat enforcement legislation is critical to its success.\n  [[Page S3208]] Senator Domenici, back in 1982, said that ``Congress \nis going to have to pass some very difficult enabling legislation to \ncarry out the purposes of this amendment.''\n  Senator Thurmond, in August of 1992, said: ``The amendment would not \nbe self-enforcing. There would be a clear responsibility upon Congress \nto develop procedures to ensure that it is capable of satisfying its \nnew constitutional responsibilities under the proposed amendment.'' \nAgain, he said back in 1982, ``There is no serious question that \nCongress will have to develop effective implementing legislation.''\n  Senator Hatch, the prime sponsor of this legislation, in March of \n1986, said the following:\n\n       There is no question that Congress would have to pass \n     implementing legislation to make it effective. In that sense, \n     it is not self-executing. It would be the obligation of \n     Congress, after the amendment is passed by both Houses and \n     ratified by three-quarters of the States, to, of course, \n     enact legislation that would cause a balanced budget to come \n     about.\n\n  The committee report for this legislation says the following:\n\n       Congress has a positive obligation to fashion legislation \n     to enforce this article. An amendment dealing with subject \n     matter as complicated as the Federal budget process must be \n     supplemented with implementing legislation.\n\n  In a colloquy that I had with Senator Simon the last time that this \namendment was before this body, we had the following questions and \nanswers:\n\n       Mr. Levin. . . . How would the monitoring of the flow and \n     receipts of outlays be done to determine whether the budget \n     for any fiscal year is on the track of being balanced? Would \n     this require implementing legislation?\n       Mr. Simon. There would have to be monitoring, and future \n     legislation would have to take care of the implementation of \n     that monitoring.\n       Mr. Levin. What exactly is the definition of receipts and \n     outlays? Specifically, would the receipts and outlays to the \n     Bonneville Power Administration be receipts and outlays of \n     the United States pursuant to this constitutional amendment? \n     Would the answer to these questions require implementing \n     legislation?\n       Mr. Simon. Implementing legislation will be needed on some \n     of these peripheral questions. . .\n       Mr. Levin. . . . In an instance in which the Office of \n     Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office \n     disagree with each other on what a level of outlays is, how \n     will the dispute be resolved so that it can be determined \n     whether or not outlays exceed receipts?\n       Mr. Simon. Future legislation will have to take care of \n     this.\n       Mr. Levin. Who will determine the level of receipts and \n     whether a revenue bill is ``a bill to increase revenues\"? . . \n     .\n       Mr. Simon. That will also have to be determined through \n     future legislation.\n       Mr. Levin. At what point will it be determined that outlays \n     will in fact exceed revenues and that action such as a tax \n     increase, spending cuts, or tapping into a rainy day fund \n     will be required? . . .\n       Mr. Simon. . . . future legislation will work out the \n     details.\n\n  The importance of enforcement legislation is recognized inside the \nconstitutional amendment itself. In section 6--and the report of the \ncommittee makes it clear that within section 6 it says that the \nCongress shall enforce and implement this article by appropriate \nlegislation--the words of section 6, in the words of the committee \nreport:\n\n       This section recognizes that an amendment must be \n     supplemented with implementing legislation.\n\n  Again, Senator Hatch, the distinguished chief sponsor of this \nlegislation, said as recently as January 30 that:\n\n       Moreover, under section 6 of the amendment, Congress must, \n     and I emphasize must, mandate exactly what type of \n     enforcement mechanism it wants, whether it be sequestration, \n     rescission, or the establishment of a contingency fund.\n\n  Mr. President, there have been a number of critical questions raised \nduring this debate that have also been left to enforcement legislation. \nThere is the question of impoundment. Will the President have the right \nto impound under this constitutional provision? The answer is, that \nwill be determined by implementing legislation.\n  Then the question is, what is the role of the courts? An absolutely \nessential question for many Members of this body, indeed a question so \nessential that some votes may be dependent upon making certain that the \ncourts will not be able to raise taxes or to veto appropriations.\n  And, by the way, the chief sponsor in the House said specifically in \na question and answer colloquy that a court could have the right to \nveto an appropriation or a revenue.\n  These are absolutely essential questions to not be left ambiguous. \nThe answer is future enforcement legislation will determine whether or \nnot the court will have any such authority.\n  Well, it is not good enough to leave the critical issues and the \nteeth to future enforcement legislation when this Congress can and \nshould adopt that legislation prior to this amendment going to the \nStates, assuming, again, that it passes the Senate tomorrow. There is \nno reason why we should not accept the responsibility of deciding what \nis in that enforcement legislation, what the teeth will be, what the \nsequestration mechanism will be, and not just simply kick the \nenforcement can down the road.\n  If we do that, it means there is no hook. We are off the hook for 7 \nyears, at least, because 2002 is the first year it is enforced. And we \nmay find there is no hook then.\n  Mr. President, it has been said if this constitutional amendment is \nadopted, that we will adopt some future implementation legislation; \nbecause we have all taken an oath to uphold the Constitution, that that \nwill increase pressure on Members to adopt enforcement legislation.\n  First of all, our oath to the Constitution does not require, does not \nassure, we will be able to agree on any particular mechanism or set of \nprocedures to carry out the constitutional amendment if it is adopted. \nThe oath we take is not a group oath, it is an individual oath. As \nindividuals, we would be duty bound to carry out the intent of the \nConstitution, of course, duty bound to support an endorsement \nmechanism, presumably. But that is far different from language being \nself-enforcing, because there is no assurance that a majority of the \nCongress would agree on the same mechanism, even though every Member \nmight carry out his constitutional duty and vote for one enforcement \nmechanism or another.\n  To the extent that the Constitution adds some pressure to reach a \nmajority decision on an enforcement mechanism, that pressure would be \nsignificantly enhanced and made much more real if the Senate adopts my \namendment tomorrow.\n  Under my approach, the pending constitutional amendment--assuming, of \ncourse, that two-thirds of the Congress votes for it--would be sent to \nthe States for ratification only after the enforcement legislation is \npassed. And to the extent that there is a hammer on Members in the \nlanguage of the pending amendment to adopt enforcement language down \nthe road, there is a hammer on Members to adopt the enforcement \nlegislation if the pending constitutional amendment is not sent to the \nStates for ratification until after we adopt that enforcement mechanism \nlegislation.\n  Now, without my amendment, if we adopt a constitutional provision \ntomorrow, it is but an empty promise. It would allow the Congress to \nput off adopting the credit implementation legislation, and therefore \nallow the argument to be made that the deficit was cured, although, in \nfact, the strong medicine has not even been taken.\n  There are two advantages, again, to adopting this amendment. First, \nit places the responsibility on this Congress instead of leaving it to \na future Congress. We should not kick that enforcement can down the \nroad to some uncertain time and some uncertain fate. Enacting a clear \nmechanism for enforcing the constitutional amendment before the \namendment goes to the States is a way of assuring that we meet our \nresponsibility instead of abdicating it.\n  Second, the States would be informed how that mechanism would work so \nthat they could consider that in their ratification deliberations. This \nwould not be a long delay. We were given assurances by the Senator from \nUtah the other night relative to part of the enforcement legislation as \nit relates to the courts, assurances that were given to the Senator \nfrom Georgia, that that could be worked out during a summit by the end \nof the summer. I believe he said this need not be a long delay. This is \njust a matter of months to be sure \n[[Page S3209]] that we do not just say, in a constitutional amendment, \nsome future Congress should adopt enforcement legislation to achieve a \nbalanced budget.\n  My amendment, if adopted, would make sure that if we adopt a \nconstitutional amendment, that before we send it to the States for \nratification, that we adopt an enforcement mechanism to achieve a \nbalanced budget. That will make it much more likely. I am very \nconcerned that enforcement mechanism would be adopted and that it would \nthen be subject to the scrutiny of the States in determining whether or \nnot they should ratify this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will not be long. I understand that the \nSenator from Maryland would like to speak.\n  I would like to point out one more time about our balanced budget \ndebt tracker. We only have 1 more day to go. We might as well finish \nwhat we started, and that is after the 27th, we were $22 billion in \ndebt; after the 28th, we will be up to $23 billion; the 28th day, we \nhave added to our deficit of $4.8 trillion since the beginning of this \ndebate. Frankly, we are now in day 29, and here we are, as we debated \nthis matter, we are now up to $24,053,760,000 in additional debt to the \nbaseline of $4.8 trillion since we started debating. We will be adding \none more of these green debt tracker slots tomorrow, the 30th day since \nwe started debate on this matter.\n  It is apparent this will go up every day we do not pass a balanced \nbudget amendment. It is apparent we will have to have $300 billion a \nyear in added deficits, maybe $350 billion a year in added deficits \nevery year that we do not do something about this. So this balanced \nbudget debt tracker is a very, very, important indication of just where \nwe are going.\n  We have to do something about it. Everybody admits that. Are we going \nto do business as usual, which is where we have been for the last 60 \nyears--certainly, the last 36 years, when we have only balanced the \nbudget once--or are we really going to do something new here, something \nthat would work, to put the pressure on Presidents to have to do \nsomething about bringing the budget into balance, and something that \nwould put pressure on Members of Congress to make priority choices \namong competing programs?\n  If we do not do that, we are mortgaging the future of our children \nand grandchildren. I hate to see that. Tomorrow is a big day. By the \nend of the day, we will know whether we passed a balanced budget \namendment, and I hope we will. I will limit my remarks to that and the \nchart tomorrow, and hopefully we can finish tomorrow in a short time.\n  Mr. President, the opponents of the balanced budget amendment seem to \nhave an infatuation with requiring the implementation plans before we \npass the balanced budget amendment. This latest version requires us to \npass the implementing legislation before we pass the amendment itself. \nThis is, to say the least, a peculiar way of proceeding.\n  This amendment is a requirement that we put the cart before the \nhorse. Mr. President, how can we implement a constitutional amendment \nwhich has not yet been ratified?\n  If the Framers worked as this proposal suggests we should, all \nFederal laws would have had to be passed before there was even a \nCongress to pass them. Does the Senator believe we should have had to \nchoose all the jurors for a trial before we adopted the sixth \namendment? Or pass the 1964 Civil Rights Act before we adopted the 14th \namendment?\n  This type of amendment is a perfect example of why we need the \nbalanced budget amendment. Congress is always looking for a way out--a \nway to stave off responsibility. And the Congress knows that the \nbalanced budget amendment means that it will be held responsible for \nits actions.\n  It also confuses the debate about the rule with the debate about \noutcomes within the rule. The proponents are interrupting the \ndiscussion of the rules until the outcomes within the rules can be \ndetermined. It is like stopping the discussion of the rules of a poker \ngame until it can be determined what hands will be dealt. We need to \nestablish this new regime of rules before we can start implementing it.\n  Mr. President, I have made it as clear as I possibly can that after \nthe balanced budget amendment is ratified, I will be more than happy to \nwork with any Member of the Senate in drafting the implementing \nlegislation. I cannot do any more than that. It is simply not possible \nto do as the proposed amendment seeks, to pass the implementing \nlegislation before the balanced budget amendment is ratified.\n  I hope we can put this proposal aside and move back the real issue at \nhand--will we stop the Government's slide into an endless pit of debt \nor stand idly by and watch as the country falls into economic crisis?\n             in opposition to the balanced budget amendment\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the distinguished scholars and \nadministrators of the Jerome Levy Economics Institute of Bard College \nplaced an advertisement in this morning's Washington Post which \ndelineated the perils of writing economic policy into the U.S. \nConstitution. This document deserves the fullest attention of the \nSenate and I ask unanimous consent that the entire text be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the item was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 27, 1995]\n\n                       An Invitation to Disaster\n\n       The Balanced Budget Amendment would destroy the ability of \n     the United States government to prevent economic depressions, \n     to respond to natural disasters, to protect the savings of \n     tens of millions of working Americans, and, over time, to \n     enable the economy to grow.\n       The ability of the federal government to pump money into an \n     ailing economy has time and again in the postwar era limited \n     the depth and duration of a recession and prevented a \n     depression. During the 1957-58 recession, the Eisenhower \n     administration deliberately increased the deficit. That \n     strategy brought a rapid end to the decline. During every \n     recession thereafter, either by design or through \n     circumstance, a deficit was crucial in containing and ending \n     the decline. For example, tax reductions adopted in 1981 were \n     not planned as a counter-recession tactic, but the enacted \n     cut that took effect in 1982 was the key to the recovery that \n     began in that year.\n       Floods in the Midwest, hurricanes in the Southeast, and \n     earthquakes in California during recent years prompted the \n     federal government to spend hundreds of millions to relieve \n     suffering and limit damage. Scientists who study natural \n     phenomena warn against worse disasters. The balanced budget \n     amendment would keep the federal government from dealing with \n     such calamities.\n       Occasional man made disasters have occurred throughout the \n     history of capitalism--for example, the savings and loan \n     debacle of the 1980s. Had the federal government not been \n     able to provide the money to validate the deposits of \n     millions of ordinary citizens, their losses and runs on \n     saving and commercial banking institutions would have \n     recreated 1932. To assume that financial crises will never \n     recur is unrealistic.\n       The balanced budget amendment ignores the nature of our \n     monetary system. The Federal Reserve and the commercial banks \n     issue money against their holdings of federal debt. Under a \n     balanced budget amendment, the debt will not increase. \n     Eventually the system will not be able to create the money \n     the economy needs in order to grow.\n       The Jerome Levy Economics Institute.\n     S Jay Levy,\n                                                         Chairman.\n     Leon Levy,\n                                                        President.\n     Hyman Minsky,\n                                            Distinguished Scholar.\n     Dimitri Papadimitriou,\n                                               Executive Director.\n     Edward V. Regan,\n                                             Distinguished Fellow.\n     David A. Levy,\n                           Vice Chairman, Director of Forecasting.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, there is no greater problem facing the \ncountry today than our continual failure to balance the Federal budget.\n  Unfortunately, this is not a new phenomenon. Over the past 33 years \nwe have balanced the budget once, one-quarter of a century ago in 1969. \nHad the Social Security program not generated a surplus, we would not \nhave balanced the budget in that year either.\n  Furthermore, the forecasts put out by the Congressional Budget Office \nand the administration show that, absent dramatic action on our part, \nthese deficits will not end any time soon. For example, CBO predicts \nthat the deficit in the year 2005 could be as high as $421 billion.\n  The President's budget, which was released early this month, \nforecasts Federal deficits of approximately $200 billion for each of \nthe next 5 years, and gives no promise that they will decline \n[[Page S3210]] anytime after that period. Even worse, the President has \ntaken little action to address this problem.\n  In the President's plan, $81 billion of deficit reductions are \nrelatively minor when it is realized those occur over 5 years; $60 \nbillion of those cuts come from keeping discretionary spending at \ntoday's level.\n  Why is it bad that the Federal Government routinely spends more than \nit takes in?\n  We are told in soothing tones by the administration that the deficits \nare each year predicted to be a lower percentage of the gross domestic \nproduct. That is somehow meant to be grand news, even though the dollar \namounts of the deficits constantly grow.\n  The problem is that every year we run a deficit, we must borrow to \nfund the shortfall. From the beginning of our country until today, we \nhave incurred a debt of about $5 trillion, with the overwhelming \nportion of that accumulated over the past 15 years.\n  The cost of servicing that debt will total $339 billion in 1995, \nmaking interest the second highest single Federal expenditure after \nSocial Security.\n  To put this number in perspective, our gross interest expense for \n1995 is more than the entire Federal budget 20 years ago. Imagine how \nthis money could be used to improve our education, or better our health \ncare system, or bolster our efforts to combat crime.\n  Aside from diverting resources that could be used for much better \npurposes, the deficit also places a great strain on the national \neconomy. The most notable effect is on interest rates.\n  Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, recently \ntestified before the Finance Committee on this subject. According to \nChairman Greenspan ``investors here and abroad are exacting from \nissuers of dollar-denominated debt an extra inflation risk premium that \nreflects not their estimate of the most likely rate of price level \nincrease over the life of the obligation, but the possibility that it \ncould prove to be significantly greater.'' This risk premium is \ndirectly the result of our large Federal budget deficits.\n  These artificially high interest rates affect all Americans. Families \npay this risk premium when they borrow money for a home, for a new car, \nto finance their children's education.\n  The Federal deficit also has a negative effect on future economic \ngrowth. Our potential to expand the economy is directly linked to the \namount we invest in physical and human capital. Newer and better \nmachinery, and a work force whose skills are continually updated, \nprovide the foundation for increasing our output of goods and services. \nWith this higher productivity comes a higher standard of living.\n  To achieve this, however, we must have a pool of national savings \nfrom which this investment can be made. Unfortunately, our national \nsavings rate has declined dramatically over the last decade, in part \nbecause the Federal Government has engaged in a policy of dissaving \nthrough its deficit spending. The Federal Government's reliance on \nborrowing to pay its bills crowds out the private sector, making it \nmore difficult for it to obtain financing.\n  But the worse consequence of this fiscal irresponsibility is that we \nare jeopardizing the economic futures of our children and \ngrandchildren. We are living beyond our means and passing along the \nbill to future generations.\n  I recently ran across a paper which described this problem. The paper \ndiscussed the idea of generational accounting, which a process of \nmeasuring how Government policies affect the distribution of income and \nwealth among different generations rather than simply over a 5- or 10-\nyear budget period.\n  To make this comparison, the authors calculated lifetime net tax \nrates for various generations. My generation will face a\n lifetime net tax rate of 26 percent. This compares to a lifetime net \ntax rate of 34 percent for a person born in 1991.\n\n  What is troubling is the gloomy forecast for future generations. \nAccording to this analysis, if we do not take action to improve our \nfiscal situation, future generations will face lifetime tax rates that \napproach 70 percent. In other words, future generations can look \nforward to handing over 70 cents of each dollar earned to the \nGovernment if we do not reverse our present course.\n  For the past few years the administration has also included a \ngenerational analysis in its budget documents. Its analyses generated \nresults that were similar to the figures just mentioned. Unfortunately, \nthe President chose to delete this section from this year's budget.\n  Why will future generations face such a daunting tax bill? Consider \nthe obligations we have levied upon them. The Social Security Program, \nwhile solvent today, faces drastic long-term problems once the baby-\nboom generation--born in the 1950's--retires. The surpluses, that the \nprogram is currently generating, will reverse in the year 2013 and will \nquickly evaporate, leaving workers in the middle of the next century \nwith a hefty bill for providing retirement benefits for those working \ntoday.\n  On top of that, the general fund has amassed $5 trillion in debt to \ndate and is likely to add $750 billion more even with the passage of \nthe balanced budget amendment. At some point that debt must be repaid.\n  What exactly does the balanced budget amendment do? Very simply, it \nprohibits Federal outlays from exceeding Federal receipts unless a \nthree-fifths majority of both Houses of Congress approve a specific \ndeficit.\n  In other words, it says that Congress can only spend what it is \nwilling to collect in taxes, unless Congress determines that there is a \nlegitimate reason for running a deficit. Such a situation could arise, \nfor example, if the country fell into a recession or was hit with a \nnatural disaster. But those would be the exceptions which Congress \nwould expressly authorize. The balanced budget constraint on Congress \nwould be comparable to that which every American family faces.\n  Mr. President, this amendment makes fiscal responsibility the norm \nrather than the exception.\n  The Federal Government has failed to balance its budget for 25 \nstraight years. Over this period there have been both Republicans and \nDemocrats in the White House, and the Senate has had both Republican \nand Democratic majorities. Neither party is free from blame. The truth \nis, there has not been the will to make the tough decisions necessary \nto balance the budget\n  The amendment before the Senate today demands the same fiscal \nresponsibility from the President that it establishes for Congress. It \nrequires the administration to submit a budget to Congress in which \noutlays do not exceed receipts. I think that makes perfect sense. It \nrecognizes that both branches of Government must participate in this \nvery difficult task if we are to succeed.\n  In addition to requiring a balanced budget, the amendment requires a \nmajority of the whole number of each House of Congress to approve, by a \nrollcall vote, legislation raising revenue. Frankly, this is not a \ncritical component of this proposal, because historically most tax \nbills have passed Congress with constitutional majorities.\n  However, I am grateful that the sponsors have not sought to include a \nthree-fifths majority requirement for raising revenue. That issue was \nconsidered and rejected by the House, and rightly so. That provision \nwould be disastrous for this country, because it would significantly \nhamper our ability to govern. Facing a potential deficit, Congress \nwould, in all likelihood, be forced to cut spending rather than raise \nrevenue because the latter would be much more difficult to accomplish. \nWhile I support spending cuts over tax increases, it would be unwise \nfor us to tilt the playing field against raising revenue as part of the \nConstitution. I would not support this amendment if the three-fifths \nmajority for raising revenue were included in it.\n  The amendment includes a process whereby its requirements could be \nwaived by a simple majority for any year in which a declaration of war \nis in effect or where the United States is engaged in military conflict \nwhich causes an imminent threat to national security. I think those are \nlegitimate circumstances to warrant deficit spending, and the amendment \nprovides the appropriate amount of flexibility to adequately address \nthem.\n  Mr. President, the amendment encompasses the entire Federal budget. \nSection 7 states that ``total receipts shall include all receipts of \nthe United \n[[Page S3211]] States Government except those derived from borrowing'' \nand that ``total outlays shall include all outlays of the United States \nGovernment except for those for repayment of debt principal.''\n  What this means is that every dollar that comes into the Treasury and \nevery dollar that goes out of the Treasury will be counted in \ndetermining whether the budget is balanced.\n  Again, this makes eminent sense and is exactly the way every family \nin America must manage its fiscal affairs.\n  Much of the effort to derail this resolution has centered on \nexcluding certain programs from the balanced budget requirement. In \nfact, this assault began during the amendment's consideration in the \nJudiciary Committee, when an effort was made to exclude Social \nSecurity.\n  Mr. President, I find it inconceivable that we would consider \nadopting, as part of the Constitution, an exclusion for Social Security \nor any other aspect of the federal budget. I am firmly behind \nprotecting the fiscal soundness of the Social Security System, but I \nthink it is absurd to exempt a program that represents 29% of all \nFederal receipts and 22% of all Federal outlays.\n  The true folly with this effort to protect Social Security is that by \napplying different rules to that program it becomes a magnet for \nefforts to circumvent the balanced budget amendment. Other federal \nprograms will begin to find their way under the Social Security \numbrella, and we will have achieved little if anything in the way of \ndeficit reduction. This loophole, once opened, would be very difficult \nto shut.\n  Exempting Social Security receipts would also provide a perverse \nincentive for future Congresses to shift Social Security taxes revenues \nto the general fund. This action would be particularly attractive since \nthe program currently collects more in revenue than it pays out in \nbenefits. But such an action would seriously undermine the actuarial \nbalance of the Social Security trust fund, and would almost certainly \nrequire draconian changes in the future in order to stave off \nbankruptcy when the baby boom generation retires. The irony of the \nexemption for Social Security is that, unless our fiscal house is in \norder, we won't be able to meet our Social Security obligations. And \nunless Social Security is factored into the balanced budget equation, \nwe will not get our fiscal house in order.\n  Critics of the balanced budget amendment argue that it is a sham; \nthat it avoids the rough choices required to balance the budget. I \nstrongly disagree.\n  What it represents is the first and most important step in a long and \nvery difficult journey to fiscal responsibility. It symbolizes that the \ntides have finally changed; that we are committed to living within our \nmeans, and that we are willing to embody that principle in the document \nthat sets forth the foundation on which our whole system of government \noperates.\n  Other fiscal disciplines we have enacted, while important, have not \ndone the job. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit control laws, the \nfirewalls, the discretionary spending caps, and the pay-as-you-go rules \nhave failed to break the attractive lure of deficit spending.\n  Opponents have argued that we should not pass a balanced budget \namendment until its supporters outline specifically how we plan to \nreach that goal. That was the so-called right-to-know amendment to the \nresolution before us. But this is simply a smokescreen thrown up by \nthose in this Chamber who have no intention of supporting this \nproposal, whether or not a plan is outlined.\n  The fact is, there is no agreed upon path to reaching a balanced \nbudget. The path that I would prescribe is likely to be different than \nthe paths that other members might advance. Any plan that will be \nadopted to reach this goal, will be the product of numerous compromises \nand the give and take of the normal political process. All of that will \ntake place once the requirement is established. The appropriate time \nframe for outlining how to balance the budget is after we have \ncommitted ourselves to making that the law of the land. It is the \nprocess that we are trying to change with this proposal.\n  To those who do not support the resolution before us I ask: What is \nyour plan? Are you content with the current situation where annual \ndeficits exceed $200 billion for the foreseeable future? Do you believe \nthat if we put this problem off for another day, it will get easier? Do \nyou believe that we are improving our children's futures by dropping \nthis massive debt in their laps?\n  Mr. President, every previous effort to balance the budget without an \namendment to the Constitution--that is, by statute--has failed to \nachieve that goal.\n  Why has that been the case? The answer is simple.\n  Once the targets become too difficult to meet, we simply changed the \nlaw. This resolution makes it difficult for us to avoid our \nresponsibility. The task is monumental, but the consequences for our \nfailure are far worse. If this amendment is defeated, the ones who will \nbe hurt the most are the future generations of our nation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as I have done on so many previous \noccasions in Congress, I rise today in strong support of a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n  It is my hope--and that of the American people--that we will pass \nthis amendment tomorrow and begin to chart a new course for this \nNation.\n  And there is now question that our Nation needs to change direction--\nboth politically and economically, and put an end to the fiscal status \nquo. That message was made clear to all of us after the results of last \nNovember's elections. It is time to hear and act on that clarion call \nfor change.\n  Tomorrow, we will have a chance to put to an end some of the \nhallmarks, some of the monuments, of America's status quo: our growing \nnational debt and annual deficits.\n  I graduated from the University of Maine in 1969, and since the day I \ngraduated, Congress has been unable--even unwilling--to pass one \nFederal budget that would have brought revenues in line with \nexpenditures. That's right--we have not experienced one balanced budget \nsince 1969, 26 years ago. It is almost hard to believe that we haven't \npassed a balanced budget since the year America put a man on the Moon. \nBut with today's $4.7 trillion debt, we could walk to the Moon and back \non a bridge of dollars bills stacked end to end from that debt.\n  As I have said before, this 26-year dry stretch represents one of our \nNation's worst losing streaks, and it is Congress' very own fiscal \nlosing streak.\n  But, today, we stand at the precipice of monumental change--the kind \nof change the American people voted for last November. The kind of \ndesire for change that brought me here to this Chamber as a U.S. \nSenator. Today's vote on this measure will help the American people, \n``to know the change and feel it,'' in the words of the English poet, \nJohn Keats.\n  Today is our opportunity to rise to the occasion and meet the \nexpectations of the citizens of this country, or, we merely do nothing \nand uphold the malaise of economics-as-usual.\n  Passing the balanced budget amendment will help restore a lost sense \nof confidence and trust that our institutions of Government have been \nlacking for the past generation. Tomorrow's vote marks our generations' \nchance to make a positive difference for all other future generations \nof Americans. And as we act on this proposal, we should remind \nourselves that what we do--or do not do--tomorrow on the floor on this \namendment affects a generation that currently has no say, no voice, and \nno vote.\n  But they will pay the price. They will foot the bill. They will bear \na terrible burden.\n  While today's vote has the promise of marking a new beginning for \nAmerica, we must understand that it is only part of the means to the \nend--not the end of the process itself. If and when we decide to pass \nthis balanced budget amendment, we begin a process that our Founding \nFathers envisioned to be in the best interest of democracy and the \nwelfare of the American people.\n  Let us be clear about one thing: with tomorrow's vote, we will not be \nratifying the balanced budget amendment. We will merely be giving the \n50 States the opportunity--the chance--to ratify the amendment before \nus. Congress has an obligation and a responsibility to let the American \npeople's voice be heard throughout the Nation, in every \n[[Page S3212]] state capital. Seventy-eight percent of the American \npeople support the balanced budget amendment, according to a recent \nsurvey by KRC Research and Consulting. Nearly three-quarters of all \nDemocrats--73 percent--support the amendment, 88 percent of all \nRepublicans, and 79 percent of all unenrolled voters.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that, when given the chance, the States \nand the American people will say ``yes'' to a new regimen of spending \nwithin our means; they will say ``yes'' to fiscal responsibility, they \nwill say ``yes'' to putting our Nation's fiscal house in order on a \npermanent basis, and they will say ``yes'' to a Congress accountable to \nthem and their needs.\n  After almost 4 weeks of continuous debate in the Senate and almost 13 \nyears after this Chamber passed this same measure by one vote, and \nafter 26 years of continuous deficits and growing debts, it is hard to \nbelieve we have again come to this point.\n  We have arrived at this juncture not necessarily by choice, but \nbecause economic and financial circumstances have compelled us to act. \nOur failure to take responsible action to end years and years of \nspiralling debt and deficit spending in the past is forcing our hand \ntoday. But make no mistake about it, tomorrow's vote is about \ntomorrow's generation.\n  Although the figures and statistics about our debts and deficits have \noften been mentioned during Senate debate on the balanced budget \namendment, they bear repeating once again in order to show the American \npeople--and opponents of this measure--the devastating costs of our \nfiscal irresponsibility and lack of action.\n  I think the American people and opponents of this measure need to be \nreminded that, since 1980, our national debt has grown from $1 trillion \nto a staggering $4.7 trillion for a growth rate of 309 percent. And our \nnational debt is expected to grow to a whopping $6.3 trillion by 1999, \nfor a growth rate of 453 percent since 1980. And an astounding 17 \npercent of our national debt--$800 billion--is held by other nations or \npeople in other nations--so even control over our own indebtedness has \nbeen handed to foreign banks and foreign creditors.\n  The American people and opponents of this measure need to be reminded \nthat in the next 5 years alone, the personal burden of this debt and \nthese interest payments for every American man, woman, and child will \nrise from $17,938 to $22,909--that's growth of nearly $5,000 in just 5 \nyears.\n  In fact, it should be pointed out that the Office of Management and \nBudget has already estimated that if we continue our current cycle of \ndeficit spending, future generations--those who will inherit a Nation \nbeset by fiscal problems we could not solve--will be forced to suffer a \ntax rate of 82 percent in order to pay the bills we left behind.\n  The American people and opponents of this measure need to be reminded \nthat the annual interest we pay on our ever-increasing national debt \nhas grown almost exponentially, rising from $177 billion in 1982--the \nonly year when the Senate passed this measure--to almost $300 billion \nin 1994. And our annual interest payments are expected to balloon to \n$373 billion in 1999, for a 219-percent growth rate between 1982 and \n1999.\n  To appreciate the impact of interest costs on our annual deficits, \none only need look at the chart behind me. If we continue our current \nfiscal course, the interest costs related to servicing the debt will \ncontinue to exceed our total annual deficits.\n  The American people and opponents of this measure need to be reminded \nthat every day, we add $819 million in daily interest to the national \ndebt. That figure will rise to $1 billion in interest every single day \nof the year. In fact, as I speak here for about 8 minutes on behalf of \nthe balanced budget amendment, we will have added almost $5 million to \nthe debt. Unfortunately, even when I do stop speaking, the debt keeps \non growing--and growing, and growing like the ``Energizer Bunny of our \nfiscal irresponsibility.''\n  The American people and opponents of this measure need to be reminded \nthat these interest payments on the debt already consume 14 percent of \nour annual Federal budget. These interest payments consume 57 percent \nof all personal income taxes each year, while the interest payments we \nmake on our debt are eight times higher than what we spend on our \nchildren's education, 50 times higher than what we spend on job \ntraining for our workers, and 55 times higher than what we spend on \nHead Start programs. With these interest payments out of the way, \nCongress can finally prioritize its spending to where the American \npeople want their tax dollars to be spent.\n  The American people are painfully aware that the estimates of future \ndeficits aren't getting any smaller no matter how much Congress \nprocrastinates its fiscal discipline. Only a few months ago, the \nCongressional Budget Office told Congress that the estimated deficit in \nthe current fiscal year would reach $162 billion, steadily rise upward \nto $197 billion by 1998, and climb again to $257 billion in the year \n2000, and $319 billion in 2002.\n  The CBO now estimates that the deficit will be higher than prior \nprojections by an average of $25 billion per year over the next 5 \nyears. This year's deficit has already been increased to $176 billion, \n$222 billion in 1998, $284 billion in 2000, and $421 billion in 2005. \nNot only that, but between now and 2002, we will add a cumulative total \nof nearly $2 trillion to the existing debt if we make no change in \nfiscal policy.\n  But the American people also need to know that these numbers have a \ndirect impact on their lives and on the future of their families. And \nthey need to know that a balanced budget amendment would have a \npositive impact on their futures and on the economy of the Nation.\n  The New York Federal Reserve Board, in an often referred to study, \nshowed how America lost five percent growth in gross domestic product--\na loss in economic growth that translates into a 3.75 million job loss \nduring the decade spanning 1979 and 1989--jobs in rural America, jobs \nin our inner cities, jobs on America's farms, and jobs for America's \nyouth.\n  The Concord Coalition study showed that a loss of national \nproductivity has caused a sharp decline in America's family incomes, \nresulting in an average family income of $35,000 rather than the \nestimated $50,000 it would have been in the absence of our structural \ndeficits and burgeoning debt.\n  In June 1992, the General Accounting Office released a report showing \na gradual decline in America's quality of life and standard of living \nif our deficit spending is not brought under control. But the report \nalso showed that if we did balance the budget by the year 2001, then by \nthe year 2020 the average American will have real growth in quality of \nlife and income by 36 percent.\n  The econometrics firm DRI/McGraw Hill reported that a balanced budget \nis worth $1,000 a year to the average American household over the next \n10 years. A balanced budget would boost long-term economic growth: \nnational interest rates would drop by 2.5 percent and by the year 2002, \nhalf the savings that is said to be needed in our budget simulations \ncould come from lower interest costs.\n  So the balanced budget amendment is not a gimmick--it does yield \npositive results. Most importantly, it puts into law what Congress has \nbeen unable and unwilling to do for the past two decades: that is, \nmuster the courage and discipline necessary to balance the budget \nwithout an amendment to the Constitution.\n  Over the years--and often to stem the tide toward a balanced budget \namendment--Congress has tried to balance the budget through statutory \nmeans. And on each and every one of these efforts Congress has failed.\n  The simple fact is statutory laws are easy to ignore. They are a \npaper tiger. During the past 26 years, Congress has operated without \nthis amendment, but with eight statutes designed to lower or eliminate \ndeficits. Looking at this chart, it is clear what the results have \nbeen. Passing this amendment is the only way--our last choice, our last \nresort--to put our fiscal house in order.\n  I share the sentiments of whose who say Congress should be able to \nbalance the budget without a constitutional amendment. But it is also \nsaid that you can learn from history. Mr. President, if the past 26 \nyears have taught us anything, it is that Congress and the President \nare unwilling and unable to balance the budget absent a force \n[[Page S3213]] greater than politics. That force is the Constitution of \nthe United States.\n  If the states ratify this amendment, Congress will be beholden to a \nlaw with as much weight as the original Bill of Rights. Congress will \nbe prohibited from ignoring annual deficits. We will be compelled by \nlaw to act. Each of us in this Chamber will have a duty to follow our \nsolemn oaths of office to uphold and protect the Constitution. When we \npass this measure, we will be beholden to following through on that \noath.\n  Mr. President, today we can make history. Today, we should make \nhistory. We can make history by molding a better, brighter future for \nthe next generation and for every generation thereafter. I hope today \nwe will make the right kind of history, and chart a new course for \nAmerica, one where balanced budgets and fiscal responsibility become \nthe norm, and not the exception to the rule.\n              vice president and balanced budget amendment\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the issue arises as to how House Joint \nResolution 1 effects the obligations of the Vice President, as \nPresident of the Senate, to vote in case of a tie vote in the Senate.\n  Article I, section 3 of the Constitution provides that the ``Vice \nPresident shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, \nunless they be equally divided.'' By the plain meaning of this \nprovision, the Vice President is not a Member of the Senate; he is \nmerely the presiding officer--President of the Senate--a neutral \numpire, and, thus, cannot vote or take part in the deliberations of the \nSenate. The only exception to this is where there exists a tie vote. In \nthat case, to ``secure at all times the possibility of a definitive \nresolution of the body, it is necessary that the [Vice President] \nshould have only a casting vote.'' The Federalist No. 68 (Hamilton).\n  But the situation where the Vice President can break a tie vote only \napplies to a simple majority vote, the run-of-the-mill ordinary vote of \nthe Senate. Where the Constitution, however, provides for a \n``supermajority'' vote, in situations where the Framers of the \nConstitution feared the passions of majority rule would retard reasoned \ndeliberation, there really is no occasion for a tie vote and therefore \nthe Vice President may not vote.\n  These include the two-thirds vote requirement of each House to \noverride a veto; the two-thirds vote requirement of the Senate to give \nits advice and consent to treaties; and the two-thirds vote requirement \nof the Senate to convict on impeachment.\n  The balanced budget amendment's supermajority provisions, whether the \nthree-fifths number of the whole number of each House of Congress [sec. \n1 waiver to allow outlays to exceed receipts; sec. 2 waiver to increase \nthe limit on the debt], or the ``constitutional majority'' provisions--\na majority of the whole number of each House--[sec. 4 requirement to \nraise revenue; sec. 5 requirement to waive amendment when the U.S. is \ninvolved in a military action that is a threat to national security]--\nwould work the same way as the Constitution's other supermajority \nprovisions.\n  Because these ``supermajority'' votes require a supermajority vote of \nthe ``whole number of each House of Congress,'' and it is clear that \nthe Vice President is not a member of either House, these provisions, \nlike the two-thirds vote in the Senate for treaties, are exceptions to \nthe simple majority vote general rule that the Vice President may vote \nin cases of a tie in the Senate.\n  Moreover, the Vice President would not have a vote because these \nsupermajority provisions would mandate that a tie-vote would be \nmeaningless. For instance, 60 votes in the Senate would be required to \nraise the debt ceiling--where three-fifths is required under section 2 \nof the amendment, and 51 votes would be needed to raise taxes, as \nrequired by section 4.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly on the issue of the potential issue of the jurisdiction of the \nFederal courts to decide matters under the constitutional amendment for \na balanced budget if it is passed and ratified. I think it is important \nthat courts not have jurisdiction to intervene in any controversy where \nthe issue is the raising of taxes or the cutting of expenses, which \nwould be the issues under the balanced budget amendment, because it is \nnot a judicial function.\n  I think the preferable course is to have within the body of the \namendment itself a flat statement that the Federal courts--no courts--\nwould have jurisdiction over any controversy arising out of the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  We have seen in a case originating in Kansas City, MO, the State of \nthe distinguished Presiding Officer, a situation where the courts \nactually ordered the imposition of taxes which, in my view, is not in \nany conceivable regard a judicial function. If there is any core \nlegislative function, it is the raising of taxes. We elected officials \nare responsible to our constituents, and that is a core legislative \nfunction. But it happened and it was upheld by the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States in the celebrated 5-to-4 decision a few years ago.\n  There is a major issue as to whether the Congress has the authority, \nthrough legislation, to take away the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court \nor the Federal courts on a constitutional issue. There is a post-Civil \nWar case, ex parte McCardle, which suggests that Congress has that \njurisdiction. In my legal judgment, that case is not valid for any \nmatter which is current today.\n  I believe that it is very unwise for the Congress to have legislative \nauthority to take away the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States, for example, on a first amendment issue. That was a \nmatter which was discussed extensively during the confirmation \nproceedings of Chief Justice Rehnquist, when after some discussion \nChief Justice Rehnquist concluded that the Congress would not have the \nauthority to take away the jurisdiction of the Federal courts on a \nmatter involving the first amendment. When we got to other amendments, \nthe fourth amendment, fifth amendment and sixth amendment, Chief \nJustice Rehnquist would not give the same response, nor would he \nrespond to the difference of the authority of Congress to take away \njurisdiction of the first amendment contrasted with the fourth, fifth \nor sixth amendments.\n  I give that very brief review to suggest that there may well be a \nquestion as to whether the Congress, through enabling legislation, \ncould take away the jurisdiction of the courts to intervene on a \ncontroversy arising out of this balanced budget amendment. It is my \nhope that we will yet address that issue within the confines of the \namendment itself. It may well be that critical votes necessary to pass \nthe balanced budget amendment will depend upon our ability to find a \nway to satisfy those Senators. I believe that it is so important to \npass the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget that I continue \nto support the amendment, even though an amendment offered to the \nconstitutional amendment for a balanced budget failed in an effort to \nput within the balanced budget amendment itself a prohibition of \nFederal court jurisdiction. It gets sort of complicated when we talk \nabout it, Mr. President.\n  I think the factors are clear. I think that our legislative history \nis clear. Aside from putting in a prohibition of Federal court \njurisdiction, our legislative history is clear that it is congressional \nintent on the balanced budget amendment that the Federal courts should \nnot have jurisdiction. But even the question of congressional intent is \na muddy field, with some Justices--notably, Justice Scalia--saying he \nwill not look to congressional intent but only to the body of the \nlanguage itself.\n  So I will conclude by saying that I hope we have made it clear as a \nmatter of Senate intent, congressional intent, that the courts should \nnot have jurisdiction over any controversy under the balanced budget \namendment, and with the extra hope that we may make it plain in the \nbody of the amendment itself before we conclude.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for just a unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that ``A Balanced \nBudget Amendment,'' an open letter to Congress from all kinds of \neconomists, \n[[Page S3214]] doctors of economics, be printed in the Record. And I \nalso ask unanimous consent that a column by William Safire on this \nmatter also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Balanced Budget Amendment--an Open Letter to Congress, February 1995\n\n       It is time to acknowledge that mere statutes that purport \n     to control federal spending or deficits have failed. It is \n     time to adopt constitutional control through a Balanced \n     Budget Amendment. In supporting such an amendment, Congress \n     can control its spending proclivities by setting up control \n     machinery external to its own internal operations, machinery \n     that will not be so easily neglected and abandoned.\n       Why do we need the Balanced Budget Amendment now, when no \n     such constitutional provision existed for two centuries? The \n     answer is clear. Up until recent decades, the principle that \n     government should balance its budget in peacetime was, \n     indeed, a part of our effective constitution, even if not \n     formally written down. Before the Keynesian-inspired shift in \n     thinking about fiscal matters, it was universally considered \n     immoral to incur debts, except in periods of emergency (wars \n     or major depressions). We have lost the moral sense of fiscal \n     responsibility that served to make formal constitutional \n     constraints unnecessary. We cannot legislate a change in \n     political morality, we can put formal constitutional \n     constraints into place.\n       The effects of the Balanced Budget Amendment would be both \n     real and symbolic. Elected politicians would be required to \n     make fiscal choices within meaningfully-constructed \n     boundaries; they would be required to weigh predicted \n     benefits against predicted tax costs. They would be forced to \n     behave ``responsibily,'' as this word is understood by the \n     citizenry, and knowledge of this fact would do much to \n     restore the confidence of citizens in governmental processes.\n       It is important to recognize that the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment imposes procedural constraints on the making of \n     budgetary choices. It does not take away the power of the \n     Congress to spend or tax. The amendment requires only that \n     the Congress and the Executive spend no more than what they \n     collect in taxes. In its simplest terms, such an amendment \n     amounts to little more than ``honesty in budgeting.''\n       Of course, we always pay for what we spend through \n     government, as anywhere else. But those who pay for the \n     government spending that is financed by borrowing are \n     taxpayers in future years, those who must pay taxes to meet \n     the ever-mounting interest obligations that are already far \n     too large an item in the federal budget. The immorality of \n     the intergenerational transfer that deficit financing \n     represents cries out for correction.\n       Some opponents of the Balanced Budget Amendment argue that \n     the interest burden should be measured in terms of percentage \n     of national product, and, so long as this ratio does not \n     increase, all is well. This argument is totally untenable \n     because it ignores the effects of both inflation and real \n     economic growth. So long as government debt is denominated in \n     dollars, sufficiently rapid inflation can, for a short \n     period, reduce the interest burden substantially, in terms of \n     the ratio to product. But surely default by way of inflation \n     is the worst of all possible ways of dealing with the fiscal \n     crisis that the deficit regime represents.\n       Opponents also often suggest that Congress and the \n     Executive must maintain the budgetary flexibility to respond \n     to emergency needs for expanding rates of spending. This \n     prospect is fully recognized, and the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment includes a provision that allows for approval of \n     debt or deficits by a three-fifths vote of those elected to \n     each house of Congress.\n       When all is said and done, there is no rational argument \n     against the Balanced Budget Amendment. Simple observation of \n     the fiscal record of recent years tells us that the \n     procedures through which fiscal choices are made are not \n     working. The problem is not one that involves the wrong \n     political leaders or the wrong parties. The problem is one \n     where those whom we elect are required to function under the \n     wrong set of rules, the wrong procedures. It is high time to \n     get our fiscal house in order.\n       We can only imagine the increase in investor and business \n     confidence, both domestic and foreign, that enactment of a \n     Balanced Budget Amendment would produce. Perhaps even more \n     importantly, we could all regain confidence in ourselves, as \n     a free people under responsible constitutional government.\n       Dr. Burton A.

During the Carter Administration, with \n     national debt mounting, Virginia Senator Harry Byrd proposed \n     an even more Draconian bill to balance the budget, and this \n     one passed both houses and was signed into law. P.L. 95-435 \n     stated: ``Beginning with Fiscal Year 1981, the total budget \n     outlays of the Federal Government shall not exceed its \n     receipts.''\n       Brave words. Because subsequent laws control, the mere \n     passage of a deficit budget for 1981 nullified the Byrd law. \n     Then came the Gramm-Rudman Act in the mid-80's, supposedly \n     imposing real fiscal discipline for our generation; all that \n     remains of that pass at self-restraint is Phil Gramm running \n     for President saying he told us so.\n       Thus is demonstrated that budget-balancing statutes are hot \n     air, and our experience shows that all protestations about a \n     ``responsible'' Congress someday balancing the budget are \n     groundless.\n       Meanwhile, the national debt has soared from a piddling \n     $373 billion when Wilbur Mills sought drastic\n      action to $5 trillion today. The interest we must pay on \n     that debt now exceeds all we spend on national defense.\n       Worse, from the perspective of the budget our children will \n     have to face, these are the good old days. Their tax dollars \n     will be consumed by paying interest on the deficits we run \n     today, leaving nothing for their own good life. They will \n     condemn their parents' current profligacy as cruelly \n     reckless.\n       That's why the Gingrich House has already passed the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution as the \n     centerpiece of its contract, and why four out of five \n     Americans support its passage when the vote comes up in the \n     Dole Senate tomorrow.\n       A third of the Senators could block it; minority rule is \n     still possible.\n       With all Republicans except Mark Hatfield united behind the \n     balancing amendment, and with most Democrats opposing such \n     deficit demolition, key votes among the undecided are \n     Senators Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad. Never has so much of \n     the nation's future rested on the decision of two guys from \n     North Dakota.\n       Another potential savior of liberal spenders is Sam Nunn of \n     Georgia who wants ironclad guarantees that the amendment will \n     not be enforceable in court, lest some Federal judge wind up \n     as de facto budget director.\n       But an unenforceable law would mock the Constitution. Let \n     the legislative history show that in the event of imbalance, \n     the Congress and the states intend any judicial injunction to \n     apply to all spending and taxing as a lump, with no \n     discretion left to judges to choose which spending to cut. If \n     enjoined by the court from running a red-ink government at \n     all the Congress would be forced to do its duty and balance \n     the budget.\n       A few points for the gentlemen from North Dakota:\n       1. By voting yes, they would empower the people back home \n     (including North Dakotans and Georgians) to join in deciding \n     this great question; 75 percent of the states must vote to \n     ratify or the amendment fails.\n       2. If the pendulum of public opinion swings, a future \n     generation can choose new taxes over spending cuts as a means \n     of balancing the nation's accounts. There's room for a shift \n     back to activist government centralized in Washington, if \n     that's what our children want.\n       3. President Clinton has just surrendered to red ink. His \n     own pusillanimous budget, which makes not even the easy \n     choices, helplessly projects another trillion in debt--and \n     that assumes his rosy economic projections come true.\n       That last item is the crusher. Publicly bowing to personal \n     and political defeat by the deficit, Mr. Clinton has turned \n     the budget helm over to Congress. That branch has \n     demonstrated how it needs to lash itself to the mast of the \n     Constitution.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, a good deal of the debate thus far has \nfailed to focus on what I regard as one of the most important factors \nto be considered as we address this amendment to the Constitution--how \nthe balanced budget amendment might affect the economy. What impact \nwill the amendment have on jobs, on incomes, and on the long-term \nstandards of living of the American people.\n  It is my strongly held view that a balanced budget amendment could, \nunder certain economic circumstances, cause significant harm to the \neconomy. Requiring a balanced budget in each and every year, as this \nproposed amendment requires, regardless of the economic situation, \nwould hamper the ability of the Federal Government to lessen the impact \nof recessions.\n  A balanced budget amendment would make economic recessions more \nsevere than they might otherwise be. The reason for that is that \ncurrently the Federal budget helps to lessen the impact of recessions \nthrough what are called automatic stabilizers.\n  These automatic stabilizers allow spending to increase and revenue to \nfall during times of economic hardship. When the economy goes into a \ndownturn, headed toward a recession, the automatic stabilizers start to \nwork. Spending on Federal Government programs, such as unemployment \ncompensation and food stamps, automatically increase as the economy \ngoes into recession, as more people lose their jobs and become eligible \nfor these programs.\n  In addition, as people earn less money as a result of a recession, \nthey pay less in taxes. The way our system is currently constructed, \nthese changes in spending and taxes occur automatically. These \nautomatic stabilizers reduce the damage done to the American \n[[Page S3216]] economy and to American families by the recession.\n  The balanced budget amendment would force the Government to raise \ntaxes and to cut spending in recessions, at just the moment that \nraising taxes and cutting spending will do the most harm to the economy \nand aggravate the recession; in other words, it would work directly \ncounter to cushioning or ameliorating the impacts of the recession.\n  This chart shows the percent change in gross domestic product, \nbeginning back in the 1880's and coming forward to the present. Since \nWorld War II and the concept of automatic stabilizers we have lessened \nthe severity of economic downturns. As a consequence of the economic \ndownturn there was greater job loss and less revenue into the Treasury. \nThere were also increased expenditures out of the Treasury for \nunemployment insurance and for medical care and food stamps. The \nincreased expenditures and loss of revenue allow a deficit to take \nplace in an economic downturn and work to support incomes and stimulate \nthe economy.\n  In the post-World War II period, we have allowed that to happen \nwithout trying to balance the budget in an economic downturn. Prior to \nWorld War II we tried to balance the budget in an economic downturn. \nPresident Hoover did it before the Great Depression.\n  Previously, when we tried to do this, the business cycle went through \ntremendous fluctuations. Prior to economic stabilizers the growth in \nthe economy would go from boom to bust. We used to have very deep \nvalleys of negative growth. In fact, during the Depression, we had 15-\npercent negative growth. From 1929 to 1933 we had a 30-percent drop in \nour gross national product, almost a one-third drop in gross national \nproduct.\n  So prior to World War II, we had these tremendous fluctuations, and \nin the postwar period, using the automatic stabilizers, we have been \nable to effectively eliminate periods of negative growth. We still have \nfluctuations, but they are much shallower and most of them have taken \nplace above the positive growth line.\n  In fact, Charles Schultze, in testimony he gave concerning the \nbalanced budget amendment said, and I quote him:\n\n       A balanced budget amendment would be bad economics. Federal \n     revenues automatically fall and expenditures for unemployment \n     compensation rise when recessions occur. The deficit \n     necessarily rises. This budgetary behavior is a very \n     important economic stabilizer. It helps sustain private \n     incomes during recession and thus keeps sales, employment and \n     production better maintained than they otherwise would be.\n\n  And he goes on to state:\n\n       The American economy in the postwar years has been far more \n     stable than it was between the Civil War and the Second World \n     War, even if we exclude the Great Depression from the \n     comparison. In the period between the Civil War and the First \n     World War, the American economy spent about half the time in \n     expansion and half in contraction.\n       In the period since 1946, the economy spent 80 percent of \n     the time expanding and only 20 percent contracting. In the \n     years after the Second World War, fluctuations in the \n     American economy around its long-term growth trend were only \n     half as large as they were in the period 1871 to 1914. Many \n     people who have studied the period, credit an important part \n     of the increased economic performance to the automatic \n     stabilizing characteristics of the Federal budget.\n\n  Under the proposed constitutional amendment, this stabilizing force \nwould be seriously threatened. The first year of a recession would turn \nan initially balanced budget into deficit, but under the proposed \nconstitutional amendment, the Congress would be required to bring the \nbudget back into balance by large tax increases or spending cuts \nimposed as the recession was still underway.\n  Of course, to do that would only drive the recession downward and \nmove the economy even deeper, deeper into these valleys.\n  Let me just talk a little bit about how the fiscal stabilizers work \nin terms of keeping income up during an economic downturn.\n  This chart illustrates how automatic stabilizers work.\n  Between the second quarter of 1990 and the fourth quarter of 1991, \nreal personal income from all sources before taxes and without \ntransfers fell by 2 percent.\n  In other words, we went into an economic slowdown, and personal \nincome began to decline. Transfer payments including unemployment \ninsurance, food stamps, and medical care increase. These payments do \nnot increase incomes up to the level that they were earning, but it \ngives them a percentage of what they were earning so they are not \ncompletely wiped out. They have some income continuing to come in.\n  So as you start this deep decline in wages, families were able to \nkeep up their after-tax income and after-transfer income. So these \npayments offset or cushioned what was happening as a consequence of the \nrecession. The reason this happens is that Government fiscal policy \nhelps to stabilize incomes.\n  During the 1990-92 recession family incomes before taxes and before \nany transfer income fell by $70 billion, but their incomes after taxes \nand with the transfer income rose by $92 billion. So we were able to \ncushion the economic downturn, and we did it because we got income \nsupport from these fiscal stabilizers. You get direct income support \nthrough unemployment insurance, and you get a decrease in the tax \nburden as a consequence of the economic slowdown.\n  Now, had the balanced budget amendment been in effect, these income \nstabilizers would not have been available, real disposable incomes of \nAmerican families would have been almost $100 billion lower, and the \nrecession would have been much, much deeper. It is for this reason that \nan article in the New York Times only a few days ago said, and I quote \nits heading, ``The Pitfalls of a Balanced Budget, Dismantling a Decades \nOld System for Softening Recessions.'' The article goes on to say, and \nI quote it:\n\n       If the amendment is enacted, the side effects would be \n     huge. A system that has softened recessions since the 1930's \n     would be dismantled.\n\n  And further on, the article states:\n\n       The biggest risk is to the Nation's automatic stabilizers \n     which have made recessions less severe than they were in the \n     century before World War II. The stabilizers work this way: \n     When the economy weakens, outlays automatically rise for \n     unemployment pay, food stamps, welfare and Medicaid. \n     Simultaneously, as incomes fall, so do corporate and \n     individual income tax payments. Both elements make more money \n     available for spending, thus helping to pull the economy out \n     of its slump.\n\n  Now, we would run the risk, without the automatic stabilizers which \nhelp to offset the downturn, of putting the economy back in the boom-\nand-bust cycle which was particularly marked in the late 1800's and \nthrough the first half of this century and which prompted the comments \nmade by Charles Schultze with respect to how we have managed to offset \nthe economic downturns since the end of World War II. As he pointed out \nin his statement, the American economy in the postwar years, post-World \nWar II years, has been far more stable than it was between the Civil \nWar and the Second World War. And as he states, ``Many people who have \nstudied the period credit an important part of the improved economic \nperformance to the automatic stabilizing characteristics of the Federal \nbudget.''\n  Some of my colleagues have argued, we can waive the amendment with 60 \nvotes. I do not know of constitutional principles that are waivable, \nbut they say we will come along and we will get a 60-vote supermajority \nand we will waive the requirement of an annual balance in order to \naddress the recessionary situation.\n  The difficulty with this is that the automatic stabilizers work \nautomatically, and they take effect immediately. The stabilizers, which \nprevent these deep fluctuations, begin as soon as the economy softens. \nThey begin before the economic downturn is generally recognized.\n  Various votes have been cited in the Chamber by others who say, we \ntook a vote and extended the unemployment insurance, and this vote \npassed by a large majority, so clearly if we were into difficulties, we \nwill get the majorities necessary in order to waive the balanced budget \namendment and run the deficit to offset the recession.\n  The first point I wish to make is that we have not always gotten \nthose votes for the extension of unemployment insurance. In the 1982 \nrecession, for example, there was a vote that failed to get the 60-vote \nrequirement. So it is not accurate to say that whenever the \n[[Page S3217]] issue is presented, the Congress has always responded--\nand particularly not responded in a timely fashion.\n  Second, those votes that people cite are votes for a further \nextension of unemployment insurance beyond what the basic program \nprovides by law. But the application of the fiscal stabilizers begins \nwith the use of the basic program. There is no vote taken here to \ninstitute the basic program. The basic program begins automatically as \nthe economy slows down, and we rely upon that basic program to cushion \nthe economic downturn.\n  If the economic downturn is severe, there is a necessity to extend \nthe basic program. On that extension, it has on occasion been approved \nby large votes and on other occasions not so approved.\n  So it is not at all clear that the vote necessary to waive the \namendment would be forthcoming, and in any event it is crystal clear \nthat the vote comes very late in the day after we have already started \non the downward slope. Therefore, our ability to check that downward \nmovement to avoid these kinds of fluctuations will be markedly limited \nunder the balanced budget amendment. We are inviting the prospect of \ngoing from these fluctuations over the business cycle without the deep \nmoves into negative growth back to the very fluctuations that marked \nthe economy in the century before the post-World War II period.\n  This matter may seem somewhat far removed because we have not had a \ngreat depression for a long, long time. But I simply want to underscore \nthat what these deep plunges into negative growth represent very severe \nunemployment, the likes of which we have not seen in the post World War \nII period: Very extensive business failures--bankruptcies, farm \nforeclosures. So we would be crippling our ability to address economic \ndownturns.\n  Laura Tyson, when she was the chair of the President's Council of \nEconomic Advisers stated in an article entitled, ``It's a Recipe For \nEconomic Chaos'':\n       Continued progress on reducing the deficit is sound \n     economic policy, but a constitutional amendment requiring \n     annual balance of the federal budget is not. The fallacy in \n     the logic behind the balanced budget amendment begins with \n     the premise that the size of the federal deficit is the \n     result of conscious policy decisions. This is only partly the \n     case. The pace of economic activity also plays an important \n     role in determining the deficit. An economic slowdown \n     automatically depresses tax revenues and increases government \n     spending on such programs as unemployment compensation, food \n     stamps and welfare.\n       Such temporary increases in the deficit act as ``automatic \n     stabilizers,'' offsetting some of the reduction in the \n     purchasing power of the private sector and cushioning the \n     economy's slide. Moreover, they do so quickly and \n     automatically, without the need for lengthy debates about the \n     state of the economy and the appropriate policy response.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       A balanced budget amendment would throw the automatic \n     stabilizers into reverse. Congress would be required to raise \n     tax rates or cut spending programs in the face of a recession \n     to counteract temporary increases in the deficit. Rather than \n     moderating the normal ups and downs of the business cycle, \n     fiscal policy would be required to aggravate them.\n\n  That is exactly what used to happen when we experienced the boom and \nbust cycles prior to World War II, and when we talked about the panics, \nthe great panic of 1893, and 1922, and 1929.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article by Laura \nTyson be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to address one other feature of \nthis proposal for a balanced budget amendment. We do not have a capital \nbudget at the Federal level and therefore the analogy that is drawn, \nwhere people say the State and local governments balance their budgets, \nwhy does the Federal Government not balance its budget--is completely \nfalse. Most States run deficits under the accounting principles used to \ncompute the Federal budget. States have balanced budget requirements \nbut they have a capital budget separate and apart, which they finance \nby borrowing.\n  We had two Governors who testified that having a balanced budget \nrequirement helped them maintain a good credit rating.\n  The question was then, ``Why do you need a good credit rating if you \nhave to have a balanced budget?''\n  Of course the answer was they expected to borrow in the future. In \nfact the Governors acknowledged that their budget balance is required \nonly on their operating budget and that they make active use of a \ncapital budget for which borrowing is permitted. Individuals, of \ncourse, borrow. Most people could not buy a home or a car if they had \nto have an annually balanced budget of the sort that this amendment \nrequires because they would not be able to make a capital investment. \nIt is prudent economics to make wise capital investments in your future \nand to depreciate the capital asset over its useful life.\n  Let me just turn to the question of the failure of this amendment to \ndistinguish between different types of spending and the impact that \nthose different types of spending would have on fiscal policy. The \nfirst is deposit insurance. It must be understood, this amendment \nrequires an annual balance; the outlays and the receipts must be in \nbalance. Between 1988 and 1991, substantial outlays were used to close \ninsolvent thrifts and transfer their assets to the Resolution Trust \nCorporation. As these assets have been sold in recent years, they have \nbegun to yield a smaller but still sizable stream of net revenue back \nto the Treasury. This kind of flexible response to a major national \nfinancial crisis would have been prevented by the year-by-year lockstep \napproach of the balanced budget amendment, which makes no account for \nanticipated future receipts.\n  The amendment actually requires the current outlays for deposit \ninsurance be matched with current spending cuts or tax increases. This \nwould produce a strong downward pressure on the economy because deposit \ninsurance payments do not add to current economic activity. They \nreplace moneys which depositors already considered as in the bank, \nwhile the offsetting cuts or taxes would subtract for current activity.\n  There was an interesting article that appeared in this morning's \npaper entitled, ``The High Cost of a Balanced Budget Amendment.'' Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that article\n appear in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is stated there:\n\n       Advocates of the Balanced Budget Amendment to the \n     Constitution do not intend to jeopardize the life savings of \n     America's families or threaten the stability of the nation's \n     banks. As written, however, the amendment could do just that.\n\n  What happens now is, as soon as you encounter a problem, the deposit \ninsurance fund covers those deposits. But in order to do that, your \noutlays have to exceed your receipts in the year in which you are \nmaking that coverage.\n  Insurance claims are automatically paid as needed, regardless, under \nthe deficit. Under the amendment, if deposit insurance payment would \ncause a deficit, might not those payments be prohibited?\n\n       During a severe economic downturn, the risk of bank failure \n     is greatest. An economic downturn also produces (or \n     exacerbates) federal budget deficits, as tax revenues decline \n     and spending for programs such as unemployment compensation \n     increases. At such a time, the government would lack the \n     extra revenues it could need to cover the large costs of \n     rescuing depositors and the banking system. Under current \n     law, deposit insurance claims are automatically paid as \n     needed, regardless of the deficit. Under amendment, if \n     deposit insurance payments would cause a deficit, might not \n     those payments be prohibited?\n\n  So it is a very important question as we consider the amendment \nbefore us. Furthermore, I have difficulty in understanding under the \namendment how, with respect to both Social Security and unemployment \ncompensation, we would be able to use the balances that we build up in \nthose trust funds in order to cover future years? How would we be able \nto expend those balances since by definition to do so your outlays \nwould be exceeding your receipts in that particular fiscal year. We \nregard that as wise policy. We build up these surpluses in the instance \nof the Social Security System in anticipation of retirement of the baby \nboom generation, and with the unemployment system we build them up \nduring better economic times in order to pay benefits during \nrecessions.\n  [[Page S3218]] How would those surpluses be used in the future when \nthe baby boomers retire or when the next recession hits since you would \nhave an excess of outlays over revenues in the Social Security trust \nfund with respect to Social Security and in the unemployment insurance \ntrust fund with respect to unemployment insurance?\n  So this requirement of an annual balance between outlays and receipts \nfundamentally undermines the economic prudence associated with \nanticipatory budget. This is budgeting which we have done consistently, \nand I think wisely. We build up the funds in the trust fund and spend \nthem during difficult times by anticipating the future expenditures.\n  Mr. President, the New York Times today in an editorial entitled \n``Unbalanced Amendment'' addresses this point. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the editorial be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this editorial addresses this point of \nthe automatic stabilizers and our ability to avoid these very deep and \nsevere economic downward plunges.\n  I quote the editorial:\n\n        When the economy slows, tax revenues fall off and spending \n     on unemployment insurance and food stamps rises. The \n     automatic rise in the deficit by triggering spending serves \n     to mitigate the slowdowns, but under the proposed amendment \n     Congress could easily turn a $1 million downturn into \n     something worse. Unless a three-fifths supermajority saves \n     the day, Congress would have to raise taxes and cut spending \n     in a slow economy, the opposite of responsible stewardship. \n     Take another unintended consequence. When savings and loans \n     went bankrupt during the 1980's, the Federal Government \n     bailed out the depositors with borrowed money, thereby \n     preventing a banking panic. But under the proposed amendment \n     the government could not react instantly unless a \n     supermajority in Congress approved.\n\n  Before people start saying we could get a supermajority vote to waive \nthe amendment, let me just remind them of the extremely close votes \nthat we had here on the floor of the Senate with respect to providing \nthe funds to cover the closing out of the failed S's.\n  Mr. President, I regard the vote coming tomorrow as a critical vote \nfor a number of reasons, but in particular because I am extremely \napprehensive that by eliminating our ability to conduct a rational \nfiscal policy to offset economic downturns, we will again plunge our \neconomy into the severe up and down boom and bust cycles which we \nexperienced consistently through our history. This is not hypothetical. \nThis is not conjecture. This is what happened.\n  This chart only shows GDP back to the 1880's, but we could have taken \nit back farther, and it would have shown the same severe up and down \nfluctuations. We have been able to moderate those movements of the \nbusiness cycle during the post-World War II period. People have become \naccustomed to the more moderate business cycle. Many simply assume that \nsomehow the business cycle will continue as it were. But the business \ncycle remains with us. As the ups and downs prior to World War II show, \nwe have succeeded in ameliorating the business cycle, cushioning it as \nit begins a downward path. So that we have avoided the very deep \nplunges that we previously had experienced. These deep plunges \nrepresent economic disaster for the country. They represent \nunemployment, business bankruptcies, and farm foreclosures, the like of \nwhich we have not seen in the post-World War II period. We almost seem \nto take it for granted that these major declines will not occur.\n  I am extremely apprehensive that the balanced budget amendment will \ntake us back to these days. I wanted to come tonight to sound this \nwarning as to the potential impact of this balanced budget amendment \nand how it might affect our economy, how it might impact on jobs, on \nincomes, on the long-term standards of living of the American people, \nhow it could cause significant harm to the economy because it would not \nallow us to follow policies which would avoid bringing economic \nslowdown into recession and recession into depression.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 7, 1995]\n\n                    It's a Recipe for Economic Chaos\n\n                       (By Laura D'Andrea Tyson)\n\n       Continued progress on reducing the deficit is sound \n     economic policy, but a constitutional amendment requiring \n     annual balance of the federal budget is not.

In fiscal year 1991, the economy's \n     unanticipated slowdown caused actual government spending for \n     unemployment insurance and related items to exceed the \n     budgeted amount by $6 billion, and actual revenues to fall \n     short of the budgeted amount by some $67 billion. In a \n     balanced-budget world, Congress would have been required to \n     offset the resulting shift of more than $70 billion in the \n     deficit by a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts that \n     by themselves would have sharply worsened the economic \n     downturn--resulting in an additional loss of 1\\1/4\\ percent \n     of GDP and 750,000 jobs.\n       The version of the amendment passed by the House has no \n     special ``escape clause'' for recessions--only the general \n     provision that the budget could be in deficit if three-fifths \n     of both the House and Senate agree. This is a far cry from an \n     automatic stabilizer. It is easy to imagine a well-organized \n     minority in either House of Congress holding this provision \n     hostage to its particular political agenda.\n       In a balanced-budget world--with fiscal policy enjoined to \n     destabilize rather than stabilize the economy--all \n     responsibility for counteracting the economic effects of the \n     business cycle would be placed at the doorstep of the Federal \n     Reserve. The Fed could attempt to meet this increased \n     responsibility by pushing interest rates down more \n     aggressively when the economy softens and raising them more \n     vigorously when it strengthens. But there are several reasons \n     why the Fed would not be able to moderate the ups and downs \n     of the business cycle on its own as well as it can with the \n     help of the automatic fiscal stabilizers.\n       First, monetary policy affects the economy indirectly and \n     with notoriously long lags, making it difficult to time the \n     desired effects with precision. By contrast, the automatic \n     stabilizers of fiscal policy swing into action as soon as the \n     economy begins to slow, often well before the Federal Reserve \n     even recognizes the need for compensating action.\n       Second, the Fed could become handcuffed in the event of a \n     major recession--its scope for action limited by the fact \n     that it an push short-term interest rates no lower than zero, \n     and probably not even that low. By historical standards, the \n     spread between today's short rates of 6 percent and zero \n     leaves uncomfortably little room for maneuver. Between the \n     middle of 1990 and the end of 1992, the Fed reduced the \n     short-term interest rate it controls by a cumulative total of \n     5\\1/4\\ percentage points. Even so, the economy sank into a \n     recession from which it has only recently fully recovered--a \n     recession whose severity was moderated by the very automatic \n     stabilizers of fiscal policy the balanced budget amendment \n     would destroy.\n       Third, the more aggressive actions requires of the Fed to \n     limit the increase in the variability of output and \n     employment could actually increase the volatility of \n     financial markets--an ironic possibility, given that many of \n     the amendment's proponents may well believe they are \n     promoting financial stability.\n       Finally, a balanced budget amendment would create an \n     automatic and undesirable link between interest rates and \n     fiscal policy. An unanticipated increase in interest rates \n     would boost federal interest expense and thus the deficit. \n     The balanced budget amendment under consideration would \n     require that such an unanticipated increase in the deficit be \n     offset within the fiscal year!\n       In other words, independent monetary policy decisions by \n     the Federal Reserve would require immediate and painful \n     budgetary adjustments. Where would they come from? Not from \n     interest payments and not, with such short notice, from \n     entitlement programs. Rather they would have to come from \n     either a tax increase or from cuts or possible shutdowns in \n     discretionary programs whose \n     [[Page S3219]] funds had not yet been obligated. This is not \n     a sensible way to establish budgetary priorities or maintain \n     the healthy interaction and independence of monetary and \n     fiscal policy.\n       One of the great discoveries of modern economics is the \n     role that fiscal policy can play in moderating the business \n     cycle. Few if any members of the Senate about to vote on a \n     balanced budget amendment experienced the tragic human costs \n     of the Great Depression, costs made more severe by President \n     Herbert Hoover's well-intentioned but misguided efforts to \n     balance the budget. Unfortunately, the huge deficits \n     inherited from the last decade of fiscal profligacy have \n     rendered discretionary changes in fiscal policy in response \n     to the business cycle all but impossible. Now many of those \n     responsible for the massive run-up in debt during the 1980s \n     are leading the charge to eliminate the automatic stabilizers \n     as well by voting for a balanced budget amendment.\n       Instead of undermining the government's ability to moderate \n     the economy's cyclical fluctuations by passing such an \n     amendment, why not simply make the hard choices and cast the \n     courageous votes required to reduce the deficit--the kind of \n     hard choices and courageous votes delivered by members of the \n     103rd Congress when they passed the administration's $505 \n     billion deficit reduction package?\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                High Cost of a Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n                           (By Richard Kogan)\n\n       Advocates of the Balanced Budget Amendment to the \n     Constitution do not intend to jeopardize the life savings of \n     America's families or threaten the stability of the nation's \n     banks. As written, however, the amendment could do just that.\n       Currently, America's savings are safe. The Federal Deposit \n     Insurance Corp. (FDIC) guarantees individual deposits in \n     banks and thrift institutions up to $100,000 per account. \n     Depositors rely on the U.S. government to keep its word, \n     quickly and automatically; if a bank goes broke, the \n     government makes good on deposits. Deposit insurance claims \n     are enforceable in court.\n       Now look at the Balanced Budget Amendment. It begins, \n     ``Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \n     receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of the \n     whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by law \n     for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a roll-call \n     vote.'' This deceptively simple concept--that the federal \n     budget must be balanced each year--would inadvertently cast \n     doubt over the ``full faith and credit'' of the U.S. \n     government, putting all federal guarantees, including deposit \n     insurance, at risk.\n       Here's why. During a severe economic downturn, the risk of \n     bank failure is greatest. An economic downturn also produces \n     (or exacerbates) federal budget deficits, as tax revenues \n     decline and spending for programs such as unemployment \n     compensation increases. At such a time, the government would \n     lack the extra revenues it could need to cover the large \n     costs of rescuing depositors and the banking system. Under \n     current law, deposit insurance claims are automatically paid \n     as needed, regardless of the deficit. Under the amendment, if \n     deposit insurance payments would cause a deficit, might not \n     those payments be prohibited? Don't forget that the measure \n     would amend the Constitution, while deposit insurance and \n     other such guarantees are only statutes.\n       American banking was not always protected. The Great \n     Depression was so steep--the economy shrank almost 30 percent \n     from 1929 to 1933--in part because there was no deposit \n     insurance. Some lost all their savings. A rumor that a bank \n     was in trouble prompted panic, with depositors rushing to \n     withdraw their savings. Even false rumors caused banks to \n     collapse.\n       One of President Roosevelt's first acts was to close the \n     banks while Congress enacted deposit insurance. The banks \n     reopened, citizens could redeposit their funds in safety and \n     the economic collapse ended. Deposit insurance became the \n     first and best economic stabilizer. It is one reason that no \n     post-war recession has shrunk the economy more than 3\\1/2\\ \n     percent.\n       Doesn't the FDIC charge annual fees to banks, building up \n     large balances, which would automatically be available in a \n     banking crisis?\n       Not after the amendment. It prohibits spending borrowed \n     funds, Incredibly, it also prohibits using accumulated \n     savings; it requires that all federal spending in any fiscal \n     year be covered by that year's revenues. This requirement is \n     like telling a family to finance a new house or a child's \n     college tuition out of that year's wages, no matter how much \n     money the family has in the bank. In this case, the amendment \n     precludes a sudden increase in deposit insurance payments if \n     that increase would cause federal spending to exceed federal \n     revenues in that year, no matter how much the FDIC has ``in \n     the bank.''\n       There are two possible ways out. First, Congress could \n     raise taxes or cut other spending by enough to offset deposit \n     insurance costs. But the potential size of those payments \n     shows why they could not be easily offset. The recent \n     restructuring of the savings and loan industry required \n     deposit insurance payments of $156 billion over four years, \n     $66 billion in 1991 alone. And the government's deposit \n     insurance guarantee covers private savings of $2.7 trillion. \n     These amounts are too large to be offset by a single year's \n     tax increases or spending cuts.\n       Second, there is the escape hatch. By a three-fifths vote, \n     Congress could choose to pay deposit insurance and allow \n     deficit spending. But it is hardly automatic that Congress \n     would respond in a timely manner (or at all), even in a \n     pending crisis. In August 1941 Congress barely mustered a \n     majority to extend the draft, even though Hitler had already \n     marched across half of Europe. In the current debate, neither \n     the Senate nor the House could find a majority to write into \n     the amendment an exception for recessions. Finding three-\n     fifths majorities in each House of Congress is significantly \n     more difficult. By the time Congress fully understands the \n     scope of a developing banking crisis and gathers the three-\n     fifths vote (if it can), the problem would have grown, \n     perhaps to a dangerous degree.\n       Taking the amendment at face value, then, legal commitments \n     made by the U.S. government would no longer be binding. When \n     economic troubles arose and the banking system, depositors \n     and the economy as whole most needed it, those \n     ``commitments'' could prove ephemeral.\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n                          Unbalanced Amendment\n\n       Tomorrow's vote in the Senate on the balanced-budget \n     amendment is crucial for the Republican agenda to chop \n     Government programs into bits. The outcome is also crucial to \n     the nation because the pernicious amendment would do enormous \n     fiscal damage. Proponents are alarmingly within three votes \n     of winning.\n       The core of the amendment would require the Government to \n     balance its books unless three-fifths of the House and Senate \n     vote to run a deficit. To the wavering Democrats--John Breaux \n     of Louisiana, Sam Nunn of Georgia, Wendell Ford of Kentucky, \n     and Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota--here are \n     five unassailable reasons to vote no.\n       Unnecessary.--Federal deficits have indeed been too high. \n     That poses a threat that borrowing will siphon savings away \n     from productive private investments.\n       But the fact that borrowing must be contained does not \n     imply it ought to be eliminated--any more than family \n     borrowing, to buy a house or pay college tuition, need be \n     eliminated. A prudent rule would keep Federal debt growing \n     less quickly than incomes. This rule would justify deficits \n     of about $200 billion a year, close to current levels.\n       Misleading.--Proponents claim the amendment would protect \n     future generations against ruinous interest payments. True, \n     today's children will owe taxes when they grow up to pay \n     interest on Federal debt. But proponents ignore the fact that \n     the tax payments will flow right back to these children as \n     owners of Government bonds.\n       Unenforceable.--Because key terms of the amendment--like \n     outlays and receipts--are undefined, Congress will be able to \n     manipulate and evade. Can Congress create independent \n     agencies or find other ways to spend and borrow off the \n     Government books? A Senate committee has already written into \n     the legislative record, used to guide future court decisions, \n     that the Tennessee Valley Authority would be exempt from the \n     amendment. It should take lawyers five minutes to stretch \n     whatever ``principle'' guides that exception to scores of \n     other Government programs.\n       The amendment also fails to provide an enforcement \n     mechanism. It might simply become an empty gesture or, worse \n     yet, the courts might step in to tell Congress how much it \n     should tax and where it should spend.\n       Irrational.--Federal bookkeeping lumps ordinary spending \n     with long-term public investments. Congress, forced by the \n     amendment to cut quickly, would go after hugely expensive, \n     though vitally important, investments, such as scientific \n     research, costly laboratories and equipment, job training or \n     other investments that would not produce benefits for years, \n     if not decades.\n       Reckless.--When the economy slows, tax revenues fall off \n     and spending on unemployment insurance and food stamps rises. \n     This automatic rise in the deficit, by triggering spending, \n     serves to mitigate the slowdown. But under the proposed \n     amendment, Congress could easily turn a mild downturn into \n     something worse. Unless a three-fifths supermajority saves \n     the day, Congress would have to raise taxes and cut spending \n     in a slow economy--the opposite of responsible stewardship.\n       Take another unintended consequence. When savings and loans \n     went bankrupt during the 1980's, the Federal Government \n     bailed out depositors with borrowed money, thereby preventing \n     a banking panic. But under the proposed amendment, the \n     Government could not react instantly unless a supermajority \n     in Congress approved.\n       The balanced-budget amendment appeals to taxpayers who \n     demand that the Government spend their money wisely. But \n     Senators Nunn, Ford, Conrad, Dorgan and Breaux need to \n     recognize that this honorable sentiment cannot be wisely \n     embedded into the Constitution.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, critics or outright opponents of the \nbalanced budget amendment have made the point that one reason we should \nnot have a balanced budget rule is because of how the business cycle \nand the so-called automatic stabilizers work. The \n[[Page S3220]] basic idea is that in recessions, revenues decrease and \noutlays--such as welfare payments--increase. Critics say that economic \nfluctuations are as inevitable as the tides and hence so is a cycle of \ndeficits, therefore, commanding budget balance is like ordering the \ntides to retreat.\n  The notion that ordering budget balance is like commanding the tides \nto retreat is absurd. It is like saying it is impossible to stop using \nyour credit cards. The truth is that taxing and spending decisions are \nvolitional, notwithstanding decades of bad habits.\n  Economic fluctuations which result in changes in revenue or outlay \nprojections are not an argument against balance, but could an argument \nfor surplus contingency funds. It is decidedly not an argument for \nmaintaining large structural deficits. A family saves for a rainy day, \nthey do not keep their credit cards ``maxed out''--in good times and \nbad--and then tell the credit company that economic fluctuations are as \ninevitable as the tides so how about another few thousand on the credit \nlimit.\n  The balanced budget amendment in no way prevents us from running a \nsmall surplus, which could be used to offset the effects of an economic \ndownturn. In fact, Fred Bergston, a noted economist and former Treasury \nDepartment official, suggests we create a habit of saving for rainy \ndays, which will allow us to use fiscal policy within the balanced \nbudget rule better than we can now without it.\n  The argument made by the Senator from Maryland seems to be a \ndistorted version of Keynsianism, and it is not clear that it would \nwork to stimulate our current economy. In fact, our recent history \nseems to refute such an expectation. In the early 1990's, we had record \ndeficits and zero or low growth for 3 years. The experience of the late \nBush, early Clinton, years was the experience of the Carter years, \nnamely high deficits and recession. This sort of stimulus mechanism \nobviously does not work very well. Additionally, Mr. President, \nPresident Clinton's response to the recession of the early 1990's was \nto send a budget with tax increases and spending cuts. This was \nsupported by the Senator from Maryland. Why was this plan appropriate \nin 1993 but apparently no other time?\n  Moreover, we have been running deficits for three decades. Have we \nbeen in recession for three decades? Have we avoided the business cycle \nfor three decades? No. We have had numerous business cycles since 1969 \nbut have only balanced the budget once. If critics are right, we should \nhave had a cycle of deficits and surpluses. Far from cycling, the debt \nis on a steady increase. The debt is growing at a fantastic rate: it is \nnow over $4.8 billion and is projected to exceed $6 trillion in only 3 \nyears. The correlation between deficits and prosperity is far from \nclear, based on our history.\n  I have other questions about this argument. At the level we are now \nspending, about $1.5 trillion each year, just how big of a deficit \nwould we have to run to stimulate the economy? We already have our foot \nto the floor on the debt accelerator--we cannot seriously argue that \npushing our debts further will be helpful. Talk about inflexible fiscal \npolicy. Our debt and yearly deficits are so large there just is not any \nclear room to move further. We would have more flexible fiscal policy \nif we got our deficits under control.\n  Mr. President, the principle of a rule of balanced budgets is \nunassailable, and should be violated only when absolutely necessary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/27/senate-section/article/S3148-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n                                 ______\n\n\n  SUPPORTING THE CONFIRMATION OF THE NOMINEES TO THE BASE CLOSURE AND \n                         REALIGNMENT COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I will not take much of the Senate's \ntime to express my support for the confirmation of Mrs. Cox, General \nDavis, Admiral Montoya, Mr. Kling, Mr. Cornella, and Mrs. Steele to be \nmembers of the Base Closure and Realignment Commission.\n  Despite the dismal performance by the White House when it submitted \nthese nominations, the Armed Services Committee resolved all \noutstanding issues concerning individual nominees. I should add that \nthese issues were, for the most part, related to whether or not an \nindividual should recuse himself or herself from deliberating on a \nparticular base. After considerable discussion and individual \ninterviews, these concerns were alleviated and the committee \nrecommended that the Senate confirm the nominees.\n  We now face a crucial decision. Tomorrow, as required by law, the \nSecretary of Defense will release his recommended list of bases for \nclosure. Whether or not the Senate confirms the Base Closure \nCommissioners has no impact on the release of the list. However, it \ndoes impact on the deliberative process which will proceed since we \nhave a Commission chairman. The question that every Senator who wants \nto delay the confirmation process should be asking is: Do we allow the \nchairman of the Base Closure and Realignment Commission, Senator Alan \nDixon, to solely conduct the evaluations of the Secretary's list, or do \nwe provide him with the assistance of these six Commissioners?\n  I have no doubt that despite the abilities of Alan Dixon, he and the \nSenate would rather see a group of individuals make decisions on the \nfuture of the Nation's military bases and our local economies. \nTherefore, I urge the Senate to confirm these nominations and let the \n1995 Base Closure Commission proceed with its work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/27/senate-section/article/S3220-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONFIRMATION OF AL CORNELLA\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the nomination of Al Cornella to be a member of the 1995 \nDefense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.\n  This Commission was created by Congress in 1990 with the intention it \nwould be an independent, nonpartisan decision-making body. I can assure \nmy colleagues, Al Cornella is a man of the highest integrity. He will \nbe fair in his deliberations and recommendations. During his opening \nstatement before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Al committed \nhimself to conducting his deliberations in a fair and impartial manner. \nAl Cornella is a man who keeps his word. The law requires the \nCommission to make recommendations based on specific criteria, ranging \nfrom military readiness to fiscal cost. Al Cornella's deliberations \nwill be fully consistent with the law.\n  Mr. President, I am confident in Al's character and trust his \njudgment. Al Cornella exemplifies the American spirit of community \ninvolvement. He is one of South Dakota's very best. Currently, Al is a \nsmall business owner in Rapid City, SD, and has served as chairman of \nthe board of the Rapid City Area Chamber of Commerce.\n  In addition to his civic involvement, Al has a strong interest in and \nknowledge of military issues. He served in the U.S. Navy during the \nVietnam conflict. Being a Vietnam veteran myself as a lieutenant in the \nU.S. Army, I strongly believe his commitment to duty and country should \nnot go unnoticed. For many years, Al served as a key leader in issues \nconcerning military affairs in the Rapid City Chamber of Commerce. For \nthe past 3 years, Al has served as a member of my Service Academy \nAdvisory Board, evaluating applicants seeking admission to our three \nmilitary academies.\n  Again, Mr. President, Al Cornella is a man of integrity. I urge my \ncolleagues to support his confirmation. Al Cornella has distinguished \nhimself in every endeavor in his life. He will do so again as a member \nof the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/27/senate-section/article/S3220-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/27/senate-section/article/S3220-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/27/senate-section/article/S3220-4", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3221]]\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:12 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 450.

A bill to authorize a certificate of documentation for the \nvessel Lady Hawk, to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n               documentation for the vessel ``lady hawk''\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to provide \na certificate of documentation for the vessel Lady Hawk, U.S. Official \nNo. 961095.\n  The Lady Hawk is owned by Ms. Joan Dunn of Seldovia, AK.\n  The vessel was built in Little Falls, MN in 1989.\n  The first owners of the vessel--a married couple--were thought to be \nU.S. citizens, and a certificate of documentation for the Lady Hawk was \nissued in June 1990.\n  In November 1990, Ms. Joan Dunn purchased the Lady Hawk from the \noriginal owners, with the intent to eventually use it as a charter \nfishing vessel.\n  On November 11, 1993, Ms. Dunn received a notice from the Coast Guard \nthat one of the married couple who originally owned the vessel was in \nfact a Canadian citizen, and that the certificate of documentation for \nthe Lady Hawk was therefore invalid.\n  The Coast Guard determined that Ms. Dunn was a bona fide purchaser in \ngood faith, and informed her that it was pursuing penalty action \nagainst the former owner, but that the certificate of documentation for \nthe Lady Hawk was nevertheless invalid.\n  The bill I am introducing today would grant a Jones Act waiver to Ms. \nDunn for the vessel Lady Hawk.\n  Ms. Dunn, through no fault of her own, cannot use this vessel for \nfishing charters or other coastwise trade without this waiver.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. NICKLES (for himself, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Helms, \n        Mr. Ashcroft, and Mrs. Hutchinson):\n  S. 476.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nMaximum Speed Limit Repeal Act of 1995 on behalf of myself and Mr. \nCampbell. This legislation will return to the States the authority to \nestablish their own speed limits.\n  The national maximum speed limit allows the Federal Government to \npenalize States which do not comply with posting and enforcement of \nspeed regulations. The penalties are potentially as high as 10 percent \nof a State's National Highway System and surface transportation funds. \nIt is also important to note that these highway revenues are generated \nentirely by the States.\n  The 55 mph speed limit law, which was amended to allow for a 65 mph \nlimit on interstates and similar highways, in one of 19 provisions of \nFederal law which threatens States with the loss of their badly needed \nhighway funds. Repealing the national maximum speed limit will help to \neliminate these unnecessary and unfair Federal penalties.\n  This bill will further empower States with the responsibility to make \ntheir own decisions with regard to speed limits. Such authority should \nnot be imposed by the bureaucracy in Washington, DC, but instead should \nbe regulated by the individual States who understand their own \ntransportation needs and who know what restrictions are best-suited for \ntheir citizens. Following my statement, I request that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. We urge all Members to cosponsor this \nimportant measure.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed, in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 476\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in \n     Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the temporary suspension of the \nreformulated gasoline requirements under the Clean Air Act in States \nwhere bona fide health concerns have been raised until those concerns \nare appropriately addressed; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n       TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF REFORMULATED GASOLINE REQUIREMENTS\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, on January 1 of this year, the reformulated \ngasoline requirements under the Clean Air Act came into effect in \nsoutheastern Wisconsin, as well as other areas around the Nation. The \npurpose of the reformulated gasoline requirement is to facilitate the \nuse of cleaner-burning fuels in the areas of the country that are \nexperiencing the most severe air pollution problems.\n  In general, I have supported the use of reformulated gasoline as \nbeing one of the most cost-effective ways to address air pollution from \nmobile sources, such as automobiles. However earlier this month, \ncitizens of southeastern Wisconsin began to experience difficulties \nwith the new fuels. Problems have ranged from health concerns to \nmechanical problems to reductions in fuel efficiency.\n  Most alarming to me are the health complaints that I have heard \nassociated with the fumes from the reformulated gas, including nausea, \nitchy and burning eyes, shortness of breath, dizziness, and skin \nrashes.\n  I believe that the citizens of Wisconsin strongly support the overall \ngoal of the Clean Air Act, which is to protect human health through \nimproved air quality. But when people are becoming sick as a result of \nthese requirements, it only makes sense to temporarily suspend the \nprogram in question, until the health concerns are adequately \naddressed.\n  On February 10 of this year, I called on EPA Administrator Carol \nBrowner to suspend the reformulated gasoline program in Wisconsin until \nApril 1, 1995, in order to allow citizens to purchase conventional \ngasoline while the health concerns associated with the reformulated \nfuels are being investigated. The Governor of Wisconsin had made the \nsame request earlier that day.\n  On February 24, I finally received the response to the request that I \nhad made. In short, I found the response to be very inadequate. EPA did \nnot agree to provide the temporary suspension that we had request, but \ninstead offered to work with the oil industry to make an unspecified \nalternative fuel available on a limited basis.\n  Because the EPA response to the matter does not address my concerns, \nI am offering legislation to require the suspension of reformulated \ngasoline requirements when bona fide health concerns are raised by a \nState where the requirements have been imposed.\n  The bill addresses the specific problem faced by Wisconsin, without \naffecting the reformulated gasoline program as implemented in other \nregions of the Nation. The bill also establishes a process whereby a \ntask force of Federal health and environmental officials work with the \naffected State to investigate the specific health concerns, and report \nback to Congress about their findings. The task force would also make \nrecommendations to Congress and the State about other fuel formulations \nthat could be used in the State, without causing the health problems \nthat led to the suspension. Once the concerns are addressed, the \nreformulated gasoline program would be reinstated.\n  Mr. President, it is not my intent to hinder the implementation of \nthe Clean Air Act. But as I said when I supported passage of the Clean \nAir Act, my bottom line concern is the health of the citizens of \nWisconsin. If people are getting sick, I believe that it is my \nresponsibility to see that the health questions are addressing \nadequately. While I had hoped that such effort would have been handled \nadministratively by EPA, the lack of action of the part of EPA has left \nno alternative but legislative action.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be included in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 477\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in \n     Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SUSPENSION OF REFORMULATED GASOLINE RULES.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other law, upon the certification by \n     appropriate health officials of a State that bona fide health \n     concerns have been raised with respect to the use of \n     reformulated gasoline as required by rules issued by the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to \n     achieve the objectives of 211(k) of the Clean Air Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7545(k)), the Administrator shall suspend \n     implementation of those rules in the State until the later \n     of--\n       (1) April 1, 1995; or\n       (2) the date on which the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services and the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, in conjunction with appropriate public \n     health officials of the State, certify that the reformulated \n     gasoline used to achieve the objectives of that section is \n     not causing human health problems.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe taxable sale or use, without penalty, of dyed diesel fuel with \nrespect to recreational boaters; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n correction of the implementation of the recreational boat diesel fuel \n                                  tax\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation to \nclarify the implementation of a law that we adopted in 1993. One of the \nprovisions included in the 1993 Budget Reconciliation Act removed the \nexemption from payment of the diesel fuel tax that recreational boaters \npreviously had.\n  At the same time, the 1993 Budget Act modified the collection point \nfor all of the fuel taxes and imposed fuel dying requirements. The \ncombination of these two changes have made the implementation of the \nfuel tax a disaster creating a situation where many recreational \nboaters cannot find any fuel to pay tax on.\n  Under the 1993 changes, fuel that is subject to taxation is clear and \nfuel that is exempt from taxation is dyed. The problem for boaters \narises because most marinas have only one fuel tank, however, they \nprovide fuel to both commercial and recreational boats. Commercial boat \nfuel is exempt from any tax and therefore commercial boat operators \nseek to purchase dyed fuel. Recreational fuel is taxable and \nrecreational boaters want to purchase clear fuel. For those marina \noperators with only one fuel tank, they must decide if they will offer \nclear, taxable fuel for the recreational boaters or \n[[Page S3223]] offer dyed tax-exempt fuel for the commercial boaters. \nMost marina operators in my State of Louisiana, find that their primary \ncustomer base is made up of commercial boaters and they are choosing to \nsell the dyed fuels. Thus, recreational boaters have no place to \npurchase the clear fuel.\n  Mr. President, this is a clear case of unintended consequences. The \nboaters are willing to pay the tax, they simply cannot find the place \nto buy the fuel and pay the tax. My bill is very simple. It modifies \nthe collection process for diesel boating fuel. It allows marina \noperators to purchase dyed, exempt fuel and then collect the tax \ndirectly from recreational boaters and remit the tax to the Government \ndirectly.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this is a very simple solution to this \nvery difficult problem. I urge the Senate to act on this important \nissue as soon as possible.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/27/senate-section/article/S3221-6", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 50\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from Texas [Mrs. \nHutchison] was added as a cosponsor of S. 50, a bill to repeal the \nincrease in tax on social security benefits.\n\n\n                                 S. 262\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the names of the Senator from \nDelaware [Mr. Biden] and the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 262, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986 to increase and make permanent the deduction for health \ninsurance costs of self-employed individuals.\n\n\n                                 S. 275\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] was added as a cosponsor of S. 275, a bill \nto establish a temporary moratorium on the Interagency Memorandum of \nAgreement Concerning Wetlands Determinations until enactment of a law \nthat is the successor to the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade \nAct of 1990, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 325\n\n  At the request of Mr. Thomas, the name of the Senator from Arizona \n[Mr. Kyl] was added as a cosponsor of S. 325, a bill to make certain \ntechnical corrections in laws relating to Native Americans, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 457\n\n  At the request of Mr. Simon, the name of the Senator from Washington \n[Mrs. Murray] was added as a cosponsor of S. 457, a bill to amend the \nImmigration and Nationality Act to update references in the \nclassification of children for purposes of U.S. immigration laws.\n\n\n                     Senate Concurrent Resolution 3\n\n  At the request of Mr. Simon, the names of the Senator from Delaware \n[Mr. Roth] and the Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar] were added as \ncosponsors of Senate Concurrent Resolution 3, a concurrent resolution \nrelative to Taiwan and the United Nations.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/27/senate-section/article/S3223-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 81--COMMENDING ROBERT D.

Mr. President, violent crime is taking a terrible toll on \nour entire society, but nowhere are its effects more pronounced or more \ntragic than on our youngest citizens. An American child dies from \ngunshot wounds every 2 hours. Homicide is now the third leading cause \nof death for children between ages 5 and 14.\n  Although the violence has also swept through rural and suburban \nareas, it has been especially pronounced in our cities. Hartford, the \ncapital city of my State, has seen a terrible loss of life in recent \nyears, much of it involving young people. But many of Hartford's \nchildren are saying, ``Enough.''\n  One such group of children, Mrs. Kulesa's fourth-grade class at the \nM.D. Fox School in Hartford, recently wrote to me with copies of their \n``Peace Poems.'' These poems are cries from the heart by a group of \nchildren who want nothing more than to grow up without violence and \nwithout fear.\n  These children's words are more eloquent than mine could ever be, so \nI want to allow them to speak for themselves. Therefore, I ask that \ntheir poems be printed in the Record.\n  The poems follow:\n\n                                 Peace\n\n                          (By Ashley Serrano)\n\n     It will make

missing, it is sad.\n     To make it grow,\n     seeds of kind acts we sow.\n\n                                 Peace\n\n                            (By Wanda Vega)\n\n     Peace is so good,\n     Having it we should.\n     It avoids fighting,\n     and back biting.\n\n                                 Peace\n\n                           (By Jason Vazquez)\n\n     When we are all together as

                  (by Wilburt Jarrett)\n\n     Peace is like the color of red.\n     It feels like a feather on your head.\n     It smells like roses in vases.\n     It sounds like people talking in races.\n     Peace tastes like buttercup candy.\n     Always keep supplies of understanding handy.\n\n                                 Peace\n\n                         (by Michael Robinson)\n\n

self be true.\n     Keep peace in your school\n\n                                 Peace\n\n                           (by Jermaine Cruz)\n\n     May we have a better day;\n     let us have peace

Mr. President, in 1992, Illinoisians made history by \nelecting the first African-American woman to the U.S. Senate, our \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun.\n  For that landmark election and for other reasons, Illinois can take \npride in the women our State has sent to Congress in this century. \nPhilip A. Grant, Jr., a professor of history at Pace University in New \nYork City, recently documented this record in a paper he presented at \nthe Illinois History Symposium in Springfield, IL. I ask that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                 Congresswomen From Illinois, 1920-1990\n\n                       (By Philip A. Grant, Jr.)\n\n       The purpose of this paper will be to review the careers of \n     the various women elected to Congress from the State of \n     Illinois between 1920 and 1990. During this eventful period \n     of seven decades, a total of nine women won congressional \n     seats in Illinois.\n       Two of the nine Illinois congresswomen were members of \n     prominent political families. These two ladies, Winnifred \n     Mason Huck of Chicago and Edna O. Simpson of Carrollton, were \n     Republicans whose tenures on Capitol Hill were rather brief.\n       Huck decided to run for the position of Congressman-at-\n     Large shortly after the death of her father, William E. \n     Mason, on June 16, 1921. Mason, subsequent to having been a \n     member of both Houses of the Illinois Legislature, had served \n     fourteen years in Congress. On November 8, 1992 Huck was \n     elected to complete the unexpired portion of her father's \n     term in the House. Although she enjoyed the distinction of \n     becoming Illinois' first woman to enter Congress, Huck's \n     actual experience was limited to the fifteen weeks between \n     November 20, 1922 and March 3, 1923.\n       Simpson was the wife of Representative Sid Simpson, who \n     spent eight terms in the House and was a former Chairman of \n     the Committee on the District of Columbia. A solid favorite \n     to win a ninth term, Simpson suddenly died on October 26, \n     1958. At the urging of Republican leaders in Illinois' \n     Twentieth Congressional District, Mrs. Simpson agreed to be \n     the party's candidate in the 1958 general election. On \n     election day she handily defeated her Democratic opponent, \n     carrying twelve of the district's fourteen counties. Although \n     she represented a heavily Republican constituency, Mrs. \n     Simpson opted to retire in 1960.\n       Two other ladies from Illinois who were elected to Congress \n     were Ruth Hanna McCormick of Bryan and Emily Taft Douglas of \n     Chicago. McCormick, a Republican, was both the daughter and \n     the wife of former Congressmen, while Douglas, a Democrat, \n     was married to a future member of the United States Senate.\n       McCormick's father was Marcus A. Hanna, who had served both \n     as a United States Senator from Ohio and Chairman of the \n     Republican National Committee. Her husband, Medill McCormick, \n     had been a member of both the House and Senate. After four \n     years as Republican National Committeewoman from Illinois, \n     McCormick in 1928 was elected Congresswoman-at-Large. Closely \n     identified with the policies of President Herbert Hoover, \n     McCormick in 1930 was defeated in her quest for a seat in the \n     United States Senate.\n       Douglas was the wife of Paul H. Douglas, who served in the \n     United States Senate from 1949 to 1967. On November 7, 1944 \n     Douglas became the first Democratic woman to be elected to \n     Congress from Illinois. Douglas in 1944 defeated the \n     incumbent Republican Congressman-at-Large, Stephen A. Day, a \n     staunch isolationist. Assigned to the prestigious Committee \n     on Foreign Affairs, Douglas worked for passage of the United \n     Nations Participation Bill, the British Loan Bill, and the \n     measures authorizing American involvement in UNESCO and the \n     United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. In November \n     1946 Douglas lost her bid for re-election to Republican \n     William G. Stratton, who later would twice be elected \n     Governor of Illinois.\n       Three Illinois ladies who each served several consecutive \n     terms in the House were Republicans Jessie Sumner of Milford, \n     Marguerite Stitt Church of Evanston, and Charlotte T. Reid of \n     Aurora. Sumner, Church, and Reid compiled unblemished records \n     of political success in their respective congressional \n     campaigns.\n       Sumner was elected to the first of four terms in Congress \n     in November 1938. Sumner's district consisted of six \n     downstate counties extending vertically in close proximity to \n     the Indiana state line. As a member of the Banking and \n     Currency Committee, Sumner vigorously opposed the domestic \n     policies of Democratic Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and \n     Harry S. Truman. Moreover, Sumner was one of the most \n     outspoken isolationists on Capitol Hill,\n      opposing such key measures as the 1939 repeal of the arms \n     embargo, the Lend-Lease Bill, the Fulbright Resolution, \n     and the International Monetary Fund (Bretton Woods) Bill.\n       Church was the widow of Ralph E. Church, who was in the \n     midst of his seventh term in the House at the time of his \n     death on March 21, 1950. Mrs. Church was elected to Congress \n     in November 1950 and was thereafter re-elected five times. In \n     addition to the City of Evanston, her constituency included \n     several affluent suburban communities north of Chicago. Mrs. \n     Church's victorious proportions ranged from 66.0% to 74.1%, \n     and in all six campaigns she polled the highest number of \n     votes of any Illinois congressman. She was a member of the \n     Foreign Affairs Committee and in her final term served as a \n     delegate to the General Assembly of the United Nations.\n       [[Page S3226]] Reid was initially elected to the House in \n     November 1962. Her district was composed of five counties \n     located between thirty and fifty miles west of Chicago. Reid \n     was elected to five terms by sizeable margins and became the \n     first Illinois congresswoman to serve on the powerful \n     Committee on Appropriations. On October 7, 1971 Reid \n     relinquished her seat in the House of Representatives to \n     accept President Richard M. Nixon's appointment to the \n     Federal Trade Commission.\n       The two most renowned Illinois congresswomen in recent \n     years have been Republican Lynn M. Martin of Rockford and \n     Democrat Cardiss Collins of Chicago. Martin and Collins began \n     their active political careers in the nineteen seventies and \n     have remained two of the most articulate members of their \n     rival political parties.\n       After serving in both the Illinois House of Representatives \n     and State Senate, Martin was elected to Congress in 1980. Her \n     district for two decades had been represented by John D. \n     Anderson, who in 1980 became an Independent candidate for \n     President. A formidable vote-getter and an eloquent public \n     speaker, Martin became the first Illinois congresswoman to be \n     designed a member of the influential Committee on Rules and \n     the woman to be chosen as Vice Chairman of the House \n     Republican Conference. Although virtually guaranteed re-\n     election to a sixth term in 1990, Martin instead engaged in \n     an unsuccessful bid for the United States Senate. On December \n     4, 1990 Martin was appointed by President George Bush to the \n     Cabinet-level position of Secretary of Labor.\n       Collins on June 5, 1973 won a special election to succeed \n     her late husband, Representative George W. Collins. At that \n     time Collins became the first Black congresswomen from the \n     Midwest. Easily re-elected to nine additional terms, Collins \n     after her 1990 victory was outranked in seniority by only \n     sixty-seven of her four hundred and thirty-four House \n     colleagues. Collins, serving an impoverished urban district, \n     established herself as one of the most liberal Democrats in \n     Congress. Between 1979 and 1981 she occupied the post of \n     Chairperson of the Congressional Black Caucus. Finally, as \n     the ranking Democrat on the Committee on Government \n     Operations, Collins chaired the Subcommittee on Government \n     Activities and Transportation.\n       The nine women from Illinois who served in Congress between \n     1920 and 1990 performed their duties in a conscientious \n     manner. As members of such important committees as Banking \n     and Currency, Foreign Affairs, Appropriations, and Rules, \n     these congresswomen exerted influence over the fate of a \n     substantial number and wide variety of major legislative \n     measures. While two of these ladies failed in attempts to win \n     races for the United States Senate, it was noteworthy that \n     the nine congresswomen prevailed in thirty-four of thirty-\n     five House elections. Both individually and collective the \n     nine congresswomen from Illinois reflected high credit on \n     their state and nation.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/27/senate-section/article/S3225-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE PEOPLE'S \n                           REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on East \nAsian and Pacific Affairs, I am pleased to report to my colleagues that \nearly yesterday the United States signed an Intellectual Property \nRights Enforcement Agreement with the People's Republic of China.\n  Since 1992, the People's Republic of China has failed to live up to \nits obligation under the memorandum of understanding on intellectual \nproperty rights. Factories throughout China, especially in such \nsouthern and eastern provinces as Guangdong, continue to mass-produce \npirated versions of American computer software, compact discs, CD-\nROM's, and video and audio cassettes mostly for sale abroad. The United \nStates Trade Representative estimates that piracy of audio-visual works \nruns close to 100 percent, while piracy of other technological items \nsuch as computer software runs around 94 to 100 percent. In addition, \npiracy of trademarks is rampant. This piracy is much more than a minor \nnuisance. The sale of these pirated items has cost U.S. businesses more \nthan $1 billion, a sum which threatens to increase exponentially as the \nnumber of pirated products swells. It endangers Americans jobs, as well \nas our primacy in software innovation.\n  While we understand that enforcing IPR in such a large country can be \ndifficult, such an argument in relation to the People's Republic of \nChina is somewhat specious in light of the fact that production is \ntolerated, if not actively encouraged in some instances, by Chinese \nmunicipal and provincial governments as well as the central authorities \nin Beijing. The United States Trade Representative has complained \nrepeatedly about the problem and United States-China negotiators have \nbeen meeting for more than a year and a half in an effort to resolve \nit.\n  Still, the Chinese refused to stem the manufacture of these goods. \nConsequently, the United States Trade Representative proposed to impose \npunitive tariffs on about $1 billion worth of Chinese goods if a \nsatisfactory accord was not reached by February 26. The two sides \nnegotiated right up to and past the deadline, and in the early hours \nSunday reached a consensus.\n  The agreement has three principle goals: to take immediate steps to \nstem piracy of IPR material, to make long-term changes to ensure \neffective enforcement of IPR in the future, and to provide United \nStates IPR holders with greater access to the Chinese market. As for \nthe first goal, Beijing has pledged to implement a 6-month special \nenforcement period beginning March 1 during which time the Government \nwill increase resources to target the 29 CD and laser disc factories \nknown to be engaging in pirated production, and confiscate and destroy \nillegally produced output and the machinery used to produce it. Beijing \nhas already signaled its willingness to work with us on this front; \nduring the negotiations, the authorities shut down seven of the illegal \nfactories including two of the most notorious--the Shenfei Laser \nOptical Systems Co. plant in Shenzhen, and a factory in Zhuhai. In \naddition, Beijing has proposed to tighten its customs practices to stem \nthe exportation of illegal products.\n  As for long-term changes, the Chinese Government has pledged to \nensure that Government ministries cease using pirated software--\napparently pirated Microsoft products are very popular, even within the \nTrade Ministry. Furthermore, the Government will establish an effective \nIPR enforcement structure consisting of IPR conference working groups \nat the central, provincial, and local level to coordinate enforcement \nefforts, and to ensure that the laws are strictly enforced. Similarly, \nit will remodel its customs enforcement system after that of the United \nStates. Lastly, China would create a title verification system, and \nwould ensure that United States right holders have access to effective \nand meaningful judicial relief in cases of infringements.\n  Finally the People's Republic of China has pledged to enhance access \nto its markets for United States right holders. It will place no quotas \non the importation of U.S. audio-visual products, and will allow U.S. \nrecord companies--subject to certain censorship concerns--to market \ntheir entire catalog. Finally, United States companies will be \npermitted to enter into joint ventures for the production and \nreproduction of their products in the People's Republic of China.\n  Mr. President, although I fully supported the position of the United \nStates Trade Representative and would have fully supported the \nimposition of sanctions, ultimately imposing sanctions on the Chinese \nwould have been a Pyrrhic victory. ``When two dragons fight, the \ngrasses are trampled''; a trade war would have had disastrous effects \non countless U.S. businesses, as well as overall Sino-American \nrelations. I'm glad that we have avoided that outcome, and am pleased \nwith the resulting agreement. I would like to commend Charlene \nBarshefsky, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, for her hard work.\n  On March 8, our subcommittee will conduct a hearing on IPR in China \nand the Enforcement Agreement. I hope to learn about the agreement in \ndetail from the United States Trade Representative's office, and to \nhear from representatives of private industry on their view of the \naccord. While the agreement is an important step forward, the true test \nwill lie in its implementation; and we intend that the subcommittee \nwill closely monitor compliance with the agreement over the coming \nmonths.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/27/senate-section/article/S3226-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3226-S3227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            P.S./WASHINGTON\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, readers of a newspaper column that I have \nwritten within the last 2 weeks were exposed to a tribute to First Lady \nHillary Rodham Clinton and a serious discussion about public opposition \nto homosexuals in the military.\n  [[Page S3227]] For the benefit of my colleagues, I ask that they be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The columns follow:\n\n                The Haters Target Hillary Rodham Clinton\n\n                        (By Senator Paul Simon)\n\n       When I was about nine years old, my father took me to hear \n     Eleanor Roosevelt speak. Even as a nine-year-old, I knew she \n     had sparked controversy. My father, a Lutheran minister, told \n     me that she stood for helping those in great need.\n       Years later I had the opportunity to meet her a few times, \n     and on one occasion to sit next to her at a dinner. A \n     plainspoken women of simple tastes but obvious conviction, \n     she somehow stirred passionate opposition.\n       History now regards her as one of our finest first ladies.\n       I mention this because in a somewhat similar way, Hillary \n     Rodham Clinton manages to generate strong feelings of \n     disapproval from some. I confess I do not understand it.\n       I saw her leadership on the health care issue, and while \n     some mistakes were made and the nation did not get health \n     coverage for all our citizens, I have yet to meet anyone who \n     sat in any of those meetings who did not come away impressed \n     by her ability, her mastery of the subject, and her \n     sincerity.\n       In one interview that has been published, she half-\n     apologized for the way she has handled things.\n       She is not the person who should apologize; it is the mean-\n     spirited haters who should reflect on their response.\n       There are those who expect the first lady to be present on \n     official occasions, smile sweetly at the appropriate time, \n     cut a ribbon for a new building or enterprise now and then \n     but otherwise be devoid of opinion or influence.\n       That day has passed.\n       I have served under five presidents, beginning with Gerald \n     Ford. All of their wives, starting with Betty Ford, are known \n     to have played a role in public matters. Hillary Clinton has \n     done it more openly.\n       Senator Bob Dole is the leading Republican candidate for \n     President today. If he should be elected, Elizabeth Dole, a \n     former cabinet member and now president of the American Red \n     Cross, will not be some decorative figure sitting on the \n     sidelines. ``Liddy'' Dole will make her presence felt on the \n     national scene, if that situation arises, and I would want \n     her to do that.\n       My wife, Jeanne Simon, has contributed significantly to \n     what I have been able to do in public life, and I am grateful \n     to her for that, and proud of her for that.\n       President Clinton brought to the White House someone whose \n     leadership and base of conviction means much to all of us.\n       Her critics are noisier than her supporters. That is always \n     the case.\n       But she should know that there are many of us who are \n     grateful to her.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                   Homosexuality and Military Service\n\n                        (By Senator Paul Simon)\n\n       ``How can you support having homosexuals in the armed \n     forces?'' a visibly angry woman asked me after a town meeting \n     recently. ``Don't you believe in the Bible?''\n       I confess I am not much impressed by people who hate in the \n     name of religion. But let me answer her question partially, \n     since I do not claim to be a theologian.\n       When I was a boy, my father never had to call me aside and \n     say, ``Paul, you ought to be interested in girls.'' I came by \n     it very naturally. He had to give me other warnings!\n       Just as my interest in girls came naturally, that is not \n     natural for a small percentage of men. There is evidence that \n     there is a genetic basis for this difference among men, \n     although the scientific research is less complete for women.\n       Regardless of the reasons for this difference, there are \n     several issues that woman with the angry question should \n     address.\n       If there is a military emergency and we have a draft, would \n     you exempt anyone who says he is gay? The percentage of those \n     claiming to be gay would suddenly escalate!\n       Because you mentioned the biblical basis for your beliefs, \n     since the 10 Commandments mention adultery and not \n     homosexuality, and adultery is condemned at least 40 times \n     more than homosexuality in the Bible, should we keep anyone \n     out of the service who has committed adultery? My \n     recollection of my Army days is that would thin our ranks \n     appreciably.\n       Or should we judge people by their conduct, not their \n     genes? That makes sense to me.\n       When I was in the Army--long ago--I served in intelligence \n     and we screened people for security clearances. Those who \n     were gay were kicked out of the Army--that's a recent \n     phenomenon--but they could not get security clearances \n     because we judged that they could be blackmailed, certainly a \n     proper judgment in the early 1950s.\n       But during those days, and during all of our previous wars, \n     we had an armed service to be proud of, and it was inclusive.\n       There is also the problem of where you stop the practice of \n     discrimination. If people cannot serve in the armed forces, \n     what about the police force or fire department? What jobs \n     would you let them have? Once you start the practice of \n     discrimination, where do you stop?\n       I would finally ask that woman who is so righteously angry: \n     What would you do if your son or daughter came home and told \n     you that he or she is gay?\n       What would you do?\n       My guess is that even that hard heart would melt.\n       And become more understanding.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/27/senate-section/article/S3226-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. SARBANES.
