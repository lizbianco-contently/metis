Under the order previously \nentered, the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka] is recognized to read \nGeorge Washington's farewell address.\n  Mr. AKAKA, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\n\nTo the people of the United States.\n  Friends and Fellow Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those, out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you, at the same time, to do me the justice to be assured, that \nthis resolution has not been taken, without strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country; and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest; no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness; but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what \nappeared to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been \nmuch earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \nbeen reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, \nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and \nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \nto abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety; and am persuaded, whatever \npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \ncircumstances of our country, you will not disapprove my determination \nto retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust, were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \nthe organization and administration of the government, the best \nexertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not \nunconscious in the outset, of the inferiority of my qualifications, \nexperience, in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, \nhas strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; and, every day, \nthe increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more, that the \nshade of retirement is as necessary to \n\n[[Page S1306]]\nme as it will be welcome. Satisfied that if any circumstances have \ngiven peculiar value to my services they were temporary, I have the \nconsolation to believe that, while choice and prudence invite me to \nquit the political scene, patriotism does not forbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is to terminate the career of \nmy political life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend the deep \nacknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved \ncountry, for the many honors it has conferred upon me; still more for \nthe steadfast confidence with which it has supported me; and for the \nopportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable \nattachment, by services faithful and persevering, though in usefulness \nunequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country from these \nservices, let it always be remembered to your praise, and as an \ninstructive example in our annals, that under circumstances in which \nthe passions, agitated in every direction, were liable to mislead \namidst appearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often \ndiscouraging--in situations in which not unfrequently, want of success \nhas countenanced the spirit of criticism,--the constancy of your \nsupport was the essential prop of the efforts, and a guarantee of the \nplans, by which they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this \nidea, I shall carry it with me to my grave, as a strong incitement to \nunceasing vows that heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of \nits beneficence--that your union and brotherly affection may be \nperpetual--that the free constitution, which is the work of your hands, \nmay be sacredly maintained--that its administration in every department \nmay be stamped with wisdom and virtue--that, in fine, the happiness of \nthe people of these states, under the auspices of liberty, may be made \ncomplete by so careful a preservation, and so prudent a use of this \nblessing, as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the \napplause, the affection and adoption of every nation which is yet a \nstranger to it.\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger, \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me, on an occasion like the present, \nto offer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your \nfrequent review, some sentiments which are the result of much \nreflection, of no inconsiderable observation, and which appear to me \nall important to the permanency of your felicity as a people. These \nwill be offered to you with the more freedom, as you can only see in \nthem the disinterested warnings of a parting friend, who can possibly \nhave no personal motive to bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an \nencouragement to it, your indulgent reception of my sentiments on a \nformer and not dissimilar occasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people, is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real independence; the support of your tranquility at home: your \npeace abroad; of your safety; of your prosperity; of that very liberty \nwhich you so highly prize. But, as it is easy to foresee that, from \ndifferent causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken, \nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed; it is of \ninfinite movement, that you should properly estimate the immense value \nof your national union to your collective and individual happiness; \nthat you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment \nto it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the \npalladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its \npreservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may \nsuggest even a suspicion that it can, in any event, be abandoned; and \nindignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to \nalienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the \nsacred ties which now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth, or choice, of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism, more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have, in a \ncommon cause, fought and triumphed together; the independence and \nliberty you possess, are the work of joint counsels, and joint efforts, \nof common dangers, sufferings and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest.--Here, every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nunion of the whole.\n  The north, in an unrestrained intercourse with the south, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter, great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise, and precious materials of manufacturing industry.--The \nsouth, in the same intercourse, benefiting by the same agency of the \nnorth, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning \npartly into its own channels the seamen of the north, it finds its \nparticular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in \ndifferent ways, to nourish and increase the general mass of the \nnational navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime \nstrength, to which itself is unequally adapted. The east, in a like \nintercourse with the west, already finds, and in the progressive \nimprovement of interior communications by land and water, will more and \nmore find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from \nabroad, or manufactures at home. The west derives from the east \nsupplies requisite to its growth and comfort--and what is perhaps of \nstill greater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure \nenjoyment of indispensable outlets for its own productions, to the \nweight, influence, and the future maritime strength of the Atlantic \nside of the Union, directed by an indissoluble community of interest as \none nation. Any other tenure by which the west can hold this essential \nadvantage, whether derived from its own separate strength; or from an \napostate and unnatural connection with any foreign power, must be \nintrinsically precarious.\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts, greater strength, greater \nresource proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \nof inestimable value, they must derive from union, an exemption from \nthose broils and wars between themselves, which so frequently afflict \nneighboring countries not tied together by the same government; which \ntheir own rivalship alone would be sufficient to produce, but which \nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues, would stimulate \nand embitter.--Hence likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those \novergrown military establishments, which under any form of government \nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as \nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is, that \nyour union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and \nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the \nother.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the union as a \nprimary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? let experience solve it. To \nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are \nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the \nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will \nafford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and \nfull experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union, \naffecting all parts of our \n\n[[Page S1307]]\ncountry, while experience shall not have demonstrated its \nimpracticability, there will always be reason to distrust the \npatriotism of those who, in any quarter, may endeavor to weaken its \nhands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern, that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical discriminations,--northern \nand southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor \nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests \nand views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within \nparticular districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other \ndistricts. You cannot shield yourself too much against the jealousies \nand heart burnings which spring from these misrepresentations: they \ntend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together \nby fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have \nlately had a useful lesson on this head: they have seen, in the \nnegotiation by the executive, and in the unanimous ratification by the \nsenate of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at \nthe event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded \nwere the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general \ngovernment and in the Atlantic states, unfriendly to their interests in \nregard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of \ntwo treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure \nto them everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign \nrelations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their \nwisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the union by \nwhich they were procured? will they not henceforth be deaf to those \nadvisers, if such they are, who would sever them from their brethren \nand connect them with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute; they must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay, by the adoption of a constitution of government, \nbetter calculated than your former, for an intimate union, and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government.--But the constitution which at any \ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower, and the right of the people to establish government, presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character, with the real design \nto direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberations and \naction of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this \nfundamental principle, and of fatal tendency.--They serve to organize \nfaction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force, to put in \nthe place of the delegated will of the nation the will of party, often \na small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; and, \naccording to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the \npublic administration the mirror of the ill concerted and incongruous \nprojects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome \nplans digested by common councils, and modified by mutual interests.\n  However combinations or associations of the above description may now \nand then answer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time \nand things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and \nunprincipled men, will be enable to subvert the power of the people, \nand to usurp for themselves the reigns of government; destroying \nafterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular opposition to its acknowledged authority, but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretext. One method of assault may be \nto effect, in the forms of the constitution, alterations which will \nimpair the energy of the system; and thus to undermine what cannot be \ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments, as of other human institutions:--that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country:--that facility in changes, upon \nthe credit of mere hypothesis and opinion, exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypothesis and opinion: and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable. \nLiberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is, indeed, little \nelse than a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of fraction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular references to the founding them on geographical \ndiscrimination. Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind.--It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism.--But this leads at length to a more \nformal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which \nresult, gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose \nin the absolute power of an individual; and, sooner or later, the chief \nof some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his \ncompetitors, turns this disposition to the purpose of his own elevation \non the ruins of public liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it in \nthe interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\n  It serves always to distract the public councils, and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother; forments occasional riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access \nto the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus \nthe policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and \nwill of another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the \nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true; and in \ngovernments of a monarchial cast, patriotism may look with indulgence, \nif not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of \n\n[[Page S1308]]\nthe popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit \nnot to be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there \nwill always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And \nthere being constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be, by force \nof public opinion, to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be \nquenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent it bursting into a \nflame, lest instead of warming, it should consume.\n  It is important likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those intrusted with its \nadministration, to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment, to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominate in the human heart, is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the \npublic weal against invasions of the others, has been evinced by \nexperiments ancient and modern: some of them in our country and under \nour own eyes.--To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute \nthem. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or \nmodification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, \nlet it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the constitution \ndesignates.--But let there be no change by usurpation; for through \nthis, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the \ncustomary weapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent \nmust always greatly overbalance in permanent evil, any partial or \ntransient benefit which the use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked, where is the security for property, for reputation, \nfor life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which \nare the instruments of investigation in courts of justice? and let us \nwith caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained \nwithout religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect, that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or \nless force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere \nfriend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the \nfoundation of the fabric?\n  Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering, also, that timely disbursements, to prepare for danger, \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions, in time of peace, to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should co-operate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind, that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper object (which is always a choice of difficulties), ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any \ntime debate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all. Religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \ndoubt but, in the course of time and things, the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it; can it be that Providence has not connected the \npermanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan, nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachment for others, should be excluded; and that, in \nplace of them, just and amicable feelings towards all should be \ncultivated. The nation which indulges towards another an habitual \nhatred, or an habitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a \nslave to its animosity, or to its affection, either of which is \nsufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy \nin one nation against another, disposes each more readily to offer \ninsult and injury, to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be \nhaughty and intractable when accidental or trifling occasions of \ndispute occur. Hence, frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and \nbloody contests. The nation, prompted by ill will and resentment, \nsometimes impels to war the government, contrary to the best \ncalculations of policy. The government sometimes participates in the \nnational propensity, and adopts through passion what reason would \nreject; at other times, it makes the animosity of the nation's \nsubservient to projects of hostility, instigated by pride, ambition, \nand other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace often, sometimes \nperhaps the liberty of nations, has been the victim.\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest, in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the \nenmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the \nquarrels and wars of the latter, without adequate inducements or \njustifications. It leads also to concessions, to the favorite nation, \nor privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the \nnation making the concessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought \nto have been retained, and by exciting jealously, ill will, and a \ndisposition to retaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are \nwithheld; and it gives to ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens who \ndevote themselves to the favorite nation, facility to betray or \nsacrifice the interests of their own country, without odium, sometimes \neven with popularity; gilding with the appearances of virtuous sense of \nobligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable \nzeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, \ncorruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \nto influence or awe the public councils!--Such an attachment of a small \nor weak, towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be \nthe satellite of the latter.\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence, (I conjure you to \nbelieve me fellow citizens,) the jealousy of a free \n\n[[Page S1309]]\npeople ought to be constantly awake; since history and experience \nprove, that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of \nrepublican government. But that jealously, to be useful, must be \nimpartial, else it becomes the instrument of the very influence to be \navoided, instead of a defense against it. Excessive partiality for one \nforeign nation and excessive dislike for another, cause those whom they \nactuate to see danger only on one side, and serve to veil and even \nsecond the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots, who may \nresist the intrigues of the favorite, are liable to become suspected \nand odious; while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence \nof the people, to surrender their interests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is, \nin extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith:--Here let \nus stop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none, or a \nvery remote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in frequent \ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \nconcerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate \nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \npolitics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her \nfriendships or enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people, under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon, to be \nscrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under the \nimpossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard \nthe giving us provocation, when we may choose peace or war, as our \ninterest, guided by justice, shall counsel.\n  Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our \nown to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any \nportion of the foreign world; so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements. I hold the maxim no less applicable \nto public than private affairs, that honesty is always the best policy. \nI repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed in their \ngenuine sense. But in my opinion, it is unnecessary, and would be \nunwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves by suitable establishments, on a \nrespectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, and a liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended \nby policy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy \nshould hold an equal and impartial hand; neither seeking nor granting \nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \ncommerce, but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed, in \norder to give trade a stable course, to define the rights of our \nmerchants, and to enable the government to support them, conventional \nrules of intercourse, the best that present circumstances and mutual \nopinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be from time to time \nabandoned or varied as experience and circumstances shall dictate; \nconstantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to look for \ndisinterested favors from another; that is must pay with a portion of \nits independence for whatever it may accept under that character; that \nby such acceptance, it may place itself in the condition of having \ngiven equivalents for nominal favors, and yet of being reproached with \ningratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to \nexpect, or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an \nillusion which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to \ndiscard.\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish; that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions, or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations, but if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good; that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism; this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n  How far, in the discharge of my official duties, I have been guided \nby the principles which have been delineated, the public records and \nother evidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is, that I have, at least, \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April, 1793, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice, and by that of your representatives in both houses of \ncongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfuenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination, with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound, in duty \nand interest, to take a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverance and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct, it \nis not necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without any \nthing more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions, and to progress, without \ninterruption, to that degree of strength, and consistency which is \nnecessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own \nfortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration, I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \nWhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or \nmitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me \nthe hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence; \nand that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service, \nwith an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be \nconsigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it, which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations; I anticipate with pleasing expectation that in which I \npromise myself to realize, without alloy, the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking, in the midst of my fellow citizens, the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors \nand dangers.\n                                                  GEO.

Over the past 3 years, we have created a sound \neconomic foundation to face the challenges of the 21st century.\n\n\n                      Strong economic performance\n\n  Overall, the American economy is healthy and strong. In the first 3 \nyears of this Administration nearly 8 million jobs were created; 93 \npercent of them in the private sector. The so-called ``misery index''--\nthe sum of the inflation and unemployment rates--fell last year to its \nlowest level since 1968. Investment has soared, laying the basis for \nfuture higher economic growth. New business incorporations have set a \nrecord and exports of American-made goods have grown rapidly. Our is \nthe strongest and most competitive economy in the world--and its \nfundamentals are as sound as they have been in three decades.\n  This turnaround occurred because of the hard work and ingenuity of \nthe American people. Many of the new jobs are high-wage service sector \njobs--reflecting the changing structure of the economy. The \ntelecommunications, biotechnology, and software industries have led the \nhigh-tech revolution world-wide. Traditional industries, such as \nmanufacturing and construction, have restructured and now use \ntechnology and workplace innovation to thrive and once again create \njobs. For example, in 1994 and 1995, America was once again the world's \nlargest automobile maker.\n  Our 1993 economic plan set the stage for this economic expansion and \nresurgence, by enacting historic deficit reduction while continuing to \ninvest in technology and education. For over a decade, growing Federal \nbudget deficits kept interest rates high and dampened reinvestment and \nproductivity growth. Now, our deficit is proportionately the lowest of \nany major economy.\n  Today, our challenge is to ensure that all Americans can become \nwinners in economic change--that our people have the skills and the \nsecurity to make the most of their own lives. The very explosion of \ntechnology and trade that creates such extraordinary opportunity also \nplaces new pressures on working people. Over the past two decades, \nmiddle-class earnings have stagnated, and our poorest families saw \ntheir incomes fall. These are long-run trends, and 3 years of sound \neconomic policies cannot correct for a decade of neglect. Even so, we \nare beginning to make some progress: real median family income \nincreased by 2.3 percent in 1994, and the poverty rate fell in 1994 for \nthe first time in 5 years.\n\n\n                   addressing our economic challenges\n\n  I am firmly committed to addressing our economic challenges and \nenhancing economic security for all Americans. People who work hard \nneed to know that they can and will have a chance to win in our new and \nchanging economy. Our economic agenda seeks both to promote growth and \nto bring the fruits of that growth within reach of all Americans. Our \noverall strategy is straightforward:\n  --Balancing the budget. In the 12 years before I took office, the \n    budget deficit skyrocketed and the national debt quadrupled. My \n    Administration has already cut the budget deficit nearly in half. I \n    am determined to finish the job of putting our fiscal house in \n    order. I have proposed a plan that balances the budget in 7 years, \n    without violating our fundamental values--without undercutting \n    Medicare, Medicaid, education, or the environment and without \n    raising taxes on working families. The plans put forth by my \n    Administration and by the Republicans in the Congress contain \n    enough spending cuts in common to balance the budget and still \n    provide a modest tax cut. I am committed to giving the American \n    people a balanced budget.\n  --Preparing workers through education and training. In the new \n    economy, education is the key to opportunity--and the education \n    obtained as a child in school will no longer last a lifetime. My \n    Administration has put in place the elements of a lifetime-learning \n    system to enable Americans to attend schools with high standards; \n    get help going to college, or from school into the workplace; and \n    receive training and education throughout their careers. We \n    expanded Head Start for preschoolers; enacted Goals 2000, \n    establishing high standards for schools; created a new direct \n    student loan program that makes it easier for young people to \n    borrow and repay college loans; gave 50,000 young people the \n    opportunity to earn college tuition through community service; and \n    enacted the School-to-Work Opportunities Act. Now we must continue \n    to give our people the skills they need, by enacting my proposals \n    to make the first $10,000 of college tuition tax deductible; to \n    give the top 5 percent of students in each high school a $1,000 \n    merit scholarship; and to enact the GI Bill for Workers, which \n    would replace the existing worker training system with a flexible \n    voucher that workers could use at community colleges or other \n    training facilities.\n  --Increasing economic security. We must give Americans the security \n    then need to thrive in the new economy. We can do this through \n    health insurance reforms that will give Americans a chance to buy \n    insurance when they change jobs or when someone in their family is \n    sick. We can do this by encouraging firms to provide more extensive \n    pension coverage, as I have done through my proposals for pension \n    simplification. In addition, we should make work pay by increasing \n    the minimum wage and preserving the full Earned Income Tax Credit \n    (EITC), which cuts taxes for hard-pressed working families to make \n    sure that no parents who work full-time have to raise their \n    children in poverty.\n  --Creating high-wage jobs through technology and exports. We must \n    continue to encourage the growth of high-wage industries, which \n    will create the high-wage jobs of the future. We have reformed the \n    decades-old telecommunications laws, to help spur the digital \n    revolution that will continue to transform the way we live. We must \n    continue to encourage exports, since jobs supported by goods \n    exports pay on average 13 percent more than other jobs. My \n    Administration has concluded over 200 trade agreements, including \n    the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Uruguay Round of \n    the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, seeking an open world \n    marketplace and fair rules for exporters of American goods and \n    services. As a result, merchandise exports have increased by 31 \n    percent.\n  --A government that is smaller, works better, and costs less. A new \n    economy demands a new kind of government. The era of big, \n    centralized, one-size-fits-all government is over. But the answer \n    is not the wholesale dismantling of government. Rather, we must \n    strive to meet our problems using flexible, non-bureaucratic \n    means--and working with businesses, religious groups, civic \n    organizations, schools, and State and local governments. My \n    Administration has reduced the size of government: as \n\n[[Page S1311]]\n    a percentage of civilian nonfarm employment, the Federal workforce is \n    the smallest it has been since 1933, before the New Deal. We have \n    conducted a top-to-bottom overhaul of Federal regulations, and are \n    eliminating 16,000 pages of outdated or burdensome rules \n    altogether. We have reformed environmental, workplace safety, and \n    pharmaceutical regulations to cut red tape without hurting public \n    protection. And we will continue to find new, market-based ways to \n    protect the public.\n\n\n                  the need to continue with what works\n\n  As The Annual Report of the Council of Economic Advisers makes clear, \nthis is a moment of great possibility for our country. Ours is the \nhealthiest of any major economy. No nation on earth is better \npositioned to reap the rewards of the new era. Our strategy of deficit \nreduction and investment in our people has begun to work. It would be a \ngrave error to turn back.\n  Our Nation must reject the temptation to shrink from its \nresponsibilities or to turn to narrow, shortsighted solutions for long-\nterm problems. If we continue to invest for the long term, we will pass \non to the next generation a Nation in which opportunity is even more \nplentiful than it is today.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, this year marks the 50th anniversary \nof Portland State University [PSU], Oregon's urban university. In its \nshort life, the university has evolved into a national model for how \nhigher education can be integrated into urban communities through \nservice learning directed at taking on thorny urban problems. What this \nmeans is that instead of just focusing on ethereal academic concepts, \nPSU staff and students roll up their sleeves and connect concepts with \ncommunity, and knowledge of an academic subject with real world \napplications.\n  In 1946, Portland State University began as an extension school to \nserve returning World War II veterans. Today, the university serves \nmore than 37,000 individuals every year, offering a wide range of \nundergraduate and graduate degree programs. What's more, since its \nextension school days, PSU's mission has shifted to showing how town \nand gown can work together to build the communities of the future.\n  When innovative community programs in the Portland metropolitan area \nare brought to my attention, often I find that PSU is in the thick of \nthings. One program that I am involved with is PSU's partnership with \nthe Police Activities League [PAL] in sponsoring the National Youth \nSports Program on campus every year. The program provides at-risk \nyoungsters with a structured summer program which emphasizes sports, \npositive decisionmaking skills, and education. PSU does more than just \nprovide the facilities--in keeping with its mission, university faculty \nconsult with PAL in developing curriculum for the program and students \nare active participants in running the program. The collaboration \ndoesn't just stop at the end of the summer. Throughout the year, PSU \nand PAL work together to involve these youngsters in positive programs \nand encourage them to work toward a college degree.\n  PSU has also tapped into emerging technologies to both strengthen the \nuniversity and the community. One of the most innovative uses of \ntechnology is its PORTALS program, or the Portland Area Library System. \nPORTALS is a cooperative endeavor linking public and private \ninstitutions throughout the Portland area to an electronically \naccessible research library, with PSU as its hub. The States of Oregon \nand Washington both stand to benefit from the new resources available \nthrough this innovative project.\n  These programs are just the tip of the iceberg of the university's \ninvolvement, PSU runs teacher academies to help local teachers get in-\nservice education. PSU students, who are all required to be involved in \ncommunity projects, work at local community-based organizations such as \ncommunity health centers, schools, and after-school programs.\n\n[[Page S1312]]\n\n  It is thus no surprise that PSU has received a number of national \nawards for its innovative curriculum and for its work serving the \nmetropolitan community and the State. Last year, the school received \nover $3 million from foundations and Federal agencies to support its \ncutting-edge undergraduate curriculum. For the same reason it is also \nhas been recognized by the American Association of Higher Education, \nthe American Association of State Colleges and Universities, and the \nInterstate Commission on Higher Education as a national model for \ninnovative undergraduate education.\n  The 50th anniversary is a time to celebrate the achievements of the \npast and look forward to the innovations and adventures of the future. \nThe faculty, staff, and students at Portland State University, past and \npresent, deserve our congratulations on a remarkable history and our \nbest wishes for future success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/26/senate-section/article/S1311-4", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECESS UNTIL 10 A.M.
