So \nrefine our consciences; purify any dross until You can see Your own \nnature reflected in the refined gold of Your priorities of \nrighteousness, justice, mercy. Give us Your heart for the poor and \nthose who suffer. Keep us faithful to Your vision for this Nation so \nclearly revealed to our Founding Fathers and Mothers. Set us ablaze \nwith patriotism and loyalty. Then continue to speak to us through our \nconsciences. May we work out in specifics what You have worked into the \nfiber of our character. We commit ourselves anew to seek Your guidance \nand follow it this day. Give us courage to follow the convictions You \nhave developed in our consciences. In the name of Jesus who taught us \nthat we can know the truth and the truth will set us free.

The Senate will now proceed \nto 10 rollcall votes with respect to amendments offered on July 18, \n1996, with 2 minutes for explanation equally divided before each vote.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, this morning the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the reconciliation bill and begin a lengthy series of \nrollcall votes. There may be from 8 to 10 votes consecutively, in order \nthis morning. Therefore, all Members should be prepared to remain in or \naround the Senate Chamber to allow these votes to be completed in a \ntimely manner.\n  Following these votes, the Senate will continue to debate amendments \nto reconciliation. However, any votes ordered on those amendments will \nbe ordered to begin at 9:30 on Tuesday.\n  I remind my colleagues, if they still intend to offer their \namendments, those that were listed, they must offer them today or \nMonday.\n\n[[Page S8330]]\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all votes ordered after \nthe first vote be reduced to 10 minutes in length, and that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order to any of those amendments in the voting \nsequence that is scheduled for today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4903\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is on the Murray \namendment. Under the previous order, the question occurs on amendment \nNo. 4903, offered by the Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray].\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, since last night when I offered this \namendment, I have been contacted by a number of Members from both sides \nof the aisle who would like to work with me to perhaps come to an \nagreement on this issue. I ask, therefore, unanimous consent to \nwithdraw the amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 4903) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, before you call the next amendment, I \nunderstand the next scheduled amendment, under the order, would have \nbeen a Faircloth amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is now my understanding that is being worked out and \nthe Senator seeks, and I understand it is all right with the minority, \nthat that amendment be set aside until Tuesday. Then we would proceed \nto the Breaux amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So I propose that as a unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, Senator Breaux was not aware he would \nbe up first, so I suggest the absence of a quorum for a couple of \nminutes so he can be advised.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Breaux has arrived. I think under our \nsequencing and the order, we have Senator Breaux's motion to waive the \npoint of order that is up now, and there are 2 minutes on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Equally divided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Two minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. EXON. May I clarify one point. As I understand it, the Breaux \namendment will be the first amendment that will be voted upon; is that \nright? That will be a 15-minute vote? Have we ordered 10 minute votes \nthereafter? Is that the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. That is the order.\n  Mr. EXON. Thank you.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n           Motion To Waive The Budget Act--Amendment No. 4910\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, my colleagues, what we are trying to do \nwith welfare reform is very simple. I think we can all agree we should \nbe tough on work, we should be good for kids. Everybody knows we should \nput work first, but in doing that we should not put children last.\n  I am afraid the Republican bill, without my amendment, does exactly \nthat simply because of this. The Republican plan says that after you \ntake the parent off of AFDC assistance, you forget about the children. \nYou absolutely forbid the State in their own wisdom to determine \nwhether they should give any assistance to the children who are \ninnocent victims of welfare at the sins of the parents. We should not \nbe punishing the children for what their parents have not done \ncorrectly.\n  So let us be as tough as we can on work, make the parent go to work, \nbut when the parent is taken off welfare, for God's sake, can't we as a \nnation at least allow the States to use their block grant money to \nprovide the things that a child needs in order to survive in this \ncountry? That is the issue. Are we going to disregard the children? Or \nare we going to help the children while we are so tough on the parents? \nMy amendment, I think, should pass.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 1 minute.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I strongly oppose the Breaux amendment \nwhich would seriously undermine the real 5-year time limit on welfare \nassistance. One of the most important features of welfare reform is \nthat recipients must understand that public assistance is temporary, \nnot a way of life.\n  Opponents of the 5-year time limit would have the American people \nbelieve this bill would abandon children. This is simply not true. \nFamilies and children would still be eligible for food stamps, \nMedicaid, housing assistance, WIC, and dozens of other means-tested \nprograms.\n  Let me reiterate that S. 1956, the bill before us, is identical to \nH.R. 4 on this issue when it passed the Senate on a vote of 87 to 12 \nlast September. The Senate rejected amendments to weaken the 5-year \ntime limit then, and it should do so again.\n  If States want to use vouchers to provide services beyond the time \nlimit, they could do so with State funds or with title XX funds of \nsocial services block grants. The State can also exempt 20 percent of \nthe caseload from the limit for those truly hardship cases. I urge the \ndefeat of the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, this is a new mandate, extremely \ncostly, a huge new bureaucracy; and nothing in the bill prohibits the \nStates from using their own money to do this.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the bill provides for a lifetime limit \nof 5 years for welfare benefits. This means that there is an actual \ndrop-dead date so that families are held truly accountable for their \nchoices. Knowing that there is a concern for those who are unable to \nwork, the bill allows a 20-percent hardship exemption from the lifetime \nlimit.\n  Working Americans live in a system where if they don't show up for \nwork, they are not paid and are likely to lose their job. They want \nwelfare recipients to live with that same reality. Taxpaying Americans \ndon't understand why their hard work is subsidizing those who are not \nworking.\n  According to the mail I receive in my office, working Iowans believe \nthat welfare recipients ought to have to work also. And they believe \nwelfare recipients should not be able to receive benefits forever.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the Personal Responsibility, Work \nOpportunity, and Medicaid Restructuring Act of 1996 will dramatically \nimprove our welfare system. By requiring able-bodied welfare recipients \nto work, it will encourage welfare families to move from dependency to \nself-sufficiency. In addition, adult recipients who refuse to engage in \nrequired work will have their benefits reduced, and individuals will be \nable to receive federally funded benefits for more than 5 years, or \nfewer at the option of the State. In recognition of the fact that not \nall families will be able to enter the work force effectively, the \nStates are given a 20-percent hardship exemption to the 5-year limit on \nbenefits.\n  Today, my colleague, Senator Breaux, introduced an amendment which \nwould have provided vouchers of those families which were denied cash \nassistance as a result of these limitations. Because this provision \nwould undermine the important goal of encouraging families to work and \nmove off welfare, and because the most troubled families will be \nprotected by the hardship exemption, I have decided to vote against the \namendment. This vote does, however, raise a number of issues which \nshould be addressed by the conference committee, including the impact \nwhich ending cash benefits may have on foster care costs in the States, \nand the impact of the benefits limitation on children.\n\n[[Page S8331]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the motion \nto waive the Budget Act in relation to the Breaux amendment No. 4910. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered.

The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4911\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non the motion to table amendment No. 4911 offered by the Senator from \nNorth Carolina, [Mr. Faircloth].\n  The Chair recognizes Senator Faircloth for 1 minute.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Madam President, the welfare bill before us requires \nthat minors must live at home with a parent as a condition of receiving \nassistance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold, the Senator \ncannot be heard. The Senate will come to order.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Madam President, this amendment states that if that \nparent is currently receiving welfare benefits and has been for the \nlast 3 years, then the minor may not receive cash benefits. If the \nparent is currently receiving welfare, and the minor child is herself \nalone living at home, then we are requiring that three generations of \nwelfare recipients live under one roof.\n  My amendment would ensure that when we require three generations of \nwelfare recipients to live under one roof, and there is a clear history \nof welfare dependency in that household, then we will only send one \ncash check.\n  My amendment is not intended to reduce benefits, and it does not \nprohibit the State from providing assistance in any noncash form--food, \nwhatever. The amendment simply would limit the amount of cash that is \ngiven to households with three generations of welfare where there is a \nclear history of welfare dependency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  The underlying bill denies assistance to teenage moms who do not live \nat home. Democrats agree with this. We have this in our bill. But what \nthe Faircloth amendment says is, you will be denied assistance as a \nteenage mom if you live at home if the home you are living in has \nreceived welfare.\n  I have to say this: This Faircloth amendment sets up two categories \nof teenage moms, one category that gets aid when they live at home and \none category that does not.\n  I thought we were for family unity. I think that is the question \nMembers must ask themselves: Are we for family unity? If we are, we \nshould vote down the Faircloth amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from North Carolina. On this question, the yeas and nays \nhave been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

May we have order, please, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Can we have order in the Chamber, please.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senators have asked how much longer will \nwe be voting. It looks to me, if we can stay close to the 10 minutes, \nwe will be out of here before noon.\n  Can I ask, how long did we take on the last vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 12 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have six amendments remaining, so if we can stay \nnear the 10 minutes, you can do your own arithmetic. It looks to me \nlike an hour and 30 minutes is what it would take. We never get it done \nthat efficiently, but that is sort of what you ought to be looking at.\n  Regular order.\n\n\n           Motion To Waive The Budget Act--Amendment No. 4912\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question now \noccurs on agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act for the \nconsideration of amendment No. 4912 offered by the Senator from \nDelaware, [Mr. Biden]. There are 2 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I point out that yesterday 46 \nDemocrats voted for an amendment by our distinguished Democratic leader \nwhich had a conditional entitlement. It maintained for a period of 5 \nyears a right of a child to some public support if needed. This measure \nwould abolish that entitlement in title IV of the Social Security Act, \nan entitlement which is provided for the aged, the unemployed, for the \ndisabled. We would only strip the Social Security Act of the provision \nfor children. I hope Democrats, who put that legislation in place 60 \nyears ago, will not vote to repeal it today. It is not reform. It is \nrepeal.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S8332]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What bill are you referring to, I ask the Senator from \nNew York, this bill that is pending or the underlying bill?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I spoke of Mr. Daschle's amendment yesterday, and I \nspoke to Mr. Biden and Mr. Specter's amendment today.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I see. All right.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I believe I have 1 minute in support of this legislation. \nI said yesterday the Biden-Specter bill is a question of, is it better \nthan the underlying bill? The underlying bill does the same thing the \nSenator just suggested that this bill does. The differences are, we \nsave $53 billion. There is $3 billion in work funds for the States, \nindividual responsibility contracts, no food stamp block grants, as the \nunderlying bill has, and the State option for vouchers, among other \nthings.\n\n  I think this is a much preferable bill than the underlying bill, and \nI would encourage my colleagues to vote for the Biden-Specter \namendment, which is better known, quite frankly, as the Castle-Tanner \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has elapsed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Wait a minute, Mr. President. I do not believe that our \ntime has elapsed. Nobody authorized the Senator from New York to speak \nin opposition. He spoke.

I yield to the distinguished Senator from Delaware [Mr. \nRoth].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the Specter-Biden \nsubstitute. While it does include some of the provisions of S. 1956 \nsuch as ending the individual entitlement, it stops far short of the \ngoals of welfare reform. The Specter-Biden substitute is $10 billion \nshort on savings and short on time limits. It has an open-ended \ncontingency fund. It does include, however, a liberalization on \nMedicaid benefits in which Medicaid could be extended to illegal \naliens.\n  I would like to clarify that our legislation does include \ntransitional Medicaid benefits for 1 year for those families leaving \nwelfare. It also includes emergency Medicaid coverage for illegal \naliens which is current law.\n  Mr. President, I urge defeat of the Specter-Biden amendment. I yield \nback the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for debate has elapsed.

Regular order, Mr. President.\n\n\n    Motion to Waive the Budget Act--Amendment No. 4914, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question now \noccurs on amendment No. 4914 offered by the Senator from Tennessee [Mr. \nFrist]. There are 2 minutes for debate equally divided.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this amendment, submitted on behalf of my \ncolleagues Senators Abraham, Bond, Santorum, Hutchison, and Thompson, \nsimply asks for a sense of the Senate that the President ensure \napproval of the waiver requests of States such as Tennessee and 14 \nother States which have waiver requests before the Department of Health \nand Human Services.\n  On October 31, 1995, the President assured the Governors on that day \nthat he would take care of these requests within 30 days. Mr. \nPresident, it has been 79 days for Tennessee. Others with waiver \nrequests have been waiting as long as 2 years. Tennessee needs action. \nMichigan needs action.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. May we please have order in the Chamber so we \ncan conclude these votes? Can we have order in the Chamber?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with reluctance that I rise in \nopposition to this amendment, because of my respect and affection for \nthe Senator from Tennessee. But, this amendment would allow for waivers \nacross the board in 16 States without any idea of what is in these \nwaivers.\n  I point out to my colleagues, that the administration has approved a \nrecord 67 waivers in 40 States. We've reduced welfare by 1.3 million \npeople. The food stamp rolls are down. We are heading in the right \ndirection.\n  Today, however, we are debating a national welfare reform program. \nThat should be our focus. The sense-of-the-Senate resolution that would \napprove waivers to 16 States without any idea what is in those waivers, \nI think is wrong, with all due respect. We don't have any idea what \nsort of impact these waivers will have on children, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by my \ncolleague from Tennessee. I am uneasy about this amendment because it \nwould express the sense of the Congress that 16 welfare waivers should \nbe approved, without us knowing what those waivers propose to do.\n  The President already has approved a record 67 welfare reform waivers \nin 40 States. That's quite a record. Welfare caseloads are down by 1.3 \nmillion people, food stamp rolls are lower, and child support \ncollections are up. So a lot of progress has been made in recent years, \nStates are experimenting, and we're debating a national welfare reform \nbill. I think we'd all like to see the passage of a bipartisan welfare \nreform bill that puts people to work and protects children.\n  But this amendment asks us to give our approval to 16 different \nwelfare plans without the benefit of knowing exactly what they propose \nto do. In my view, it should make us uneasy to approve 16 plans without \nknowing what the impact would be on the children in those States.\n\n[[Page S8333]]\n\n  Mr. President, my understanding is that in one of the State waivers, \nthe State asks to set a 5-year lifetime limit on welfare benefits that \nwould begin in 1987. That's a retroactive time limit. If this is true, \na mother who had been off assistance for the last 4 years, but lost her \njob by no fault of her own, would be told she could have no assistance \nat all. What would happen to her children? We don't know, because the \ndetails of the plan do not accompany the amendment before us today.\n  I understand that another waiver would terminate food stamp benefits \nif a mother does not comply with the work program. Now I know my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have argued that kids won't \nbe hurt by welfare reform after the time limit, because food stamps are \nstill there. Not under this sort of waiver as far as I can tell.\n  So Mr. President, I urge caution on this amendment. I also raise a \npoint of order against the bill under the Byrd rule, section \n313(b)(1)(A) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Budget Act, \nI move to waive the point of order against amendment No. 4914 to the \nbill. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Congressional Budget Act with respect to amendment No. 4914, \nas modified. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

The point of order is sustained, \nand the amendment falls.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Harkin \namendment, which was next in line, be set aside and be reconsidered on \nTuesday. He is in the process of negotiating. We did that for a \nRepublican Senator.\n  The next order of business is Senator Ashcroft, if this request is \ngranted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n           Motion to Waive the Budget Act--Amendment No. 4917\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question now \noccurs on amendment No. 4917, offered by the Senators from Pennsylvania \nand Missouri. There are 2 minutes for debate equally divided.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise with an amendment that would \nallow States to require welfare recipients to bring up to date the \nimmunizations of their minor children. Immunizations in America are \nfree to individuals who are on welfare. Yet we have a number of \nchildren who are, every year, afflicted with serious disabling diseases \nwhich will persist into disabilities of their adulthood for lack of \nimmunizations.\n  This amendment would simply provide States the authority, as it \nrelates to programs which States share the cost of, and would require \nimmunizations where the Federal Government funds the entirety of the \nwelfare benefit. If you did not provide your children with the \nimmunizations that were appropriate, you would have a 20-percent \ndecrease until the children were properly immunized. This is in the \ninterest of children.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I do not disagree with the thrust of what my \ncolleague is saying, that parents should be responsible for immunizing \ntheir children. But I am afraid that we are aiming at the parents, but \nhurting the child. If the child is not fully immunized, to cut off that \nchild from necessary food, medicine, or other resources is, I think, \nmisguided.\n  We need to encourage and promote immunizations, but we do not want to \nsimultaneously deny a child--through the fault of the parent who does \nnot get the child fully immunized--the benefit of the necessary \nnutritional and medical services they would otherwise get. That is the \neffect of this amendment.\n  I respect my colleague's thrust, but do not penalize the child. The \nchild would be the one to suffer. In cases where a child is behind in \nimmunizations, that child could lose access to food and SSI for as long \nas a year while they catch up on their immunization schedule. \nImmunizations cannot be given all at once, I am told.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Is the Senator aware there is a 6-month grace period?\n  Mr. DODD. I respect that. My colleague knows, as well, that innocent \nchildren should not be penalized because their parents may be \nirresponsible. That is the net effect of this amendment.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Is the Senator aware this is just a 20-percent decrease \nin the benefit for the 6-month interval?\n  Mr. DODD. If it is a 5-percent decrease, why should an innocent child \npay for the irresponsibility of a parent? That does not make sense. We \nought to encourage immunizations, promote and do what we can. The 6-\nyear-old or 2-year-old child whose parent is irresponsible should not \nbe denied nutrition and adequate medical benefits.\n  I suggest, as well, the pending amendment is not germane. I rise to \nmake a point of order that it violates section 305(b) of the \nCongressional Budget Act.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I move the point of order be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator request a rollcall?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I do request a rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to make a plea to my \ncolleagues. Please err on the side of caution when we are dealing with \nthe lives of poor children in America.\n  This amendment says that Health and Human Services studies this \nlegislation and if, God forbid, there are provisions in this \nlegislation that create more impoverished children, their report comes \nback to us at the end of 2 years and we take action--quick action--to \nmodify these provisions so that we can correct the problem.\n  Democrats and Republicans: This is the right thing to do. We ought to \nevaluate the action that we are taking in this legislation. And God \nknows we ought to take the corrective action, if that is necessary, to \nmake sure that we are not creating more poverty among children. This is \nthe right thing to do. It is a fail-safe mechanism. It is a safety net \nbuilt into the legislation.\n\n  I hope--I hope--every Democrat and Republican will support this. We \nmust do this if we are to understand what this legislation means and be \nable to take corrective action, if necessary, to help poor children in \nAmerica.\n  Please support this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield time to Senator Roth.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I oppose the Wellstone amendment. It is \nwholly unnecessary and unprecedented.\n  In regard to studying welfare reform, this amendment is wholly \nunnecessary. The legislation is filled with studies, evaluations and \nrankings of successful and unsuccessful States.\n  We absolutely want to know what works in welfare reform. But what is \nunacceptable and unprecedented is the rules given to the Secretary of \nHHS in sending recommendations to the Congress which must then be \nconsidered under expedited procedures in Congress.\n  Let me point out that there were about 11.7 million AFDC recipients \nin 1990. In 1993 the caseload exceeded 14 million for the first time. \nThe caseload was over 14 million again in 1994. Last year HHS told the \nCongress that, if we do nothing, there will still be more children in \npoverty. That is under the current welfare system.\n  Again, we welcome the study. The legislation includes a study. But no \nCongress should yield its authority to a Cabinet Secretary for this or \nany other reason.\n  I urge defeat of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

However, we are going to remain in session \nto take up amendments. If Senators want to offer amendments, they have \nto offer them either today or Monday. We are going to be here a few \nhours to take amendments. We are putting a list together, to try to \nmake some sense of this afternoon. If we start on our side and go to \nyour side, we would ask the D'Amato amendment on work be in order. Then \nyou have one immediately following that?\n  Mr. EXON. I am certainly pleased to respond to my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. At the present time we have three Democratic amendments in \nthis order: Following D'Amato would be Feinstein, then Conrad, and then \nGraham. There may be some others. I would simply say to my colleagues \non this side, at the present time we have seven Republican amendments \nand three Democratic amendments. This afternoon would be an excellent \ntime to offer your amendment. If you would come to us, any Democrat, we \ncould schedule you right after the Graham amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have some others to put in order, but I will do it \nafter the vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4921\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non the motion to table amendment No. 4921 offered by the Senator from \nFlorida [Mr. Graham]. The yeas and nays have been ordered. Under the \nprevious order, there will be 2 minutes of discussion equally divided.\n  The Senate will come to order.\n  The Chair was in error. The vote is not on the motion to table. This \nis an\n\n[[Page S8335]]\n\nup-or-down vote on amendment No. 4921, offered by the Senator from \nFlorida, who will be recognized as soon as the Senate comes to order.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the issue presented by this motion to \nstrike is a simple one. We have already spent weeks debating the issue \nof the benefits for legal aliens--legal aliens. On May 2, we passed a \ncomprehensive immigration bill which outlined the restraints that we \nfelt were appropriate. We are now coming, today, to essentially trash \nall of that work that we have done by developing an entirely new set of \nprinciples as it relates to the eligibility of legal aliens, a new set \nof principles that have gone unstudied and unexamined, but represent \nsome very significant policy shifts. It moves away from the principle \nof restraining benefits by looking to the sponsor to pay for the \nbenefits of the legal alien, and it represents outright bars to legal \naliens, from political refugees and asylees, as well as those who came \nin with a sponsor. It substantially increases the shift of \nresponsibility to local governments.\n  Mr. President, we have already dealt with this issue. We should let \nthe immigration conference come to closure and not impose a new set of \nunexamined, duplicative, and I consider inappropriate policies. It \nshould now be rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the time we have to Senator Simpson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, this will cost $16 billion. Our Nation's \nimmigration law is very clear on one point. No one may immigrate to the \nUnited States of America if he or she is likely at any time to become a \npublic charge. And the American public expects the newcomers will work \nand receive any needed support from the relatives who brought them \nhere. Period. That is the law.\n  There is considerable evidence that this promise of self-sufficiency \nis not being honored. That is why in the other bill we enforce the \naffidavit of sponsorship. The welfare reform bill contains provisions \nwhich ensure that immigrants are self-sufficient. The bill shifts the \nwelfare costs from the American taxpayers onto those who sponsor their \nimmigrant relatives to the country. The immigration bill is in \nconference. It is not in peril. We have resolved 150 items of the \nSenate issues, 120 House issues. We have three significant issues yet \nto be resolved. But these provisions on immigrant welfare are \nimportant. We cannot afford to have these reforms delayed, and the \nGraham amendment would do just that. The simple premise: Sponsor brings \nthe immigrant, sponsor promises to pay, sponsor pays before the \ntaxpayer pays.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, since 1882 Federal law has provided that \nprobability of becoming a public charge is ground for immigrants' \nexclusion from the United States. Additionally, becoming a public \ncharge which a noncitizen is currently a deportable offense.\n  According to the Census Bureau, there were 23 million foreign-born \npersons in the United States in 1994, representing 9 percent of the \npopulation. That is the highest level in the last 50 years.\n  Aliens over 65 are 5 times more likely to be on SSI than citizens \nover 65, making the program a retirement plan for elderly noncitizens. \nSSI applications by noncitizens grew 370 percent from 1982 to 1992 \nversus 39 percent for citizens.\n  Without reform, over 2 million noncitizens will continue collecting \nguaranteed cash welfare, health care, and food benefits, costing \ntaxpayers more than $20 billion over 6 years.\n  In this legislation, sponsors, not taxpayers, are held responsible \nfor supporting noncitizens because sponsor agreements are made legally \nbinding documents. Deeming is expanded to apply to most Federal \nprograms. Both deeming and sponsorship continue until the alien becomes \na citizen, unless the noncitizen has worked for at least 10 years.\n  Most nonncitizens who arrive after the date of enactment would not be \neligible for most Federal welfare benefits during their first 5 years \nin the United States.\n  Refugees and veterans and their families and emergency medical \nservices are excepted.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, most immigrants are hard working, and \ncommitted to self-sufficiency. Unfortunately, others have become \ndependent on a variety of Government benefits. The Personal \nResponsibility, Work Opportunity, and Medicaid Restructuring Act of \n1996 addresses this issue by limiting the eligibility of qualified \naliens for certain Federal benefits, including SSI and food stamps. In \naddition, the legislation grants State authority to limit the \neligibility of qualified aliens to certain State public benefits.\n  My colleagues, Senator Graham, has offered an amendment which would \nremove these provisions from the bill. While I cannot support this \namendment because it undermines the principle that individuals who \nimmigrate to this Nation should be self-sufficient, I believe that the \namendment is important because it draws attention to the plight of \nthose hard-working immigrants who may need assistance as a result of \nevents which are beyond their control. Therefore, I strongly recommend \nthat the conference committee consider the needs of those immigrants \nwho are committed to self-sufficiency but who are in need through no \nfault of their own.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this will cost the taxpayers $16 \nbillion.\n  I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 4921.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Pursuant to the order, we have not decided how long we will be here, \nbut I think it will work out because of Senators agreeing to take their \namendments up today. We will not be here late. Here is what I know to \nthis point. I say to the Senator, we are going to try to go back and \nforth. Senator D'Amato's amendment has been agreed to as being the next \nin order. I ask Senator D'Amato if he will agree to a time limit?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Fifteen minutes, twenty minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How about 15 minutes on a side for Senator D'Amato?\n  Mr. EXON. I have no instructions on this side.\n  We will agree to the 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thirty minutes equally divided on Senator D'Amato's \namendment. Senator Feinstein has an immigration amendment. Let me make \na unanimous consent request on her behalf. Senator Feinstein had an \namendment called ``work requirement'' on our previous consolidated \nfinite list of amendments. She has asked if she could substitute, for \nthat work requirement, an immigration amendment that has to do with \nprospective application of the alien law in this bill.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that it be in order that she substitute \nthat measure for the one that she had previously listed as reserved. \nThat means she will not take up the previously reserved one. It will be \ngone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator agree to a half-hour equally divided?\n  Mr. EXON. I talked to Senator Feinstein about this. She wants to \nreserve the full 1 hour. Hopefully, we can cut that down, but she has \nothers who want to speak. So at least we have agreed to have a half-\nhour equally divided on D'Amato. We would have to insist on 2 hours \nequally divided. Maybe that can be cut down on the Feinstein-Boxer \namendment.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Well, then, just a moment. Does the Senator have an \nearly departure time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The cosponsor of the amendment, Senator Boxer, does.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, we have a number of Senators who \nwould like to go in a short period of time and not take very long. I am \nwondering if we might try to get a couple of those in at 30 minutes, \nand then come back to the Senator for the full time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield? I say to my senior Senator, I \nthink we should agree to an hour equally divided. I only need 10 \nminutes, giving the Senator 20 minutes. I think that Senator Domenici \nhas been very gracious to us. I am willing to cut mine back even \nfurther to 5 or 6 minutes, if you needed more time than that.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I might address the Chairman, I \nwill do my level best and will agree to the half hour, with the proviso \nthat if there is something I need to respond to, I have an opportunity \nto do so.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will see if we can do it that way.\n  Mr. President, an hour equally divided on the Feinstein amendment.\n  Senator Chafee, you are next. How much would you desire?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Half hour equally divided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Any objection to a half hour equally divided?\n  Mr. EXON. No objection here.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Following that is a food stamp block grant amendment by \nSenator Conrad.\n  Mr. EXON. We have no instructions on that at the present time. I told \nhim he would be later. I cannot agree to that at this time. We will \ncheck with Senator Conrad in a few moments and let you know.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will move ahead. I have one on behalf of Senator \nGramm. It will take exactly 1 minute on my side. Could you agree to a \nlimited time on that amendment?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I heard some reference to the Conrad \namendment, which I want to speak about for 2 minutes at some point. I \nwill do it at any time.\n  Mr. EXON. I think we can agree to a shortened time on Gramm, but I \nwill check on that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think we will waste more time this way than if we \njust proceed. Let me stop with the Chafee amendment as a request on \ntime limits, and just indicate the order, thereafter, without time \nagreements.\n  Mr. EXON. Right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Following Chafee, we agreed that Senator Conrad's \namendment would be the next order of business on food stamps. Following \nthat would be a Gramm amendment--I am supposed to offer that--on drugs. \nIf I am not here, Senator Santorum will do that. Following that will be \nGraham-Bumpers on funding formula. That would be the sixth amendment, \nif they are looking at when they would come up today. Following that is \na Democratic amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. We do not have anything after Graham-Bumpers at this \njuncture. It does not mean we may not have more, but we cannot make \nagreement on something we do not have on the list.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. After the Graham-Bumpers funding formula, we would put \nin the order, Helms on food stamps, to be followed by a Democratic \namendment, if they come up with one, to be followed by a Shelby \namendment, to be followed by a Democratic amendment, if they come up \nwith one, to be followed by an Ashcroft amendment. That is all we have \non our side.\n  I ask that be the order for this afternoon.\n  Mr. EXON. Have you placed Shelby above Pressler in your list?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are working to clear Pressler.\n  Mr. EXON. OK. Is it proper to say Pressler, then Shelby?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Correct. Then you have one and we have Ashcroft.\n  If there are no Democratic amendments, the Republican amendments will \nbe taken in that order.\n  Mr. EXON. I will get back with you on Senators Graham and Conrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair considers that a proposed order, and \nthere is no unanimous consent request propounded yet.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nannounced as agreed upon be the order of business for the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4927\n\n   (Purpose: To require welfare recipients to participate in gainful \n                           community service)\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato], for himself, Mr. \n     Levin, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Gramm, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Pressler, \n     Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Craig, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Burns, Mr. Smith, \n     Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Brown, Mr. \n     Thompson, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Bond, Mr. Grams, Mr. Shelby, Mr. \n     Jeffords, Mr. Mack, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Lott, and \n     Mr. Nickles, proposes an amendment numbered 4927.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n       Section 402(a)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act, as added \n     by section 2103(a)(1), is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(iii) Not later than one year after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, unless the State opts out of this provision by \n     notifying\n\n[[Page S8337]]\n\n     the Secretary, a State shall, consistent with the exception \n     provided in section 407(e)(2), require a parent or caretaker \n     receiving assistance under the program who, after receiving \n     such assistance for two months is not exempt from work \n     requirements and is not engaged in work, as determined under \n     section 407(c), to participate in community service \n     employment, with minimum hours per week and tasks to be \n     determined by the State.''\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and 24 other colleagues, 24 Senators, who join with me in saying \nwe should really end welfare as we know it. That is something that \nPresident Clinton has spoken about and has been a concern of the \nAmerican people, a bona fide concern. It is a concern of even welfare \nrecipients themselves, who tell us time and time again in a unifying \nvoice, ``Reform this system, change this system; the system entraps us; \nit does not give us hope; it does not give us opportunities.''\n  What this amendment does, it goes right to the core of one of the \ngreat problems. That is, seeing to it that able-bodied recipients who \nhave, in some cases, become trapped in the welfare syndrome be given an \nopportunity for work experience, to become self-sustaining, so they can \nfeel part of this great country, that they can experience pride in \nwork, so that even those, Mr. President, who do not have a job, under \nthis amendment will have the opportunity to participate and to feel \nthey are earning their way in their community.\n  What this amendment does, it says a State can require able-bodied \nrecipients to take community service in lieu of a job, where there is \nno job, where they are not involved in a job-training program. Why \nshould we have to wait 2 years, have a recipient on welfare for 2 \nyears, before we say to them, ``You should report to a community \nservice project, work at a hospital, work in the park, work helping to \nclean the highways''? We are talking about able-bodied recipients.\n  Let me make clear this in no way will impinge upon that single parent \nwho is the custodian of a child. Understand that. Indeed, there is a \nspecific exemption which indicates that if there is a custodial parent \ncaring for a child under the age of 11, that adult can demonstrate an \ninability to obtain needed child care, then they are relieved of this \nburden.\n  Let me also point out that many, many middle-class Americans, working \nmiddle-class families, have single-parent moms who are working. They \nbegin to see, by the way, ``Am I a second-class citizen? I go to work. \nI support one, two, three children.'' We have millions of Americans \ntoday, moms and dads, who leave the house every day, they have \nchildren. They go to work.\n  What we are saying here is really very, very modest. We are saying, \n``Look, you are on welfare. You are receiving benefits. At the end of 2 \nmonths, you take community service. You can participate.'' If there is \nno job available in the private sector, let that person help his or her \ncommunity. Everybody gains self-respect, dignity. I am tired of hearing \nwe want to change the welfare system as we know it and then not do much \nabout it.\n  Yesterday I spoke about a great American who had more empathy for \npoor people, immigrants, for people who needed help and opportunity and \ntraining, and who did more in establishing hope and opportunities. I \nspeak to my parents, and my dad tells me during the Depression days, \nwhat the WPA, the Works Progress Administration, what it meant and how \nit gave people an opportunity for dignity. Young people had a job and \ncould report to work and help build the highways and schools, et \ncetera. It was a form of community service. It really was. It gave \npeople that self-fulfillment.\n  When Franklin Delano Roosevelt, one of the great architects of trying \nto give people the ability to lift themselves out of poverty, certainly \na figure that working poor people looked to for hope during the most \nterrible times, when he gave us an admonition and warned of the evils \nof entrapping people in a welfare system, his words should take on \nmeaning. Forget about someone running for office today, a Democrat or \nRepublican, someone in the Congress or someone who wants to get here. \nLook at someone who said, ``If people stay on welfare for a prolonged \nperiod of time, it administers a narcotic to their spirit.'' That is \nPresident Roosevelt. ``If people stay on welfare for a prolonged period \nof time,'' he said, ``it administers a narcotic to their spirit.''\n  He went on to say that ``this dependence on welfare''--listen to \nthis--``this dependence on welfare undermines their humanity, makes \nthem wards of the State, and takes away their chance at America.'' How \nprophetic. How prophetic, because here we are 50 years later, and what \nhave we seen? We have seen the decline of the human spirit--the decline \nof it. Now we have a system where people figure out how they can beat \nthe system, bring people here, put them on the welfare rolls, and how \nthey feel good about beating the system. By the way, if a State does \nnot want to do this, it can opt out. By gosh, it is about time we said, \nhey, after 2 months on welfare, if you are able-bodied and if you do \nnot have a job, you are not in job training, you report for community \nservice. If you do not want to do that, you are off the rolls. If you \ndo not want to help yourself and be part of this process of earning \none's way and contributing either to your benefit or to the benefit of \na community that is helping you because you do not have a job, why, \nthen, that community has no longer a responsibility and obligation. \nIndeed, we are doing something that President Roosevelt warned us \nabout. We are entrapping those people; we are destroying their dignity, \ndestroying the human spirit, destroying their opportunity of \nunderstanding the greatness of a free capital system where people work \nand are rewarded on the basis of their ability.\n\n  This amendment was adopted unanimously last year. It was offered by \nSenator Dole. I proudly offer it on behalf of Senator Dole again, in \nthe spirit of overcoming adversity and giving people hope and \nopportunity and ending that dependency that acts as a narcotic and \nseduces the best in people. That is what it has done for far too long.\n  So I hope that we can pass this unanimously. Again, I say Senator \nDole offered this last year. I am proud to offer it on behalf of my 24 \ncolleagues. I daresay that this should pass unanimously this time. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as \nan original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, yesterday, I was on the floor when the \nSenator gave his speech with reference to the whole problem of welfare. \nI commend him for it. Today, I commend him for his remarks and for the \namendment he has offered. I believe there is a great deal of concern \nout there about whether there will be enough private sector jobs. I \nthink what we are saying is, you know, it is not just the private \nsector job we are looking for, we are looking for a change in the \nbehavioral pattern of people on welfare.\n  This is a very good test. If, after a couple of months on welfare, \nthe State finds or the locality finds community service-type jobs, the \npoint of it is that you have to get up, go to work, sign in, do what \nyou are supposed to do, which is part of getting you ready, it seems to \nme, if you have had less of an opportunistic life and have not had a \nchance. I see it as part of the new weave that may very well yield a \ndifferent kind of tapestry in terms of a life for people who are on \nwelfare. I hope it passes and is retained in conference.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I yield back any remaining time on my \namendment.\n  Mr. EXON. We yield back our time.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman of \nthe committee for the opportunity to offer this amendment. This \namendment is on behalf of Senators Boxer, Graham, and myself.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4929\n\n (Purpose: This amendment provides that the ban on SSI apply to those \nentering the country on or after the enactment of this bill and exists \n                           until citizenship)\n\n  Mr. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Graham, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4929.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, Senator Graham offered an amendment \nwhich deals with the receiving of benefits by people who are newcomers \nto this country but here in a legal status as legal aliens. This \namendment relates to that amendment. It provides that the ban on public \nbenefits for newcomers to this country become effective September 1 of \nthis year and last until they become citizens of this country, which \ncan take place in 5 years. In essence, what we would do is take the \nprovision of the bill which effectively prevents and throws off of any \nbenefit program people in this country legally and we would make that \nprospective.\n  I do this as a Californian. This bill and this amendment has an \nenormous impact on California, and I want to say why.\n  Presently, in California, are 52.4 percent of all of the legal \nimmigrants in the country on SSI. Fifty-two percent of all the legal \nimmigrants in the country on SSI, aged, blind and disabled, are in the \nState of California.\n  This bill is where a good deal of the savings are gathered, whether \nthe savings are $16 or $18 billion, clearly, 52 percent of those \nsavings comes from California. I am here with my colleague, Senator \nBoxer, to tell you that 1 million people--bigger than the population of \nmany States--on the date this bill becomes effective will be thrown OFF \nof AFDC, will be thrown off of SSI immediately. This includes in my \ncity, San Francisco, very elderly and very senior Russian immigrants.\n  I remember watching a woman walk down Grant Avenue, she happened to \nbe Chinese. She was so hunched over, she could barely walk. She is on \nSSI. She is a legal immigrant to this country. She would be summarily \nthrown off of SSI.\n  I happen to agree with something Albert Schweitzer once said: How you \ntreat the least among us is a test of our civilization. Yet, I \nunderstand the need to make the changes. The costs have become so great \nand people are hesitant to pay these costs through their taxes. \nTherefore, what do you do?\n  Do you throw people off into the streets without no source of \nsupport, or do you send a message to the world and say: henceforth, \nwhen you come to this country as a newcomer, know that for the time you \nare not a citizen, you will not be able receive any of these benefits; \nknow that before you come; know that your children will not be eligible \nfor AFDC; the grandmothers will not be eligible for SSI or health \nbenefits--know that before you come, the term on which you are coming \nto this country.\n\n  I think that is a fair judgment to make, to send that message. But, I \nthink it is an unfair judgment, and possibly a very difficult judgment. \nIt is easy to come up to this Chamber and come up to the desk and cast \nthat aye vote. It is not going to be so easy when you see that crippled \nwoman, whether she be Hispanic, or whether she be Chinese, Russian, \nAfrican, or any other newcomer, white too, unable to survive, unable to \nparticipate in a program like Self-help for the Elderly or Unlock in My \nCity, which deals with Chinese elderly newcomers to a great extent. I \nthink that is a real dilemma in this bill.\n  Let me talk about what it does in California. It is estimated by the \nState and by the Department of Health and Human Services that the loss \nfor California is anywhere from $7 billion over the period of this bill \nto $9 billion. The 20 highest-loss metropolitan areas are: No. 1, Los \nAngeles and Long Beach; then San Jose, Stockton, Anaheim, Santa Ana, \nFresno, Modesto, San Francisco, San Diego, Sacramento, Oxnard, Ventura, \nSanta Barbara, and Lompoc. Those are the areas that are impacted with \nthe largest numbers.\n\n\n                           LOS ANGELES COUNTY\n\n  This measure is an unfunded mandate, essentially, on Los Angeles \nCounty. Its numbers and costs are a huge transfer of funds. Los Angeles \nCounty does not have the right to say ``OK, we have canceled SSI and \nyour AFDC, so go home.'' People will still be there. If they can't walk \ndown the street, if they are senile, if they are blind, if they are \ntotally disabled, they will have no recourse but to fund them.\n  Let's take a look at how many people are involved in Los Angeles \nCounty, and what this transfer of cost is in the largest county in the \nUnited States.\n  This will immediately, in this county alone throw off of SSI 93,000 \npeople who are aged, who are blind and who are disabled. The transfer \nto the county is $236 million this year and every year. It will throw \noff of AFDC 190,313 families. On the Medicaid provisions alone, the \ncost to the county is $100 million. So, the cost to Los Angeles County \nper year in just basic, preliminary estimates in terms of what would \nend up being a transfer is $336 million a year. I am told from some \nthis could create a situation of bankruptcy for the county.\n  Is this really what we want to do? Some say welfare reform is a \nbattle for the soul. Some say it is a battle for the heart. I really \nthink it is a battle for the future. I understand the need to save \ncosts, but I also understand that truly how we treat the least among us \nis the ultimate test of this Nation.\n\n  I would submit to you that, yes, if this amendment passes, we will \nreduce the savings of the bill. I would also\n\n[[Page S8339]]\n\nsubmit to you that unless we do this, in the largest State in the \nUnion, in 2 or 3 years, we are going to see an absolute picture of \ndevastation.\n  Forty percent of the Federal funding losses over the 6 years come \nfrom California. The bill, the way it stands, is estimated to cost $7 \nbillion to $9 billion, nearly a million people are effected in the \nState of California, and in Los Angeles County alone, the estimate is \n400,000 to 500,000 people impacted unless this amendment passes.\n  My statement to this body is, in essence, ``you could establish your \nprinciple, your public policy, which is, after all, what this body is \nall about, without actually harming and hurting people now who are \ndeserving, whose total ability to live and exist in this country \ndepends on their ability to receive SSI, or their ability to receive \nAFDC, or their ability to receive the medical care that they are \ncovered to get under the law today. In essence, we change the law \nmidstream on the most vulnerable people and are in this country \nlegally.\n  I have a real problem with that. I would think anybody looking at \nthis bill would have a real problem with that, at least I would hope \nthey would. Come to Chinatown in San Francisco, for example, and stand \non a corner for an hour and watch the elderly go by. Take 52 percent of \nall of them that you see and know that they are SSI, and know that \ntomorrow or September 1, they won't be. That is what this bill does. It \nhas a very profound implication for California.\n  That is why Senator Boxer and I stand here today, and why Senator \nGraham has tried to move the amendment he did and now supports our \namendment. I would submit to you that the big States, the growth \nStates, are going to have the biggest impact.\n  I would submit to you that they will be: California, on a tier all by \nitself; certainly Florida; certainly Texas; certainly New York; \ncertainly Illinois; and certainly to an extent New Jersey. These are \nthe big States that will be affected by this bill.\n  I know the votes are here to defeat the amendment.\n  The ultimate test of a civilization is how we treat the least among \nus. It is one thing to change the rules ahead, so everybody knows what \nrules we as a country play by, and both Senator Boxer and I are willing \nto do that. It is another thing to say, when you have no other means of \nsubsistence, ``we are going to change the rules on you today.''\n  I yield 10 minutes of my time to Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank the senior Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] for her \nwork and the staff work on this excellent amendment. Both Senators from \nCalifornia have been, shall we say, very upset about the impact of this \nbill on our great, wonderful, and beautiful State. We have been talking \nfor several days about what approach we can take to keep with the \nprinciple of welfare reform but to make sure we do not change these \nrules in the middle of the game so that innocent children, innocent \nfamilies, even refugees who come here without a sponsor but to escape \npersecution, are not thrown out on the street.\n  I was discussing this with a friend of mine who said, ``Well, they \nwill be taken care of. Someone is going to take care of them.'' I said \nthat I used to be a county supervisor, and I know that we have the \ngeneral assistance program, and we are required to take care of those \nwho are completely destitute. Where are the counties going to get the \nfunds to do this? This friend of mine said, ``Well, maybe they will \njust change the law, and they won't have to do it anymore.''\n  My friends, we need welfare reform. The system does not work. It is \nbroken. The senior Senator and I want to fix it. We want to put work \nfirst. We also want to make sure that the most vulnerable, as she has \nstated, are protected. It is perhaps easy to sit in this beautiful \nChamber, in all the luxury of this beautiful Chamber, far away from the \nproblem, and vote to say we are cutting off legal immigrants. It is \neasy to say it. I understand that. It is politically popular to say it.\n  I remind my friends that we are talking about people who are here \nlegally, who waited their turn to come here. We are talking about \nrefugees, people who sought asylum. And we are changing the rules. This \nbill will harm them even if they are blind, even if they are helpless, \neven if they are children. I think what Senator Feinstein has crafted \nin her amendment goes a long way to resolving this issue. The amendment \nwould say to those who are here legally, you came knowing the rules and \nwe will keep you under those rules. However, let the word go out across \nthe world that times are changing. America is changing the rules, and \nif you come here after September of this year, you will no longer have \nthose same benefits. The senior Senator from California and I believe \nthis is eminently fair. It does no damage to the thrust of the \nunderlying bill.\n  As Senator Feinstein has pointed out, our State of California is \ngoing to get hit with a tremendous unfunded mandate. With well over $50 \nbillion of savings in this bill, we know that over a third of those \nsavings come from legal immigrant cutbacks--40 percent of which will \ncome from our great State of California. That simply is not fair. We \nare talking about a loss of $7 to $9 billion to California alone.\n  This is an Earth-shattering bill we are considering. This is a bill \nthat will bring much needed change to the welfare system. It is putting \nwork first. It is changing in many ways the social contract in this \ncountry. It is putting responsibility on the shoulders of many people \nin this country.\n  I think it is a very important bill, and I very much want to support \nit, but I have to say, how can we be proud to vote for a bill that \nwould take a blind, elderly woman with no other means of support and \nthrow her out on the street? How can we be proud of a bill that takes \nchildren and puts them out on the street?\n  Today, there are an estimated 4 million legal immigrant children in \nthis country. Some of them will be harmed if the Feinstein-Boxer \namendment is not adopted. Out of those 4 million legal immigrant \nchildren, about 1.5 million live in the State of California. How can we \nstand here and say that we care about children and yet in the same \nbreath vote for a bill that could cause harm to scores of legal \nimmigrant children? It is hard for me to comprehend that.\n\n  Senator Feinstein and I have heard from our counties and cities all \nover the State. She has listed for you in descending order the cities \nand counties that would be affected the most. I had an opportunity to \nspeak with one of Los Angeles' County supervisors, Zev Yeroslavsky. He \nprovided me with information which shows what would happen to Los \nAngeles. This bill could be cataclysmic for that city. Again, it is \neasy to say let the counties worry about it. But I thought this body \ndecided we would not put unfunded mandates on local governments. And \nyet that is what we are doing.\n  I have to say this. Last night, the Senator from Florida and the \nSenator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum], got into a debate about just \nwhat happens to legal immigrants in this country. The Senator from \nPennsylvania made an eloquent statement that this bill does not \nadversely impact refugees. He said we are true to the American \nprinciple of give us your tired and your poor. If you escape from your \ncountry and you come here, we take you in. I was very moved by that \neloquence, and then learned, as Senator Graham pointed out, in a copy \nof the most recent bill, refugees would also be cut off 5 years after \nthey entered.\n  The Feinstein amendment would say we are going to make these changes, \nbut we are going to make them prospectively, from September of this \nyear forward.\n  I cannot imagine that we would knowingly hurt the most vulnerable in \nour society--who are here legally--by immediately changing the rules. \nBy immediately telling the aged, blind, and disabled, with the most \nseverely disabling diseases and conditions, that they are thrown out. \nAnd to tell the counties that this is your problem.\n  I just remember those days when I was a county supervisor, and a \nlittle child came before me with her family and looked into my eyes and \nthe eyes of my colleagues. We, two Democrats and three Republicans on \nthat board, would never turn people away.\n  That would be a violation of every ethic--be it religious, moral, \nethical,\n\n[[Page S8340]]\n\nor governmental. Yet, without the Feinstein-Boxer amendment, which is \nalso supported by Senator Graham, that is exactly what we will do. We \nwill force an unfunded mandate on the local governments. We will hurt \nthe most vulnerable in our society. We are changing the rules in the \nmiddle of the game.\n  If we support this amendment, which I think is a fine amendment, it \ndoes no harm at all to the premise of this bill. It just means that we \nphase-in some of the more restrictive aspects of this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues--indeed, I implore my colleagues--think about \nwhat you are doing. Because if this goes forward and we see the most \nvulnerable people on the streets of our cities and our counties and we \nsee our counties without the means to handle it, we will be very sorry, \nindeed, that we went forward. The Feinstein-Boxer-Graham amendment \ngives us the opportunity to phase-in all of this.\n  Again, I thank my colleague. I urge support for the amendment, and I \nyield back the time to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from California has 7 \nminutes exactly.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Just one thought for this body. Take the most \nconservative cost for California, $7 billion; 7-year bill, $1 billion a \nyear, most of it coming from Los Angeles County, let us say $500 \nmillion a year. California is a proposition 13 State. This all has to \ncome from general assistance. General assistance is locally funded. Los \nAngeles cannot raise its property tax rate under proposition 13.\n  How does the county fund it? The county cannot fund it. This will \nforce, if the county is to fund it--this will force the reduction of \nother county programs. It could be the sheriff, it could be the jail. \nThere is no way around it. The dollars are too big.\n  The distinguished chairman of the committee indicated that the \nsavings, by taking all legal immigrants off of all benefits, is $18 \nbillion. What we are telling you is we know 52 percent of this comes \nfrom California. Therefore, if California is a prop 13 State and it \npresses the local jurisdictions and they are funded by property taxes \nand they cannot raise their property taxes and they cannot say ``legal \nimmigrants, leave the country and go home,'' it is a real catch-22 for \nthe local government.\n  If I might, just quickly, ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a letter dated July 17 from the Democratic floor leader of \nthe California Assembly and President pro tempore of the California \nSenate; and a memorandum from the California State Association of \nCounties.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                           California Legislature,\n\n\n                                                State Capitol,\n\n                                    Sacramento, CA, July 17, 1996.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: We write to convey major concerns \n     raised by the most recent proposed welfare reform legislation \n     currently being considered by Congress.\n\n\n            services for aged and disabled legal immigrants\n\n       Denying federal benefits to legal immigrants \n     disproportionately harms California communities. Over 230,000 \n     non-citizen legal immigrants currently receive SSI in \n     California, excluding refugees. This aid is provided to the \n     aged, blind and disabled, who could not support themselves by \n     going to work if their SSI benefits ended. Under HR 3507, SSI \n     and Food Stamps would be denied to non-citizens already \n     legally residing in California as well as to new legal \n     entrants unlike the immigration reform legislation currently \n     under consideration in Congress, which permits continued \n     benefits for existing legal residents.\n       The proposed bar on SSI and Food Stamps for all legal \n     immigrants, and the denial of other federal means-tested \n     programs to new legal entrants for their first five years in \n     the country would have a devastating effect on California's \n     counties, which are obligated to be the providers of last \n     resort. It is estimated that these proposed changes would \n     result in costs of $9 billion to California's counties over a \n     seven-year period. At a minimum, the very elderly, those too \n     disabled to become citizens and those who become disabled \n     after they arrive in this country should be exempted from the \n     prohibition on SSI--if for no other reason than to lessen to \n     counties the indefensible cost of shifting care from the \n     federal government to local taxpayers for a needy population \n     admitted under U.S. immigration laws.\n\n\n                        protection for children\n\n       While we agree that welfare dependence should not be \n     encouraged as a way of life, it is essential in setting time \n     limits on aid that adequate protections be provided for \n     children once parents hit these time limits. Some provision \n     must be made for vouchers or some other mechanism by which \n     the essential survival needs of children such as food can be \n     met. The Administration has suggested this sort of approach \n     as a means of ensuring adequate protection for children whose \n     parents hit time limits on aid.\n       California's child poverty rate was 27 percent for 1992 \n     through 1994, substantially above the national rate of 21 \n     percent. HR 4, which was vetoed by the President, would have \n     caused an additional 1.5 million children to become poor. \n     Though estimates have not been produced for HR 3507, it is \n     likely that it also would result in a significant additional \n     number of children falling below the poverty level.\n\n\n                    adequate funding for child care\n\n       Funds provided for child care are essential to meet the \n     needs of parents entering the work force while on aid and \n     leaving aid as their earnings increase. For California to \n     meet required participation rates, about 400,000 parents \n     would have to enter the work force and an additional 100,000 \n     would have to increase their hours of work. Even if only 15 \n     percent of these parents need a paid, formal child care \n     arrangement, California will need nearly $300 million per \n     year in new child care funds.\n       Thank you for your consideration of these concerns. If your \n     staff have any questions about these issues, they can contact \n     Tim Gage, at (916) 324-0341.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Lockyer,\n       President pro tempore, California Senate.\n     Richard Katz,\n       Democratic Floor Leader, California Assembly.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      California State Association\n\n\n                                                  of Counties,\n\n                                    Sacramento, CA, July 15, 1996.\n     To: California Congressional Delegation.\n     From: Mike Nevin, CSAC President.\n     Re Welfare reform legislation.\n       I am writing once again to bring to your attention a very \n     important issue involving the impact of the welfare reform \n     bill on local government. As I understand it, the Congress \n     plans to submit a new welfare reform bill to the President \n     that does not contain Medicaid reform. However, the bill will \n     still contain measures which pose serious and substantial \n     cost shifts to local government including drastic health care \n     costs.\n       The measures, H.R. 3507 and S. 1795, propose to eliminate \n     SSI and food stamps to legal immigrants including those \n     already legally residing in California. In addition, it would \n     eliminate future immigrants from eligibility for 50 to 80 \n     federal programs for five years and disqualifies those same \n     immigrants from these programs until citizenship. The fiscal \n     effect of these provisions would be to drain $23 billion of \n     federal money nationwide from major welfare programs over \n     seven years. California, which is home to the largest number \n     of noncitizen legal immigrants in the country would lose at \n     least $9 billion over seven years.\n       Once legal immigrants are no longer eligible for federal \n     social service programs, California's 58 counties will still \n     be responsible for providing social services and medical care \n     to them. A recent study issued by the University of \n     California at Los Angeles indicates that an estimated 830,000 \n     immigrants would converge onto county health programs if \n     changes are made at the federal level to exclude them from \n     health coverage. The counties in California are legally and \n     fiscally responsible under state law to provide a ``safety \n     net'' to indigent persons in the form of cash aid and health \n     care. Currently, local governments are bursting at the seams \n     from the impact of these programs.\n       Changes of this magnitude at the federal level could cause \n     many counties to meet the same fate as Orange County did two \n     years ago when it declared bankruptcy. Counties are already \n     struggling financially as year after year they have been \n     forced to absorb reductions in payments because of local, \n     state and federal budget difficulties. We cannot now absorb \n     these costs as well. We strongly urge you to consider your \n     vote on these very important pieces of legislation and the \n     long-range impact they will have on local government once the \n     publicity is over. We would request that you do not support \n     these measures should they contain these faulty policies \n     which would merely shift the cost and responsibility to the \n     counties.\n       There are additional concerns that we have with the \n     proposal and Margaret Pena of my staff is available to \n     discuss them with you. She can be reached at (916) 327-7523. \n     Thank you for your consideration.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                     New California Coalition,\n\n                                 San Francisco, CA, July 17, 1996.\n     To: Kathleen Reich, Office of Senator Feinstein.\n     From: Tanya Broder.\n     Re Welfare bills pending before the House and Senate floor--\n         the California impact of the immigrant provisions.\n       Attached, as you requested are:\n       1. A letter from the California State Association of \n     Counties on this issue.\n\n[[Page S8341]]\n\n       2. A one-pager prepared by the National Immigration Law \n     Center on the current welfare bills.\n       3. A 2-pager on the California impact. I put this together, \n     based largely on materials prepared by NILC. It is being \n     refined--let me know if anything is unclear.\n       Please do not hesitate to call me at 243-8215, extension \n     319, if you have any questions or need additional \n     information. Please inform us of the Senator's position on \n     any or all of these issues as soon as you can. Thank you for \n     your interest.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, how much of my time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes and 46 seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this is certainly an issue of dollars. It \nis certainly an issue of impact on local institutions required to \nprovide services. But it is also fundamentally an issue of fairness, \nfairness in many dimensions. Let me just mention two.\n  One of those is the fact that very few of these local communities \nrequested the circumstance in which they find themselves. Immigrants, \nlegal and illegal, come into this country for a variety of reasons but \nvirtually none of them come in because they receive an invitation from \na particular community. It is Federal policy that determines who can \ncome legally. It is Federal willingness to allocate resources that will \ndetermine whether we can enforce the immigration laws that we have \nenacted or will we be faced with floodtides of illegal immigration. \nUnfortunately, my State, as does California, peculiarly has to deal \nwith this issue. We have had hundreds of thousands of immigrants in all \ncategories, from refugees to parolees to asylees to special categories \nof entrants, come into our State, as well as those who have come \nthrough the normal immigration process. All those decisions are made by \nthose of us who are privileged to be Federal officials.\n  The consequences of those decisions almost always fall at a local \nlevel: At a hospital attempting to cope with overwhelming numbers of \npersons seeking medical assistance; at an educational institution, a \nschool that is overcrowded because of the large surge of immigrant \nchildren--the social institutions. My State was so overwhelmed that we \nwent to Federal court with a request, under litigation, that we be \ncompensated for the expenses the State had paid on behalf of those \npersons who came to the United States as a result of Federal action.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on that case just a few weeks ago. \nUnfortunately for the State of Florida, the ruling was: You may have a \ngood case. You may have a strong moral basis for your litigation. But \nit is not a justiciable case before the Federal courts. You have to \nfind your relief through the political processes, not through the \njudicial processes. That is what we are about today. Fundamental \nfairness in terms of the Federal Government assuming its appropriate \nresponsibility for the financial cost of the immigration decisions that \nit has made.\n  There is a second issue of fairness and that is as it relates to the \nindividual affected. These people who came here under the current \nimmigration law did so under a set of standards and expectations that \ndid not include that they were going to have their benefits \nperemptorily terminated. If this is a good idea to have in effect \ntoday, we should have done it 10 or 20 years ago.\n  I think it is fundamentally unfair to have these people in the \ncountry under the rules that have applied--we are dealing, here, with \nlegal aliens, people who pay the same taxes we do and are subject to \nthe same responsibilities; but now, at the last moment, we are going to \nsay you are not going to get the same benefits. I think that is unfair. \nThe amendment that has been offered by the Senators from California \nwould relieve us from that unfairness. I hope it will be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 4 minutes of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from California has 26 seconds remaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield to the other side and request I be allowed to \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this is a debate that is virtually \nidentical to the debate we engaged in last night at a rather late hour \nwith the Senator from Florida on his amendment. His amendment removes \nall the provisions dealing with legal immigrants from the bill, for \ncurrent participants in the welfare system and future participants in \nthe welfare system. What the Feinstein amendment does is simply makes \nthe provisions in the bill prospective but grandfathers in everybody \nwho is in the system. The Graham amendment, to my understanding, was \ngoing to reduce the savings in the budget by somewhere from $16 to $18 \nbillion. My understanding is the Feinstein amendment reduces the \nsavings in the reconciliation bill from $10 to $12 billion. It is still \na dramatic revenue loss. As was in the case of the Graham bill, in the \nFeinstein bill there are no offsets. This is just a reduction in \nsavings, going to pay for legal immigrants to continue to receive \nwelfare benefits.\n\n  Let me, for the benefit of those who were not up at 11:30 last night \nlistening to this debate, go through how the underlying bill works and, \nin fact, a little bit of the history of the underlying provisions in \nthis act, the underlying bill. What is in this legislation before us \nare provisions that were passed in H.R. 4 last year and passed both the \nHouse and Senate. They were in the Senate bill that passed the Senate \nlast year 87 to 12. They are in the Democratic substitute, which I \nbelieve--I might be wrong--the Members who are debating this amendment \nand advocating this amendment voted for. The Daschle substitute has \nthis identical provision in the bill, the same provision as the \nRepublican bill.\n  What the Senators from California and Florida are attempting to do is \nto remove what has passed the Congress once, what has passed this \nSenate twice, what has been included in both Democratic and Republican \nbills.\n  I suggest this has been a fairly well-tested provision. It is clear \nthe vast majority of the Members of this Senate believe that we have \nbeen too generous with legal immigrants coming into this country, and I \nwill explain why they feel that way.\n  In fact, the Graham amendment today was tabled; in other words, \ndefeated, on a motion of 62 to 34. So this is not, frankly, even a \npartisan issue, as you see. It has very strong bipartisan support.\n  Let me explain what the underlying bill does, what the Feinstein \namendment is attempting to change. What we do in this bill is recognize \nthat there are various classes of immigrants.\n  For purposes of simplification, we will talk about three major \nclasses of immigrants. One is what are called refugees. These are \npeople who come to this country who are seeking refuge from political \npersecution or other kinds of persecution in a foreign country, and \nthey come to our shores seeking help and refuge in the United States.\n  What we say to those people, as the Senator from California referred \nto earlier, just like the Statue of Liberty says, we are open and we \nallow those people in, and we do even more. The Statue of Liberty did \nnot say, ``Give us your poor, your hungry,'' and all the other things \nit says, ``and the Government will feed them.'' It says, come on in \nhere and have a chance at American life, come on in and have a chance \nat the opportunity of America. Nowhere that I see on the Statue of \nLiberty does it say anything about the Government having welfare \nprograms for everybody for as long as they are in this country. I do \nnot think that is on there. I can check, but I am pretty sure it is not \non there. What is on there is an opportunity that America presents to \nthe people in this country, and we continue that, certainly.\n  Second, we, in this bill, provide for welfare benefits for refugees \nfor 5 years. They are eligible for every benefit that a citizen of this \ncountry is eligible for.\n  Now, why 5 years? Because after 5 years, they are eligible for \ncitizenship, and if they apply for citizenship and go through the \nprogram to get their citizenship and are successful, they are citizens \nand are eligible for every right with respect to social services as any \nother American. So that is why we limit it to 5 years.\n\n[[Page S8342]]\n\n  Some would say, ``What you're doing here is sort of coercing people \nto become citizens.'' I think that is, frankly, not true. I do not \nthink most refugees come here because they are looking for welfare \nbenefits. I think most people come here because they are looking for \nthe things that are on the Statue of Liberty; they are looking for the \nopportunity that is America. In fact, the vast majority of those people \ndo not end up on welfare, for the long term, anyway. So what we do is \nwe say, ``Look, we have an expectation in this country that people are \nnot coming here for social services,'' and all we are doing is \npatterning a law to reflect that expectation.\n  What I just described with respect to refugees also applies to \nasylees. Asylees are people like the two players from the Cuban \nbaseball team last week, or the week before, who were in this country \nand escaped from their hotel and claimed political asylum and were \ngranted that asylum. Those two players are probably not going to be \nneeding any welfare benefits, given their talent level.\n  But there are people who do claim asylum here and end up on welfare, \nand they are treated the same as refugees: 5 years until they are \neligible for citizenship, and then the expectation is you can either \ndecide to be a citizen of this country and avail yourselves of all the \nbenefits and responsibilities of citizenship, or you take the option \nyou are not going to be a citizen and no longer be eligible for these \nprograms. That is a decision you make. It is not a decision we are \nforcing on anybody. You make that decision. I think that is a \nreasonable time. It is 5 years. It is a very generous offer. So that is \nthe one side of the immigrant calculation.\n  The other side is what is called ``sponsored immigrants.'' Those are \nthe majority of immigrants who come to this country. They are people \nwho come here under what is called a sponsorship agreement wherein \nmost--I would not say all--but in the vast majority of cases, these are \nfamily members under the family reunification provisions of the \nimmigration law. They are mothers and fathers of people who live in \nthis country; they are sisters and brothers or children of the people \nwho live in this country. They come into this country under this \nsponsorship agreement.\n\n  What does the sponsorship agreement say? If you are the sponsor, if \nyou are the citizen of the country who is bringing in your mother, then \nyou sign a piece of paper that says, ``I will take responsibility for \nproviding for the needs of the person I want to bring to this country. \nI will provide for them. My income, my assets will be deemed available \nto them for purposes of determining whether they are eligible for \nbenefits.'' That is under current law.\n  What does the immigrant who comes to this country sign? They sign a \npiece of paper that says, ``I am willing and capable, able to work, and \nI will not be a public charge.'' They sign a legal document saying they \nwill not be a public charge. You say, ``That should take care of it. \nThat is pretty solid. They are contracts.'' One would think they are \nlegally binding when they sign them. The fact is, they are not legally \nbinding.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield on that point for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to make sure the Senator realizes that Senator \nFeinstein and I, in this amendment, do not change any of the things my \nfriend is talking about. We do not touch anything in the underlying \nbill.\n  All the Senator does, and I back her 100 percent, as does the Senator \nfrom Florida, is to say that since we are changing the rules that have \nbeen in effect for a long time, let's make them apply to people who are \ncoming as of September of this year rather than change the rules for \nthe folks who are here now. But everything the Senator says, Senator \nFeinstein's amendment does as much for future immigrants. I want to \nmake sure the Senator was clear on that point.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. For the Senator to suggest the Feinstein amendment does \nnot touch it is not accurate. You say it does not apply to anybody \nhere, so you would remove all the provisions of this act with respect \nto people in this country.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is prospective. Our amendment makes it prospective, \nbut it says to the folks here, ``We are not going to change your rules \nin the middle of the game.'' All the things my friend is explaining, \nnone of those are touched by the Feinstein-Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. They are not touched prospectively. Again, all these \nprovisions I am explaining do apply and will apply to people who are in \nthis country. So, for example, if you have a sponsored immigrant who is \nin this country receiving welfare benefits, maybe has been receiving \nthem for 20 years, we suggest after 20 years, if you are not a citizen, \nif you are here receiving welfare benefits, which in many cases--and I \nwas getting to the point with respect to sponsored immigrants, because \nwhat has been happening is that we have seen a chronic trend, and the \nSenator from New Mexico was on the floor yesterday with a chart that \nillustrates this, what happens with a lot of the sponsored immigrants--\nand these people are in this country now--is that son and daughter are \nbringing over mom and dad, and mom and dad come into this country, they \nsign these documents, they have signed them already, but they are not \nlegally enforceable, No. 1.\n  No. 2, the welfare departments in the States do not know what the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service is doing. They do not talk to \neach other. There is no communication. So mom comes into the country. \nShe is 70 years old. She goes down to the SSI office, and guess what? \nShe is on SSI. By the way, when she qualifies for SSI, she qualifies \nfor Medicaid. When she qualifies for SSI, she qualifies for food \nstamps, and she qualifies for a whole variety of other programs, all \npaid for by the taxpayer.\n  So what we have become in this country, not prospectively, but now, \nis a retirement home for millions of people all over the world to come \nhere and have you, the taxpayer, pay for their retirement.\n  Now, I do not think that is right. What the amendment of the Senator \nfrom California says is, ``Well, they are here, let them stay, and \nwe'll continue to pay for them.'' If it is wrong, it is wrong. And \nwhether it is prospective or not, it is wrong.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much for yielding.\n  Let me make this point. Under present law, affidavits of support are \nnot legally enforceable. In the immigration bill, that is one of the \nthings that is achieved. It is a binding contract, an affidavit, so \nthat in the future these contracts will be legally enforceable. I \nsupport that. I agree with you on this point. But the point that we are \ntrying to make is that at present they are not. Therefore, there has \nbeen a kind of a change.\n  The other point that I want to make to you is that this is not the \nsame as the Daschle bill. This bill is not the same as the Daschle bill \non this point. The Daschle bill has certain exemptions. The disabled \nare exempted. Refugees are exempted. Battered women and children are \nexempted. Veterans are exempted. That is a point I really appreciate \nthe opportunity to make.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. With respect to this list, I know in this bill--and I \nhave not read every page of all of this--my belief is veterans are \nexempted, also. I say to the Senator from California, having worked on \nthis issue for quite some time, I think you may have a legitimate point \nwith respect to a refugee who is 90 years old who is in this country \nand has been here for a long time as to whether we want to knock them \noff this system. I suggest to the Senator that, while I will not be a \nconferee, I would be sympathetic and would communicate my sympathy with \nrespect to some very difficult, isolated cases for the very old or the \nseverely disabled who may be on these programs today. But yours goes \nwell beyond that.\n  I mean, I think we can look at the hard cases, but I think what your \nbill does is basically let people who signed a document--it is true \nthat it is not a legally binding document, but I can guarantee you when \nthey set that in front of them, and it is fairly legal looking, when \nthey signed that--I mean, I do not know about you, but when I sign a \ndocument, put my name\n\n[[Page S8343]]\n\non something saying I am going to do something, I want to live up to \nthat end of the bargain.\n  We want them to live up to their end of the bargain. What your bill \ndoes is let them off the hook. We do not want to let them off the hook. \nWe want people who come to this country who say they are not going be a \npublic charge and people who bring their relatives into this country \nwho say they are going to take care of them to live up to the deal.\n  What your bill does is say there is no deal, you do whatever you \nwant, and we will pay the charge. I do not think that is what we want \nto say in this country. I do not think that is what we want to do.\n  While I understand what your concern is--and the Senator from \nCalifornia is a thoughtful person, and I find myself in agreement with \nher many times. I think the point you have made with the impact on \nCalifornia, I cannot argue the fact that the impact on California will \nbe disproportionate with respect to this particular provision.\n  The fact of immigration has, as you know, its pluses and its minuses. \nYou can make the decision, not me, as to whether it is a plus or a \nminus in California. But what I say is the Congressional Budget Office \nhas said--and I will read from their report that they sent to the \nSenator from Delaware with respect to unfunded mandates.\n  Both Senators from California talked extensively about the impact of \nunfunded mandates as a result of this legislation. Unfunded mandates \nwas a bill that we passed last year that said that we are tired of the \nGovernment, the Federal Government, passing bills, imposing mandates on \nState and local Governments without coming up with the money for these \nState and local governments to fulfill the mandate, requiring them to \ndo something but not paying them the money to do it.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, this bill does not have \nunfunded mandates. I will read the section. ``On balance''--obviously \nin every bill there are pluses and minuses. I accept that:\n\n       On balance, spending by State and local governments on \n     federally mandated activities could be reduced by billions of \n     dollars over the next 5 years as a result of the enactment of \n     this bill.\n\n  I, again, have some sympathy for the Senator from California because \nyou have a disproportionate impact with respect to legal immigrants. \nYou may be one of those States that is on the minus side while another \nState is on the plus side. But on balance, in this country, this is not \nan unfunded mandate. That is the way I think we have to look at things.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Just on that one point, if I may. I appreciate what \nthe Senator is saying. But when you continue to read the report that \nyou were reading from the Congressional Budget Office, it does say:\n\n       While the new mandates imposed by the bill would result in \n     additional costs to some States, the repeal of existing \n     mandates and the additional flexibility provided are likely \n     to reduce spending by more than the additional costs.\n\n  That cannot be true for California. In a way, it is a play with words \nbecause the numbers are so big in California in terms of 52 percent of \nthe impact of this section of the bill with SSI falling on California. \nFifty-two percent of all of the SSI users are in California. That is \nwho you are talking about. Those are the elderly. Those are the blind. \nThose are the disabled. By this bill, boom, they are off. That is the \nissue that both of us are trying to bring respectfully to your \nattention.\n  What I do not understand is--and I understand the savings. See, the \nreason this section of the bill has the large amount of savings that it \ndoes is because of California, because $7 to $9 billion of it is \nCalifornia. The minute you transfer it and it goes to the county--\nbecause California alone is a proposition 13 State and cannot raise its \nproperty tax to accommodate the general assistance added burden--you \ncould force some counties--and LA could be one under this; you just \nhave to know this because the numbers are so huge in Los Angeles. It is \na very precipitous situation.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I suggest a couple things to the Senator from \nCalifornia. No. 1, this is a policy that I think needs to be changed, \nand, No. 2, the fact of the matter is that there are a lot of people on \nthese programs who can and should be working, as a result of their \ncoming into this country and signing this document, should be working \nunder the law.\n  What your bill does is take those people off the hook. You can say, \nwell, there is going to be a tremendous impact to these counties. Yeah, \nwell, that may be true. But I guess the point I am making is, we should \nstand up for what people sign their names on, which is that they were \ngoing to not be a public charge and the people who are going to take \ncare of them--I go back to the sponsorship agreement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Let me finish my point. I go back to the sponsorship \nagreement. What you are ignoring here is, you say, well, it is going to \nfall on the counties. Under what I described, under the system I \ndescribed of SSI, for example, who should the burden fall on? Clearly, \nit should fall on the sponsor--not the county.\n  Sponsors, when they bring people into this country--there is a \ncertain economic criteria to be able to bring someone in with a \nsponsor. These people have in fact taken a walk. They have said, well, \nyou know, let the Government pick up this cost. I do not want to pick \nup mom's cost. I want to buy my other Mercedes. Well, let us not buy \nanother Mercedes. Let us pay for mom.\n  What you are suggesting is that all these people who have three cars \nin their garage are going to let mom starve or put them on LA County's \nwelfare rolls, which may not exist as you so eloquently state. I am \nsaying that a lot of these people who sponsor people into this country \nare going to have to start footing the bill. That is what we are \npushing here. You make the assumption that everybody who is on SSI is \ngoing to fall on to the county or the State. I do not make that \nassumption. I make the assumption that people who sign legal documents \nsaying they were going to take care of people are going to now have to \nbelly up. They are going to have to pay the bill.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We do not disagree with you. I want to make it clear. I \nwant to make it clear. The senior Senator from California and I do not \ndisagree with you. We believe that the sponsors who can, should and \nmust pay for people they sponsor to come to the country.\n  But I want to make a point to my friend. It is worthy to note that \napproximately 400,000 legal immigrants receive AFDC in California. Out \nof those, 62 percent are refugees. They do not have a sponsor. This \ngoes back to your debate with the Senator from Florida last night. We \nalso have a situation where many of those on SSI, who are sponsored, \nsomething may have happened to their families or their sponsors in the \ninterim.\n  So, my friend is talking about a principle that we agree with. But \nyet in the underlying bill there is no recognition of the fact that a \nlot of these legal immigrants do not have a sponsor to fall back on. A \nlot of these elderly do not have a sponsor to fall back on.\n  I think before we pass this sweeping reform, what Senator Feinstein \nand my amendment does is say, we are willing to say as of September, \neven though we have some reservations and we know it is tough and we \nknow it will hurt our State, we are willing to go along with it. But \nplease, we say to you, Senator from Pennsylvania, taking a lead in this \nbill, consider what we are telling you. Rather than just have an \nargument, maybe there is some room here where we can work together so \nwhen we bring this bill out, we will not hurt a lot of kids and a lot \nof very sick, elderly, and blind people.\n  Thank you for your generosity.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reclaiming my time to make a couple of points. All the \nrefugees you talk about have a 5-year exemption from the ineligibility \nfor benefits. Anyone that is in this country is eligible for benefits \nup to the first 5 years they are in this country.\n  Mrs. BOXER. They are cut off after 5 years.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. After the fifth year they are no longer eligible. As \nthe Senator from California knows they are eligible, after a 5-year \nperiod, to apply\n\n[[Page S8344]]\n\nfor citizenship. Once they apply for citizenship and are accepted, they \nwould again be eligible if, in fact, they need be.\n  As the Senator from California knows, the hurdle for getting their \ncitizenship in this country is not extraordinary. So if people are, in \nfact, in such desperate condition as the Senator suggests, I think the \nanswer would be, in fact, to get these people into citizenship \nprograms. I suggest that is a positive thing.\n  As we all know, those who are noncitizens who do not know the \nlanguage or cannot, in many cases, successfully interact into the \neconomic mainstream of our country, obviously have a much more \ndifficult time succeeding. So, in fact, forcing or encouraging \ncitizenship would be a positive thing for many of the people that we \nare talking about here. I think that has to be looked at.\n  No. 2, we are talking about a 1-year transition. In some cases we \nwill have people who have exhausted their 5 years who now say wait, I \nwill not be eligible for benefits, and I will be brought in for some \nsort of redetermination here. It will be basically a year process. I \nsuggest during that year process, if they still are concerned or they \nstill are, in fact, disabled or believe they would not be able to work, \nthey can begin to go through the process during that transition year to \nget their citizenship. I think we provide plenty of avenues for the \ntruly disabled refugees and asylees to be able to stay on these \nbenefits if, in fact, they are truly disabled. It takes some initiative \non their part, but my goodness, should we not expect some initiative on \nthe people's part, to create some link between themselves and this \ncountry in order to receive benefits?\n  I remind the Senators from California, I believe, and I can be \ncorrected, but I believe we are the only country in the world who \nactually provides welfare benefits for their immigrants as soon as they \ncome into this country. We are, in a sense, already very generous. I am \nnot saying we should not be generous to those who are in need. But, at \nsome point, like we are saying to moms who are having children and are \non AFDC, there is a contract here. If we are going to limit moms with \nchildren on AFDC to 5 years, I think we have every right to limit \nrefugees in this country who come here for 5 years. What we are saying \nto the refugees, unlike what we are saying to the moms, you get your \ncitizenship in the fifth year, you can get back on the rolls. We do not \nlet moms back on the rolls.\n  We are being painted as being cruel and knocking all these people \noff, when in fact what we are being is somewhat principled. I believe \nit will actually work to the benefit of the refugees who will seek \ncitizenship, which will make them more likely to be successful in their \neconomic life in America.\n\n  I think there are a lot of positive things we can say. This is not, \nas I am sure will be noted in some publications, any kind of immigrant-\nbashing--nothing like that. We think people who are sponsored \nimmigrants should live up to their contract, and people who are \nrefugees, and immigrants, and asylees should have a period of time in \nwhich we will help them, and then at some point they have to help \nthemselves, just like a lot of other people who are going to be dealing \nwith the welfare system with AFDC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Pennsylvania has a \nminute and a half remaining, and the Senator from California has 1 \nminute remaining.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I say, and I think I speak on behalf of my colleague, \nSenator Boxer, as well, we are not disputing that the time has come to \nmake some changes. We are not even disputing that perhaps there are \nsome who are on SSI or AFDC that can find other ways of support. What \nwe are disputing is that this language is so ironclad that it throws \nthe baby out with the bath water.\n  I was mayor of San Francisco for 9 years, a member of the board of \nsupervisors for 9, for a total of 18 years. I know these communities. I \ncan tell you that there are several hundred thousand people who do not \nhave another source of support. In Los Angeles, I know, I have seen it \nwith my own eyes. This bill does not allow for any fine tuning.\n  I think both Senator Boxer and I would be happy to sit down with the \nother side and try to work out a process of evaluation whereby you \ncould fine tune this bill so people who truly are blind, who truly can \nbarely walk down a street, who truly have no access to three meals a \nday can have a source of subsistence in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, pursuant to section 310(d)(2), I raise a \npoint of order against the pending amendment because it reduces outlay \nsavings for the Finance Committee below the level provided in the \nreconciliation instructions, and the amendment would not make \ncompensating outlay reductions or revenue increases.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Pursuant to Section 904 of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act. I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nRhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I understand I am recognized for 15 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4931\n\n (Purpose: To maintain current eligibility standards for Medicaid and \n                 provide additional State flexibility)\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, yesterday we voted not to reform the \nMedicaid Program. This is a welfare bill we are on, not a Medicaid \nbill. We put off any Medicaid reforms, if you would, until another day. \nBecause of the link between welfare eligibility and Medicaid \neligibility, this bill will repeal the guarantee--the word I am using \nis ``guarantee''--it will repeal the guarantee of Medicaid coverage for \n1.5 million children age 13 through 18, and 4 million mothers.\n  Mr. President, once again, this is not a Medicaid bill, yet we repeal \nexisting Medicaid guarantees.\n  Under our amendment, the amendment I am presenting, and I send to the \ndesk now on behalf of myself, Senators Breaux, Cohen, Graham, Jeffords, \nKerrey of Nebraska, Hatfield, Murray, Snowe, Lieberman, Reid, and \nRockefeller.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], for himself, \n     Mr. Breaux, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Graham, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kerrey, \n     Mr. Hatfield, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n     Reid, and Mr. Rockefeller, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4931.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, under our amendment, we make sure that no \nlow-income mothers and children who are eligible for Medicaid under \ncurrent law, under the existing law, will lose their health care \ncoverage under Medicaid if the State lowers its eligibility standards \nfor cash assistance or AFDC.\n  Now, this is not some open-ended lifetime entitlement to Medicaid \ncoverage. I am sure that will be raised, and we are ready for that one. \nAll this amendment does is apply current law income and resource \nstandards and methodologies in determining eligibility for Medicaid. If \na family's income increases, if there is no longer a dependent child in \nthe home, these folks will lose Medicaid eligibility under our \namendment, just as they would under current law.\n  Exactly who are we talking about, Mr. President? First, the \nindividuals we are talking about, their incomes, on an average, are \nabout 38 percent of the poverty level. Some will argue that we do not \nneed this amendment because children under 100 percent of poverty are \nalready covered. In other words, we are worried about these children. \nSome will say, oh, do not worry about them because if they are at 100 \npercent of poverty or less, they are covered. But that is not true, Mr. \nPresident. By 2002, they will all be covered up to the age of 18, but \nnot until then. Thus, children between the ages of 13 and 18 will not \nbe guaranteed coverage. Their mothers, unless they are pregnant, will \nlose the guarantees as well.\n  Mr. President, I refer everyone to this chart. Under the bill that we \nhave, pregnant women continue to be covered. Children under 13 are \ncovered. That is under 100 percent of poverty or less. The aged, blind, \nand disabled are covered. Who loses out? Who is losing out on the \nguarantees? It is nonpregnant women and children 13 to 18 that are \ngoing to fall through the cracks.\n  So, Mr. President, some will argue that we are backtracking from \nprevious welfare reform measures by removing this guarantee. I want to \nremind my colleagues that both the House and the Senate-passed versions \nof H.R. 4, which passed here 87 to 12, had the very provision in it \nthat I am talking about, which I am seeking to obtain. You might say, \nwell, if the House version had it and the Senate version had it, then, \nobviously, when we came to conference, it was there. But it was dropped \nin conference, in some type of maneuver. Even though it was in both \nbills that were passed, it was dropped from the freestanding welfare \nreform bill that passed.\n  I also point out, Mr. President, that the welfare reform bill that \npassed yesterday in the House of Representatives has this same language \nthat I am talking about here and trying to put into our legislation. \nMr. President, if we really want this welfare reform proposal to \nachieve the results of moving women off of welfare and into work, we \nshould not, in one fell swoop, remove their cash assistance and their \nmedical coverage. This is a prescription, I believe, for failure of \nwelfare reform.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude my section of the remarks before \nturning it over to the Senator from Louisiana by saying this. In the \nFinance Committee, we had all kinds of hearings in connection with \nwelfare reform, and two points came clearly through; that, if you want \nto get individuals off of welfare--and we are particularly talking, in \nmost of these cases, about women--they need support. One of the two \nthings they need in the form of support is child care, adequate child \ncare and the availability of that; second is Medicaid coverage for \nthemselves and for their children.\n  So, Mr. President, I earnestly hope that this amendment will be \nadopted. I think it is one that the managers will accept.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for \nyielding me some time and for his continued outstanding work in trying \nto make sure that whatever we do in this body is fair. All of us want \nto be tough on work. We have said that many times. We also should be \nfair to children and to pregnant women. We should be fair to those who \nare the neediest among us.\n  This legislation makes fundamental changes in the Medicaid Program, \nand that is not supposed to be what we are doing. Our Republican \ncolleagues have offered an amendment which has taken Medicaid out of \nthe equation. We are working on a welfare bill. But without the Chafee-\nBreaux amendment and a number of our colleagues, this legislation will \nstill adversely affect those people who are on Medicaid and health care \nassistance. The question is, why? Very simple. Because under the \ncurrent law, people who are eligible for AFDC assistance are also \neligible for Medicaid. Therefore, under this legislation, the States \ncould be changing all of the eligibility requirements for AFDC and, in \ndoing so, kick off, potentially, 4 million people who are on Medicaid \nbecause of their eligibility for AFDC. It sounds complicated, but it is \nnot really. We made a decision in the Congress and the people who run \nthe Medicaid Program that the standards for AFDC would be the standards \nfor Medicaid eligibility. That was a decision that should not now be \nchanged without a careful consideration of whether that is good policy \nor not.\n  Nobody is debating Medicaid eligibility on this floor. But when you \nchange the welfare program, you, in fact, will be changing the Medicaid \neligibility for millions of Americans. As Senator Chafee shows, we are \ntalking about pregnant women, children under 13, people who are the \nleast able to take care of themselves in our country. I think that is \njust not what we are all about in this country.\n  It is interesting to note that both the House and the Senate bills \nthat were passed last year contained a provision just like the Chafee \namendment. We have already adopted this before. By a vote of 87 to 12, \nthe legislation that\n\n[[Page S8346]]\n\ncontains the Chafee-Breaux amendment was passed by this Senate body. \nThat language in the House bill and in the Senate bill said very \nclearly that we would continue Medicaid coverage, health care coverage, \nfor poor children and their parents who would have qualified for AFDC \nassistance under the rules in effect at that time.\n  Now we have essentially the same bill before the Senate, but it does \nnot have that provision in it anymore. I do not know where it was \ndropped or how it got dropped. This is almost a technical amendment \nbecause we have already adopted this amendment. When the welfare reform \nbills were previously before the House and the Senate, there was no \ndisagreement in the House and no disagreement in the Senate that the \npeople who are Medicaid-eligible because of AFDC eligibility would \ncontinue to have that eligibility. That is what the policy should be. \nIf we want to come back later on and change Medicaid eligibility, let \nus do it that way. Let us have a fair debate about whether we are going \nto take the aged, the blind, the disabled, pregnant women, or children, \nthe people least advantaged among us, and kick them off of not only \nwelfare but off of Medicaid, too. At least allow us to have some \ndiscussion about it.\n  With that, Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time that \nwas yielded to me from Senator Chafee.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. I will soon offer a second-degree amendment to the Chafee-\nBreaux amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment would not be in order until the \ntime has expired.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wonder if the Chair would be good enough \nto point that out again on a second-degree amendment? It cannot be \noffered until all time has expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, let me discuss the purpose of my amendment. \nThe purpose of my amendment to the Chafee-Breaux amendment is to ensure \nMedicaid coverage to all individuals currently receiving Medicaid \nbenefits because of their eligibility through the current AFDC Program.\n  By this approach we would ensure that no child or adult currently \nreceiving Medicaid benefits would lose coverage because of welfare \nreform.\n  Let me first explain that under our bill as currently written we \nbelieve that no child would lose Medicaid coverage because of welfare \nreform. The Congressional Budget Office has not scored any Medicaid \nbabies because of the change in AFDC. But how can that be?\n  The overwhelming reason for this is because Medicaid eligibility is \nno longer tied exclusively to AFDC eligibility. Medicaid eligibility \nwas expanded in the late 1980's and is now tied to the national poverty \nlevel as well as to AFDC eligibility. This is an important point. \nMedicaid eligibility is higher than State AFDC eligibility. We believe \nthat children currently receiving Medicaid would not be affected by the \nchange to the AFDC Program. The minimum Federal standard is that \npregnant women, infants, and children, and children under the age of 6, \nunder 133 percent of the Federal poverty level, must be covered by \nMedicaid. Children age 6 to 13 must be covered if under 100 percent of \nthe poverty level.\n  Moreover, the General Accounting Office recently reported that 40 \nStates have already expanded Medicaid coverage to pregnant women, \ninfants, or children beyond these Federal mandates. One State has \nchosen to go as high as 300 percent of the Federal poverty level. \nThirty-two States extend coverage to pregnant women and children up to \n150 percent of the poverty level. Some States have extended coverage to \nchildren up to 19 years of age.\n  So the overwhelming evidence points to the conclusion that States are \nexpanding Medicaid eligibility, not reducing it.\n  For 3 years President Clinton has been saying that the key to getting \npeople off welfare is giving child care and Medicaid coverage. \nGovernors already know this, and that is what they are doing. But to be \non the cautious side, the bill, as amended, in committee provides for a \n1-year transition period for anyone who may lose Medicaid eligibility \nas States change AFDC into the block grants, if there is still some \nconcern that this is not enough. That is the reason that at the \nappropriate moment I will offer my amendment to grandfather in those \nindividuals currently receiving Medicaid benefits so long as they are \nstill under the poverty level.\n  Let me point out, Mr. President, that there is no difference between \nthe Chafee-Breaux amendment and my amendment in the second degree in \nregard to individuals currently receiving Medicaid. As I have already \nindicated, those individuals will continue to receive Medicaid, an \napproach which I think is, indeed, fair and equitable. The difference \nis that the Chafee-Breaux amendment applies to categories rather than \npeople. That means that someone 5 or 10 years from now may not qualify \nfor Medicaid under a State's new welfare program. Nevertheless, they \ncould claim eligibility under the old program.\n  It seems to me that this creates serious issues of inequity. I think \nit also is very burdensome to the State as it would require them to \nmaintain these eligibility standards without end. I know that the \nGovernors are deeply concerned about the Chafee-Breaux approach. They \nthink it is unduly administratively burdensome to have to maintain two \nsets of systems. It is in contrast with the purpose of this legislation \nwhich is to create flexibility as we move forward with welfare reform, \nMedicaid, and other reforms. What we hope to do is to develop the kind \nof flexibility that will enable the States to develop approaches to \nthese problems that brings some positive result. But it is hard to see \nhow requiring a State to continue indefinitely an old program as the \nChafee-Breaux amendment does. It is, indeed, hard to grasp.\n  So I hope that my good friends and colleagues, Senator Chafee and \nSenator Breaux, would look at the amendment which I intend to offer as \nsoon as all time has expired. As I said, it seems to me that this is, \nindeed, a fair and equitable approach. We are protecting those who are \ncurrently receiving Medicaid under AFDC. They will continue \nindefinitely to be eligible so long as they meet the requirements of \nAFDC. But I find it hard to see the equity, the fairness, the reason \nfor, or the principle behind that we should continue in effect old \nprograms that are going to be modified.\n  The basic purpose of welfare reform is to provide flexibility to the \nStates. We think that the Chafee-Breaux amendment is a step in the \nopposite direction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from West Virginia 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. President, I have how much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I hope Members on both sides of the \naisle will vote for this amendment offered by my colleagues from Rhode \nIsland and Louisiana, Senators Chafee and Breaux. It is the kind of \namendment that deserves strong support from this body.\n  There is absolutely no reason for welfare reform to cause innocent \nchildren to lose health insurance. We can and we should enact a bill \nthat is very tough and very clear about requiring adults to work or \nprepare for work if they want to get public assistance. But we do need \nto pass the Chafee-Breaux amendment to make sure that children who are \neligible for Medicaid do not lose their health coverage as we change \nthe welfare system. We need to pass this amendment to make sure that \nlosing health care is not the price of leaving welfare and getting a \njob.\n  Mr. President, with this amendment, we are not proposing a new \nbenefit or new spending. We are just trying to protect the way that \npoor children now can see a doctor when they're sick, get their \nvaccinations and their checkups, and receive basic medical care. Up to \n1.5 million children and 4 million parents are at serious risk of \nlosing their Medicaid coverage unless this amendment prevails.\n  Mr. President, I truly believe the American people, including West \nVirginians, want us to adopt this amendment. The public has made it \nvery clear that they expect Congress to make distinctions between \nresponsible\n\n[[Page S8347]]\n\nreform and reckless change. Americans want all children to have a \nchance in this country, and they know that health care is where that \nchance starts and lasts. You have to be healthy to learn, to grow, and \nto become productive.\n  As our constituents demand changes in welfare, they are not asking us \nto abandon children or take health care away from those who need it. In \nfact, they get pretty upset when they see Congress doing something that \nwill hurt children or health care.\n  It is counterintuitive, counterproductive, and just plain wrong to \npush the parents of poor children into the workplace, and then pull \nhealth care out from under them. The mothers who succeed in leaving \nwelfare for work are rarely going to start with jobs that offer health \ninsurance for themselves or their families. According to one study, 78 \npercent of women who worked their way off welfare ended up in jobs that \ndid not offer health insurance. Two-thirds of these women were still \nnot able to get insurance after 18 months.\n  It is cruel to ask a mother to make the choice between working and \nholding onto health insurance.\n  This amendment is the critical way we can make sure parents have \nevery reason to get a job and get off welfare--because Medicaid will be \na source of coverage for a limited amount of time, for the transition \nfrom welfare to work.\n  Congress is going to make bold changes in the welfare system. But \nplease, let's not take the country backward in this life-and-death \nissue of health care for children and their parents as they leave \nwelfare for work. It's our responsibility to deal with this part of the \nhealth care system, because unfortunately, the private sector just \nisn't there. Medicaid has to be there for them, or these families and \nchildren join the uninsured and have a much more difficult time getting \nout of the rut they're trying to escape.\n  Ask any doctor, hospital, or community--when families don't have \nhealth insurance, they end up using the emergency room as their source \nof health care. That's costly, inefficient, and burdens the health care \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, as we act on welfare reform, I hope we realize it is \nnot just about saving money. We want to promote personal \nresponsibility, the work ethic, and stronger families. The Chafee-\nBreaux amendment is a very specific way all of us in this body can make \nsure that poor families are not punished in the cruelest way, by losing \ntheir health insurance. All we want to do is to make sure basic health \ncare is still there for these children and families while we get much \ntougher about the parents getting work and getting off welfare for \ngood. I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment, which will \nmake it even more possible for low-income parents to join the work \nforce.\n  Congress decided more than 10 years ago that the Federal Government \nhad an important role in setting minimum standards of health coverage \nfor pregnant women and children. Congress voted for--and two Republican \nPresidents signed--legislation in 1986, in 1987, in 1988, in 1989, and \nin 1990 that no matter where they lived, children were guaranteed a \ndecent standard of health coverage.\n  Texas currently sets its overall eligibility for Medicaid at 18 \npercent of poverty except for pregnant women and young children \nbecause, frankly, Congress forced it and many other States to set \nhigher standards for pregnant women and children. While many of my \ncolleagues do not want to, in any way, impinge on a State's \nflexibility, there is a time and place for decent minimal standards. \nMr. President, this is the time, and this is the place. This is for \nsome of our country's neediest children.\n  Mr. President, let us not go back in time, and repeal extremely \nimportant health care protections for pregnant women and children.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to save 2 minutes for the \nSenator from Florida, who is expected. So I will save that time for \nhim.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Who yields time?\n  The time runs equally if neither side seeks recognition.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes and 20 seconds.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I will use up the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, the second-degree amendment, as I understand it, by \nthe Senator from Delaware says that all those individuals who are \ncurrently eligible for Medicaid would be eligible in the future even \nthough the eligibility standards might be lowered, and thus if a new \nperson came along, they would not be eligible for Medicaid because the \ncash assistance payments standard would have been lowered.\n  Mr. President, to me that is a very impractical proposal because what \nyou have to do is get a list of everybody who is currently, I presume, \non Medicaid, who meets the eligibility standards, and then I presume \nthat is the permanent list.\n  If somebody comes along who is at the same level, so you have two \nwomen side by side, one who qualifies because of the existing standards \nand another comes along in the future who does not quite get there by \nwhatever date this bill passes and the AFDC standards or the cash \nassistance standards have then been dropped, this other woman does not \nqualify, she and her children. She has dependent children. You might \nsay, ``Oh, no, do not worry about those children; they are taken care \nof under the 100 percent poverty.''\n  No, they are not. That is very clear--100 percent of poverty only \ncovers those under 13. Next year it will be 14 and 15. But a woman who \nhas a 15-year old child comes along, with the same financial situation \nas her neighbor, who came in time to qualify and gets it, and the \nsecond one does not, that is not very fair.\n  So I hope, Mr. President, when we come to vote on this second-degree \namendment, as I understand it and as it has been explained, it will be \nrejected, and then we can get to the Chafee-Breaux amendment as \noriginally proposed and take care of these individuals who are being \nknocked off--nonpregnant women and children 13 through 18.\n  How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes and 59 seconds.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I now call up my amendment in the second \ndegree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4932 to amendment No. 4931.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n       ``(12) Continuation of medicaid for certain low-income \n     individuals.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, a State to which a grant is made under section 403 \n     shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure that--\n       ``(i) any individual who, as of the date of the enactment \n     of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of \n     1996, is receiving medical assistance under title XIX as a \n     result of such individual's receipt of aid or assistance \n     under a State plan approved under this part (as in effect on \n     July 1, 1996), or under a State plan approved under part E \n     (as so in effect)--\n       ``(I) shall be eligible for medical assistance under the \n     State's plan approved under title XIX, so long as such \n     individual continues to meet the eligibility requirements \n     applicable to such individual under the State's plan approved \n     under this part (as in effect on July 1, 1996); and\n       ``(II) with respect to such individual, any reference in--\n       ``(aa) title XIX;\n\n[[Page S8348]]\n\n       ``(bb) any other provision of law in relation to the \n     operation of such title;\n       (cc) the State plan under such title of the State in which \n     such individual resides; or\n       ``(dd) any other provision of State law in relation to the \n     operation of such State plan under such title, to a provision \n     of this part, or a State plan under this part (or a provision \n     of such a plan), including standards and methodologies for \n     determining income and resources under this part or such \n     plan, shall be considered a reference to such a provision or \n     plan as in effect as of July 1, 1996; and\n       ``(ii) except as provided in subparagraph (B), if any \n     family becomes ineligible to receive assistance under the \n     State program funded under this part as a result of--\n       ``(I) increased earnings from employment;\n       ``(II) the collection or increased collection of child or \n     spousal support; or\n       ``(III) a combination of the matters described in \n     subclauses (I) and (II), and such family received such \n     assistance in at least 3 of the 6 months immediately \n     preceding the month in which such ineligibility begins, the \n     family shall be eligible for medical assistance under the \n     State's plan approved under title XIX during the immediately \n     succeeding 12-month period for so long as family income (as \n     defined by the State), excluding any refund of Federal income \n     taxes made by reason of section 32 of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to earned income tax credit) and any \n     payment made by an employer under section 3507 of such Code \n     (relating to advance payment of earned income credit), is \n     less than the poverty line, and that the family will be \n     appropriately notified of such eligibility.\n       ``(B) Exception.--No medical assistance may be provided \n     under subparagraph (A) to any family that contains an \n     individual who has had all or part of any assistance provided \n     under this part (as in effect on July 1, 1996, or as in \n     effect, with respect to a State, on and after the effective \n     date of chapter 1 of subtitle A of title II of the Personal \n     Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996) terminated \n     as a result of the application of--\n       ``(i) a preceding paragraph of this subsection;\n       ``(ii) section 407(e)(1); or\n       ``(iii) in the case of a family that includes an individual \n     described in clause (i) of subparagraph (A), a sanction \n     imposed under the State plan under this part (as in effect on \n     July 1, 1996).\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I have, of course, already discussed the \npurpose of my amendment. As I said, the purpose of my amendment is to \nensure Medicaid coverage to all individuals currently receiving \nMedicaid benefits because of their eligibility through the current AFDC \nprogram. As I said, this would ensure no child or adult currently \nreceiving Medicaid benefits would lose coverage because of welfare \nreform. I believe this is fair. I think it is equitable. I think it \njust makes common sense.\n  Yes, there are going to be changes in the future. That is the reason \nwe are providing for welfare reform. Hopefully, at a later stage we \nwill have Medicaid reform. I personally thought it was a mistake to \nseparate the two reforms because they are interrelated. But it makes no \nsense to me, when we are trying to provide greater flexibility to the \nGovernors, to require that two sets or systems of eligibility be \nmaintained if a State changes the welfare program under TANF.\n  As far as the administrative burdens are concerned, I would say to my \ngood friend from Rhode Island, that his plan, too, will require the \nmaintenance of two books. The difference is that in time ours will \nbecome less important.\n  But I hope the sponsors of the basic amendment will review and look \nat my proposal, as I believe it is an approach that does provide for \nequity in that it guarantees all those who are currently receiving \nMedicaid benefits under AFDC would continue to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, do I understand we have 15 minutes on the \nnew amendment? Is that the proposal? I guess there was never any time \nagreement, was there?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For the second-degree amendment there is 1 \nhour equally divided, controlled half an hour on each side.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I will just take a couple of minutes.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me we have to make up our minds around \nhere. Are we dealing with Medicaid reform or are we not? The ground \nrules were--what we did in the Finance Committee, we dealt with \nwelfare, we dealt with Medicaid. Then we came to the floor and we \ndropped off the Medicaid provisions.\n  Now what we are trying to do, it seems to me, in a back-door way, is \nmake very severe changes in Medicaid without us considering it a \nMedicaid bill. If we are dealing with Medicaid we get into all kind of \ndifferent things. We get into the Boland amendment and matters we dealt \nwith in the Finance Committee. But that is not the approach.\n  Yes, it was very clear, we are severing the two: Welfare is here, \nMedicaid is here; we are dropping Medicaid off and sticking with \nwelfare. Yet in one fell swoop here, because of the eligibility \nstandards of AFDC, or cash assistance, Medicaid goes along with it. And \nyou have to be very, very careful then. When you have dropped the major \nMedicaid portions of the bill, what are you going to do about this \ngroup that loses their Medicaid coverage, the ones I am talking about? \nIt does not do any good to say that is all right, we will take care of \nthose on the list now. What about in the future? Are we going to let a \nState just drop right down on its cash assistance way below the levels \nthey are not permitted to go now--which is May 1, 1988--and then go \nright down? OK, that is welfare reform. We say if they are 38 percent \nof poverty on May 1, 1988, if they want to go down to 15 percent of \npoverty, all right. That is welfare reform. But they should not, the \nindividuals should not lose their Medicaid coverage in those changes. \nThat is the problem with the second-degree amendment that was presented \nhere.\n\n  We will have a chance to visit more on this, I presume. I do not know \nwhat the arrangement is for Tuesday. I suppose we will go right into \nthe votes. Maybe a minute or 2 minutes equally divided and an \nexplanation of some type, as we have done here today. I might say, as \nyou know all, the amendments we voted on today and were debated last \nevening, all were under an arrangement of no second-degree amendments. \nToday is different, apparently. So the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee came forward with a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. President, I would like, on my time, to ask the chairman of the \nFinance Committee if I am correct in believing that you could end up \nwith a situation where you have two similar individuals, let us say \nwomen on welfare currently. Let us just look ahead a year from now. \nUnder this proposal, you could find one individual currently receiving \nMedicaid coverage and another individual in exactly the same position--\nexactly, children the same age, earned income exactly the same, welfare \nbenefits exactly the same. One would be entitled to Medicaid coverage \nand one would not be, because that second woman is not on the rolls \ncurrently? Am I correct in that? I ask the distinguished chairman of \nthe Finance Committee.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Rhode Island, that \nis correct. What we have provided here is a transition rule, trying to \nease the change by providing that all women and children who are \ncurrently receiving Medicaid benefits because of AFDC programs will \ncontinue to do so. But, to answer him directly, yes, that is true for a \nyear from now and it will be true 5 years from now. It would be true 10 \nyears from now.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if I am also correct in suggesting that, under \nthe proposal of the Senator from Delaware, under his second-degree \namendment, you could have a situation where the woman is on the rolls \nnow and therefore she is Medicaid eligible. Then suppose she goes off \nas a result of earnings. Can that individual come back on if her \nearnings fall below the earnings limitation? Yes, fall below, so she \nwould be eligible once again for cash assistance? Would she get \nMedicaid?\n  Mr. ROTH. Once people go off the rolls, their eligibility in the \nfuture would depend upon the new program. So they would not go back on \nthe basis of AFDC.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. So it seems to me that an individual who is locked in \nunder the present system, as suggested by the second-degree amendment, \nthat individual would make a great mistake to get off Medicaid, \nbecause, let's say, the eligibility was dropped and they would not \ncurrently qualify. So the key thing is to stay on Medicaid, do not get \noff.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Sure.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I do not think that would be correct. If the person is \nno longer eligible for AFDC, what you are\n\n[[Page S8349]]\n\nsuggesting is they should keep working in a low-wage job just for the \npurposes of keeping Medicaid and not try to get a promotion where you \ncan get benefits and other kinds of things. I am not sure that would be \na logical economic move for somebody.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I am sorry, did I miss a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I said, what you are suggesting is that someone who is \nno longer on AFDC but is Medicaid eligible because of this \ngrandfathering is not going to have an incentive to take a better job, \npotentially with benefits, potentially with opportunities for greater \nadvancement, because if they come into a situation where they lose that \njob, they would not be able to get back on Medicaid. I am looking at \nsomeone making an economically rational decision. To me that would not \nbe an economically rational decision.\n  I think the grandfathering does take care of that situation, and if \nthat mother does have a problem and falls back on AFDC, she is then \neligible for Medicaid again. I do not think I see the problem that the \nSenator from Rhode Island has put forward.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is not the testimony that we had before the Finance \nCommittee. The testimony we had was very clear that the Medicaid \nsituation is a big factor, not just for the adult, but for the children \nlikewise. It affects people's behavior.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. These are people who are not on AFDC anymore. These are \npeople who are working, because if they were on AFDC, they would be \nincluded under the new program.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. What we are talking about here are two different \nstandards. Let's say under current law, somebody is eligible for AFDC. \nAutomatically that individual gets Medicaid. In the welfare reform bill \nthat we have before us, we are saying to the States, ``You're not bound \nby that May 1988 level. You can go below that, if you want.''\n  OK, that is fine, we all agree with that. That is what we voted on. \nBut let's say the May 1988 levels were in the State 50 percent of the \npoverty level, and the State decides, ``We're going to get tougher on \nwelfare eligibility. We're going to make it so you can't get it if you \nare above 38 percent of the poverty level.''\n  Under the Roth proposal, he is saying, ``That is right, you drop it \ndown, but if you are currently receiving Medicaid at the 50 percent \nlevel, that is all right, forget the 38 percent, you are taken care \nof.''\n  What I am saying is that that person who now is covered is going to \nbe very, very reluctant to get off Medicaid and take a job, because \nthat person cannot get back on, according to the information I received \nfrom the manager of the bill.\n  Mr. ROTH. Inherent in what the Senator from Rhode Island is saying is \nthat the Governors, in developing new programs, are inherently going to \nshortchange those on welfare. The fact is, and as you know, in the \nFinance Committee, it was clearly shown that much of the spending in \nwelfare, Medicaid and other programs is beyond what is required by the \nFederal Government. In fact, I think in the case of Medicaid, they were \nspending more than 50 percent on a voluntary basis.\n\n  So I think it is wrong to assume necessarily that the programs that \nare going to be developed under TANF are going to be less desirable.\n  Let me say, a family could increase earnings and drop off AFDC but \nstill be eligible for Medicaid if less than 100 percent of poverty. So \nthere are alternatives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I am ready to yield my time back, if the manager of the \nbill is ready to yield his back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, \nwill be recognized to offer his amendment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I did not say I yielded my time back, I said ``ready to \nyield my time back.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair misunderstood.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. So I still have time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 26 minutes; the other side has \n18 minutes.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4933 to Amendment No. 4931\n\n (Purpose: To maintain current eligibility standards for medicaid and \n                 provide additional State flexibility)\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I do now yield back my time, and send a \nperfecting amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], for himself, \n     Mr. Breaux, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Graham, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kerrey, \n     Mr. Hatfield, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n     Reid, and Mr. Rockefeller, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4933 to amendment No. 4931.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, I am proud to be joined by my colleague, \nSenator Jeffords, the distinguished occupant of the Chair, Senators \nKerrey, Leahy, Murray, and Reid in offering an amendment to preserve \nour Nation's Food Stamp Program by eliminating the food stamp block \ngrant.\n  This is one of the most important issues in the pending welfare \nreform legislation. Members in this Chamber and people around the \ncountry often talk of the need for a real bipartisan effort to reform \nour welfare system. Our amendment is a true bipartisan undertaking.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues will consider the amendment and the \nbenefits it will provide for our Nation's children and elderly, our \ncities and our rural areas. Block granting the Food Stamp Program is a \nmistake for this country. I am confident that if my colleagues give \ncareful consideration to the Food Stamp Program, how it works, who it \nserves, and how it was developed, that they will vote for our \namendment.\n  I want to make clear to my colleagues and others who are watching \nwhat this amendment is about. It is about providing food to hungry \npeople. That is what is at issue. This amendment is about making \ncertain that hungry people are fed. That is the most basic test of the \nfundamental decency of any society. Are hungry people fed? This \namendment provides the answer. It says that in America hungry people \nwill not go without food.\n  Mr. President, I want to make clear at the outset that the cost of \nour amendment is fully offset over the 6-year budget period. This \namendment reduces the standard deduction in order to provide the \nrevenue necessary to pay for the amendment. With our amendment, the \nAgriculture Committee will still be in full compliance with its budget \nreconciliation target.\n  Mr. President, the Food Stamp Program is the anchor for our Nation's \nnutritional safety net. The program developed from a decision by \nCongress that no child, indeed no person, in our wealthy country with \nits abundant food supply should go hungry.\n  My colleagues will remember that former Senator Dole, the apparent \nRepublican Presidential nominee, was a leader in this effort. So, too, \nwas former Senator George McGovern, a former Democratic Presidential \nnominee. In fact, we ought to wish former Senator McGovern a happy \nbirthday because this is Senator McGovern's birthday today.\n  So we had a fully bipartisan effort that formed the Food Stamp \nProgram. It remains a valid goal for our country and for those of us in \nthis Chamber who share with our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives and the President of the United States the \nresponsibility for making these decisions.\n  My colleagues should know that fully 51 percent of food stamp \nrecipients are children, 7 percent are elderly, and 9 percent are \ndisabled.\n  To further illustrate, I have brought with me this chart indicating \nthe distribution of food stamp benefits to households. And 82 percent \nof food stamp households are households with children. This chart shows \nthat. Now, 82 percent of the food stamp eligible households in this \ncountry are households with children. Only 18 percent are without \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, I want to make clear, we are defending the basic \nnotion of a Food Stamp Program. That does not mean that we are not \nsupportive of changes to reform the Food Stamp Program, to improve its \nimplementation and to save money, because this bill has substantial \nsavings out of the Food Stamp Program, over $20 billion.\n\n  We are not affecting those savings. But we are saying, do not block \ngrant the Food Stamp Program. Do not do that. That is a mistake for \nthis country. And it will fundamentally undermine the Food Stamp \nProgram and the nutritional safety net that it provides.\n  Mr. President, currently every child who needs food is eligible for \nfood stamps. Under a block grant, a State would have no obligation to \nprovide benefits to children--none, no obligation to provide for \nchildren. There are no standards whatsoever regarding who should \nreceive benefits or how much in benefits they should receive under the \nbill we have before us.\n  Mr. President, block granting the Food Stamp Program would tear a \nhole in the safety net that makes certain 14 million children do not go \nto bed hungry at night or do not go to school with hunger pains. This \nis what preserving our Nation's Food Stamp Program is about. And these \nare the people we place at risk by block granting the Food Stamp \nProgram and eliminating the food safety net.\n  The Food Stamp Program, as my colleagues know well, is a carefully \ncrafted program that has a tremendously impressive history of \nresponding to economic fluctuations in our country and changes in child \nand adult poverty levels. The Food Stamp Program has been successful in \nfighting hunger because it automatically covers more people when \neconomic downturns or natural disasters push more Americans below the \npoverty line.\n  Block granting the Food Stamp Program would eliminate this automatic \nresponse to increases in poverty that the current program provides. I \nhave brought two charts which illustrate the Food Stamp Program's \nresponsiveness to fluctuations in poverty.\n  The first is a chart that shows from 1979 to 1993 how the Food Stamp \nProgram responded directly to changes in the overall poverty rate. My \ncolleagues can see the red line shows the poverty population in this \ncountry. The blue line shows food stamp participation. As poverty rates \nhave changed, as the incidence of poverty has changed, one can see that \nthe food stamp participation rate has moved in tandem with it. In other \nwords, responding directly to increases in poverty.\n\n[[Page S8351]]\n\n  The second chart is perhaps more compelling to those who think the \nFederal Government should protect kids but are less sympathetic to \ntheir parents. This chart illustrates how the Food Stamp Program \nresponds to changes in the child poverty rate. Again, the red line \nshows increases in the child poverty rate from 1979 through 1993. \nAgain, the food stamp participation rate tracks closely with it. Make \nno mistake, the Food Stamp Program is the most important part of our \narsenal to fight the battle against poverty in America.\n  This responsiveness, the responsiveness of the Food Stamp Program to \neconomic fluctuations, led the National Governors' Association and the \ndrafters of this welfare bill to improve the AFDC block grant \ncontingency fund trigger by basing it on an increase in food stamp \nparticipation.\n  Mr. President, it does not make sense to turn around and block grant \nthe program and eliminate the program's ability to respond to dramatic \nchanges caused by economic downturns or natural disasters. It makes no \nsense to take away that automatic stabilizer that is a central feature \nof the Food Stamp Program.\n  Again, this does not mean we cannot make changes in the Food Stamp \nProgram. We can. We should. We should achieve additional savings, and \nwe will. This amendment does not affect those changes and those \nsavings.\n  A block grant with limited funding cannot respond to changes in \npoverty levels, nor can it respond to a severe economic downturn or to \na natural disaster. The need for a State to help its children, elderly, \nand working families, would come precisely at a time when the State's \neconomy is least able to support increased food assistance \nexpenditures.\n  Let me just share with my colleagues the example from the State of \nFlorida, because I think it is most instructive. I want to make clear \nthis is not a question of Governors or States being mean-spirited or \nwanting to limit food stamps in a time of need. We are not questioning \nhere the good faith of our Nation's Governors. We are not questioning \nthe good faith of our Nation's State legislators. This is a question of \neconomic reality. There simply is no way for any State to accurately \nplan in advance for dramatic increases in food aid required by severe \neconomic downturns or natural disasters.\n  Governor Chiles of Florida gave testimony at the Senate agriculture \nhearing on nutrition in May of last year that illustrated this point. \nHe included a chart with his testimony which outlined Florida's food \nstamp participation benefits from October 1987 to January 1995. I have \nbrought the chart of Governor Chiles because I think it can help \nMembers understand why block granting the Food Stamp Program could have \nunintended consequences we would all regret.\n  The way the food stamp block grant is structured in the bill before \nthe Senate, a State is required to decide several months before the \nbeginning of the next fiscal year if it wants to exercise the block \ngrant option. A State would then be bound to its decision for the \nremainder of the fiscal year. Therein lies the problem, Mr. President.\n  We will look at the chart from Florida that Governor Chiles \npresented. From October 1987 to October 1989, we can see the demand for \nfood stamps in Florida was level. No block grant demands were \nincreasing. They were basically stable. So a Governor could have felt \nconfident that his or her State would have been better off with the \nblock grant and would not put anyone at risk of going hungry if they \nwere basing that on the experience of 1987 to 1989.\n  However, from October 1989 to mid-1992, there was a national \nrecession, and Florida's food stamp caseload exploded. One can see how \nthe food stamp caseload just went up on almost a straight line in the \nState of Florida. No block grant could have responded to the increase \nin families that needed food stamps in Florida during this time. No \nState would be able to predict or prepare for this dramatic growth in \ndemand for food assistance.\n  That was not the end of the story in Florida because we will recall \nthe testimony of Governor Chiles. Then the big one hit, a natural \ndisaster. The natural disaster was Hurricane Andrew, and its \ndevastating blow was felt all across Florida. The sharp increase in \ndemand for food aid help in September 1992 shows the impact of \nHurricane Andrew. A block grant could not have responded to the \nimmediate and massive need for food created by this natural disaster.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a central point with respect to this \namendment. If we adopt a circumstance in which a State must commit to a \nflat amount of funding, a flat block grant amount for food stamps, and \nthen that State is hit by either an economic downturn, impossible to \npredict, or a natural disaster, again, impossible to predict, and the \ndemand for food aid skyrockets as it did in Florida, the need for food \nfor that State's children and for other people could not and would not \nbe met.\n  Mr. President, Florida is not alone. Natural disasters hit nearly \nevery State in the last year, from a drought in Texas to flooding in \nMissouri, to earthquakes in California. We all know the litany of \nnatural disasters over the last several years. Are we really going to \nabandon the children in those States to a flat amount of funding for \nfood stamps with no ability to adjust for an economic downturn or a \nnatural disaster? I think not. I think America is better than that. The \nNational Food Stamp Program should respond to the needs of families \nthat temporarily need food during these times of crisis.\n  As a matter of fact, using almost exactly the same formula as is in \nthe current welfare proposal, the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nestimated if a block grant proposal had been enacted in 1990, in 1994 \nevery State would have fallen short of the funding needed to provide \nfood aid for their children. Choose any State and children would have \nsuffered.\n  Mr. President, the case for this amendment does not end there. The \nobligation that is in the bill before the Senate could destroy the Food \nStamp Program. I believe we have a strong national interest in ensuring \nthat children and other vulnerable members of our society do not go \nhungry. Others may argue this is a State option, that the decision to \ntake the risk that children go hungry should be left to each State.\n  It is not that simple, Mr. President. The block grant option contains \nwithin it the potential to destroy the National Food Stamp Program. \nThat is because if States opt for the block grant, their \nrepresentatives no longer have a stake in the Federal program. They \ncould vote for deep cuts in the Food Stamp Program without any adverse \nimpact on their States or districts.\n  Mr. President, I believe the underlying bill has in it the seeds of \nthe destruction of the Food Stamp Program. Too many of us have labored \nfor too long on a bipartisan basis to make certain that if people are \nhungry in this country, they have a chance of being fed, to allow that \nto happen.\n  I also want to emphasize there is a different rationale for block \ngranting the AFDC Program than the Food Stamp Program. We have heard \nmany calls for block granting the AFDC Program. That has a certain \nlogic to it. Many States have indicated their desire to block grant the \nAFDC Program in order to make better use of the significant number of \nState dollars that are spent on the AFDC Program. States may also want \nblock grants for AFDC, in the hope of eventually achieving savings at \nthe State level. These arguments do not apply to the Food Stamp Program \nbecause it is a Federal program. Food stamp benefits are fully funded \nby the Federal Government. There is no State match. There is no State \nmaintenance of effort requirement.\n\n  Mr. President, I also want to address the issue of State flexibility. \nI firmly believe that real welfare reform requires greatly increased \nState flexibility. I introduced an entire welfare reform package of my \nown, which provided for a dramatic increase in tax flexibility. That \nmade sense. I have already explained why a block grant approach to food \nstamps is bad policy and completely undermines the benefits and \nintegrity of the Food Stamp Program.\n  I know, however, that there are those in this Chamber who support the \nblock grants solely on the basis of supporting anything that increases \nState flexibility. I will address this issue because it is important. \nWithout the block grant, the welfare bill before us makes the\n\n[[Page S8352]]\n\nbiggest steps to expand State flexibility in operating the Food Stamp \nProgram that the program has experienced in two decades. States will \nhave broad, new authority to simplify food stamp rules and develop \ntheir own policies to promote work and responsibility. That is as it \nshould be.\n  States will have broad, new flexibility to streamline food stamp \nbenefits to coordinate with their application of benefits under the \nAFDC block grant. They have the option to convert food stamp benefits \nto wage subsidies, and the option to determine if they want to provide \nbenefits to people who are delinquent in child support payments. States \nalso have almost complete flexibility to structure programs to promote \nemployment and self-sufficiency and to impose strict work requirements.\n  Federal rules impeding implementation of State electronic benefit \ntransfer systems would be eliminated under the current bill, as would a \nlarge number of provisions which micromanage food stamp administration. \nWe do not change any of that, Mr. President. That dramatically \nincreased State flexibility is completely preserved under the amendment \nwe are offering. I understand and support the need for State \nflexibility. But, as I have already pointed out, this is a Federal \nprogram, part of a national commitment to ensure that children and \nvulnerable Americans do not go hungry. And it works. We here in the \nSenate have a responsibility to ensure that Federal tax dollars applied \nto the Food Stamp Program succeed in fulfilling this commitment. We \nshould not use the doctrine of State flexibility to put millions of \nAmerican children and seniors at risk of going to bed hungry at night. \nWe are a better nation than that. We are a better people than that. We \nare a better Senate than that.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in saying that, in America, the \nhungry will be fed.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair. First, let me say, Mr. President, \nthat we have had votes on block grants here in the Senate in the past. \nWe had one on the bill last year. In fact, when it came out of the \nAgriculture Committee, there was no block grant. The block grant was \noffered here on the floor of the Senate and was passed in the Senate. \nIt was included in the welfare reform bill that was passed here in the \nSenate. It was included in the bill that passed originally, as I said \nbefore, in the Senate, which passed 87 to 12. The Senator from \nNorth Dakota voted for that, as well as other provisions in the bill. \nThe block grant included in the Senate bill--\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. If the Senator will yield, I would like to correct the \nRecord. The Senator from North Dakota did not vote for the block grant. \nThe Senator from North Dakota voted against the block grant. But when a \nSenator is presented with the question of supporting the overall bill, \nthat is a different question.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It was included in the Senate bill, which passed 87 to \n12 here, in the reconciliation bill, and in the welfare bill that was \nvetoed by the President. In fact, the block grant provision that is in \nthis bill actually has a lot higher hurdles for States to jump over to \nget a block grant, because in the bill that originally came through \nhere, there was a requirement in the original Senate bill that 85 \npercent of the money be spent on food.\n  In this bill, 94 percent of the money has to be spent on food stamp \naid. So States have a higher requirement. In this bill, you can get a \nblock grant only if you have EBT, electronic benefits transfer, a \ncomputerized way of providing food stamps. In the other bill, there was \nno such electronic benefits transfer.\n  In this bill, you have to meet one of these criteria to get in. An \nerror rate of under 6 percent. The national error rate is between 9 and \n10 percent. So you have to have a pretty good error rate to be able to \nqualify for a block grant. There are only a few States who qualify--\nMassachusetts, Alabama, Kentucky, Arkansas, Louisiana, South Dakota, \nand the Virgin Islands. Maryland, Texas, and South Carolina qualify for \nelectronic benefits transfer. If you have an error rate above 6 \npercent, you have to use State dollars to, in fact, pay down the error \nrate to make up the difference--obviously, an expense of the States.\n  So we have a much higher standard here of qualifying, and the \nstandard is set for the purpose of making sure that the States that do \ntake a block grant either have a technologically advanced program like \nelectronic benefits transfer, where you get the debit card instead of \nthe stamps, which you then use to purchase your food, or you have a \ngood system which has a low error rate. I think when you consider the \nfact that only 7 jurisdictions out of the 50-some that we have \nreceiving these programs have such a low error rate, I think we have \nset the standard pretty high here. So this is not an easy thing that \nlots of States are going to jump into. Most States will not qualify for \nthese block grants. So we believe we have set an appropriate standard.\n  The Senator from South Dakota talked about the Florida rate and how \nit was going along at a nice rate, and then jumped up, and they got \ncaught and they were stuck. Well, as the Senator from North Dakota \nknows, they are not stuck. Under this bill, as under the previous block \ngrant proposals, the Governor and legislature of Florida can opt in, \nbut they can also opt out. It is a one-time thing. You stay in, or when \nyou go out, you are out forever. If they do not want to swim in the \npond and do not like the water temperature, they can get out. They \nwould have to sit on the beach and watch. They had their chance to \nswim. We think that is fair and that gives an adequate chance for \nStates who run into difficult situations.\n  This is certainly a safety valve for a State that might find itself \nin some sort of cataclysmic situation. The other things we allow States \nto do, which is positive, is to take the money that they have had--I \ncannot see the exact years on the chart, but say they had 3 or 4 good \nyears, where it was perking along at a low rate, and because we have \ngiven them a block grant, they do not have to comply with all the bells \nand whistles that we require in Washington; they can run their own \nprogram. As most Governors told me, they can run it a heck of a lot \nmore efficiently than we make them run it out of Washington. So let us \nassume--and I do not think it is unreasonable to assume this--if the \nfood stamp rate stays the same and we are giving increases in funding, \nthen they would be able to save money. We allow them to keep up to 10 \npercent of the total amount that they--I will rephrase that. If they do \nnot spend all of the money that has been allocated to them in the block \ngrant, and they spend, let us say 95 percent of it, well, the 5 percent \nthey do not spend they can put in a fund and carry it over. They can \ncarry over up to 10 percent every year, and up to 30 percent of an \nannual allocation, which means they can have a rainy day fund here to \ntake care of situations where you have that little spike because of a \nhurricane or something like that. That is what prudent State planners \nshould do when it comes to these kinds of programs. We provide for that \nin this bill.\n\n  So we think that there are adequate safeguards there for these kinds \nof spikes in benefits. The Senator also said there is no maintenance of \neffort provision. Under the current Food Stamp Program, 50 percent of \nthe administrative costs are paid for by the Federal Government, and 50 \npercent are paid for by the State government.\n  They said we do not require them to maintain their effort; in other \nwords, require them to pick up 50 percent of the cost. That is true and \nit is not true. Specifically, do we require them to pick up the effort? \nNo. But what we say, as I referred to earlier, is that now 94 percent \nof the money they get must go for food stamps; 6 percent is \nadministrative. What is the average administrative cost for the Food \nStamp Program today? Coincidentally, 12 percent. What does that mean? \nThat means that 6 percent now is going to be federally funded. That is \nthe 6 percent you can use for administrative costs, and, if they want \nto continue their spending at a rate of 12 percent for administrative \ncosts, who is going to pick up the other 6 percent? The State with \nState funds. No, we do not specifically say you have to maintain \neffort. But we give you only half of the money you would normally use \nto administer the program. So, if they can do a better job\n\n[[Page S8353]]\n\nadministering the program, if they get from 12 percent down to 10 \npercent, we say you can keep the savings, and you can use State dollars \nfor the savings.\n  I do not think that is a bad thing. I think if they can reduce their \nadministrative costs they should get the benefit of reducing those \ncosts.\n  So we have set up a system that says we want to give you the \nopportunity, if you think you can run this program better than we can, \nif you think you can feed more people, if you think you can do it more \nefficiently, we are going to give you the opportunity. When you do \nthat, you have to submit a plan to HHS. They have to get approval. You \nhave to say in that plan how you are going to serve a specific \npopulation. As you know, when we submit plans here, as we had this \ndiscussion earlier today about getting waivers approved by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, that is not an easy thing to \ndo sometimes.\n  So we put hurdles in place to make sure that these plans are adequate \nto serve the needs of hungry people in the respective States, and we \nrequire them to maintain a quality control program, and, frankly, you \nknow that just makes sense. So we have adequate controls in there to \nmake sure this is a good plan for the people of the State. We give them \nthe option to do it. If they have a bad year, or some doom on the \nhorizon, they can get out. So we give them the flexibility to get out. \nWe give them the opportunity to save money on administrative costs by \nputting in a better system, and we set standards so they have to either \nbe technologically advanced like an EBT system--that is a much more \nefficient system to get into this program in the first place--or they \nhave to have lower error rates, which means they have to have a well-\nrun program to get in here.\n  So, I believe we have come up with a plan here that provides adequate \nsafeguards for the hungry in those respective States, gives States an \nincentive to be innovative, to be efficient, to provide actually more \nand better food services to the people in their State, and in the end \nprovide the safety valve for States that might find themselves in the \nsituation which Florida found themselves in with an escape hatch, a \none-time escape hatch in the bill.\n  So, I think what this bill has done is it has taken what was--\nfrankly, no offense to the author--a relatively crude Food Stamp Block \nProgram that was offered here on the floor and has been refined through \nconference because some of these cases are made in the conference bill, \nand additionally refined by the Agriculture Committee, which the \nSenator from North Dakota and I both sit on. As you know, excellent \nwork comes out of that committee. We have refined it, and now we are at \nthe point where I suggest we have a fairly solid, responsible program \nthat is going to be limited in impact because of the limitation of \nStates and their ability to get in here and have adequate safeguards to \nmake sure that not only people who are in this program are fed, but \nthat States that run into problems can get out.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, our colleague from Pennsylvania has not \nonly misplaced me by putting me in South Dakota--I represent North \nDakota----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I apologize. I am sorry.\n  Mr. CONRAD. But also misplacing his argument as well. The simple \nreality is Florida did not get advance notice of Hurricane Andrew. \nNobody called up the Governor and said, when he would have had to make \nthe decision under this bill to opt in and take the block grant that, \n``Hey, Governor, 9 months from now you are going to be hit by a \nhurricane.'' You know, if the Governor would have looked back to the \npattern back in 1987 to 1989, any Governor might have concluded it is a \nsafe bet to go with a block grant.\n  The problem is people do not have advance notice of an economic \ndownturn. That is what happened here. They do not have advance notice \nof an actual disaster. That is what happened here. All the opt in and \nopt out would not have done them a bit of good in Florida. When these \nhungry people showed up, these were not people who have been on the \nwelfare rolls for 10 years, these were not people who did not work. \nThese are people who were hit by a natural disaster and needed food. \nThe State of Florida would not have been able to provide it under a \nblock grant.\n  Is that what we want to do in this country? I think not.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me conclude.\n  We want a plan and a program that is going to assure us, as the Food \nStamp Program does now, that if people are hungry, if they have been \nhit by a sharp economic downturn and a natural disaster, that they are \ngoing to have a chance to be fed.\n  Let me just say, with respect to the notion of opt in and opt out, \nthat you have a one-time opt out here; one time. Does that mean Florida \nis never going to be hit by another natural disaster? Does that mean \nthat Florida is never going to be hit again by an economic downturn?\n  Mr. President, this is not well-crafted. This is not well thought \nthrough. It goes right to the heart of the Food Stamp Program. More \nimportantly, it goes right to the heart of the question in America: Are \nwe going to make sure that hungry people are fed?\n  I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, in response to the last assertion that \nFlorida would not be hit by another natural disaster if Florida opts \nout of a block grant, in the Federal entitlement program they are \ncovered under the existing Food Stamp Program.\n  I do not understand why the opt out is such a bad idea. The fact is \nthat what you want to accomplish is to put them back into the main \nprogram.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I may say to my colleague, the opt out is not just a \nbad idea. What is a bad idea is the opt in because once you have opted \nin you are stuck for that year. You are stuck. Florida would have been \nstuck. They would not have been able to feed these people who are \nhungry. The problem is the opt in.\n\n  That is what this amendment seeks to say. It says, ``Look, we are not \ngoing to have a program that endangers children. We are not going to \nhave a program that endangers people who are vulnerable.''\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that this is a circumstance in which we \nshould all understand that half of the States are eligible immediately, \nI am told under this bill, to go under the Block Grant Program; 40 \nwould be eligible within 2 years. This is not some narrow, finely \ncrafted amendment. This is a wholesale assault on the Food Stamp \nProgram. That is what this is.\n  I do not think that is what this Senate ought to be doing. I do not \nthink that is what this Congress ought to be doing.\n  Further, there is no guarantee under this legislation that protects \nchildren who are now eligible. There is no individual guarantee to \nchildren in this legislation. And most serious of all, there is \nabsolutely no protection for a State that is hit by a natural disaster \nor a sharp economic downturn. That is the reality of the underlying \nlegislation.\n  I do not think we want to take that risk with America's kids. I do \nnot think we want to take that risk with the States that may face \nsomething they are wholly unprepared for.\n  What is going to happen in California? What if California opted in \nand decided in July of a year that the next year they were going to be \nblock granted? They are going to take a set amount of money for food \nstamps. And then California has the big one, has a huge earthquake, and \nmillions of people are displaced and hungry, and they show up at \nFederal centers looking for food assistance. Are we really going to \nhave a system that says that we are sorry, California is out of money; \nyou just are going to have to go hungry, and maybe you can go over to \nNevada and find some food over there?\n  This is not well thought through, this provision of block granting \nfood stamps. We ought to make this change, the change that is contained \nin this amendment.\n  I say to my friend that he has established a new standard. The \nstandard here is it is good because it passed the Senate sometime in \nthe past, or that it is acceptable because it passed the Senate \nsometime in the past. That is a new standard. I do not think that is \nthe standard we want to apply in judging whether or not legislation is \nwell-crafted.\n  I am afraid all too often things that have passed this Chamber, \nperhaps even things that passed the other\n\n[[Page S8354]]\n\nChamber, are things that need a lot more work. And that is why we have \noffered this amendment on a bipartisan basis.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, from the numbers that I have, I have \nfour States that would be eligible for block grant under the EBT \nprovision, seven States would be under the error rate of under 6 \npercent. That is out of 53 jurisdictions that are eligible for the \nprogram. So I have 11 jurisdictions of 53 that would be eligible today, \nnot 40.\n  Now, I will say that all 53 jurisdictions are eligible, if the States \nare willing to pay down the error rate. That would be unlikely, we \nsuspect, for any jurisdiction that would want to put up money, State \nmoney in advance to get a Federal block grant. So what we are looking \nat here is 11 States today.\n  Now, the Senator from North Dakota may be anticipating a lot more \nStates going on with electronic benefits transfer, and I know that is \nbeing worked on in several States, but as we speak right now we are \nlooking at 11 jurisdictions. So this is not opening the floodgates by \nany stretch of the imagination.\n  What the Senator also has talked about is the State of Florida being \nstuck if, in fact, they get hit with a bad economy and on top of that, \nin the case of Florida, a natural disaster.\n  I suggest that if the Senator from North Dakota looks at his chart, \nhe will see several--I cannot tell the months or years, but an extended \nperiod of time where the rate did not go up, the number of people on \nfood stamps did not go up. As I said before, under our program, States \nwould be able to save a portion of the money, up to 10 percent of the \nannual block grant, and let it go into next year. So they could build \nup a rainy day fund or a reserve fund for bad times.\n  Now, if you look at the Florida example, and let us say Florida is \none of those States that is a little skittish and wanted to get out, \nbefore Hurricane Andrew there looked to be a substantial period of time \nwhere benefits were increasing fairly dramatically prior to the \nhurricane. So they certainly would have had ample notice of a rising \nfood stamp roll and been able to get out, if they were concerned, well \nbefore the hurricane.\n  That is just using Florida's example. They would have been able to \nget out during the period of economic downturn, but I think what is \nmore important is that they are able to plan for this by taking the \ngood times--and we have, as in most capitalist economies, economic \nbusiness cycles. During the good times, they can save some money, and \nduring the bad times, they can draw down that surplus.\n  The Senator from North Dakota also indicated that they would not be \nable to pay these people benefits; they would run out of money. Well, \nthe Senator knows that hurricane, I think, occurred sometime in the \nsummer, which is only halfway through the year.\n\n  At that point, they still have half the block grant left. They could \nmove that funding forward and fill that need and then come in at the \nend, I would suspect, with State dollars to make sure they get to the \nend of the year. The State can always put up their own money to fill \nthe need and, in fact, having created a plan which creates an \nentitlement for food stamps, they would be required to come up with \ntheir own money. Then they have to make the decision, as I said before, \nwhether they want to continue a program that puts them at some sort of \nrisk. My feeling is that is a decision for the States to make.\n  But to suggest that the State will have no money to pay people food \nstamps is just not accurate. They will have the money. It will be their \nown money, not the block grant. But that is the choice they make. The \nGovernors and State legislators are not stupid. They know there are \ngood times and there are bad times, there are natural disasters, and on \nbalance they are going to make a decision that they can run a program \nso much better than we let them run it today that, given all these \nexigencies, and they know they exist, they are going to run a better \nprogram and save money in the process.\n  That is a decision we leave up to them to make. We trust the \nGovernors in the State. We trust State legislators to be able to sit \ndown and rationally come up with a decision, that they want to take \nresponsibility for this because they can do it better and serve the \nneeds of their people better. I want to give people the option to do \nit, but there are sufficient safeguards that they have a good program \nto start, which is why these hurdles are in place, and that they have a \ngood plan and that they implement it, which is why we require HHS \napproval. And if they screw up, frankly, they have a chance to get out.\n  So we make them have a good plan to start. We require them to submit \na good plan to continue, and if they end up having a lousy plan, they \ncan get out. That, to me, is as well thought out as you can possibly \nget and is as flexible as you can possibly get for an opportunity for \nStates to take control of this very important program that feeds \nmillions of people.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The problem with the argument of the Senator from \nPennsylvania is that it is wholly focused on what is in the interest of \nthe State government. What he forgets about is who we are trying to \nserve here. We are talking about hungry people. He is worried about \nwhat happens to the structure of the State government. I am worried \nabout what happens to the people who are hungry in that State if the \nState officials make this mistake.\n  Let us go back to the example of Florida. From 1987 to 1989, their \ncaseload was flat. Then they had economic downturn and the caseload \nstarted to explode. They did not have advance warning of an economic \ndownturn. More clearly, they did not have warning of what happened here \nwhere we see the spike in demand for food aid for people caused by a \nnatural disaster. They would have had to make the decision to go to the \nblock grant under this proposal back here in July of the previous year.\n  Now, unless they were prophetic, they might have thought if they had \na pattern like they saw back in 1987 to 1989, it was safe to take a \nblock grant. But then if they would have had a natural disaster like \nAndrew, what would have happened to the people who were hungry that \nlined up for help? The Senator says, well, the State could have put in \ntheir money. That is at the very time the State is having to put their \nmoney into every other part of this disaster.\n\n  You go find out about the budget of the State of Florida during this \nperiod. They were under enormous stress because of the combination of \neconomic downturn and natural disaster. That is the very time this \nunderlying bill would say: State, come up with some more money.\n  That is a dream. That is not connected to reality. That is a wish. \nThat is a hope. People cannot eat wishes and hopes. People need food \nwhen they are hungry. This, to me, is one of those circumstances where \nwe have before us a proposal that does not meet the needs of the \npeople. I am not so worried about the State government. I am worried \nabout the people who in my State or any other State would be denied \nfood because of an economic downturn or a natural disaster that was \nunforeseen, unpredicted, and the State bet the farm that nothing bad \nwas going to happen.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Twenty-nine minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield whatever time the Senator from Vermont desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to join Senator Conrad, \nmyself, and our cosponsors in supporting the amendment to remove the \noptional block grant from the welfare bill.\n  I have three major objections to block granting the Food Stamp \nProgram. First, I am very concerned about the opportunity for fraud if \nwe turn the Food Stamp Program over to the States. Second, I am fearful \nthat a food stamp block grant could put our most vulnerable populations \nat risk. Finally, I believe the bill as crafted proposes a solid \nprogram that will afford the States a great deal of flexibility without \nirretrievably compromising our national nutritional safety net. I think \nthe program proposed in the bill should be given an opportunity to \nprove itself.\n\n[[Page S8355]]\n\n  Under current food stamp law, the USDA operates a sophisticated \ncomputer system that identifies suspicious food stamp redemption \npatterns. Federal undercover agents visit the suspicious stores and \ngather evidence of illegal activity. If food stamps are converted to a \nblock grant, much of this responsibility will shift to the States. Few \nStates will be able to match the antifraud capabilities and resources \nof this Federal operation. Although I understand the States' desire for \ngreater flexibility, we know that at this time only a handful have \ndeveloped an electronic system that could provide the assurances of \nfraud prevention that we have at the Federal level. In this time of \nquickly diminishing Federal resources, I am reluctant to sacrifice the \nefficiencies and success of the program that the Department of \nAgriculture has developed.\n  Next, let me share my concern that the optional food stamp block \ngrant would end the assurance of a nutritional safety net under the \nNation's poor--particularly its children. Poor families and elderly \nindividuals would be left at serious risk during economic downturns in \nStates opting for the block grant. The block grant fails to provide any \nadjustment during a recession for increases in unemployment and \npoverty. States also would receive no additional funds in the event \nthat food prices rise unexpectedly. States would be forced to curtail \neligibility and benefits during these times. Unemployed workers who \nneed food stamps temporarily could end up on a waiting list--depriving \ntheir families of critical food assistance. After unemployment \ncompensation, the Food Stamp Program is the Nation's principle \ncountercyclical tool to respond to recessions.\n  Block granting the Food Stamp Program puts children at risk. \nPreserving national standards for food stamps takes on even greater \nimportance if the AFDC Program is converted to a block grant since no \npoor child is assured of receiving cash assistance under an AFDC block \ngrant. Maintaining the National Food Stamp Program at least guarantees \nthat a food assistance safety net of last resort is in place for poor \nchildren. Given this very great risk, I frankly am not sure why a State \nwould choose a block grant, nonetheless it is possible a State would, \nand I fear its poorest citizens could end up suffering the \nconsequences.\n  Finally, I believe there is no reason for a State to choose a block \ngrant--the welfare bill as drafted gives the States unprecedented \nflexibility to run their own food stamp programs without a block grant.\n  Under this reform bill:\n  States get flexibility to set their own food stamp benefit rules for \nfamilies that receive AFDC. If they choose, States could drop many of \nthe rules that now apply to families, and then substitute their own \nrules--without securing a waiver. States also may integrate food stamp \nand cash assistance benefit eligibility as they see fit. States have \nasked for a long time for this flexibility, and the bill as drafted \ngives it to them.\n  States can convert food stamp benefits to wage subsidies provided to \nemployers. In other words, States may require food stamp recipients in \nwage subsidy projects to work for wages rather than food stamps. Again, \nthis is something many States have asked for, and the bill as drafted \ngives it to them.\n  States have the flexibility to disqualify custodial parents who do \nnot cooperate with efforts to establish paternity or child support \norders. States may also disqualify absent parents who fail to make \ntheir child support payments.\n  States are freed from federally imposed administrative requirements. \nThe bill lifts an array of Federal requirements regarding food stamp \napplication forms, the application process, and how States should \ncoordinate with other assistance programs would be removed. States can \nmake their own decisions on how to administer their food stamp \nprograms. This is flexibility the States asked for, and the bill gives \nit to them.\n  I have listed four ways that this bill provides much greater \nflexibility to the States than they have ever had in the Food Stamp \nProgram--and there are many more provisions in the bill that give the \nStates the flexibility they have asked for with regard to the Food \nStamp Program.\n  For the reasons described above, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this amendment to remove the optional block grant from the \nbill.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthis amendment to strike the optional food stamp block grant. This bill \nprovides States ample flexibility to develop their food assistance \nprograms without a block grant structure. We should not place minimum \nnational eligibility and benefit floors for this important food \nassistance safety net at risk in an effort to provide States with even \nmore flexibility.\n  Maintaining the national standards for food stamps is particularly \nimportant under this bill. Children and their families may lose cash \nassistance under the welfare block grant--even if parents are unable to \nfind work. The National Food Stamp Program ensures that a basic food \nassistance safety net is still available to these families and prevents \nchildren from being at risk for unmet nutritional needs. If we are \ngoing to cut funding for cash assistance and block-grant the welfare \nprogram, we need to be very conscious of the changes we make to other \nsafety-net programs that also serve poor Americans.\n  Block grants will place both States and food stamp beneficiaries at \nrisk. These block grants would not adjust for increases in unemployment \nor poverty, or unexpected increases in food prices. States would need \nto stretch their block grant dollars by providing fewer benefits to \neach enrollee under these circumstances--or they may be forced to cut \neligibility.\n  States do not need an optional food stamp block grant. This bill \nprovides States with substantial new flexibility to design their food \nstamp programs. For example:\n  States could largely develop their own food stamp benefit rules and \nthey may integrate the food stamp eligibility process with welfare.\n  Federal requirements for employment and training programs related to \nfood stamp eligibility would be repealed--States could design these \nprograms as they choose.\n  States could convert food stamp benefits to wage subsidies.\n  Federal rules that make electronic benefit systems difficult to \nimplement would be repealed, while Federal requirements for food stamp \napplications, coordination with other safety-net programs, and other \nadministrative rules would also be deleted.\n  These are significant changes to the current Food Stamp Program. \nStates will be better able to design and administer their programs \nusing innovative approaches to promoting work and self-sufficiency for \nfood stamp beneficiaries. We should not also establish a food stamp \nblock grant, thereby eliminating the national floor for eligibility and \nbenefits, thereby threatening low-income children and their families.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, just a couple of quick additional points \nso we can, hopefully, persuade the occupant of the chair of the wisdom \nof this amendment. I think he is perhaps right on the brink, now, of \ncoming over to our side. If we can just provide him some additional \ninformation, he will come to our side on this argument.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania was indicating that just a handful of \nStates would be eligible. That strikes me as an indication of the \nweakness of their argument. If the argument is this underlying bill is \nnot so bad because only a handful of States can qualify, that does not \nspeak very well of the position in the legislation. The fact is, not a \nhandful of States qualify; every State can qualify. Every State can \nqualify. Every State could be in a position of not meeting the needs of \nhungry people at the time of economic recession or natural disaster.\n  The facts I have suggest that about half the States now could take \nblock grant with no cost. Others could come in by paying a small cost. \nBut within 2 or 3 years, nearly 40 States would be in a position to be \nin the block grant at no cost. In addition to that, with respect to \nwhat happens to participation rates during a recession, I have a chart \nthat shows what has happened in various States during an economic \ndownturn, during the period of 1989 to 1992, when the country was in a \nrecession.\n\n[[Page S8356]]\n\n  Nevada's participation rate went up over 90 percent; Florida's rate \nwent up over 100 percent; Delaware's rate went up over 70 percent; \nVermont's rate went up nearly 60 percent. These are not things that a \nState does a very good job of forecasting. They even do less well at \nforecasting natural disasters.\n  In my own State of North Dakota, we had a natural disaster back in \n1988 and 1989. It was a drought. Nobody forecasted the drought was \ncoming. Out of the blue we have a drought. All of a sudden our \nparticipation rates jumped, and not just in food stamps, but other \nprograms as well. Food stamps are different because we are talking \nabout hungry people. We are talking about preventing people who cannot \nget food from having some alternative that is humane.\n  The Florida example is just as clear as it can be. You have to opt in \nthe year before. If they had opted in, they would have been stuck with \nthe level of funding provided for in this block grant. If you look at \nit, in 1994, Florida, their actual money, because of the flexibility of \nthe National Food Stamp Program--they got $1.4 billion. Under the block \ngrant they would have gotten $440 million. That is a $1 billion hole \nthat would have had to be filled in somewhere.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania suggests they just take it out of other \nState money. What other State money? Every State I know budgets their \nmoney right up to the full ability of the State revenue sources to \ncover those expenditures. They may have a bit of a rainy day fund, but \nit is not enough to cover a natural disaster when the State is faced \nwith expenditures for all manner of other requirements. They have to \ndeal with roads. They have to deal with bridges. They have to deal with \nall kinds of other extraordinary expenses at the time of a natural \ndisaster. The last thing we should have people worrying about is \nwhether, in the midst of a natural disaster, hungry people are going to \nget fed. That is what this amendment addresses. I hope my colleagues \nwill support it.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota keeps \nmentioning how, under this program, we are not worried about people who \nare in need of food. The very fact is, States must submit a plan to be \napproved by HHS to satisfy the Department of Health and Human Services \nof that very fact, whether we are going to meet the needs. In fact, we \nrequire them to specify how they are going to serve everybody, and \nspecific populations.\n  To suggest we have not set up adequate safeguards to make sure, \nthrough these block grants, people will be adequately served is not \nreflective of what is actually in the legislation.\n  Second, you mentioned----\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Sure.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask my colleague, what in the State plan enables it to \ndeal with a natural disaster like Hurricane Andrew? The State plan has \nthe States setting out what they are going to do with the resources \nthat they have under the block grant. When they are hit with a natural \ndisaster and the need skyrockets, they are not given any more money. \nWhat good does the plan do that does not anticipate this disaster? \nObviously, they would not be taking the option of going to the block \ngrant if they were anticipating it, so clearly it would not be in their \nplan.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. To answer your question, as the Senator from North \nDakota knows, the State of Florida during the time of Hurricane Andrew \nwas eligible for disaster assistance, and that covers a variety of \nthings. Having just gone through that in Pennsylvania, a substantial \namount of disaster assistance was funneled through the Department of \nAgriculture, and, in fact, there are programs available for people to \nmeet some of the needs that are there during the time of disaster.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We are not attempting nor would I recommend we block \ngrant emergency assistance. So you keep pointing back to one State in \none instance and draw a bad case for that. It would be--I am not \narguing there would not be a severe strain. But I suggest the Governor \nof Florida and the State Legislature of Florida knows that occasionally \nthey are hit by hurricanes. It is not like these hurricanes are just, \n``Gee, wow, in Florida we had a hurricane. We never see that.'' They \nsee them all the time and they know they can be disastrous, and that \nshould go into their calculation whether they want to go into this in \nthe first place.\n  We are assuming, and I think it is a good assumption, that the \nGovernor and the State legislature are not going to take on this \nenormous responsibility without having thought through what the \ndifferent consequences would be, given natural disasters or given \neconomic downturn, and a whole lot of other things.\n  We believe that there still will be States out there that, because of \nthe enormous burden that the Federal Government forces upon them with \nthis program that drives up costs for them and makes their program \ninefficient, can take the money and take the risk and still do a better \njob, and they are willing to assume that risk.\n  They do so with eyes open wide. If their eyes were not open, they \ncertainly are open now as a result of our discussion. That if they do \nnot have the money, if they have an economic downturn or disaster, they \nhave to come up with their own State money.\n  I will announce to State Governors now, if you take a block grant \nunder this proposal and run out of money at the end of the year, it is \nyour responsibility. Now everybody has been warned, and they are going \nto have to make a decision based on what they think is the best thing \nto do.\n  I think what this whole welfare reform bill is about is trying to get \naway from the paternalism of the Federal Government and the \ninefficiency of the Federal Government in trying to micromanage \nprograms out of Washington, DC, for Fargo, ND, and other places. What \nwe are trying to do here is assure, to the extent we can, that States \nthat get involved have good programs. We make sure they have low error \nrates or high technology to run an efficient system.\n  We ensure that when they take the program, after they now run a good \nprogram, that when they opt for a block grant, which is to cut the ties \nto the Federal program, in fact, take it and let them run it \nthemselves, that they have to submit a plan, which adequately covers \nall the people we are concerned about, and is approved by HHS. Again, a \nprudent step to making sure they are not taking the money and spending \nit on a fleet of Volvos for all the Cabinet Secretaries; that, in fact \nthey are spending it on helping the poor who need food.\n  We have adequate safeguards in here to make sure that the poor who \nare in need of food assistance get it; that the States run a good \noperation. We have those safeguards in place.\n  One other thing. The Senator from North Dakota voted for in committee \nand supported in committee an amendment that was put forward by the \nSenator from Vermont, the ranking member, Senator Leahy, as a further, \nfrankly, disincentive for these States to take a block grant.\n  Under the old formula, States could either take the 1994 allocation \nfor food stamps or the average of 1992, 1993, and 1994. Senator Leahy, \nand others on your side of the aisle, were saying, ``Gee, well, with \nthe reductions in food stamp benefits under our bill, that may be a \nvery attractive thing for them to take--take that high figure, since \nour numbers are going to be coming down.''\n  So what you added in committee was a provision that said that in no \ncase could either the 1992, 1993, 1994 average or 1994 allocation be \nhigher than the 1997 levels after the reforms have been put in place. \nSo you make it even less tantalizing to go ahead and take a block \ngrant.\n  All I suggest is, we spent a lot of time on this amendment. It has \nbeen a good debate and discussion. I hope those who were listening are \nstill listening after an hour of this debate. I think it has been \ninformative. I think what we have seen here is we set very high \nhurdles; we have not made this to be the most attractive block grant \nproposal out there. What we have said to States is, ``If you think you \ncan do it better, given these high hurdles to get into this program, we \nare going to give you the opportunity to do it.''\n\n[[Page S8357]]\n\n  I think that is only fair to give States the opportunity to run a \nbetter program that helps the people in their State.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator has 17 minutes 5 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the argument of the Senator from \nPennsylvania with respect to a natural disaster reveals the weakness of \nhis argument. The Senator from Pennsylvania suggests, if you have a \nnatural disaster and you are stuck with this block grant program that \nprovides only a set amount of money, it cannot be adjusted for the \nmagnitude of the disaster, that, well, you have economic assistance.\n  Economic assistance is not for food assistance, that is why we have \nthe Food Stamp Program. Economic assistance is to meet the other \ndisaster needs that a State meets in a circumstance of unforeseen \nnatural disaster. Economic assistance programs are not designed to \nreplace the Food Stamp Program.\n  Mr. President, if that is what he is suggesting is out there for \npeople to be counting on, if they face a natural disaster, those people \nare going to be in a world of hurt.\n  I might also say, the notion that Governors are put on notice because \nwe in the Senate have a debate at 3 o'clock in the afternoon on Friday \nis probably not a very reliable thing for any of us to depend upon. I \ndoubt if any Governor is watching this debate or paying very close \nattention to what goes on in the Senate Chamber.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to send each Governor a copy of this \ndebate so they will be fully informed as to what they are getting into.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I welcome that. No question, they will be riveted by the \ncomments of the two of us this afternoon.\n  Let me just end on this note. The harsh reality is, if a State opts \ninto this block grant--and we go back to the example of Florida, but we \ndo not need Florida's example, we could take dozens of examples of what \nhas happened to States in times of economic downturn or natural \ndisaster--what we would find, without exception, is that these things \nare unpredictable; that if a State had opted into the block grant, \ntaken a flat amount of money to provide for the food needs of its \npeople and then have something unforeseen occur, whether it was an \neconomic downturn, a drought, a hurricane, an earthquake, they only \nhave that set amount of money, no matter what the need is.\n  What happens to those people? What would have happened to hungry \npeople in Florida if there was not the automatic adjustment provided by \nthe Federal Food Stamp Program? I can tell you what would have \nhappened. The State of Florida would have been presented with an \nimpossible choice: meet the other disaster needs of the State in that \ncircumstance or divert money to food which would have otherwise been \nprovided for with the Federal Food Stamp Program.\n  What a hellacious choice to present the State officials of Florida or \nthe State officials of Pennsylvania. They have had natural disasters. \nThey just had one. Or the State of North Dakota, or the State of \nCalifornia. We saw California beset by one disaster after another. We \nsaw them have landslides, fires, earthquakes all in 1 year. Their \ncaseload skyrocketed. But if they would have had a set amount of money \nfor food stamps, some people who had legitimate needs would not have \nbeen served.\n\n  Mr. President, America is better than that. America is better than \nthat. This Senate is better than that. When there is a disaster, we \nhave a spirit of neighborliness in this country and we go to help out. \nWhen there was a disaster in Pennsylvania, the Federal Government \nhelped out. When there was a disaster in my State, the people of \nAmerica rallied, through their Federal Government, and helped us, and \nit made a difference in people's lives.\n  This bill, as it is written, is just a mistake. We should not leave a \ncircumstance in which people who are hungry do not have the opportunity \nto be fed.\n  This amendment, which is a bipartisan amendment, addresses that need. \nI hope my colleagues will support it.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield back the balance of our time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4935\n\n(Purpose: To deny welfare benefits to individuals convicted of illegal \n                 drug possession, use or distribution)\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Gramm of Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] for Mr. Gramm \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4935.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 364, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.  . DENIAL OF BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN DRUG RELATED \n                   CONVICTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--An individual convicted (under Federal or \n     State law) of any crime relating to the illegal possession, \n     use, or distribution of a drug shall not be eligible for any \n     Federal means-tested public benefit, as defined in Section \n     2403(c)(1) of this Act.\n       (b) Family Members Exempt.--The prohibition contained under \n     subsection (a) shall not apply to the family members or \n     dependants of the convicted individual in a manner that would \n     make such family members or dependents ineligible for welfare \n     benefits that they would otherwise be eligible for. Any \n     benefits provided to family members or dependents of a person \n     described in subsection (a) shall be reduced by the amount \n     which would have otherwise been made available to the \n     convicted individual.\n       (c) Period of Prohibition.--The prohibition under \n     subsection (a) shall apply--\n       (1) with respect to an individual convicted of a \n     misdemeanor, during the 5-year period beginning on the date \n     of the conviction or the 5-year period beginning on January \n     1, 1997, whichever is later; and\n       (2) with respect to an individual convicted of a felony, \n     for the duration of the life of that individual.\n       (d) Exceptions.--Subsection (a) shall not apply with \n     respect to the following Federal benefits:\n       (1) Emergency medical services under title XV or XIX of the \n     Social Security Act.\n       (2) Short-term, non-cash, in-kind emergency disaster \n     relief.\n       (3)(A) Public health assistance for immunizations.\n       (B) Public health assistance for testing and treatment of \n     communicable diseases if the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services determines that it is necessary to prevent the \n     spread of such disease.\n       (e) Effective Date.--The denial of Federal benefits set \n     forth in this section shall take effect for convictions \n     occurring after the date of enactment.\n       (f) Regulations.--Not later than December 31, 1996, the \n     Attorney General shall promulgate regulations detailing the \n     means by which Federal and State agencies, courts, and law \n     enforcement agencies will exchange and share the data and \n     information necessary to implement and enforce the \n     withholding of Federal benefits.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. This amendment, to my understanding, is an amendment \nthat says that if you are convicted of a Federal drug crime, that if it \nis a misdemeanor crime you are ineligible for a means-tested benefit \nfor 5 years, if it is a felony you are ineligible permanently. I ask \nfor the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if there is one phrase that has \ncharacterized the debate on welfare reform, it is the phrase that ``we \nare going to end welfare as we have known it.'' What we have known \nwelfare as has a number of dimensions. We have focused a great deal of \nattention, for instance, on the issue of what will it take to cause \nwelfare to be seen as a temporary program, not as a permanent \nlifestyle.\n  There is another dimension to welfare as we have known it. And that \nis how the Federal Government has participated financially with the \nStates in financing the cost of welfare. And I speak specifically to \nthe cash payments under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children.\n  The current law is essentially a matching formula in which the States \nindicate what they are prepared to commit to this program and then the \nFederal Government matches that amount. There are nuances to that \nstatement but that is fundamentally the status quo.\n  This bill, with a minor modification, intends to retain that aspect \nof welfare as we have known it. That is, we would continue to maintain \nthe State by State Federal allocations as they have developed under the \ncurrent system. And those State by State allocations, as you would \nimagine, are extremely divergent.\n  As an example, to use the State of the Presiding Officer, Idaho, in \n1996, per child in poverty--that is of all the children in Idaho who \nlive at or below the poverty level--if you divide the number of dollars \nthat are coming from the Federal Government to the State of Idaho by \nthat number of children, the result is $495. That is what Idaho \nreceives per poor child.\n  Just to move across the line into your adjoining State of Washington, \nthe State of Washington, with the same mathematical formula, in 1996 \nwill receive $1,948 or approximately four to five times, per child in \npoverty, what Idaho receives.\n  That result is now going to be cast into the stone of block grants. \nThat is the basis upon which Idaho will be receiving its money between \nnow and the year 2001 so that essentially those same discrepancies will \nbe maintained.\n  What has not been retained, however, Mr. President, is what is the \npurpose of the allocation of funds. Under the current system, the \npurpose of the allocation of funds from the Federal Government to the \nStates and into the eligible families is essentially economic support. \nIt pays for the rent, the lights, the food, the school supplies, the \ndiapers, all the things that a family needs.\n  What we are now about to do is shift to a different goal. And that \ndifferent goal is to, yes, continue to provide some economic support, \nbut with a heavy emphasis on funding those activities which will \nfacilitate people getting off of welfare and into work.\n  What are those kinds of activities that are now going to be funded? \nWell, they include job training. They include child care. They include \nsome of the support services such as transportation for people to get \nto the job training or to get to the job. Those types of expenditures, \nwithin a range, tend to be fairly consistent from State to State.\n  It does not cost a great deal less or more to provide that set of \nservices in Moscow, ID, as in Spokane, WA. Yet Washington is going to \nhave four to five times as many dollars per child in poverty to pay for \nthose services as is Idaho. Therefore, Idaho is going to have a much \nmore difficult time financially in terms of being able to pay for those \nkinds of transitional services and have anything left over to cover the \neconomic needs of families who are in poverty than will States that \ncommence this process at a much higher level.\n  That, Mr. President, is the preface for the amendment that is offered \ntoday by Senator Bumpers and myself entitled ``Children's Fair Share.'' \nAnd our premise is that we ought to, over time, have as a national goal \nto treat each child in poverty in America as being of equal worth, and \nequal dignity and equal importance to their opportunities for the \nfuture of our Nation.\n\n  Our approach is a simple one. Rather than take the status quo, which \nis predicated on the old welfare system and the old objectives, we \nshould focus on a needs-based formula. As a result, over time, States \nwould receive funding based on the number of poor children in their \nState.\n  Why are Senator Bumpers and I offering this amendment? Any formula\n\n[[Page S8359]]\n\nallocation should be guided by some underlying principles and policy \njustifications. One fundamental principle is fairness--fairness to \nAmerica's children, fairness to the States, fairness to the Nation. If \nwe are going to block grant welfare, we must be very careful that we \nare block granting with fairness.\n  The General Accounting Office issued a report in February 1995 \nentitled, ``Block Grants: Characteristics, Experience, and Lessons \nLearned.'' What are the lessons that have been learned from our \nprevious history with block grants that we should take into account as \nwe start on the block grant for welfare?\n  The General Accounting Office report stated, ``Because initial \nfunding allocations used in current block grants were based on prior \ncategorical grants, they were not necessarily equitable.'' That, Mr. \nPresident, describes the circumstance that we face this afternoon with \nthis legislation--inequitable allocations of block grant funds because \nthey were based on prior categorical grants.\n  Senator Bumpers and I propose a funding formula that would clearly \nmeet the following principles. First, block grant funding should \nreflect need or the number of persons in the individual States that \nwould need assistance. Think about that principle, that one that seems \nrational.\n  Second, a State's access to Federal funding should increase if the \nnumber of people in need of assistance increases; conversely, a State's \naccess to Federal funding should decrease if the number of people in \nneed of that assistance decrease. Does that sound logical and \nreasonable?\n  Third, States should not be permanently disadvantaged because of the \nold categorical policies. In this case, the policies and circumstances \nsurrounding welfare as we have known it, which we are attempting to \ndiscard.\n  Fourth, if requirements and penalties are to be imposed upon the \nStates, as envisaged by this bill, then fairness dictates that all \nStates have an equitable and reasonable chance of reaching those goals.\n  Mr. President, I suggest these principles sound rather simple. In \nsharp contrast, the legislation which is before the Senate fails to \nmeet these tests of fairness. In fact, the formula used in this bill \nwould perpetuate inequities into the future. Those inequities would, in \nfact, grow.\n  Let me give an example. I cited the example of two neighboring \nStates, Idaho and Washington. Let me cite two neighboring \njurisdictions, the District of Columbia and the State of Virginia. \nToday, the District of Columbia per child in poverty receives $1,611; \nin the State of Virginia, $728. That is what the situation is today.\n  Now, what is the proposal of the underlying bill for the year 2001? \nAre we going to bring these together? Are we going to move toward \neliminating the $680 difference between the District of Columbia and \nthe State of Virginia? Unfortunately, it is just the opposite, Mr. \nPresident. In the year 2001, under the plan that is before the Senate, \nthe District of Columbia will receive $1,752 per child in poverty; the \nState of Virginia will receive $748. Rather than closing toward \nfairness, we will see a widening in which, in the year 2001, the \nDistrict of Columbia will have approximately $1,000 more per child in \npoverty than does the State of Virginia. I find it hard to think of a \npolicy rationale that would justify such a result.\n\n  Mr. President, ironically, in the name of reform, in the name of \nchange, we are locking in past inequities, repackaging them as block \ngrants and failing to take into account future populations or economic \nchanges among the States, failing to take into account the very \nobligations we are about to give to the States to perform and the \nnecessity that if all States are going to achieve those objectives and \nif all States are going to be held to both sanctions and rewards for \ntheir success or failure in achieving those objectives, that all States \nshould commence this new adventure of welfare reform from an \nessentially equitable position.\n  By allocating future spending on the basis of 1995 allocations, this \nbill fails to distribute money based on any measure of need. It fails \nto take into account population growth or economic changes. It would \npermanently disadvantage States well into the future based upon choices \nand circumstances of 1995. It would unfairly impose penalties on \nStates.\n  The formula in this welfare bill would result in extreme disparities \nbetween States in Federal funding for poor children. I have given four \nexamples to date. I might say all of these examples and all of the \nstatistics I am using are the product of a report done by the \nCongressional Research Service dated July 18, 1996.\n  In this report, it points out that under the underlying bill the \nState of our leader, the State of Mississippi, would receive $355 per \nchild in poverty, while the State of New York would receive $1,998, or \nalmost six times more than the poor child in Mississippi. In fact, if \nwe combine the amount per poor child in the States of Alabama, \nArkansas, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Texas, the total of funds per \npoor child in those five States would not equal what a poor child, for \ninstance, in the State of Massachusetts would receive. To put it \nanother way, the Federal Government effectively values some poor \nchildren five times more than it does children in the State of Alabama, \nArkansas, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Texas.\n  That is not the end of it, Mr. President, because under this bill, \nStates that fail to meet the work requirements, States that are not \nable to put the money into effective job training, job search, job \nplacement, child care, transportation, the other activities that have \nbeen found as necessary in order to get people from welfare to work, \nthey are going to be subject to a penalty.\n  Now, in a previous version of this bill, that penalty was 5 percent \nof the State's grant. So if the State was going to receive $1 million, \nit would be penalized 5 percent if it failed to meet the work \nrequirement. This bill, Mr. President, if we believe it, makes that 5 \npercent cumulative, so that in the first year, you are penalized a \npercent; if you fail in the second year, you get penalized 10 percent; \nin the third year, you get penalized 15 percent, and so forth, up until \nyou are penalized one quarter, or 25 percent of your State grant.\n  That is not the only penalty in this bill, Mr. President. The \nlanguage goes so far as to say a State can be penalized up to 25 \npercent per quarter in terms of the allocation of grant funds.\n  Mr. President, today is a historic day. It is the opening of the \ncentennial Olympics in Atlanta. Much of the world's focus for the next \nfew days will be on Atlanta and on the Olympic events. I would liken \nthis funding formula dilemma to a variation of one of the most \ncelebrated contests in the Olympics. Let us say you have Dennis \nMitchell and Gail Devers lined up at the start of the 100-meter dash. \nThen you have a less talented runner lined up 30 yards behind these two \nOlympic superstars. Then you have Senator Bumpers--who, unfortunately \ncould not join us this afternoon, but will make some remarks on \nMonday--and I, who have been assigned a position 200 yards behind these \nsuperstars. The gun goes off. Now, we are all going to be judged on \nwhether we can reach the finish line in the 100-meter dash in under 11 \nseconds. If you do, you get the acclaim of the crowd and you may even \nget a medal. If not, you are subject to penalty.\n  Well, not surprisingly, Dennis and Gail reach that goal easily. The \nrunner that started 30 meters further behind makes it in about 13 or 14 \nseconds, failing to meet the goal despite a valiant attempt. Now, \nSenator Bumpers and I, I hate to admit, we do not even come close to \nmaking the goal. Even Michael Johnson, the world-record holder, can \nonly run the 200-meter dash in 19.66 seconds. However, even he would be \npenalized in this scenario. That would be a travesty of the Olympic \nspirit. That would be a sad race to observe.\n  But, Mr. President, it gets worse. Since Senator Bumpers and I lost \nthe race, and the runner at 130 yards also failed to meet the standard, \nwe would have to move further back for the next race. Since they had \nreached the goal, Dennis and Gail would move 10 meters closer for the \nnext race.\n  That is essentially the structure of this bill. Those who start out \nin an advantaged position are placed in the prospect that they will get \nrewards because they have achieved the goals. Those who start--as \nSenator Bumpers\n\n[[Page S8360]]\n\nand I are going to have to do--200 yards behind the regular starting \nline and therefore have relatively little expectation of reaching the \ngoal, we are going to be further penalized, now having to be 300 yards \nbehind the starting line.\n  That, Mr. President, is an absurd result. However, it is exactly the \nsituation that our States must deal with if this bill passes with its \ncombination of funding formulas, incentives, and penalties.\n  Mr. President, as we change welfare as we know it, we should recommit \nourselves to the value that we place upon all of America's children. We \nshould want to see that all of those children have the same opportunity \nto succeed and that they start from the same place in life's starting \nline. There is no justification for poor children to be treated with \nless or more value by the Federal Government depending upon in which \nState they happen to live.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the Graham-Bumpers amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I \nwill respond as to why. The Senator from Florida repeatedly talked \nabout how those States that are currently disadvantaged that are way \nbehind from the start are going to get put further behind, as if the \nStates who were far behind were there--as I heard this term a lot on \nthe floor--through ``no fault of their own.'' I hear that all the time. \nThey are disadvantaged for no fault of their own. The fact is that the \nreason they are so far behind is directly a result of the decisions \nthat those States made with respect to how much money they want to put \nforward in State dollars to help the poor in their States.\n\n  If you look at the chart of the Senator from Florida, the majority of \nthe States that are advantaged, according to him, by the current system \nare States like New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, California New \nJersey--those States who have invested significant State dollars in \nAFDC, Medicaid, and a lot of other programs that are aimed at helping \nthe poor. They are high-benefit States; they are States that are \nwilling to spend tax dollars to meet a Federal match, to help the poor \nin their State. Therefore, they have a higher per capita spending rate \non the poor than States like Florida, Texas, Arkansas, and the others.\n  So when it comes to them redoing the formulas in a block grant, we \nlook at what States are spending now and what the Federal Government \nputs in now. What the Federal Government puts in now is based on what \nthe State puts in. It is a match. So the Federal share, yes, in \nPennsylvania is higher than it would be if you start all over and say \nwe are going to pay so much for everybody. But, by doing what, you \nwould take Pennsylvania and a program in Pennsylvania that has been \nestablished for a long time and has been supported by the State and \njust cut the legs out from under it to give it to a State who has not \nbeen providing those services in the past. How is that fair?\n  If you want to talk about fair, you have a State actually spending \ndollars, putting forth an effort and putting together a program they \nbelieve better meets the needs and is willing to spend money to help \nthe poor, and you are going to create a block grant and take money away \nfrom them because they were being better neighbors--I will use that \nterm. I do not think that is fair. The whole premise of the Hutchison \nformula--Senator Hutchison was the one who worked tirelessly, and I \nmean tirelessly, because there have been a lot of contentious issues I \nhave dealt with in the area of welfare reform over the past 2 years. I \ndo not want to use too strong of a term, but nothing approaches the \nanimosity that is raised on an issue than when you are talking about \ndollars for the States back home. That is really where people draw the \nline.\n  So to be able to come up, as we have done, with a compromise formula \nthat says we want to make sure no one is hurt, that no State is cut, \nthat they are held harmless in the allocation they get from the Federal \nGovernment, and we set a separate growth fund for States that are \nhydro-States to give them money, a separate pot of money, $800 million, \nalmost $1 billion, to use for growth. Florida gets over $100 million of \nthe $800 million in that fund. We try to take care of both. For those \nwho have been doing a good job, spending resources, taking care of the \npoor in their States, hold them harmless and, at the same time, provide \nfor growth for the other States that, frankly, have not been meeting \nthe national average when it comes to providing services for the poor.\n  We think that is a fair balance. If we had all the money in the \nworld, we would give everything to everybody. But we do not. We do not \nhave enough money to provide the same level for everybody that the \nState of New York, for example, provides for their beneficiaries. So we \nhave to make, as the Senator from Florida, and I am sure everybody \nlistening, realizes, you have to compromise. This was the compromise we \ncame up with. Is it perfect? Absolutely not. Is it fair from an \nobjective standpoint? I think the Senator from Florida can make the \nargument that, no, it is not fair. Is it fair given where we had to \nstart? I make the argument that, yes, given the situation we found \nourselves in, it is. If we were going to redo this and go back to 1965, \ninstead of developing an AFDC Program, or whatever current revision of \nthe AFDC Program was created, and start all over, would we have done it \ndifferently? Absolutely. But we are not there. We are here. We have a \nhistory of States that have invested. We have a history of programs. \nAnd to go in and just decimate those programs because of this block \ngrant, I think would be tragic to a lot of people and a lot of States, \nand certainly it would be an enormous hardship on, frankly, the States \nthat are having some of the very worst budgetary times and a lot of \neconomic problems like in the Northeast, in the upper Midwest, and in \nthe case of California and the west coast.\n\n  So we think what we have done here is a balance given where we had to \nstart. It is not--and I agree with the Senator from Florida--from an \nobjective position, as if we were starting from day one a fair \nsolution. I will not argue that. But what I will argue is that given \nwhere we had to start, which is a long history of providing services to \nthe poor, this is the best and the fairest we could come up with given \nthose set of circumstances and the hand we were dealt.\n  So, I do not fault at all the Senator from Florida for standing up, \nas he has done not only on this bill but last year on several \namendments, and articulately advocating for his State and for other \nStates that do not get as much money as they think they deserve. He \ncertainly has a right to do that, and he is certainly justified in \ndoing that. I think what we have done here is to accommodate him and \nhis State as best we can given the circumstances, in providing funds \nfor them to be able to get some more resources.\n  I will anticipate the comment, which is that it is not enough. I \ncannot even argue that it is not enough. But what I am saying is you \nwould find that the States like Pennsylvania and New York, which are \nnot going to see any growth at all in their allocation, would tell me \nthat is not enough. Nobody has enough. This is a situation where \neveryone is getting squeezed, and we are hoping that even though they \nare getting a smaller allocation, that they will be able to take this \nblock grant and be able to redesign this program. That is what this is \nall about--giving them the flexibility. Yes, less money in a sense, but \nmore flexibility to be able to design a program that more efficiently \nprovides for the poor in their States, that more efficiently \ntransitions people off welfare into productive lives than the current \nsystem does, which will save money if they do so in a proper fashion.\n  So, we think there is a good balance between enough money and \ncertainly maximum flexibility to be able to accomplish the purpose \nwithout any additional money, or any change in the funding formulas \nhere.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, let me just make a few points.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania has made a very good argument, if we \nwere going to leave the welfare program as we have known it for the \nlast three-plus decades. The whole premise of us being here today until \nthis job is done is that we want to change that welfare system as we \nhave known it.\n  So, to say that we are going to change the whole chassis drivetrain\n\n[[Page S8361]]\n\nand other aspects of this vehicle, but keep the engine of how we \ndistribute the money to pay to make the vehicle mobile, exactly the \nsame as we had in the past, is, I think, an intellectual disconnect. If \nwe are going to change the program, we have to look at what is going to \nbe required on a nationwide basis and on a State-by-State basis in \norder to accomplish the objectives of the new--not the old--welfare \nsystem.\n  The fact is that the change that is going to be most fundamental to \nthe States is that they are now going to take on the requirement \nsubject to both carrots and sticks in sanctions to move people from \nwelfare to work. We have had some experience with this, Mr. President. \nTwo of the longest term pilot programs in welfare reform are in the \ncities of Gainesville and Pensacola, FL. They have been working for \nseveral years to try to determine, not in theory, but in practice, with \nreal people.\n  What does it take to get folks off welfare? What does it take to get \nthem that first job and then get them in the position that they can \nhold the job in the future? The fact is it takes, for many of those \npeople, a significant investment. We have to invest in job training for \npeople who do not have any job skills. You have to invest in job \nplacement for people who have never gone out to get a job before. You \nhave to invest in child care so that there is somebody there to look \nafter the kids while the mother is in training and in the first months \nof employment.\n  Those all have significant costs. Those costs are within ranges \nfairly consistent from State to State across the country. Yet, we are \ngoing to start some States with four, or five, or six times more money \nthan others with poor children in order to be able to pay for those \ncommon transitional expenses.\n  I am afraid that we are about to build into the architecture of \nwelfare reform failure for many States, and then after we have built in \nfailure, we are going to impose heavy sanctions on those States that \nfail, which will make it even less likely that they will be able to \nachieve success.\n  I fear that the result of all of that is going to be that we will \nwaste several years in accomplishing the objectives that we all see, \nwhich is to move people from dependence to independence and self-\nsufficiency and pride that comes with the ability to support oneself, \nthat we are going to lose that opportunity over the next period as we \nstart this process with a fundamentally, structurally failed \narchitecture.\n  Mr. President, if I thought that we were starting this from a suspect \nplace but that was just a necessary political accommodation in order to \nget off the blocks, and then we would soon be moving towards a greater \nlevel of equity, I could accept that as a pragmatic means of moving \nfrom the old to the new.\n  Are we going to be making that transition? Let us just look at two of \nthe States that I cited: the State of Mississippi and the State of New \nYork. How long under the Hutchison amendment will it take for the State \nof Mississippi to reach the State of New York in its funds available \nfor poor children? Will the Senator from Pennsylvania think that maybe \nwhen we celebrate the 300th anniversary of the country in the year \n2076, would we have done it by then? Sadly not. Will we have done it \nwhen we celebrate the 400th anniversary of the country in the year \n2176? Mr. President, sadly not.\n  It will, in fact, not be until the year 2202, exactly 206 years from \ntoday, 2202, before Mississippi will finally close the gap and be the \nequivalent of New York. That means that it will be some six to seven \ngenerations before that gap is closed.\n  My colleague and friend from Pennsylvania is a patient man. He is \nprepared to wait until the year 2202 to achieve equity. I am more \nimpatient. I do not believe that my life expectancy is going to extend \nto that year. I would like to see some more reasonable date at which we \nwill begin to achieve parity among the States so we can then expect the \nStates to be subject to a parity of sanctions and incentives in terms \nof whether they have, in fact, achieved the goal of moving people from \nwelfare to work.\n\n  We have suggested a 5-year transitional plan to achieve that result. \nThe Senator from Pennsylvania was very gracious in recognizing that \nthis is a legitimate concern, and I recognize that it is not easy to \ndo. You have people who have been operating under the old system with \ncertain sets of expectations. But, frankly, we are asking lots of \npeople to change their whole pattern. We are asking people who have \nbeen essentially waiting to receive a check once a month now to get up \nevery day and go to work. That is a change. We are asking communities \nthat have previously closed the door to employment opportunities for \nmany of these people to open the door and create the chance for them to \nbecome self-sufficient.\n  I think that we ought to, as politicians, challenge ourselves, be \nwilling to make some of the same kinds of adjustments in this new \nsystem. And certainly one of those adjustments ought to be fundamental \nfairness in the way we treat American children wherever those children \nhappen to live in this great Nation.\n  That is the purpose of the Graham-Bumpers amendment. Mr. President, \nas I indicated earlier, by unanimous consent I have reserved the right \nto modify this amendment up to the time of the vote on Tuesday. We \nwould be receptive to further ideas as to how to better achieve this \nobjective.\n  I also indicated that my friend and cosponsor, Senator Bumpers, will \nutilize some time on Monday to speak further on this matter. I hope \nthat over the next few days my colleagues will study this issue of \nfundamental fairness--the fact that some 35 States would be benefited \nas we move, over time, toward fairness--and ask themselves, is it not \ntime as we change welfare as we have known it to also change a pattern \nof expenditure of Federal funds which has seriously disadvantaged many \nof the poorest children in America?\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, if I could just make one quick comment, \nand that is I think the Senator's example of Mississippi and New York \nactually illustrates the point as to why the formula in the underlying \nbill is a fairer formula. To suggest the cost of living to provide for \na poor child in Mississippi is the same as it is to provide for a child \nin Manhattan I think is obvious. It is not the same. The cost of living \nin a lot of areas in this country is substantially lower than it is \nelsewhere. California is one of the States that would be harmed by the \nSenator's amendment. There is a much higher cost of living in the \nStates that are highlighted than in the other States.\n  So there is a disparity, and one of the reasons that States like \nPennsylvania, California, and New York have to spend more money is \nbecause the Federal grants are set at a flat level, which may be very \nadequate for Mississippi but certainly not for New York City or San \nFrancisco or Philadelphia and a lot of other places. So the States have \nhad to make up that difference and, in fact, drawn more Federal dollars \nas a result. There is in a sense, it sounds, an inequity, that a child \nin Mississippi should be given the same as a child in New York when in \na sense the child in Mississippi, to maintain the standard of living, \nneeds less money than a child in New York, where the cost of living is \nhigher.\n  So that is part of what makes these discussions on formulas so \nincredibly complex and difficult, and very difficult to resolve. But I \nthink we have done the best we possibly can.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. If the Senator \nfrom Florida is finished, if he will yield back his time, we will then \nmove on to the next amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I would like to, however, submit for the Record a list of the \npenalties and rewards contained in this bill as a means of underscoring \nthe discrepancy in the likelihood of States being subject to sanction \nor receiving incentives based on the amount of funds that they will \nreceive under this bill per child in poverty.\n  I ask unanimous consent that ``Use of Rewards and Penalties for the \nWelfare Work Requirements'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8362]]\n\n     Use of Rewards and Penalties for the Welfare Work Requirements\n\n\n                               penalties\n\n       Failure to Satisfy Minimum Participation Rates\n       Failure to Comply with Paternity Establishment and Child \n     Support Enforcement Requirements\n       Failure to Timely Repay a Federal Loan Fund for State \n     Welfare Programs\n       Failure of Any State to Maintain Certain Level of Historic \n     Effort\n       Substantial Noncompliance of State Child Support \n     Enforcement Program Requirements\n       Failure of State Receiving Amounts from Contingency Fund to \n     Maintain 100% of Historic Effort\n       Failure to Comply with Provisions of IV-A Or the State Plan\n       Required Replacement of Grant Fund Reductions Caused by \n     Penalties\n\n\n                                rewards\n\n       Reduction of Required State Spending from 80% to 72% for \n     States that Achieve Program Goals\n       Grant to Reward States that Reduce Out-of-Wedlock Births\n       Bonus to Reward High Performance States\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4937\n\n   (Purpose: To Change retention rates under the food stamp program)\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from South \nDakota, Mr. Pressler, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum], for Mr. \n     Pressler, for himself and Mr. Daschle, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4937.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 70, strike line 21 and all that follows \n     through page 71, line 3, and insert the following:\n       ``(c) Retention Rate.--The provision of the first sentence \n     of section 16(a) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. \n     2025(a)) is amended by striking ``25 percent during the \n     period beginning October 1, 1990'' and all that follows \n     through ``section 13(b)(2) of this Act'' and inserting ``35 \n     percent of the value of all funds or allotments recovered or \n     collected pursuant to subsections (b)(1) and (c) of section \n     13 and 20 percent of the value of all funds or allotments \n     recovered or collected pursuant to section 13(b)(2) of this \n     Act''.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to explain \nthe pending amendment. Eliminating food stamp fraud and abuse is of \nparamount importance, both in my State of South Dakota and across the \nNation. Clearly, if there are steps that can be taken to curb the \nfraudulent use of food stamps, then we, as lawmakers, have a \nresponsibility to take them. This amendment is one such step, and I \nbelieve it is fundamentally sound policy.\n  This amendment provides States incentives to police the fraudulent \nuse of food stamps. By granting States the authority to retain 35 \npercent of a food stamp overissuance in instances of intentional fraud \nand 20 percent in the event of nonintentional overissuance, they are \nencouraged to pursue perpetrators to the fullest extent of the law. A \nrecent study by the South Dakota Department of Social Services \ndemonstrated unequivocally that a two-tiered system, such as the one \nproposed by this amendment, is far more effective at encouraging States \nto pursue food stamp fraud than the flat retention rate system proposed \nin the underlying reconciliation bill.\n  Moreover, this amendment has been scored by the Congressional Budget \nOffice as having no significant cost. I urge my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to support the amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this amendment has been agreed to by \nboth sides, and I ask unanimous consent it be agreed to and that the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4937) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4930\n\n         (Purpose: To strengthen food stamp work requirements)\n\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  I call up amendment No. 4930 which is at the desk, and I ask that it \nbe stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], for himself, \n     Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Shelby, and Mr. \n     Smith, proposes an amendment numbered 4930.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 1134 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1134. WORK REQUIREMENT.\n\n       Section 6 of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2015), as \n     amended by section 1133, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(o) Work Requirement--\n       ``(1) Definition of work program.--In this subsection, the \n     term `work program' means--\n       ``(A) a program under the Job Training Partnership Act (29 \n     U.S.C. 1501 et seq.);\n       ``(B) a program under section 236 of the Trade Act of 1974 \n     (19 U.S.C. 2296); or\n       ``(C) a program of employment or training operated or \n     supervised by a State or political subdivision of a State \n     that meets standards approved by the Governor of the State, \n     including a program under subsection (d)(4), other than a job \n     search program or a job search training program.\n       ``(2) Work requirement.--Subject to paragraph (3), no \n     individual shall be eligible to participate in the food stamp \n     program as a member of any household if the individual did \n     not--\n       ``(A) work 20 hours or more per week, averaged monthly;\n       ``(B) participate in and comply with the requirements of a \n     work program for at least 20 hours or more per week, as \n     determined by the State agency; or\n       ``(C) participate in and comply with the requirements of a \n     program under section 20 or a comparable program established \n     by a State or political subdivision of a State.\n       ``(3) Exemptions.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an \n     individual if the individual is--\n       ``(A) a parent residing with a dependent child under 18 \n     years of age;\n       ``(B) mentally or physically unfit;\n       ``(C) under 18 years of age;\n       ``(D) 50 years of age or older; or\n       ``(E) a pregnant woman.''.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as we so frequently say around this place, \nI will be brief. The pending amendment, offered by Senator Faircloth \nand me, and cosponsored by the distinguished Senator from Texas, [Mr. \nGramm], the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, [Mr. Nickles], the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama, [Mr. Shelby], and the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire, [Mr. Smith], is very simple. It requires \nable-bodied food stamp recipients to go to work for at least 20 hours a \nweek--if they expect to continue to receive food stamps free of \ncharge--at the expense, I might emphasize, of those taxpayers who work \n40 hours a week or more to pay the bill.\n  I must be candid--other food stamp proposals do not go nearly far \nenough, in my judgment, in making workfare a reality. I do not believe \nit is fair to working Americans, many of whom have to work two jobs or \nmore in order to feed and clothe their families, to have to pay taxes \nto support those who are not motivated to get off their rear ends and \njoin the work force of America.\n  Who knows, Mr. President, if they tried it, they might like it. If \nthey are obliged to go to work a little bit for their free food stamps, \nthey might just be surprised to discover that it is rewarding to work \nregularly and permanently like most other Americans have to do.\n  Excluded from the requirements of this amendment--let me emphasize \nthis--excluded are young people under 18, although some young people \nunder 18 are busy many nights shooting each other, parents of \nyoungsters under 18, physically disabled people, pregnant women, and \npeople over 50 years of age.\n  Credible evidence indicates there are at least 12 million able-bodied \npeople in this country presently receiving food stamps, many without \ndoing one lick of work to get them. My fellow sponsors of this \namendment and I are simply proposing that these people must start \nworking for at least 20 hours a week to qualify for free food stamps. \nThat will leave the other 20 hours for them to get busy and find full-\ntime jobs so that they can be supported by themselves instead of the \nFederal taxpayers.\n  I am convinced that there are many kinds of honest work for food \nstamp recipients to do. The pending amendment allows recipients to sign \nup for job training programs at the Federal level as well as for \nemployment and training programs at the State level.\n  The pending amendment puts accountability into the Federal Food Stamp \nProgram by putting an end to\n\n[[Page S8363]]\n\ngiving food stamp benefits to able-bodied people who just refuse to \nwork. If they are not willing to work, then the working taxpayers \nshould not be forced to finance deliberate idleness.\n  Mr. President, in a moment I shall move to table my own amendment \nbecause I have been informed that an effort is being contemplated to \ntry to avoid an up-or-down vote on it. I want to go on record regarding \nthe significance of what this amendment proposes, and I want all other \nSenators to go on record likewise.\n  So I will move to table this amendment (No. 4930) and ask for the \nyeas and nays. And, of course, I will vote against tabling, as will the \nother Senators who are cosponsoring this amendment, and I do hope that \nthere will be enough Senators who will vote against tabling to make it \na viable amendment.\n  I am quite confident that some attention will be given to how \nSenators will vote on this tabling motion. So let me reiterate, just to \nmake it perfectly clear, that Senators favoring the requirement that \nable-bodied food stamp recipients must go to work for at least 20 hours \na week in order to be eligible for free food stamps, those Senators \nshould vote against tabling this amendment as I will vote against \ntabling. Senators not favoring this work requirement for those \nreceiving free food stamps should, of course, vote aye, in favor of \ntabling the amendment sponsored by the Senator from North Carolina.\n\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I move to table amendment No. 4930. Mr. \nPresident, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield such time as I \nmay have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, our colleague, Senator Leahy of Vermont, \nwas unable to be here this afternoon. He has asked me to make a \nstatement on his behalf in reference to the amendment that has just \nbeen offered by the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Speaking on Senator Leahy's behalf:\n\n       I oppose the Helms amendment. It would deny food stamps to \n     millions of unemployed workers, including factory workers who \n     have worked for 10 or 20 years and then are laid off when a \n     plant closes. The Helms amendment would replace the tough \n     work requirements already in the bill with a flat prohibition \n     on the provision of food stamps to unemployed workers between \n     the ages of 18 and 50 who are not disabled and do not have \n     children under the age of 18. The Senate defeated a version \n     of Senator Helms' amendment last year by a vote of 66 to 32. \n     Under the Helms amendment, no unemployed worker without a \n     minor child in the household, no such worker could receive \n     food stamps unless he or she was working at least 20 hours \n     per week in a workfare slot. If the worker was furloughed or \n     laid off, he or she generally would be immediately removed \n     from the Food Stamp Program.\n       The amendment does not provide funding to create workfare \n     positions to which these individuals could be referred. The \n     amendment simply denies food stamps to laid-off workers who \n     are looking for a new job but have not yet found one.\n\n  Mr. President, I offer that statement in behalf of our colleague, \nSenator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The record will so note.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4936\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment which I offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to it being in order? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4938\n\n(Purpose: To preserve eligibility of immigrants for programs of student \n            assistance under the Public Health Service Act)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I may offer an \namendment on behalf of the Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk for Mr. \nSimon and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], for Mr. Simon, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4938.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       In Section 2403(c)(2)(H), after ``1965'' and before the \n     period at the end, add ``, and Titles III, VII, and VIII of \n     the Public Health Service Act''.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent all time on this \namendment be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask the amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Shelby, from Alabama, \nwill be coming over shortly to lay down an amendment in relation to \nadoption tax credit. In cosponsoring this amendment with him to the \nwelfare reform bill that would provide a refundable tax credit for the \nadoption expenses, I am excited about this legislation and feel that \nthis is an important time to move it.\n  It has not even been a year since our last joint effort to pass the \namendment to H.R. 4. That amendment was overwhelmingly supported, and I \nhope my colleagues will respond to our efforts today in an equally \npositive manner. This amendment provides tax credit support to families \nas they struggle with the bureaucratic process involving adoption. Many \npeople who are aware that I have become an adoptive parent recognize \nthe roadblocks that all of us face when we choose this course in the \nprocess of building a family.\n  I have had that experience. I do not want others to have the kind of \ndifficulty that many families do in this process. That is why I have \nworked with others to assure that we make all-out efforts to build an \nadoption tax credit so that adoptive families, or those who use \nadoption to build families, can find it as rewarding and no more \ndifficult than those who are successful in building a family in a \nnatural way.\n  This amendment changes the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by providing \na refundable tax credit for adoption expenses. It also excludes \nemployees and military adoption assistance benefits and withdrawals \nfrom IRA's used for adoption expenses from gross income.\n  What does an adoption tax credit have to do with welfare reform? \nFrankly, not much, Mr. President, if we are discussing our current \nwelfare system, but a great deal, I think, if we are discussing a \ndramatically reformed system. Then we want innovation and creativity. \nThe current welfare system has created a dependence on Federal programs \nwhile the envisioned system encourages independence. Welfare spending \nhas been growing at an alarming pace, but so has the number of children \nliving in poverty, and so has the number of children who need families.\n  Providing a future for these children by uniting them with loving \nfamilies who can provide not only their financial welfare but also \ntheir emotional welfare has to be a goal of this Congress. As we move \ntoward a system that promotes greater strength in the American family, \nwe ought to encourage efforts like this by using the adoption tax \ncredit.\n  Too often we read stories about the tragic experiences couples have \nendured in order to adopt a child. It is my hope that our work here \nwill lead to more happy stories and fewer heartbreaking reports.\n  Adoption is a too often overlooked option to get the best of all \nworlds: uniting a child with a loving, nurturing family. I think we \nneed to keep focused on that single fact by continuing our efforts to \nimprove this process.\n  I am pleased to be here again, with my colleague from Alabama, \nSenator Shelby to offer this important amendment today. We need to give \nadoptive families a fairer shake. I urge my colleagues to support \nimproving access to adoption, by voting for the Shelby amendment.\n  I certainly hope this Senate will respond as willingly as they did on \nH.R.\n\n[[Page S8364]]\n\n4 in the inclusion of this amendment in our welfare reform package.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it was my intent to send an amendment to \nthe desk which would strengthen and accelerate the work requirement \nthat is contained in this bill. My amendment, in the form of the Levin-\nDole amendment, was added to the Senate-passed welfare reform bill last \nSeptember. I offered it, Senator Dole at that time cosponsored it, and \nit was adopted.\n  The reason that I offered the amendment then and support this \napproach now is that I believe work requirements should be clear and \nshould be strong and should be applied promptly.\n  The amendment would add a requirement that welfare recipients either \nbe in job training, be in school, or be working in private-sector jobs \nwithin 3 months of the receipt of benefits. That was the heart of the \nLevin-Dole amendment.\n  If private sector jobs cannot be found, then those recipients would \nbe required to perform community service employment. Community service \nemployment is the backup in the Levin-Dole amendment, in the approach \nwhich is essential, and it would be required that somebody engage in \nthat community service within months.\n  This requirement would be phased in to allow States the chance to \nadjust administratively, and States would be permitted the option to \nopt out of the requirement by notification to the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services.\n  The bill before us requires welfare recipients to work within 2 years \nof the receipt of benefits--2 years. The question is, why wait 2 years? \nWhy should an able-bodied person receiving welfare benefits not be \nrequired to work for 2 years? That was a flaw in the bill last time, \nwhich was corrected with the Levin-Dole amendment; it is a flaw in this \nbill, which would have been corrected in the Daschle substitute; and is \nnow, hopefully, going to be corrected in a manner that I am going to \ndescribe.\n  But the heart of my approach, which we have fought for now for 2 \nyears, is that able-bodied welfare recipients who are not in private \nsector jobs, who are not in job training, who are not in school, work \nwithin months and not be allowed to go without working for 2 \nyears. There is no reason to wait 2 years when we are talking about \nable-bodied people receiving welfare benefits. There is no reason why \nthose folks should not be working within months.\n\n  Last night, I shared with the Democratic and Republican staffs my \namendment, which would do the same thing as the Levin-Dole amendment \ndid last year. We were informed this morning that the Democratic staff \nhad been able to clear this amendment on this side. We were awaiting \nclearance on the Republican side.\n  Earlier today, Senator D'Amato offered an amendment on this subject. \nWe have now had a chance to review the D'Amato amendment. The D'Amato \namendment, with one or two very technical changes, is the Levin-Dole \namendment. So we are happy to cosponsor the D'Amato amendment. It is \nindeed the same amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be listed as a \ncosponsor of the D'Amato amendment immediately following Senator \nD'Amato's name.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, when the D'Amato amendment was offered, \nsince the Democratic staff had not had an opportunity to review the \namendment to see if it was the same amendment, to see whether or not it \ncould be cleared on this side, it was not cleared on this side at that \ntime. As I said, we have subsequently had the opportunity to read this \namendment. It is the same amendment.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment on \nbehalf of myself, Senators Craig, Grams, Coats, and Helms. The \namendment will help provide, Mr. President, homes for thousands of \nchildren who are waiting to be adopted in this country. This amendment \nis the same amendment which was agreed to by a vote of 93 to 5 right \nhere in the Senate during its consideration of welfare reform this past \nfall.\n  Mr. President, this strong bipartisan vote shows that the Senate is \ncommitted--committed--to making adoption more affordable for working \nfamilies in America.\n  Mr. President, regardless of what kind of welfare reform we pass in \nthis Chamber, the grim reality is that the out-of-wedlock birthrate in \nthis country is projected to reach 50 percent very soon after the turn \nof the century, which is only a few years away.\n  Mr. President, we are not far from having one out of every two \nchildren born in this country born into a home where there is no \nfather. That is a profound change in our culture which will have \nenormous consequences for American society as we have known it. One of \nthese consequences, no doubt, will be an increase in the number of \nchildren neglected and, yes, abandoned. It is therefore more important \nthan ever--more important than ever--for us to help find ways to \nprovide for these children.\n  Mr. President, study after study shows and common sense tells us that \na child is much better off being adopted by a stable, two-parent family \nthan being shipped around from foster homes to State agencies, and back \nagain. There are currently hundreds of thousands of children in America \nwaiting to be adopted. But the current financial burden prevents many \nparents from doing so.\n  Many people do not realize how expensive it is to adopt a child. \nThere are many fees and costs involved with adopting a child, including \nmaternity home care, normal prenatal and hospital care for the mother \nand the child, preadoption foster care for an infant, ``home study'' \nfees and, yes, legal fees. These costs range anywhere from about \n$13,000 to $36,000 according to the National Council for Adoption.\n  Mr. President, I know of many families in my State, and perhaps your \nState, that would love to adopt a child into their family but simply do \nnot have $13,000, much less $36,000 to do so. As a result of this \nenormous cost, children are denied homes, and parents are denied \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today will help make \nadoption financially possible for many children and families. It \nprovides a $5,000 fully\n\n[[Page S8366]]\n\nrefundable tax credit for adoption expenses. It also provides that when \nan employer pays for adoption expenses incurred by an employee, the \nemployee does not have to count that assistance as income for taxable \npurposes.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this amendment provides that withdrawals from \nan IRA can be made penalty free and excluded from income if used for \nqualified adoption expenses. These measures are a first step in tearing \ndown the massive financial barriers to adoption in this country.\n  Mr. President, I believe the question before us today is not if the \nnumber of abandoned children is going to increase over the next few \nyears; no one disputes that. We know the answer to that. The real \nquestion for us to answer is, what are we going to do about it? This \namendment would be a big first start in America. I yield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I agree with my good friend, Senator Shelby, \nthat we need tax incentives to promote adoptions. Adoption is good for \nthe child, is good for the family, and it is good for society. It was \nfor this reason that the Finance Committee unanimously passed out of \ncommittee an adoption tax credit bill.\n  The Shelby amendment, unlike the Finance Committee adoption tax \ncredit bill, provides a refundable tax credit. The Finance Committee \ndecided against a refundable credit in its legislation because of the \nvery, very serious history of problems we have had with fraud in \nrefundable credits.\n  I also point out that unlike the Shelby amendment, the Finance \nCommittee bill, which, as I said, passed out of the committee \nunanimously, provides not only a $5,000 credit for non-special-needs \nadoptions, but also a $6,000 credit for special-needs adoptions. I \nthink this is a very important provision of this legislation that \naddresses a very, very special need.\n  Going back to the Shelby amendment, I must point out also that it is \nnot paid for. If the Shelby amendment were to pass, we would be \nrequired to find additional savings in the welfare bill of $1.515 \nbillion over the next 6 years. The Finance Committee bill, on the other \nhand, is fully offset.\n  Let me also say that I have been assured by the majority leader that \nhe will schedule the adoption tax credit legislation which passed out \nof the Finance Committee for floor consideration before the end of the \nyear.\n  Although I strongly support giving tax incentives for the promotion \nof adoptions, Senator Shelby's amendment is not germane to the welfare \nlegislation. Therefore, it is my intent when the time on this amendment \nhas expired to make a point of order.\n  Mr. SHELBY. The Senator from Delaware talked about refundables. Why \ndo we have in our bill a refundable tax credit? Basically, because many \nlow-income people in America want to adopt a child and would not have \nthe $5,000 tax liability, and thus would not benefit as much from the \nFinance Committee proposal. The adoption community supports our \nversion. I hope the Senate will continue to support it.\n  I yield back the remaining time, if the Senator from Delaware will \nyield back his time.\n  Mr. ROTH. I make the additional comment that under our legislation, \nthe tax credit can be carried over for 5 years. I believe, therefore, \nwe have addressed the problem about which Senator Shelby is concerned.\n  I yield back the balance of my time. It is my understanding the \nSenator has yielded back his time.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I make a point of order against the Shelby \namendment under sections 305 and 310 of the Budget Act on the grounds \nthat the amendment is not germane.\n  Since the amendment, if adopted, would reduce revenue by $1.515 \nbillion over the next 6 years, I also make a point of order against the \namendment under section 310(d)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to waive any provisions of the \nBudget Act which might impinge upon my amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Frist amendment is a sense of the \nSenate amendment which would state the view of Congress that the \nPresident should ensure that the Secretary of the Department of Health \nand Human Services approve some 22 welfare waiver requests submitted \nfrom 16 States.\n  I cannot support such a sweeping blanket amendment.\n  My own State of Michigan has a waiver application pending which was \nsubmitted late in June which contains some 75 individual waivers. This \nrequest has much merit. The proposal contains work requirements which \nseem to be similar to legislation which I succeeded in adding to the \nSenate-passed welfare reform bill last year and which I will offer to \nthis bill. However, we have not been given any opportunity to evaluate \nthe various waiver requests of the other 15 States embodied in this \namendment. We just do not know the details of welfare waiver \nsubmissions from Utah or Georgia or Kansas or Wyoming or other States \nincluded in the amendment.\n  The President and the Department of Health and Human Services have \napproved more than 60 waivers, more than any previous President. I \nsupport this kind of flexibility. I hope that before this session of \nCongress ends, we will have, in law, comprehensive bi-partisan welfare \nreform which makes such waivers unnecessary.\n  I want to comment on several other amendments to the pending \nlegislation.\n  I cannot support two Ashcroft amendments which would mandate that \nStates take specific actions with respect to drug testing and with \nrespect to recipients who have not immunized their children. The \nunderlying bill permits States to test welfare recipients for use of \nillegal drugs and to sanction recipients who test positive. The bill \nalso does not preclude States from sanctioning recipients who are \nnegligent in failing to properly immunize their children. Requiring \nStates to take these actions is not consistent with the intent of this \nlegislation which is to provide greater flexibility to the States to \nbetter design their specific welfare measures in ways that better suit \nneeds and circumstances in their States and localities.\n  I support the Graham amendment to strike certain provisions relative \nto legal, I repeat, legal, immigrants. The underlying bill goes too far \nbecause it would deny food stamps to severely disabled legal immigrants \nwho have worked, and then become disabled, and because it would take \nfood stamps away from legal immigrants, who waited their turn and came \nhere under the rules, retroactively. I will support a Feinstein \namendment which would make the prohibition against legal immigrants \nreceiving food stamp assistance prospective. That is more fair. That \nwill serve as a warning to future immigrants that they cannot expect to \nreceive these benefits, but it does not yank the rug out from under \nlegal immigrants who have played by the rules.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the country's primary welfare program--\naid to families with dependent children [AFDC]--is a failure, both for \nthose participating in it and for those paying for it. What started as \na well-intentioned program in the 1930's to help widows today has \nbecome an enormous program that takes basic American values--work, \nreward for work, family, and personal responsibility--and turns them on \ntheir head.\n  The incentives in the current welfare system contradict our shared \nvalues and motivates harmful behavior by welfare recipients. Today's \nwelfare program financially rewards parents who don't work, don't \nmarry, and have children out-of-wedlock.\n  The program is failing to move welfare recipients off dependency and \ninto the work force. It is a factor in the breakdown of two-parent \nfamilies and the buildup of teen pregnancy. AFDC started as a program \nto assist families in poverty but now is seen as a program that \nperpetuates poverty.\n  Mr. President, there is bipartisan agreement that our welfare system \nmust be changed so welfare incentives reward our society's shared \nvalues of work, marriage, and personal responsibility. Both parties \nhave included work requirements as integral parts of their welfare \nproposals. I believe that\n\n[[Page S8367]]\n\nDemocrats and Republicans alike wish to use our Nation's welfare \nprograms to combat social ills--particularly the growth in out-of-\nwedlock pregnancies among teenagers. I am convinced that members of \nboth parties are concerned with the impact of any type of welfare \nreform on children--who comprise 9 of the 14 million recipients of \nFederal AFDC dollars.\n  The first priority for welfare reform is to put welfare recipients to \nwork. The public demands that we stop giving cash to adults on welfare, \nand start giving them jobs, and they're right. Virtually all welfare \nexperts, both liberal and conservative, agree that work and its rewards \nare the solution to the welfare crisis.\n  We have considerable experience with work programs. The Job \nOpportunities Basic Skills Program, which has come to be known as JOBS, \nwas passed in 1988 under the leadership of Senator Moynihan. \nEvaluations of the JOBS Program that have been conducted have shown \nthat the programs have had some success; they have begun to make a \ndifference.\n  Our experience with that program has taught us several important \nlessons. First, programs that emphasize placing welfare recipients in \njobs as quickly as possible are the most successful and cost-effective. \nInevitably, setting placement as a priority creates a degree of \nconflict with other program goals such as assisting in training and \neducation. Yet, long delays in job placement can occur while welfare \nrecipients are routed through a succession of training programs.\n  Second, assessing recipients' individual needs and addressing those \nneeds is critical to placing them successfully. Do they have \nappropriate child care? Do they need supplementary education or \ntraining? Do they have the skills and ability necessary for the \nproposed job? Little purpose is served in placing a welfare recipient \nin a job if their child care needs can not be addressed, transportation \nto and from the job is unworkable, or special skills are needed.\n  Third, successful programs form strong links with local employers and \nwork hard to maintain those links with the local employers, who are the \nsource of the jobs. The work requirements in the bill before us will \napply to over 1.5 million adults. By comparison, approximately 4 \nmillion individuals currently work at or below the minimum wage. \nFinding jobs for an additional 1.5 million adults, without simply \ndisplacing current workers, is going to be a massive challenge.\n\n  I am pleased that the current legislation includes funds for a \nperformance bonus to States that move people into real jobs and off of \nwelfare. In the current welfare system, income maintenance is the \nfocus--processing applications and mailing checks to people. The \nwelfare proposals that I voted against last fall, equated reform with \nsavings rather than returning recipients to work. We must change that \nfocus, and put a premium on getting people into the work force, where \ntheir lives can be sounder on a sounder foundation. States that embrace \nthe ``work first'' philosophy and turn their welfare systems into \neffective employment offices ought to be rewarded. Otherwise, a welfare \nmaintenance system will be perpetuated.\n  The performance bonus requires the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices (HHS) to develop and publish a formula that allocates the \nbonus fund to States based on the number of welfare recipients who \nbecome ineligible for cash assistance because of employment in an \nunsubsidized job. The incentive payments provided by this amendment \nwill be distributed based on the State's success in getting long-term \nrecipients off welfare and into lasting jobs and on the unemployment \nconditions of a State.\n  I am also pleased to introduce amendments to reduce teen pregnancy \nand help young mothers and their children avoid the cycle of long-term \nwelfare dependency. As part of last year's welfare debate, I joined \nwith Senator Conrad to introduce an amendment that proposed numerous \nprovisions to prevent teen pregnancy. Most of the provisions in that \namendment are included in the bill before us, and I appreciate that \nvery much. The legislation requires teen mothers to live at home or in \nsafe, adult-supervised living arrangements--so-called second chance \nhomes. It establishes national goals regarding education strategies and \nreduction of pregnancy rates. It includes a sense of the Senate \nprovision attacking pregnancies that result from statutory rape.\n  However, there is more that can be done. The birth rate for single \nteenage parents has tripled since 1960, signaling that the battle \nagainst teenage pregnancy is ever more critical. The power to change \nany community must involve an internal structure at the grassroots \nlevel. The battle against teenage pregnancy must begin at the local \nlevel, because changing the attitudes and behavior of teens requires an \nintimate, hands-on involvement.\n  My amendment requires States to dedicate 3 percent of their share of \nthe title XX social service block grant--an amount equal to $71.4 \nmillion--to programs and services that stress to minors the difficulty \nof being a teenage parent. By teaching minors to delay parenthood, \nthese programs will infuse our children with a clear understanding of \nthe consequences of teenage childbearing.\n  I will also offer an amendment to reduce the incidence of statutory \nrape in the Nation which many studies link to teenage pregnancies in \nthe Nation.\n  Shockingly, the majority of the men who father the families of \nteenage mothers are adults. The National Center for Health and \nStatistics reported in 1991 that almost 70 percent of births to teenage \ngirls were fathered by men age 20 or older. Moreover, the younger the \nmother, the greater the age gap between her and the father. There are \nmen who are impregnating girls age 14 and younger, and they are on \naverage 10 to 15 years older, according to a 1990 study by \nthe California Vital Statistics Section. Similar studies bear out this \nresult.\n\n  These adult men are impregnating an increasing number of girls age \n11-14. Despite a slight drop in the overall teen birth rate in the last \nfew years, the birth rate for girls age 14 and under increased 26 \npercent in the late 1980's. These girls are not just young mothers--\nthey are children. And sexual predators are taking advantage of their \ninability to form and articulate a decision about their bodies. In \norder to choose abstinence for young girls and to make this choice \nclear to adult men, the Federal Government must focus some resources on \npredatory adult men in order to both stop and hopefully dissuade them \nfrom their illegal behavior.\n  Kathleen Sylvester of the Progressive Policy Institute says that the \nmost recent research indicates that in those States where awareness of \nthis problem has been raised, prosecutors have organized themselves to \nbe aggressive and obtained adequate sentences for convicted offenders. \nCalifornia, Connecticut, and New York have all established special \nunits in their district attorneys' offices to target sexual predators \nand counsel their victims. Florida is getting tough as well. Pending \nlegislation would charge a man over the age of 18 who has intercourse \nwith a girl under the age of 15 with second-degree statutory rape, a \nfelony. To spur the other States to follow their example and stop these \ncriminals, the Federal Government must send them unequivocal proof that \nwe are serious in this intent.\n  To this end, I applaud the inclusion in the present bill that it is \nthe sense of the Senate that States should aggressively enforce \nstatutory rape laws. I propose an amendment which would add three \nadditional steps for us to take. First, it appropriates $6 million to \nthe Attorney General of the United States to fight statutory rape, \nparticularly by predatory older men who commit repeat offenses. The \nappropriation will enable the Justice Department to pay strict \nattention to the crime of statutory rape, as part of its violence \nagainst women initiative. The money should be used to research both the \nlinkage between statutory rape and teen pregnancy, as well as those \npredatory older men who are repeat offenders. It should also provide \nfor the education of State and local law enforcement officials on the \nprevention and prosecution of statutory rape.\n  Second, my amendment requires the States to work to reduce the \nincidence of statutory rape. Activities would include the expansion of \ncriminal law enforcement, public education, and counseling services, as \nwell as the restructuring of teen pregnancy prevention\n\n[[Page S8368]]\n\nprograms to include men. Third, it requires States to certify to the \nFederal Government that they are engaged in such activities to stop \nstatutory rape.\n  A 1992 sampling of 500 teen mothers revealed that two-thirds had \nhistories of sexual abuse with adult men averaging age 27. Another \nstudy conducted in Washington State studied 535 teen mothers and \ndiscovered that 62 percent of them experienced rape or molestation \nbefore their first pregnancy, and the mean age of the offenders was 27. \nClearly, the reality of mothers sacrificing educational opportunities \nto give birth to fatherless babies and live in poverty is not a choice \nbut a symptom and a result of a greater problem. Large numbers of older \nmen are crossing legal and social boundaries to engage in sexual \nactivity with girls below the age of consent, and thereby emotionally \nrob them of their power to say ``no'' in later years.\n  This bill makes strides in demanding the responsibility of fathers. \nIt stipulates and enforces their duty to own up to their paternity, to \npay child support, and to set a good example for their children by \nworking in private sector or community service jobs. It should further \nimpress upon a certain group of men their duty to refrain from sexually \npreying on young girls and dispossessing them of their fundamental \nright to make sexual, educational, and career choices.\n  Although the American public supports tough welfare measures, they \nare reluctant to cut people off and leave defenseless children without \nsome means of basic support. Welfare reform, therefore, must balance \ncutbacks with programs that create training and employment \nopportunities. The reform movement must include a component that \nprovides those on public assistance with the necessary skills and \ntraining required to genuinely compete in the work force. Welfare \nreform demands accountability not just from the poor, but from \ngovernment as well.\n  The Senate bill is better than the House bill in many ways. Welfare \nmust change to focus on work and on personal responsibility--but it \nneed not be unfair to children. The Senate bill contains more funding \nfor child care, it maintains existing child protection programs such as \nadoption assistance, foster care, and child abuse and neglect. It does \nnot require, but gives States the option to employ a family cap and to \ndeny payments to minor, single mothers, and it does not allow States to \npenalize mothers who can't work because they can't find or afford child \ncare.\n  There are still serious problems with the Senate bill most of which \nhave to do with the prospects for children who parents are not acting \nresponsibly.\n  Under the proposed bill, States can opt out of the Federal Food Stamp \nProgram and receive a State block grant. This provision will put many \npoor children and elderly at risk. Under a flat block grant, States \nwill be unable to meet the needs of poor families during periods of \nrecession or high unemployment. The Food Research and Action Center \nestimates that S. 1795 will reduce food and nutrition assistance to 14 \nmillion children and 2 million elderly persons due to the overall cuts \nin the Federal Food Stamp Program.\n  The bill repeals the Mickey Leland Child Hunger Relief Act which \nremoved the cap on the food stamp shelter deduction for low income \nfamilies. Food stamp shelter deduction provides families who are not \nreceiving housing aid additional food stamp benefits. The Senate \nFinance-passed bill will reduce cash assistance for families who \nqualify for this deduction--forcing them to choose between providing \nfood for their children or paying the rent.\n  The new legislation will also have a very unfair and potentially very \nharmful impact on nearly a million legal immigrants. The bill bans \nlegal immigrants, many of whom have been here over 10 years, from the \nSupplemental Security Income [SSI] assistance program, Medicaid and \nfood stamps. Recipients of SSI, most of who are poor elderly or \ndisabled immigrants will remain impoverished. The rapid phase-in-period \nwill leave many who are currently receiving assistance without any \nbasic means of support.\n  The bill also does little to maintain a contingency fund and serious \nmaintenance of effort requirements for the States. And it fails to \nprovide sufficient bonuses to States that are successful in moving \nwelfare recipients into unsubsidized jobs.\n  This bill is far from perfect, but it can bring some measure of \nconsistency back to our values and the incentives in our welfare \nsystem. It can lead a national effort to cut down on the number of \npeople on the welfare rolls and add to the number in to jobs. It can \nattack the intertwined problems of teenage pregnancy and welfare \ndependency.\n  There is a tragic link between welfare and a host of other problems \nfacing our society today, including crime, illegitimacy, drug abuse, \npoverty, and illiteracy. This legislation attempts to severe that link. \nIn effect, we're trying to destroy the welfare cycle and return welfare \nto its original purpose--a temporary form of assistance for the very \npoor as they seek to work their way out of hard times.\n  If the promise of the legislation is realized, millions of American \nfamilies will move off welfare into real jobs, and we will see a \nresulting decrease in poverty, crime, illegitimacy, and an increase in \neconomic development and family stability.\n  I hope that my amendments will be adopted so that we can obtain \nimprovements in the conference committee with the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n\n                   ASSETS FOR INDEPENDENCE AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, many of the congressional efforts at \nreforming the welfare system have focused on the elimination of the \nFederal bureaucracy, the devolution of Federal authority, and the \ntransfer of funds to the State bureaucracy. In some respects, these \nreforms may be effective and efficient. In other areas, the devolution \nwill prove too limited in that authority and funds remain remote from \nthe people and communities who would most benefit from change and who \nare most capable of effecting that change.\n  Devolution to the States almost certainly will not change one \ncritical flaw in traditional welfare programs--a focus on income \nmaintenance and spending instead of a focus on asset-building and \nsaving. The current welfare system in fact punishes the accumulation of \nassets by terminating eligibility for assistance when minimal asset \nlevels are achieved.\n  There is then a need to help low-income individuals and families, \nwhether working or on welfare, to develop and reaffirm strong habits \nfor saving money and to invest that money in assets rather than \nspending it on consumer goods or other items that may not help lift the \nindividual or family from poverty. There is particularly a need to \nfocus on the building of assets whose high return on investment propels \nthem into economic independence and personal and familial stability.\n  In addition, there is a recognized need to help revitalize low-income \ncommunities by reducing welfare rolls and increasing tax receipts, \nemployment, and business activity with local enterprises and builders.\n  Mr. President, the assets for independence amendment approved by the \nSenate yesterday would allow States to use part of their block grant \nmoneys to establish an individual development account [IDA] savings \naccounts to help welfare recipients and low-income families build the \nfamily's assets and strengthen its ability to remain independent from \nGovernment income-maintenance programs.\n  In some respects, IDA's are like IRA's for the working poor. \nInvestments using assets from IDA savings accounts are strictly limited \nto three purposes: purchase of home, post-secondary education, or \nbusiness capitalization. These purposes are connected with extremely \nhigh returns on investment and can propel both the communities and the \nfamilies benefiting from the home, education, or small business into a \nnew economic and personal prosperity.\n  Just how might an IDA work? The individual or family deposits \nwhatever they can save--typically $5 to $20 a month--in the account. \nThe sponsoring organization matches that deposit with funds provided by \nlocal churches and service organizations, corporations, foundations, \nand State or local governments. With Federal block granted welfare \nfunds, a State match of these deposits can also be deposited in the \naccount.\n  Just what are some of those benefits? Most fundamentally, \nparticipants will develop and reaffirm strong habits for\n\n[[Page S8369]]\n\nsaving money. To assist this, sponsor organizations will provide \nparticipating individuals and families intensive financial counseling \nand counseling to develop investment plans for education, home \nownership, and entrepreneurship.\n  In addition, participating welfare and low-income families build \nassets whose high return on investment propels them into independence \nand stability. The community will also benefit from the significant \nreturn on an investment in IDA's: We can expect welfare rolls to be \nreduced; tax receipts to increase; employment to increase; and local \nenterprises and builders can expect increased business activity. \nNeighborhoods will be rejuvenated as new microenterprises and increased \nhome renovation and building drive increased employment and community \ndevelopment.\n  In fact, it is estimated that an investment of $100 million in asset \nbuilding through these individual accounts would generate 7,050 new \nbusinesses, 68,799 new job years, $730 million in additional earnings, \n12,000 new or rehabilitated homes, $287 million in savings and matching \ncontributions and earnings on those accounts, $188 million in increased \nassets for low-income families, 6,600 families removed from welfare \nrolls, 12,000 youth graduates from vocational education and college \nprograms, 20,000 adults obtaining high school, vocational, and college \ndegrees.\n\n  Source: Corporation for Enterprise Development, ``The Return of the \nDream: An Analysis of the Probable Economic Return on a National \nInvestment in Individual Development Accounts,'' May 1995.\n  IDA's are planned or now available on a small scale across the \ncountry, including Indiana, Illinois, Virginia, Oregon, and Iowa. The \nassets for independence amendment has been developed after a review of \nnumerous, similar, successful programs, and most notably one run by the \nEastside Community Investments community development corporation in \nIndianapolis, IN. The amendment incorporates a number of protections \ndeveloped with their assistance and based on their experience. For \nexample, accounts will be held in a trust. In addition, sponsor \norganizations must cosign any withdrawal of funds; withdrawals are \nstrictly limited to home purchase, education, and microenterprise.\n  I challenge this Congress to consider the $5.4 trillion we have spent \non welfare programs in the past 30 years. Have these programs that \nfocus on income maintenance been successful? Do we honestly believe \nthat we can give money to low-income citizens and have them spend their \nway out of poverty? Or is it time to consider a new approach, not just \nan approach that focuses on a Federal bureaucracy or even a substituted \nState bureaucracy, but an approach that empowers families and \ncommunities directly to build assets with high returns on investment--\nreturns whose economic and personal growth approaches the exponential?\n  The assets for independence amendment does just this. It does not \nconcentrate on Government programs but focuses on community efforts to \nput high-return assets in the hands of families. I am very pleased that \nwe have included it in this vital legislation.\n\n\n                   Coats-Wyden Kinship Care Amendment\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Coats-Wyden \nkinship care amendment, which was agreed to by the Senate last night. I \nwould like to thank my colleague, Senator Coats, for his assistance \nwith this important amendment.\n  Grandparents caring for grandchildren represent an underappreciated \nnatural resource in our Nation. They hold tremendous potential for \ncuring one of our society's most pressing maladies: The care of \nchildren who have no parents, or whose parents simply aren't up to the \ntask of providing children a stable, secure, and nurturing living \nenvironment.\n  There is such a great reservoir of love and experience available to \nus, and more especially to the tens of thousands of American children \nwho desperately need basic care giving. We provide public assistance to \nstrangers for this kind of care, but the folks available to provide \nfoster care homes are in short supply.\n  It is time that States and the Federal Government begin to promote \npolicies that open doors to relatives who are ready, willing and able \nto care for these children. Some States have already been moving in \nthis direction for over a decade. Over the past 10 years the number of \nchildren involved in extended family arrangements has increased by 40 \npercent. Currently, more than 3 million children are being raised by \ntheir grandparents. In other words, 5 percent of all families in this \ncountry are headed by grandparents.\n  However, in many places States still lack a system that includes \nrelatives in the decisionmaking process when children are removed from \nthe home. I have heard case after case of relatives who never heard \nfrom the child protection agency when a grandchild or other related \nchild was removed from the home. Once the child was taken, extended \nfamily members had no contact and no way of finding out what then \nhappened to the children. Sometimes brothers and sisters have been \nseparated and a grandparent has spent years in court trying to reunite \ntheir family.\n  I have repeatedly heard the frustration of grandparents whose \ngrandchildren, as far as they knew, disappeared in the night, and once \nthe children entered the State child protection system they literally \ndisappeared from their families' lives.\n  The amendment that we proposed, similar to one that was adopted by \nthe House last spring, and to language that has been in almost every \nwelfare bill since then, would give relatives preference over stranger \ncaregivers when the State determines where to place a child who has \nbeen removed from the home. It's time we start developing policies that \nmake it easier, instead of more difficult, for families to come \ntogether to raise their children.\n  As we rethink our child protection system, we need to rededicate \nourselves to looking to families, including extended families, for \nsolutions. When a child is separated from their parents, it is usually \na painful and traumatic experience. Living with people that a child \nknows and trusts gives children a better chance in the world and gives \nfamilies a better chance to rebuild themselves.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from across the aisle, Senator Coats, for \nhis help with this amendment.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

After extensive negotiations over the past year with \nthe Department of the Interior, the affected States, and the industry, \nthe Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Fairness Act is now before the Senate \nfor final passage. This bipartisan reform of the Federal Royalty \nProgram is identical to the version passed by the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee in May.\n  The Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Fairness Act will result in a \nsimpler, fairer and more cost effective way to administer oil and gas \nroyalty collections on Federal lands. This is important legislation for \nthe independent producers in New Mexico and for independent producers \nthroughout the Nation.\n  The bill, H.R. 1975, amends the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty \nManagement Act of 1982 with respect to royalty collections on Federal \nlands and the Outer Continental Shelf. It does not apply to Indian \nlands.\n  The bill establishes a statute of limitations to ensure royalty \naudits and collections are final within 7 years from the date of \nproduction; establishes reciprocity with respect to payment of interest \non royalty overpayments and underpayments; simplifies\n\n[[Page S8370]]\n\nrecordkeeping and reporting requirements; and expands the Federal \nroyalty functions that may be delegated to a qualifying State.\n  In short, The Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness \nAct will streamline the process, reduce the burden on industry while \nprotecting the revenues of New Mexico and the Federal Government. I \nworked hard to make this a bill the President would sign. I urge that \nwe pass this bill as soon as possible and send it to the President for \nhis signature.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am very concerned as to how the \ncurrent airport safety situation may affect smaller airports. We \ncertainly want our citizens who must fly in smaller airplanes with \nsmaller companies to be safe. On the other hand, we do not want such an \nexpensive layer of regulations that these smaller planes and smaller \ncompanies cannot operate because of prohibitive costs.\n  As we go forward with improving safety, I think of the smaller \nairports in South Dakota where people must fly in smaller aircraft and \nwith smaller companies. We must keep those safe. We must meet the same \nstandards applying to larger aircraft and larger companies. But let us \nremember that one size does not fit all. In achieving these safety \ngoals, let us be certain we keep in mind the smaller airports of our \ncountry. This is a concern not only in South Dakota but also in Fresno, \nCA, for example, where I have relatives. People must fly in smaller \naircraft if they are going to travel from Los Angeles to Fresno. \nUpstate New York has the same situation. If you are going to fly to \nMartha's Vineyard, you probably fly on a smaller aircraft.\n  So the point is that as we move forward quickly in possibly \nimplementing new regulations, let us be certain we keep in mind the \nfact that at least half of Americans must originate their flights in \nwhat we call smaller airports. I certainly want them to be considered \nin this process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/19/senate-section/article/S8370-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

GILROY DALY\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to a great \npublic servant and one of the most honorable figures ever to serve on \nthe Federal bench in the State of Connecticut, U.S. district judge T.F. \nGilroy Daly, who died of cancer on Thursday, July 14.\n  A true giant of jurisprudence, Judge Daly was a former Army Ranger \nwho stood 6 foot, 6 inches and presided over his courtroom with a regal \npresence. People commonly described Judge Daly as the epitome of what a \njudge should be. He was known for his impeccable character, his sense \nof fairness, and his unwavering commitment to the ideals of justice.\n  Judge Daly brought a wealth of life experience to the court, which \nshaped his career on the bench. After serving our country in the Korean \nwar, Judge Daly worked as an assistant U.S. attorney, prosecuting \norganized crime cases in the Southern District of New York. After \nleaving the Justice Department, Judge Daly held a number of full and \npart time statewide posts in Connecticut, including deputy attorney \ngeneral, deputy treasurer, and insurance commissioner.\n  Judge Daly gained prominence as a trial lawyer and demonstrated his \nsense of justice in the early 1970s when he took an unpaid leave from \nhis State position to defend a young man who had been wrongly convicted \nof murder. After a 6-week hearing, he won a new trial for his client, \nand charges against the young man were eventually dropped after a grand \njury investigation cleared him.\n  In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed Judge Daly to the Federal \nbench. he served as chief judge from 1983 to 1988, and he is credited \nwith modernizing the Connecticut court system and significantly \nreducing the backlog of cases before the court. During his time on the \nbench, he presided over a number of high-profile trials and earned a \nreputation among defense attorneys and prosecuters as a stern, but \nfair-minded jurist. He ruled on numerous complex and potentially \nvolatile issues involving discrimination in municipal hiring, State \npolice interrogation methods, and public corruption.\n  He was particularly known for handing down harsh sentences to corrupt \npublic officials who came before him. Being a man of such high moral \nstandards, Judge Daly held a particular disdain for anyone who betrayed \nthe trust of the general public. Judge Daly believed that without the \npeople's trust, government cannot function effectively, and his career \nwas dedicated to maintaining the integrity of the Constitution and \nprotecting the rights of the general public.\n  Judge T.F. Gilroy Daly never lost sight of the fact that law is a \npublic service profession, and his legacy will live on for years to \ncome. He will be remembered as one of the most accomplished figures \never to preside in a Federal court, and he will be sorely missed by the \npeople of Connecticut.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Stuart, and his four \nchildren Timothy, Loan, Matthew and Anna.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/19/senate-section/article/S8370-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8370-S8372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRANSPORTATION EMPOWERMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced legislation entitled \nthe Transportation Empowerment Act which will return primary \ntransportation program responsibility and taxing authority to the \nStates. I intend to be brief today. But, I will be back on the floor to \nspeak to this proposal periodically over the remainder of the Congress \nand again early in the next Congress as debate begins in earnest on the \nreauthorization of the transportation bill known as the Intermodal \nSurface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA].\n  The era of Big Government is over. The highway system is a relic of \nthis era and a perfect example of a program that ought to be returned \nto the States.\n  In the 1950's, the Federal Government began building the Interstate \nHighway System. Its construction was slated to last 13 years and cost \n$25 billion. It has lasted 40 years at a cost of about $130 billion. At \nthe same time, the Federal-Aid Highways Program was also expanded to \ninclude more than $170 billion in other programs and projects.\n  The antiquated system of collecting and distributing gas tax dollars \nto fund these programs as well as the transportation priorities of the \nStates and local governments is inefficient, costly, and bureaucratic.\n  The Interstate Highway System is complete. Now it's time to change \ndirections to provide State and local governments the authority and the \nflexibility to move forward without succumbing to the bureaucratic \nwhims of Washington.\n  This legislation does just that--it re-empowers States to make their \nown decisions. This bill uses a 2-year transition period to lower the \nFederal gas tax, eliminate most highway trust fund programs, relieve \nStates of an array of regulations and restrictions, and remove Federal \nroadblocks to infrastructure privatization.\n  This proposal provides that the Federal Government would retain a \ncore Federal transportation program including maintenance of the \ncurrent Interstate System. Federal participation would also continue \nfor Indian reservation roads, public lands, parkways and park roads, \nand emergency relief.\n  The bottom line is this--for far too long Washington has had a \nstranglehold on States' transportation needs. It's past time for \nWashington to let go and let the States take responsibility for their \nown surface transportation needs.\n  Mr. President, I have included several letters on this issue which I \nhave previously sent to my Senate colleagues and I ask unanimous \nconsent\n\n[[Page S8371]]\n\nthat they be printed in the Record. I also ask unanimous consent that a \nsummary of this legislation be printed in the Record.\n  I ask my colleagues to review this proposal and to consider joining \nme as a cosponsor of this legislation which will re-empower States and \nend Washington's micromanagement of States' transportation dollars and \npriorities.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington DC, March 7, 1996.\n       Dear Colleague: Several weeks ago, I sent you a letter \n     informing you of my plan to introduce legislation which \n     largely repeals the federal gas tax and returns the primary \n     transportation program responsibility and taxing authority to \n     the states. I am currently drafting this legislation as well \n     as exploring options to ensure a smooth transition from a \n     federal to a state program.\n       In light of this effort, I thought you might be interested \n     in the attached article which highlights a major problem with \n     the current federal transportation system.\n       This article, from the February 23, 1996 edition of the \n     ``American Association of State Highway and Transportation \n     Officials (AASHTO) Weekly Transportation Report,'' contains \n     excerpts of a speech by Deputy Highway Administrator, Jane \n     Garvey. Ms. Garvey predicted future transportation funding \n     will fall dramatically short of previous years' levels and \n     she further indicated future transportation funding will be \n     spent on non-transportation priorities.\n       Our states have consistently asked that their highway trust \n     fund dollars be reserved for infrastructure requirements and \n     that they be returned unencumbered by federal restrictions \n     and mandates. It is my belief this request can only be \n     accomplished by removing these transportation dollars from \n     the federal coffers. The simple fact is that, if left in \n     federal hands, these funds will always be a temptation for a \n     Congress which must contend with competing priorities and \n     declining discretionary funding levels.\n       I hope you will consider the benefits of returning \n     transportation program responsibility and primary taxing \n     authority to the states and join me in this effort. Should \n     your staff have any questions or comments, please have them \n     contact Patrick Kearney of my staff at 224-3102.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Connie Mack,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                           The AASHTO Journal,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 23, 1996.\n\n           Less Funding, More Alternative Financing Predicted\n\n       Predicting lean years ahead for federal transportation \n     funding, Jane Garvey, Deputy Administrator, of the Federal \n     Highway Administration, this week outlined alternatives for \n     funding future transportation projects, and some of the \n     issues the Administration will address in reauthorization of \n     federal transportation programs.\n       Garvey discussed the status of the Administration's FY 1997 \n     budget proposal and provided a future outlook for \n     transportation funding during a Women in Transportation \n     Seminar luncheon on Wednesday. She said that the budget \n     submitted by the Administration on February 6 provided a \n     broad framework of the cuts the Administration hopes to \n     achieve next fiscal year. She added that specific figures as \n     to how transportation funding would be affected have not been \n     made available.\n       Garvey stated that the President would submit a detailed \n     budget proposal on March 18, and that representatives from \n     the FHWA would be appearing before the House Transportation \n     Appropriations Subcommittee on March 20 to discuss their \n     budget proposal (see related article).\n       Contending that transportation made out well during FY \n     1996, Garvey predicted that future funding levels will fall \n     dramatically short of previous years' levels. All \n     discretionary funding categories are expected to take a hit \n     in FY 1997, Garvey stated, and infrastructure spending will \n     have to compete with other priorities. She added that an 18 \n     percent reduction in transportation spending between FY 1997 \n     and FY 2002 is expected, from $38.9 billion in FY 1996 to $32 \n     billion in 2002.\n       To address this situation, Garvey stated that it was \n     essential for federal, state and local transportation \n     organizations to convey how important the nation's \n     transportation system is to the welfare of the economy and \n     its citizens. In addition, states and localities must be able \n     to maximize what funding is made available to them to the \n     greatest extend possible, according to Garvey.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 1996.\n       Dear Colleague: Soon after the Senate returns from the \n     President's Day recess, I will introduce legislation to \n     substantially reduce the federal role in transportation and \n     return the primary program responsibility and taxing \n     authority to the states. At a time when Governors and \n     Congressional leaders are talking about providing greater \n     freedom for states, it just does not make sense to continue \n     the current system.\n       States do no want to receive transportation funding with \n     federal strings attached. They do not want restrictions on \n     how transportation funding can be spent and have funding \n     withheld for noncompliance with mandates. Moreover, Governors \n     are rightly concerned over the prospect of seeing more of \n     their transportation funding diverted to other spending \n     programs. Congress' record in this regard is abysmal and is \n     unlikely to improve as other priorities compete for budget \n     dollars in the future.\n       The legislation I plan to introduce will leave in place \n     those portions of the gas tax set aside for deficit reduction \n     as well as a few additional cents to sponsor a modest federal \n     program. This federal program will be comprised of the \n     Interstate Maintenance, Interstate Bridges, Federal Lands and \n     Emergency Disaster programs.\n       The remainder of the tax will be repealed after DOT has met \n     all of its current obligations. DOT has estimated these \n     obligations will be met approximately 15 months after the \n     expiration of the existing authorization. This time delay \n     provides states ample time to take whatever actions may be \n     necessary to implement their own funding measures.\n       We need to return primary program responsibility and taxing \n     authority for transportation programs to the states. I look \n     forward to having you join me in this effort. If your staff \n     has any questions or comments, please have them contact \n     Patrick Kearney of my staff at 224-3102.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Connie Mack,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 1996.\n\n                 Off Budget--a Symptom or the Solution?\n\n       Dear Colleague: Last week the House of Representatives \n     voted by a wide margin to remove the transportation trust \n     funds from the Unified Budget. This vote reflected the \n     frustration of the House members, and their respective \n     states, with the manner in which the federal government \n     manages transportation spending. However, in my view the \n     legislation approved by the House is not a solution to the \n     core problem--a federally run transportation program.\n       Before developing a solution the problem must be defined. \n     And, the problem is much greater than that suggested by the \n     House legislation. It is, in fact, a three part problem \n     consisting of:\n       Withholding our state's gas tax dollars; Redistributing \n     states' gas tax dollars; and Federal micro-management.\n       Regrettably, the House-passed legislation only addresses \n     the first of these parts and ignores the other two. It fails \n     to address the redistribution of states' contributions to the \n     trust fund which strikes me as peculiar now that the \n     Interstate system is complete. Additionally, the House \n     legislation doesn't address federal micro-management of this \n     funding which has plagued our states' transportation \n     officials for years. The legacy of a program run through the \n     federal government is one which has provided: funding \n     restrictions on various program areas, mandatory spending \n     requirements with penalties for non-compliance, and redundant \n     administrative requirements.\n       For these reasons, I ask you to consider a real solution \n     rather than simply alleviating one symptom. Please join me \n     and consider exploring a truly off-budget proposal, one that \n     phases out most of the federal transportation program and \n     returns transportation program responsibility and primary \n     taxing authority to the states.\n           Sincerely,\n     Connie Mack.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1996.\n     ``Turning Back'' the Highway Trust Fund\n       Dear Colleague: Over the last several months I have written \n     to you on a number of occasions regarding proposed \n     legislation to return primary transportation program \n     responsibility and taxing authority to the states. Attached \n     is a summary of this legislation which I plan to introduce \n     next week.\n       With the completion of the Interstate System, it is time \n     for us to examine the lessons of the past and explore our \n     options for the future. Although it was initially envisioned \n     as a ten year, $30 billion highway program, the Federal Aid \n     Highway program exploded into one that has lasted 40 years \n     and has cost nearly $300 billion. Additionally, the existing \n     program is plagued by an enormous bureaucracy that inhibits \n     states' flexibility and withholds states' scarce \n     transportation dollars.\n       Rather than continue the tired and troubled practices of \n     the past, shouldn't we as a Nation look for a better way to \n     address our infrastructure needs? I believe the legislation I \n     am proposing will allow states to better serve the driving \n     public as we head into the 21st Century.\n       It is my intention to introduce this legislation early in \n     the week of July 15, 1996. Congressman John Kasich (R-OH) \n     will be introducing companion legislation in the House of \n     Representatives. If you wish to be an original cosponsor of \n     this legislation please contact my office by Friday, July 12, \n     1996. Should your staff have any questions or require \n     additional information please do not hesitate to have them \n     call Patrick Kearney of my staff (x4-3102).\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Connie Mack,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n[[Page S8372]]\n\n  Transportation Empowerment Act--Senator Connie Mack. Representative \n                              John Kasich\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       The Federal government collects about $24 billion in \n     dedicated transportation taxes, skims money off the top for \n     demonstration projects, skims more of the top to fund the \n     Washington highway bureaucracy, runs the remainder through a \n     maze of formulas, and then returns gas taxes of the states. \n     Understandably, states complain that this approach is \n     needlessly complicated and denies them the funding \n     flexibility and stability they deserve.\n       The Mack/Kasish bill re-empowers states in transportation \n     financing and decision making. Our bill uses a two-year \n     transition period to lower the Federal gas tax, eliminate \n     most highway trust fund programs, relieve states of myriad \n     federal restrictions and regulations, and remove federal \n     roadblocks to infrastructure privatization. Each state would \n     be free to replace the Federal gas tax and keep those dollars \n     within the state.\n       The Mack/Kasich legislation retains federal oversight of \n     the maintenance of the current interstate system. Federal \n     programs also remain in place for Indian reservation roads, \n     public lands, parkways and park roads, and emergency relief. \n     The Mack/Kasich bill also creates an Infrastructure Special \n     Assistance Fund for critical programs the Congress may elect \n     to fund, including providing transitional assistance.\n\n\n                             implementation\n\n       This legislation provides a two year transition. During the \n     transition period of fiscal years 1998 and 1999, this \n     legislation keeps in place the current 14 cents gas tax \n     dedicated to transportation purposes.\n       7 cents in 1998 and 2 cents in 1999 are dedicated to the \n     remaining downsized federal program, to pay off existing \n     obligations, and to fund the Infrastructure Special \n     Assistance Fund.\n       The remainder of the gas tax (7 cents in 1998 and 12 cents \n     in 1999) is returned to the states in a block grant based on \n     their contributions to the trust fund. The block grant could \n     be used for transportation purposes without restriction from \n     Washington.\n       At the beginning of fiscal year 2000, the federal gas tax \n     is reduced to 2 cents.\n       This two-year transition gives states time to prepare to \n     regain control over their highway program and raise their \n     state gas taxes if they choose. Any money collected would \n     stay within the state to be used as the state sees fit \n     without restriction from Washington.\n\n\n                            other provisions\n\n       The Mack/Kasich legislation acknowledges that states will \n     need to cooperate on many transportation issues. The bill \n     authorizes states to establish multi-state ``compacts'' for \n     planning, financing and establishing safety and construction \n     standards.\n       The legislation will encourage innovative approaches on the \n     part of the states, such as use of infrastructure banks and \n     privatization. The bill repeals the requirement that states \n     repay federal grants associated with transportation \n     infrastructure which is slated for privatization.\n       This legislation only addresses gas taxes currently \n     dedicated to transportation purposes. it does not address the \n     4.3 cents currently dedicated to deficit reduction.\n       Currently, other transportation funding ``reform'' \n     proposals are being discussed on the Hill. Generally, these \n     proposals seek to reform the highway program by increasing \n     flexibility and revising current formula which returns gas \n     tax dollars to the states. However, because gas taxes would \n     continue to be funneled through Washington, these formulas \n     invite the re-emergence of Washington micro management and \n     changes to the formulas in future authorizing legislation.\n       The Mack/Kasich bill permanently returns control over \n     America's infrastructure to the states by phasing out much of \n     the Federal program and reducing the gas tax. This greatly \n     reduces the risk of Washington micro management in the \n     future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/19/senate-section/article/S8370-4", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/19/senate-section/article/S8372-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8372-S8373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-3454.

A bill to amend the Competitive, Special, and Facilities \nResearch Grant Act to provide increased emphasis on competitive grants \nto promote agricultural research projects regarding precision \nagriculture and to provide for the dissemination of the results of the \nresearch projects, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n    the precision agriculture research, education, and information \n                       dissemination act of 1996\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today several colleagues and I \nare introducing the Precision Agriculture Research, Education, and \nInformation Dissemination Act of 1996.\n  This legislation emphasizes research on precision agriculture \ntechnologies. These technologies are very existing and will enable the \nUnited States to maintain and augment our competitive edge in global \nagricultural markets. The legislation amends the Competitive, Special \nand Facilities Research Grant Act of 1965 by modifying the National \nResearch Initiative [NRI] to give the Secretary of Agriculture \nauthority to provide research, extension, and education competitive \ngrants and programs that emphasize precision agriculture technologies \nand management practices.\n  This legislation represents a compromise between various interests. \nThe bill is supported by the Fertilizer Institute, National Center for \nResources Innovations, Experiment Station and Extension Service \nDirectors, Lockheed Martin, and a consortium of other high tech \ncompanies.\n  An identical bill H.R. 3795 was introduced by Congressman Lewis and \nCongressman Crapo on July 11, 1996.\n  Precision agriculture technologies are rapidly advancing, and it is \ncrucial that the agricultural community invest in this field of \nresearch so that all farmers will be able to benefit. This bill will \nnot only increase the investment in precision agriculture, but it will \nalso emphasize an educational process that will assist all farmers in \nadopting precision agriculture technologies and applications.\n  Emerging technologies in production agriculture are changing and \nimproving the way farmers produce food and fiber in this country. New \ntechnologies such as global positioning satellites field mapping, \ngeoreference information systems, grid soil sampling, variable rate \nseeding and input applications, portable electronic pest scouting, on-\nthe-go yield monitoring, and computerized field history and record \nkeeping are just a few of the next generation technological tools in \nuse today.\n  These technologies allow the agriculture producer to adjust hundreds \nof variables in the farm field, form soil pH to nutrient levels to crop \nyield, on a 2 foot by 2 foot grid that were previously far too costly \nto calculate for each field. Today, these technologies can map these \nvariables and data instantaneously as an applicator or combine drives \nacross the field. In short, each farm field using precision technology \nbecomes a research pilot. And in the down months or winter season a \nfarmer can collect the data from the previous growing season and adjust \ndozens of important agronomic variables to maximize the efficient use \nof all the farmers inputs: time, fuel, commercial inputs, seed \nrate, irrigation--the list goes on and on.\n\n  These precision farming tools are already proving to help farmers \nincrease field productivity, improve input efficiency, protect the \nenvironment, maximize farm profitability and create computerized field \nhistories that may help increase land values. Collectively, these and \nother emerging technologies are being used in a holistic, site-specific \nsystems approach called precision agriculture. Progressive and \nproduction minded farmers are already using these technologies. In a \ndecade, they may be as commonplace on the farm as air-conditioned \ntractor cabs and power steering.\n  Precision farming seems to offer great promise for improving \nproduction performance. Inherently, it just sounds very appealing to be \nable to evaluate production conditions on an individual square foot, \nyard, or acre basis rather than that of a whole field. It would seem \nthat we should be able to treat any situation more appropriately the\n\n[[Page S8374]]\n\nsmaller the plot we are considering. There have been great strides in \nmeasuring things on the basis of smaller and smaller units on the \nground than we have ever realistically envisioned in the past. \nMeasuring yields as we harvest. Being able to collect soil samples on a \nvery small pilot basis and apply prescribed corrective measures ``on \nthe go.'' All of these things are possible. They are being done on an \nexperimental basis in many locations. Some producers have adopted the \nnew technology and are using it.\n  Precision farming is, in its simplest sense, a management system for \ncrop production that uses site-specific data to maximize yields and \nmore efficiently use inputs. The technology is quickly gaining \nacceptance and use by producers, farm suppliers, crop consultants, and \ncustom applicators.\n  Precision farming links the data-management abilities of computers \nwith sophisticated farm equipment that can vary applications rates and \nmonitor yields throughout a field.\n  Mr. President, the capabilities of precision agriculture technologies \nare rapidly increasing. The economic and environmental benefits of \nthese technologies have not been fully realized. Increasing the use of \nthese technologies and development of complementary new technologies \nwill benefit American agriculture, the U.S. economy, and both domestic \nand global environmental concerns. In Kentucky, this type of research \ncan help producers increase their yield while protecting environmental \nconcerns such as water quality.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S. 1976. A bill to authorize the President to enter into a trade \nagreement concerning Northern Ireland and certain border counties of \nthe Republic of Ireland, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n     The Northern Ireland Free Trade, Development and Security Act\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I introduce the Northern Ireland \nFree Trade, Development and Security Act.\n  The resurgence of sectarian unrest that we have witnessed in the last \nweeks in Northern Ireland has seriously jeopardized the chances of a \nlasting peace in that province. The current uncertainty brought about \nby the recent confrontation between the Catholic and Protestant \ncommunities does not augur well for the prospect of a prosperous and \nprogressive Northern Ireland adhering to the principles of democracy, \nrestraint and mutual respect.\n  Throughout the six counties the ancient drums of a harsh and \nunbending history have been once again been replaced by the fierce and \nacrimonious sounds of cross community hatred. Shattering glass and car \nbombs have once more become part and parcel of daily life in parts of \nNorthern Ireland.\n  Mr. President, voices throughout Ireland continually echo the need \nfor restraint and reconciliation. These are the voices of Northern \nIreland's future. Voices which for so long have fallen on deaf ears. \nThese voices Mr. President must be heard. It is in everyones self-\ninterest to go forward. It is in no ones self-interest to slow down the \npeace process. Sadly this process may have come to a grinding halt, \nsadly too, the good and honest people of Northern Ireland will once \nagain be the victims of a tyranny of violence and intransigence. The \nlegislation that I introduce today is a marker that says that the men \nand women of Ulster are not alone in this period of instability and \nhour of need. We must verify hope, not concede to dispair.\n  Mr. President, the Northern Ireland and Border Counties Free Trade, \nDevelopment and Security Act, that I introduce today, is modeled on the \nGaza/ West Bank Free Trade Act pending in this body. Both bills are \nbased on the premise that a country or region that has a vibrant, \ngrowing and exporting economy requires underlying economic and social \ncohesion and cooperation. The legislation that I am introducing \npromises an open, liberalizing trade arrangement between Northern \nIreland, the border counties of the Irish Republic and the United \nStates. It will act as a primary inducement and incentive for \nindigenous Irish business to trade and flourish. This program will mean \nreal jobs for the people of Northern Ireland, jobs that will prove to \nbe crucial if the improvement of social and economic life in the North \nof Ireland is to be realized. In doing so, it will not only assist in \nrevitalizing Northern Ireland's economy but it will help to rid Ulster \nof the religious and racial hatred which has plagued its people for \nmore than 300 years.\n  Mr. President, the paradox of Northern Ireland is that she has given \nso much to other cultures and lands but has been incapable of fully \nreaping the rewards of her own peoples skills and strengths at home. \nThe unfortunate reality is that as in the Republic of Ireland, a large \nmajority of the North's highly educated and skilled younger generation \nhas been forced to emigrate due to high unemployment levels which are \nas high as 70 percent in some areas. These disadvantaged areas are the \nones which this legislation has been especially designed to target. \nJoint cooperation and joint economic development between the United \nStates, Northern Ireland, and the European Union will integrate the \nmost distressed parts of Northern Ireland and the border counties into \na dynamic economy that--while firmly rooted in the European Union--\ncontinues to expand and cement new trading relatonships beneficial to \nall trading partners.\n\n  Mr. President the coming days in Northern Ireland will mean that \nserious risks will have to be taken. The way forward is not entirerly \nclear. Great strains have been placed between our good friends Great \nBritain and the Republic of Ireland. A close and harmonious \nrelationship between these two nations is a necessary prerequisite to \nfuture progress in Northern Ireland. I would ask both of these close \nfriends to join this effort to help forge a new and innovative way \nforward for their own citizens. Indeed current events call for new \napproaches, new modalities, and reinvigorated efforts.\n  To the men and women of Northern Ireland and the border counties, I \nsay that your best days are in front of you. Stand steadfastly. Both \ncommunities can work together to create a future that will outshine \nNorthern Ireland's dark but proud past and will significantly increase \nthe prospects for the youth of Northern Ireland who hold the key to the \nsuccess of this project. Take from your past the virtues of your \nforefathers--industry, faith, and imagination but leave behind the \nquarrels of other centuries. Just like the unity of Catholic and \nProtestant at the Somme, I ask that those heroic deeds be emanated. \nThis time ahead will take courage, strength, and determination on all \nsides. I remind you once more you are not alone. As this country stood \nby you at the Somme this country stands by you now.\n  Northern Ireland's peace process must move forward and the \naspirations and goodwill of the vast majority of its citizens must be \naccompanied by hard work and endeavour. The proposed establishment of a \nfree trade area in these designated areas must be passed into \nlegislation if the predicted 3,000 to 10,000 jobs are to be created. A \nmore prosperous economy with more evenly spread and meaningful job \nopportunities can only serve to bridge the social and economic \ndisparities that exist in this region. In conclusion this opportunity \ncannot be overlooked, after 25 years since the outbreak of the \n``troubles,'' the people of Northern Ireland have suffered enough \nviolence and depravity. Now it is time to embark on a rebuilding \nprocess that will give no chance to the terrorist but every chance to \npeace and reconciliation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/19/senate-section/article/S8373-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8374-S8375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 684\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatfield, the name of the Senator from Missouri \n[Mr. Bond] was added as a cosponsor of S. 684, a bill to amend the \nPublic Health Service Act to provide for programs of research regarding \nParkinson's disease, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1477\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from Utah \n[Mr. Bennett] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1477, a bill to amend the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act \nto improve the regulation of food, drugs, devices, and biological \nproducts, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1505\n\n  At the request of Mr. Pressler, the name of the Senator from Alabama\n\n[[Page S8375]]\n\n[Mr. Heflin] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1505, a bill to reduce risk \nto public safety and the environment associated with pipeline \ntransportation of natural gas and hazardous liquids, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1729\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Hutchison, the name of the Senator from New \nMexico [Mr. Bingaman] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1729, a bill to \namend title 18, United States Code, with respect to stalking.\n\n\n                                S. 1897\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from \nMaryland [Ms. Mikulski] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1897, a bill to \namend the Public Health Service Act to revise and extend certain \nprograms relating to the National Institutes of Health, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1899\n\n  At the request of Mr. Stevens, the name of the Senator from Idaho \n[Mr. Kempthorne] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1899, a bill entitled \nthe ``Mollie Beattie Alaska Wilderness Area Act''.\n\n\n                                S. 1965\n\n  At the request of Mr. Biden, the name of the Senator from Wisconsin \n[Mr. Feingold] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1965, a bill to prevent \nthe illegal manufacturing and use of methamphetamine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4910\n\n  At the request of Mr. Breaux the name of the Senator from California \n[Mrs. Boxer] was added as a cosponsor of amendment No. 4910 proposed to \nS. 1956, an original bill to provide for reconciliation pursuant to \nsection 202(a) of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \nyear 1997.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/19/senate-section/article/S8374-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8375-S8380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      THE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, WORK OPPORTUNITY, AND MEDICAID \n                       RESTRUCTURING ACT OF 1996\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                D'AMATO (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 4927\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Gramm, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Craig, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \nBurns, Mr. Smith, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Brown, \nMr. Thompson, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Bond, Mr. Grams, Mr. Shelby, Mr. \nJeffords, Mr. Mack, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Lott, Mr. Domenici, \nand Mr. Nickles) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 1956) to provide \nfor reconciliation pursuant to section 202(a) of the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 1997;

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize American \nLegion\n\n[[Page S8381]]\n\nPost No. 88 as they dedicate a memorial to our Nation's veterans. Post \nNo. 88 undertook the creation and dedication of this war memorial to \nmark their 50th anniversary. This emblem of service will endure as a \nreminder of the veterans' sacrifice made for our liberty.\n  On July 4, Post No. 88 dedicated a demilitarized M6OA3 tank and \nplaced it on permanent display at South Village Road in Louden, NH. \nJoining the legionnaires in this solemn occasion were local Boy Scouts \nand Cub Scouts, young musicians, local clergy, and town leaders. The \nmonument was dedicated to the memory of those veterans who served their \ncountry, with a special remembrance for POW's and MIA's.\n  Our veterans have made it possible for us to live free in this great \ncountry. The strong, sound granite of the memorial stone, cut from our \nNew Hampshire hills, is representative of America's best and bravest. \nThe men and women who have served this country in the Armed Forces will \nbe honored through this memorial and the community will remember their \nservice and their sacrifice.\n  This monument is just one of many examples of the way American Legion \nPost No. 88 serves their community. Members of the post donate \ncountless volunteer hours, fundraising for veterans' needs, support \nyouth education, and assist the medically needy. Post No. 88 has been \nan integral part of the community for the past 50 years and has served \nthe community with dedication and with pride. I congratulate American \nLegion Post No. 88 for their service and dedication to their community. \nThe new war memorial is a fitting tribute to our Nation's veterans and \nanother fine example of Post No. 88's commitment to honoring our Armed \nForces.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/19/senate-section/article/S8380-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERT N. WILENTZ\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on July 1, an era came to an end, when \nRobert N. Wilentz removed his robe for the final time and ended a 17-\nyear tenure as chief justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court.\n  During a rare interview in 1993, when asked how the Wilentz years \nwould be remembered, he replied, ``I would hope only that they would be \nremembered as years when a great court system was kept great and when a \ngreat supreme court was kept great.'' And they will be, due to the \nefforts of a truly great man--Chief Justice Robert N. Wilentz.\n  Greatness is based not on what you gain, but on what you give. And \nthe contributions of Justice Wilentz to the legal profession and to the \npeople of New Jersey are a benchmark against which the actions of \nothers will be judged. An old Latin saying notes that justice must be \nfair and good; while Justice Wilentz wore the judicial robes, he \nassured both.\n  He has been categorized as a liberal activist, but that is not \nentirely fair, for Justice Wilentz's decisions were not based on any \npolitical agenda, but on a mixture of extraordinary intellect and \nunusual compassion.\n  Under his direction, the New Jersey Supreme Court achieved a national \nreputation for innovative decisions which often set an example for the \nentire country. The court instructed municipalities that they must \nprovide housing for low-income residents. In separate opinions, which \nWilentz authored, the court recognized the ``battered woman's \nsyndrome'' as a defense for women charged with homicide and made a host \nliable for providing alcohol to a guest, if the host is aware that the \nguest is intoxicated and will soon drive.\n  In the now famous Abbot versus Burke decision, which ordered the \nState to provide more money for city schools, Wilentz wrote, ``We \nrealize that perhaps nothing short of substantial social and economic \nchange will make the difference for these students, * * *. We have \nconcluded, however, that even if not a cure, money will help, and that \nthese students are constitutionally entitled to that help.'' Like all \nof his statements, this one demonstrates that behind the black robes \nwas a daring thinker and visionary jurist.\n  We may not agree with all of his decisions, but we must recognize his \ndesire to always do what he believed to be right, and just.\n  Since Chief Justice Wilentz's appointment by Governor Brendan Byrne \nin 1979, the New Jersey Supreme Court has been involved in an \nextraordinary number of such precedent setting cases. Yet, in nearly \nthree quarters of these cases, the decisions were unanimous; this is a \ntestament to the chief justice's leadership abilities.\n  Justice Wilentz was not only a superior jurist and leader, but a \nskillful administrator. As chief justice, he tirelessly worked to \nimprove the State's municipal court system. To enhance efficiency, he \nreorganized the courts into four divisions, civil, criminal, family, \nand general equity, and he divided the appellate division into eight \nfour judge panels.\n  Under his guidance, the court instituted the New Jersey Judicial \nCollege, the Municipal Court Judicial Conference and a speedy trial \nprogram; all have become national models. He also created separate task \nforces to investigate gender bias in the court system and to address \nminority concerns involving the judiciary.\n  James Bryant Conant once remarked, ``each walk of life, has its own \nelite, its own aristocracy based on excellence of performance.'' And \nrecently, the Newark Star-Ledger confirmed that ``his [Wilentz] record \nfor excellence is secure and his place in New Jersey's history is \nfixed.'' I echo that opinion. All New Jerseyans have benefited from his \nleadership, his scholarship, his statesmanship.\n  Chief Justice Robert N. Wilentz will long be remembered for his love \nof the law, his reasoned eloquence and his uncompromising commitment to \nsocial justice. It will indeed be difficult to fill his shoes, and his \nrobe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/19/senate-section/article/S8381-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MAX M. FISHER\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, Max M. Fisher was honored last \nnight in Detroit at the National Republican Leadership Award Dinner. \nUnfortunately, votes here in the Senate prevented me from attending. I \nam particularly sorry to have missed this event because I hold Max in \nthe highest possible esteem. Max Fisher's life exemplifies all that is \ngood about our Nation and our people.\n  Max joined with two partners to form his own oil company, Aurora \nGasoline, in 1933, only 3 years after graduating from college. He \nbecame chairman of the board of Aurora in 1957 and went on to serve on \nthe board of directors of Marathon oil in 1962. Max has served on the \nboard of directors of numerous corporations and continues to serve on \nthe boards of Comerica and Sotheby's.\n  I can think of no man who has done more for his community than Max \nFisher. He has served as founding chairman of Detroit Renaissance, \nfounding member and former chairman of New Detroit, member of the board \nof Sinai Hospital, and in numerous other responsible positions helping \nindividuals and communities.\n  Central to Max's philanthropic mission has been his heroic efforts on \nbehalf of Israel and world Jewry. He has served as chairman of the \nboard of governors of the reconstituted Jewish Agency in Jerusalem, \nGeneral Chairman of the United Jewish Appeal, Chairman of the Board of \nUnited Israel Appeal, and President of the Council of Jewish \nFederations and Welfare Funds.\n  In political life as well, Max has made great contributions. He has \nbeen an advisor and supporter of the last four Republican Presidents. \nIn addition, he has been a supporter of the Republican National \nCommittee for more than 40 years.\n  We on the Republican side of the aisle owe our own special debt to \nMax. But all of America, as well as Israel and numerous persons around \nthe world, owe him our thanks. With this statement I pay tribute to a \ngreat man, whose life's efforts demonstrate the awesome impact one \nindividual can have on his surroundings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/19/senate-section/article/S8381-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8381-S8382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE 1997 DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate completed \naction on the fiscal year 1997 Defense appropriations bill. This is one \nof the most important annual appropriations bills and the largest; by \nitself it consumes about half of all discretionary spending. I had deep \nconcerns about the bill because it added more than $10 billion to the\n\n[[Page S8382]]\n\nPresident's request for defense. By my estimation this money was not \nnecessary for our national security, especially when we are cutting \nnearly every other discretionary spending account as we move toward a \nbalanced budget. I remain unconvinced that our defenses need vast \ninfusions of new funds, and I disagree with some of defense priorities \nso ardently advocated by the majority.\n  Ballistic missile defenses receive $3.3 billion in this bill, which \nis $855 million above what the president requested. I don't think there \nis anyone in this Chamber who would argue against developing and \ndeploying missile defense systems to protect our troops in the field. \nBut many of my colleagues are anxious to embark on a missile defense \nspending spree that the Congressional Budget Office estimates could \ncost up to $60 billion. I would say to them that not only would that be \na waste of taxpayer money, but could have the long-term effect of \nsqueezing other necessary defense programs from the defense budget. It \nwould be ironic if those who profess to care so much about our defenses \nend up undermining them instead.\n  I voted for a series of unsuccessful amendments to cut billions of \ndollars from both the Defense authorization and appropriations bills. \nHowever, I did vote for final passage of the Defense appropriations \nbill. While I disagree with the overall spending figures in the bill, \nSenators Stevens and Inouye did an excellent job of crafting \nlegislation which will best serve our military. In particular, I am \npleased that the bill includes $150 million for peer-reviewed breast \ncancer research, and $100 million for prostate cancer research. In \naddition, the bill provides a full 3 percent pay raise for our troops, \nas well as a 4 percent raise in the basic allowance for quarters. \nFinally, I worked hard to have money added to the bill so that Air \nNational Guard F-16 units can maintain a cost-effective force \nstructure.\n  In closing, I look forward to the results of the nonpartisan, \nindependent National Defense Panel created by a 100 to nothing vote \nduring the debate on the DOD authorization bill. This Commission will \nbe tasked with reviewing our current defense program, and give an \nindependent assessment of a variety of possible force structures \nthrough 2010. We owe it to the Nation to put the Defense Department \nthrough the same budgetary scrutiny that we are putting virtually every \nother category of Government spending.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/19/senate-section/article/S8381-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ISABEL STUDENT HONORED\n\n Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would like to bring to my \ncolleagues' attention the outstanding efforts of a young man from my \nhome State. Ryan Maher is a senior from Isabel High School in Isabel, \nSD. Recently, Ryan placed second in his region and first in the State \ncompetitions to advance to the national competition for National \nHistory Day.\n  National History Day is a 5-day event held in June at the University \nof Maryland in College Park. The annual competition is now entering its \nthird decade. Today, 400,000 students and 50,000 teachers and media \nspecialists participate. National History Day is an excellent way to \nencourage students to be more active in learning United States history.\n  Every year National History Day is centered around a specific theme. \nThe theme of this year's competition was ``Taking a Stand.'' There are \ntwo levels of competition, the junior level is 6th through 8th grades \nand the senior division includes grades 9 through 12. Categories \ninclude research paper, group or individual presentation, display \npresentation, or performance.\n  Ryan competed in the senior division with a display presentation \nentitled, ``Dakota Farmer: Battling the Elements.'' Like other students \nwho were a part of the competition, he spent countless hours \nresearching and developing his project. He incorporated interviews with \nhis grandfather and other farmers from the area, together with old \nphotographs, to tell the history of working South Dakota land. Ryan \nbecame interested in the subject after he had written a paper on \nfarming and the dust bowl years of the thirties. This was the second \ntime Ryan participated in the nationwide competition.\n  Ryan won the honor of having his project displayed in the Smithsonian \nMuseum of American History on Wednesday, June 12, 1996. Projects were \njudged on several criteria, including relation to annual theme, \nanalysis of information, and historical perspective. The honor of \nhaving one's work displayed in the Smithsonian Museum of American \nHistory and earning the trip to our Nation's Capital are great rewards \nto students such as Ryan. I highly commend Ryan Maher for his \noutstanding academic efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/19/senate-section/article/S8382-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JOHN S. WATSON, SR.\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on July 6, former New Jersey \nAssemblyman John S. Watson, Sr. died of cancer. A committed public \nofficial and compassionate private individual, he will be missed by the \nentire New Jersey community.\n  Watson's life was a series of firsts. He was a public official for 23 \nyears, serving at both the county and State level. In 1970, he became \nthe first African-American member of the Board of Chosen Freeholders in \nMercer County. Seven years later, he became the first black freeholder \nin New Jersey to be chosen president of a county freeholder board. In \n1981, he was elected to the New Jersey Assembly where he represented \nthe 15th District for 12 years. His career in the legislature was \ncapped by being named chairman of the Assembly Appropriations Committee \nin 1992; he was the first African-American in the country to hold such \na position.\n  During his years in the Assembly, John also served on the Housing \nCommittee, the Legislative Advisory Committee on Arts and Furnishings, \nand the New Jersey Capital Budgeting and Planning Commission. As a \nlegislator, he successfully sponsored measures to create the minority \nopportunity skills training program, a college based computer training \nprogram, and the New Jersey pre-college program for high school \nstudents.\n  Assemblyman Watson consistently supported State aid to urban areas, \ntax reform and programs for the elderly and poor. He successfully \nfought to establish a rainy day fund to reserve budget surpluses for \ntimes when revenue declined. He was also known for his unfailing \ncourtesy to those on both sides of the political aisle.\n  But if that is how John Watson will be remembered in Trenton, his \ndistrict will remember him as a caring man who used his political power \nto aid individuals and families in need. New Jersey will indeed miss \nhis service and his spirit.\n  The great humanitarian Albert Schweitzer remarked, ``One thing I \nknow: the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who \nwill have sought and found how to serve.''\n  If that is true, then John S. Watson, Sr. was indeed the happiest of \nmen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/19/senate-section/article/S8382-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8382-S8383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO MOLLY PHELAN OF COLORADO, GIRL SCOUT GOLD AWARD WINNER\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize 17-\nyear-old Molly Phelan of Estes Park, CO. On June 29, 1996, Molly was \nhonored with the Girl Scout Gold Award from the Mountain Prairie Girl \nScout Council in Colorado. The Gold Award is the highest honor achieved \nin U.S. Girl Scouting and is awarded to young women between the ages of \n14 and 17, or in grades 9 through 12. To be eligible for this award, \none must display outstanding achievement in the areas of leadership, \ncommunity service, career planning, and personal development. \nAdditionally, a Girl Scout must earn the Career Exploration Pin, four \ninterest patches, the Senior Girl Scout Leadership Award, and complete \na Gold Award Project of her own creation.\n  Molly has made outstanding contributions in each of these areas. As a \nsenior at Estes Park High School and a devoted member of Girl Scout \nTroop 642, Molly completed numerous projects throughout the year. For \nher Gold Award Project, Molly was an active member of the Death-Day \nProgram at her high school which recognizes those who have died in \ndrinking and driving accidents. She took this issue a step further by \nmaking public service announcements on the radio about drinking and \ndriving awareness.\n  Molly truly exhibits concern for her community and a desire to \nimprove the world around her. She is an excellent role model for all \nyouth and displays\n\n[[Page S8383]]\n\ngenuine leadership through her Girl Scout projects. I am proud to \nsalute Molly as a recipient of the prestigious Girl Scout Gold \nAward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/19/senate-section/article/S8382-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO CHRISTINE ZAMBRICKI\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to pay tribute today to \none of my constituents, Christine Zambricki. Ms. Zambricki will \nconclude her year as national president of the American Association of \nNurse Anesthetists [AANA] in August and I want to take this opportunity \nto congratulate her on this fine achievement.\n  Ms. Zambricki has had a distinguished career. She currently serves as \nassistant hospital director at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, \nMI, and concurrently serves as director of the nurse anesthesia track, \ngraduate program in nursing at Oakland University in Rochester, MI. \nPreviously she served as director of anesthesia services from 1989 to \n1992 and director of nursing from 1992 to 1993 at William Beaumont \nHospital.\n  In addition to these prestigious positions in the medical community, \nshe has held various other high-level medical positions, earned various \nnursing degrees, and has received many other honors. Just a few of her \ncredits in her profession and in academia include service as president \nof the Michigan Nurses Association from 1985 to 1987, being appointed \nby the Governor of Michigan to serve on various State boards, and \nreceiving her master of science in nurse anesthesia in 1980 from Wayne \nState University.\n  She has been published extensively and her presentations are far too \nnumerous to list. However, it is clear that her contributions to the \nnurse anesthesia profession as well as nursing in general has been \nsubstantial. Ms. Zambricki has been an outstanding president of her \norganization--AANA. As you may know, Mr. President, AANA is the \nprofessional association that represents over 26,000 certified \nregistered nurse anesthetists [CRNA's] which is 96 percent of the nurse \nanesthetists in the United States.\n  As anesthesia specialists, CRNA's administer more than 65 percent of \nthe 26 million anesthetics given to patients in the United States each \nyear. CRNA's are the sole anesthesia providers in 85 percent of rural \nhospitals, enabling these medical facilities to provide obstetrical, \nsurgical, and trauma stabilization services. CRNA's are also frontline \nproviders of anesthesia in underserved urban areas, providing services \nfor major trauma cases, for example.\n  It is clear that the AANA has been fortunate to have benefited from \nMs. Zambricki's outstanding service as president and I take special \npride in congratulating one of Michigan's own for having assumed this \ndifficult yet rewarding professional obligation on behalf of nurse \nanesthesia. I am certain that Ms. Zambricki has many more years ahead \nof her in which she will undoubtedly make further contributions to the \nhonored profession of nurse anesthesia. Congratulations Christine on \nyour year as president of the American Association of Nurse \nAnesthetists.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/19/senate-section/article/S8383-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO RICH DeVOS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, last night Rich DeVos was honored \nin Detroit at the National Republican Leadership Award Dinner. \nUnfortunately, votes here in the Senate prevented me from attending. I \nam particularly sorry to have missed this event because I hold Rich in \nthe highest possible esteem. His life's story is a continuing series of \nexamples to us all of strong character, hard work, and principled \ngenerosity.\n  After serving his country in the Air Force in World War II, Rich co-\nfounded a flying school and commercial air charter service with Jay Van \nAndel. Three years later he co-founded an import business with the same \npartner. In 1959, he and his partner founded the Amway Corp. That \nventure grew to be one of the world's largest direct selling companies, \nrecording $6.3 billion in sales last year. Rich is also owner and \nchairman of the NBA's Orlando Magic basketball team.\n  Having succeeded through his own hard work, Rich has devoted more and \nmore of his time to helping others. His speeches and books spread the \nword about compassionate capitalism, and he leads by example. He serves \non numerous boards, including service as chairman of Gospel Films and \nthe Butterworth Health Corp. He has given freely of his time and money \nfor charitable organizations such as the National Organization on \nDisability, and for the cause of political and economic liberty.\n  Rich is the recipient of literally dozens of prestigious awards, \nincluding the Adam Smith Free Enterprise Award from the American \nLegislative Exchange Council and the William Booth Award from the \nSalvation Army. He is a great friend to liberty, a great servant to \nthose in need and a great credit to the state of Michigan. I, for one, \nhave always been inspired by his work and his character; Rich DeVos is \nindeed one of our Nation's true heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/19/senate-section/article/S8383-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8383-S8384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GOV. WILLIAM T. CAHILL\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on July 1, New Jersey lost one \nof its most dedicated public servants, former Gov. William T. Cahill. \nWhether as a New Jersey assemblyman, U.S. Congressman or Governor, Bill \nCahill was always ready to fight for what he thought was right, \nregardless of whether it was expedient or popular. As he once remarked:\n\n       It's not the role of the Governor to do what is popular. \n     His role is to tell the people what's good for New Jersey.\n\n  Undeniably, Governor Cahill was good for New Jersey.\n  A blue collar Irish kid from a gritty Camden neighborhood, Governor \nCahill was described by both friends and foes as a fighter; he \ncontinually battled for the environment, for education, for fairness in \nthe tax system. In fact, his single term, from 1970 to 1974, is \nremarkable for the number of successful initiatives which he left as \nhis legacy to New Jersey.\n  Governor Cahill was in the vanguard of both the environmental and the \nconsumer protection movements. He created the State Department of \nEnvironmental Protection, the Division of Consumer Affairs and the \nBoard of Public Utilities. During his administration, the State passed \nthe Coastal Area Facility Review Act to block construction of proposed \noffshore oil refineries and high-rise buildings. Cahill also fought for \na series of unprecedented wetlands protection laws and strong air \npollution control measures.\n  His legacy has touched virtually every aspect of life in the Garden \nState. The Governor's initiatives led to the Nation's first daily \nlottery, which yielded new revenues to ease the burden on New Jersey's \ntaxpayers. During his tenure, Cahill helped get no-fault auto insurance \nenacted and established full-time county prosecutors. He more than \nquadrupled State aid to New Jersey's economically challenged cities.\n  Bill Cahill never shied away from a fight that he thought would \nbenefit New Jersey. He even criticized then President Nixon, a fellow \nRepublican, for not paying attention to domestic problems such as those \nthat existed in Newark.\n  In probably his best remembered role, Governor Cahill scored the \nultimate touchdown for New Jersey. He helped to establish the New \nJersey Sports and Exposition Authority and the Meadowlands Sports \nComplex, and he personally intervened to lure the Giants to the new \nstadium. When the New York financial community tried to ruin the deal, \nCahill took the negotiations into overtime; he worked with the incoming \nDemocratic administration to assure that New Jersey companies would \nfinance the enormous project.\n  Yet, some of Bill Cahill's most impressive accomplishments have \nlargely been forgotten. On Thanksgiving Day, 1971, a violent inmate \nuprising erupted at Rahway State Prison. The memories of the Attica \nriot, only a few months before, still lingered in the public's and the \ninmates' minds. Cahill immediately went to the prison; his constant \nintervention, negotiation and steadying influence was credited with \nending the riot, without a single life lost. He was hailed as a \nnational hero for preventing Rahway from becoming another Attica.\n  With all of his achievements, Bill Cahill could have rested on his \nlaurels and perhaps easily won reelection to a second term as Governor \nin 1974. Instead, because he believed it was the right thing to do, he \nlaunched the on-\n\n[[Page S8384]]\n\ngoing battle in New Jersey over education financing.\n  While Governor, Cahill was the prime defendant in a 1973 case where \nthe State Supreme Court ruled that the system of funding education \nthrough property taxes discriminated against children in poor \ndistricts. Due to the ruling, the State enacted the Thorough and \nEfficient Education Act. But the Governor was not finished.\n  The New Jersey tax system, with its heavy reliance on property taxes, \nhad always bothered Cahill. Specifically, the Governor wanted a broad-\nbased income tax and an equalized State property tax. The income tax \nwould be used to fund public education and, hopefully, would reduce \ninequities between rich and poor school districts. In essence, the \nGovernor's dream was to give all children a chance at a decent \neducation.\n\n  So he tossed a politically risky revision of the tax code into the \npolitical ring. He pushed the State legislature for an income tax and \nan equalized State property tax. The legislature, however, took the \ngloves off and slaughtered the plan in the assembly.\n  The promotion of the very unpopular tax, coupled with scandals in his \nadministration, none of which ever directly involved or implicated him, \nended Bill Cahill's career in government. He lost the Republican \nnomination for Governor in 1974. But when reflecting on his decision to \nattempt to revise the tax code, the courageous decision which cost him \nhis political career, Cahill remarked,\n\n       We were right then, and while many describe it as our worst \n     defeat, I believe it was our finest moment.\n\n  During those years in the Governor's office, Cahill demonstrated that \nhe was a pragmatist, not a partisan. He often appointed Democrats to \nkey positions, if he thought they could best serve New Jersey. These \nincluded former Governor Richard Hughes as chief justice of the State \nsupreme court and future Gov. Brendan Byrne to the State superior \ncourt.\n  The only thing that Governor Cahill was ever uncompromisingly \npartisan about was the State he loved. Early in his term, he was on a \ncommercial flight from Washington to Newark. When the plane landed, the \nflight attendant welcomed everyone to the Port of New York. The very \nnext day, Cahill was on the phone to officials at the Port Authority of \nNew York, which operates Newark International Airport. Shortly \nafterward, the Port Authority redesignated itself ``The Port Authority \nof New York and New Jersey.'' Among New Jersey's champions, he was \nalways a heavyweight.\n  Whether we agree with his decisions and priorities or not, Governor \nCahill was a man who stood by his convictions, no matter what the \nconsequences. As he once told an aide, forget about politics for a \nminute. What's the right thing to do? His concern was policy, not \npolitics.\n  Thomas Fuller once noted that ``Great and good are seldom the same \nman.'' He obviously never knew William T. Cahill. In his continual \nstriving to do what was right, he proved himself a great Governor, and \na great man. Undeniably, he always fought the good fight for New \nJersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/19/senate-section/article/S8383-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THOMAS J. COOGAN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of Thomas \nJ. Coogan, the longtime mayor of Melvindale, MI, who passed away on \nDecember 11, 1995. Tom had been fighting lung cancer and back problems \nsince January 1995, while valiantly continuing to fulfill his duties as \nmayor. A month before his death, Tom won an unprecedented 11th term as \nmayor. During his 20-year career as mayor of Melvindale, Tom Coogan's \nname became synonymous with the city.\n  He was an activist mayor who became involved in many causes he felt \nwould benefit the residents of Melvindale. He championed environmental \ninitiatives and directed the building of several parks and a recreation \ncenter. He also provided leadership in the diversification of the \ncity's industrial base and the construction of a city hall complex. Tom \nwas an advocate for senior-citizen rights and introduced several \nprograms for older residents.\n  One of Tom's proudest achievements was the construction of a senior \ncitizens' building named Coogan Terrace in his honor. He was the \ndriving force behind this center which has benefited so many of \nMelvindale's elderly. It is a fitting tribute to Tom that this building \nwhich bears his name will continue serving the people of Melvindale \nlong after he has left us.\n  During his fight with cancer, Tom was forced to close the barbershop \nhe opened in 1965 in order to continue working as mayor.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 3161, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3161) to authorize the extension of \n     nondiscriminatory treatment (most-favored-nation treatment) \n     to the products of Romania.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3161, \na bill to extend permanent most-favored-nation trade status to Romania. \nI believe it is premature to surrender leverage over developments in \nRomania less than 4 months before their national elections. Adoption of \nthis measure now will weaken our ability to extend support to \ndemocratic forces in Romania.\n  I spoke in opposition to the Senate version of this measure, S. 1644, \nwhen the Finance Committee held a hearing on it on June 4, 1996. Before \nthat, as Co-Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in \nEurope, I joined with our Chairman, the distinguished Representative \nChristopher H. Smith, in a letter to the Chairman of the Ways and Means \nCommittee in the House, urging postponement of action on this \ninitiative until after Romania's elections.\n  On Wednesday, the House passed H.R. 3161, after a spirited debate on \nthe previous day. Their action, and the likely passage of this bill by \nthis Chamber, surrenders leverage over developments in Romania which is \nuniquely ours. The semi-annual review process for Romania's most-\nfavored-nation gives Congress the ability to express itself if the slow \nbut steady progress with democratization and privatization that has \nbeen occurring in Romania should suffer a reverse after this fall's \nelection.\n  I do not need to recite the horrors that occurred in the former \nYugoslavia, just over the border from Romania when extremists seized \ncontrol of the political process. Genocide in Bosnia has not yet been \nredressed, and thousands of American troops are deployed there on the \nground to help the Dayton Accords succeed.\n  Romania has a substantial ethnic minority population. Approximately 9 \npercent of Romania's population of 23 million is ethnically Hungarian. \nRelations between ethnic Hungarians and Romanians have not always been \neasy.\n  The current Romanian Government is a coalition government. It \ncontained three extremist minority parties for 3 of its 4 years in \noffice, with two leaving the government only this past December.\n  All of the experts I have spoken with, and all knowledgeable Romanian \nofficials believe that the next government will be a coalition \ngovernment, too. I think it is very important for those who support \ndemocratic progress and privatization in Romania to keep a close eye on \nthese national elections and the government they produce.\n  The opposition did very well in this spring's local elections. This \nbodes well for their chances in the fall, but it appears that no single \nparty has the strength or public support to form a government on its \nown. Even if the opposition wins, this does not resolve the question of \nwho will be included in the coalition government.\n  Romania has made clear that its first priority in its \nforeign relations is NATO integration. They view passage of this \nmeasure and receipt of unconditional MFN status as a step in this \ndirection, a credential that they have made progress.\n\n  I have no trouble saying that they have made progress. Measured since \nCeaucescu's fall, the progress has been serious. Over a shorter time-\nframe, it sometimes appears to be one step forward and two steps back, \nbut it is progress nonetheless.\n  Having said that, there are also problems. I think these problems are \nserious enough for Congress to want to keep the leverage it has through \nthe semi-annual MFN report and review process until after this fall's \nnational elections. Then, once we see how the elections have turned \nout, who is in the coalition government, and what their policies will \nbe, we can make a well-considered judgment on whether to terminate the \nreview process and make their MFN trade status unconditional. Action \nnow is premature.\n  I know that the Romanian Assembly and Senate both passed resolutions \nstating that all parties agreed that MFN would not be a political issue \nin the fall campaign. I ask you to imagine what would happen if both \nour House and Senate passed a resolution stating, for instance, that \nNAFTA would not be a campaign issue.\n  In a nation with a free press, passage of such a resolution would \nhave the immediate effect of moving the issue to the top of the \npolitical agenda, and focusing hard questions on the leadership of both \nparties. It would not take the issue off of the agenda.\n  I received a copy of a May 27, 1996 letter from the president of the \nDemocratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania, the DAHR, which states, \n``In the opinion of the DAHR, the entire population of Romania has \ngreat need of Most Favored Nation status, but we believe that the best \nmethod for the American government would be to continue to link this \nbenefit to respect for human rights and minority rights until such time \nas practical results are achieved in these areas.''\n  Mr. President, it does not sound to me as if there is unanimous \nsupport within Romania for pressing ahead with unconditional MFN. In \nfact, the ethnic minority most vulnerable to oppression and \ndiscrimination, and the one that has suffered serious human rights \nviolations in the past, is the very one that asks the United States to \nretain the MFN review process.\n\n[[Page S8392]]\n\n  I received another letter from the Ad Hoc Committee for the \nOrganization of Romanian Democracy, Inc. That letter, dated July 15, \n1996, points out shortcomings in the property restitution and \ncompensation process in Romania, and talks about developments in a \nhuman rights case.\n  In that regard, it states, ``To further emphasize the injustices of \nthe present Romanian regime, we wish also to inform you that we have \njust received a fax from Romania informing us about two newspapermen, \nRadu Mazare, Chief Editor and Constantin Cumpana, Chief of Section, of \nthe Telegraph, from the city of Constanta, who have just been sentenced \nfor slander to 7 months in prison and a fine of 25 million lei (approx. \n$8000).''\n  Their letter continues, ``In view of the above injustices, the \nCommittee appeals to you, Senator D'Amato, to consent to urging the \npostponement, until after the Romanian Presidential- Parliamentary \nelections in September-October 1996, of debates and voting in respect \nto the granting of permanent MFN status to Romania.''\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Democratic Alliance \nof Hungarians in Romania's letter and the Ad Hoc Commmittee's letter be \nprinted in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Let me continue by pointing out some other problems in \nRomania. Rights of national minorities to receive an education in their \nnative languages have been restricted by the Romanian education law of \nJuly 24, 1995, and the government has not supported the opening of an \nindependent Hungarian university.\n  An ethnic Hungarian, Pal Cseresznyes, remains in jail on questionable \ncharges, an imprisonment that has lasted for 6 years and during which \nhe allegedly suffered frequent beatings.\n  I am concerned by reports that the local elections revealed serious \ninaccuracies in voter lists, a problem that had been identified by \ninternational observers in previous elections and that the government \nhas had time to repair. Those same inaccurate lists appear to be going \nto be used this fall. Use of those lists could call into question \npublic trust in the results of the national election.\n  Mr. President, I regret that this measure has moved forward with such \nspeed. I note that it was not referred to committee. Its consideration \nnow coincides with the visit to the United States of the Romanian \nForeign Minister, Mr. Teodor Melescanu. It appears that part of the \nrush to judgment this effort reflects is to produce a victory on this \nissue for the President of Romania, Ion Iliescu. Regardless of the \nprotestations of parliamentarians and Romanian officials to the \ncontrary, I firmly expect that passage of this measure will immediately \nbe touted as a great victory for Romania.\n  I hope that it will not, in fact, be a defeat for human rights, \ndemocracy, and free enterprise in Romania. I will watch the results of \nthis election closely, and I join with those who support this bill in \nhoping that their results will justify the faith passage of this \nmeasures represents. I have, however, found that hope, when dealing \nwith entrenched Balkan issues, is seldom well rewarded.\n  I will be watching to see who is in the resulting coalition \ngovernment and what policies they adopt. While passage of this bill \nwill end the MFN review process, inclusion of Romania in NATO will \nrequire additional steps. Without the MFN review process leverage, if \nthe elections produce negative results, the consequences in terms of \nU.S. policy will have to be more severe.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Ad Hoc Committee for the Organization of Romanian \n           Democracy, Inc.,\n                                  Mount Vernon, NY, July 15, 1996.\n     Hon. Alfonse D'Amato,\n     U.S. Senate, HSOB, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator D'Amato: At the request of the owners of the \n     properties nationalized-confiscated by decrees in 1949, we \n     are forwarding to you the English translation of the \n     memorandum addressed to President Iliescu of Romania and \n     submitted and registered at the office of the President. The \n     signatory is Mrs. Alexandrina Ionescu, Strada Franceza No. \n     56, Bucharest 3.\n       The gist of the memorandum, condensed in a few sentences, \n     is as follows: By sentence of Lower Courts of Justice, Mrs. \n     Ionescu and other owners obtained the restitution of \n     property. They complied with all the prescribed legal \n     requirements by paying the taxes and registering the legal \n     deeds of property with the appropriate authority. \n     Nevertheless, the Attorney General has started proceedings to \n     annul the decisions of the Lower Courts.\n       The attached memorandum, translated into English and \n     French, has also been submitted to the United Nations and the \n     Council of Europe.\n       To further emphasize the injustices of the present Romanian \n     regime, we wish to also inform you that we have just received \n     a fax from Romania informing us about two newspaper men, Radu \n     Mazare, Chief Editor and Constantin Cumpana, Chief of \n     Section, of the Telegraph, from the city of Constanta, who \n     have just been sentenced for slander to seven months in \n     prison and a fine of 25 million lei (approx. $8000).\n       In view of the above injustices, the Committee appeals to \n     you, Senator D'Amato, to consent to urging the postponement, \n     until after the Romanian presidential-Parliamentary elections \n     in September-October 1996, of debates and voting in respect \n     to the granting of permanent MFN status to Romania.\n       We thank you, Senator D'Amato, for your consideration and \n     understanding of the Romanian people who desire true \n     democracy in their country.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                           Stefan Issarescu, M.D.,\n                                                         Chairman.\n                               Simone M.
