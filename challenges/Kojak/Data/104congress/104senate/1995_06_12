Sadly, however, \nthere are those who are littering this information superhighway with \nobscene, indecent, and destructive pornography. Virtual but virtueless \nreality is projected in the most twisted, sick, misuse of sexuality. \nViolent people with sexual pathology are able to stalk and harass the \ninnocent. Cyber solicitation of teenagers reveals the dark side of \nonline victimization.\n  Lord, we are profoundly concerned about the impact of this on our \nchildren. We have learned from careful study how children can become \naddicted to pornography at an early age. Their understanding and \nappreciation of Your gift of sexuality can be denigrated and eventually \ndebilitated. Pornography disallowed in print and the mail is now \nreadily available to young children who learn how to use the computer.\n  Oh God, help us care for our children. Give us wisdom to create \nregulations that will protect the innocent. In times past, You have \nused the Senate to deal with problems of air and water pollution, and \nthe misuse of our natural resources. Lord, give us courage to balance \nour reverence for freedom of speech with responsibility for what is \nsaid and depicted.\n  Now, guide the Senators as they consider ways of controlling the \npollution of computer communications and how to preserve one of our \ngreatest resources: the minds of our children and the future moral \nstrength of our Nation.

Mr. President, I would like to use this time to rise in \nsupport of the telecommunications bill, the bill we have talked about \nlast week and will continue on this week; hopefully to finish the bill \nearly this week. I know we have talked about it a great deal. Last year \nthere was considerable discussion.\n  It seems to me it comes along at a time when it is responding to what \nthe American people said in 1994, and that is we ought to move away, \nhave less Government, less regulation, and let the marketplace \nfunction. That is what this bill is designed to do. It seeks to remove \nsome artificial governmental regulations, regulations that go beyond \nsimply providing for fair competition. I think we want to move in that \ndirection.\n  Times have changed a great deal. As some of my experience back with \nthe Rural Electric Association showed, seeking to bring electricity to \nareas where there was relatively low density and where there were few \npeople living, no one in the competitive business was really interested \nin serving those areas [[Page S8128]] that were very low in revenue. \nHence, the cooperative effort of the rural electrics.\n  I think cooperation is necessary and will be here in the area of \nuniversal coverage. We need to provide with certainty that there will \nbe telephone communications, and that is part of this bill. At the same \ntime, we need to open it to full access in competition. So many things \nare happening, so many things are changing, so many things that will \nbring to a State like mine the opportunity to have all kinds of \ncommunications, indeed to conduct the kinds of businesses in Wyoming \nthat you could not conduct without entry to an information network, \nwithout the kinds of things that will be provided here.\n  This bill is designed to remove restrictions on competition. I think \nthat is what it should be all about. It is designed to create \nopportunities for investment and growth, not only in the communications \nsystem in this country but certainly global communications.\n  I do not want to take a great deal of time but I do rise in support \nof that concept. I think this bill does the things it is designed to \ndo. I know there are differences of view. That is as it should be. \nThere are great debates in this place. They are designed to show there \nis more than one alternative, otherwise there would not be a great \ndebate. I am one who thinks, if we can set forth here the conditions \nthat ought to be met in the case of local telephones before they \nexpand, and long distance into the local, that is the way we ought to \ndo it, and keep the substantive judgments of the Department of Justice \nat a minimum. The authority lies there, of course, to move in when \nthere are unfair trade practices. That is as it should be.\n  So the result we look for, of course, is lower prices. We look for \nexpanded options. We look for 1.5 to 3 million high-technology jobs \nthat will be developed, and more exports. So this is a good step.\n  I look forward to supporting the bill. I look forward to the Senate \ncompleting its work this week so we can move on, then, to some of the \nother features.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this morning I was going through some mail \nin my office and I received a letter from a young woman in Fargo, ND. I \nshall not use her name because I have not asked her if it is \nappropriate to use her name. But she is a young woman who described a \nwhole series of troubles. She was left with two children as a single \nparent, no training, not many skills, and jobless. She described her \njourney through the social services system to try to find a way to get \ntrained and get a job. The letter is an inspiring letter from someone \nwho is now working full time--thanks, she says, to the training \nprograms, thanks to the help that she received from Medicaid and \nelsewhere. So this is a person for whom a job is a way out, a job is a \nway to take care of her children. A job is, for her, substantial self-\nworth and respect.\n  You forget, sometimes, how important jobs are until you read a letter \nfrom someone like this who did not have a job and now does, thanks to a \nlot of help from a lot of people, but especially thanks to her \ndetermination.\n  I mention this letter about jobs because jobs are very important to \nthe American people, and we have 10 million people out there--give or \ntake a few--who are looking for a job today and cannot find one. We do \nnot have enough jobs. We do not have enough good jobs that pay good \nwages in our country.\n  About a year and a half ago we debated in the U.S. Senate what is \ncalled NAFTA, which many people will remember, the North American Free-\nTrade Agreement. The contention was, if we would link our economy to \nMexico's economy--and Canada's, too, but especially NAFTA was about \nMexico--somehow we would have tremendous new opportunities in our \ncountry, or so we were told by the prophets of the day. We were told \nthat linking the American economy to the Mexican economy would produce \na burst of new jobs and new opportunity in our country.\n  Some of us did not believe that to be the case. Some of us believed \nthat if you linked an economy like ours with an average wage of $l5 to \n$17 an hour to an economy like Mexico, which still pays in many areas \n50 cents or $1 an hour--in other words, linking our economy to an \neconomy whose wage base is a fraction of ours--we felt it would tip the \ntable so that jobs in this country would move south to Mexico. The jobs \nwould move south because big producers, big corporations want to \nproduce where it is cheap, and sell back into our country.\n  I know it may be a sore spot with some to start keeping score on the \nactual results of NAFTA. But after 1 full year's experience of NAFTA \nand after part of this year with NAFTA, I felt it was important to come \nto the floor of the Senate and describe what has happened with the \nUnited States-Mexico trade situation.\n  A new study has just been released by Robert Scott of the Center for \nInternational Business Education and Research at the University of \nMaryland. Robert Scott used to work for the Joint Economic Committee \nhere in Congress, of which I was a member. He did some analysis and \nsome work while on that committee with respect to NAFTA and has now \ncompleted an evaluation of NAFTA with respect to the job impact in the \nUnited States.\n  I want to commend to the attention of the Senate this study by Mr. \nScott. It is interesting, thoughtful, and I think it is the only study \nI have seen that really looks at this in an appropriate way. Mr. Scott \ntakes out the transshipments between the two countries. In other words, \nif Mexico receives something that is actually produced in another \nnation--for example, computers from Asia--and does not use the \ncomputers but re-exports them to the United States instead, those \ncomputers are not really Mexican exports and so they should not be \ncounted in our measurement. Or, if another nation produces something \nand ships it to the United States but we do not use and simply \ntransport it to Mexico, then it should not be considered an export from \nthe United States to Mexico. These kinds of transshipments do not have \na job impact of any significant nature between our two countries.\n  So, Mr. Scott takes out the transshipments and takes a look at what \nis produced in the United States versus Mexico and what is consumed in \neach country. The question is, What has happened as a result of the \nUnited States-Mexico trade agreement as a result of NAFTA?\n  Let me show you two charts. First, the United States-Mexico trade \nsurplus, again taking out transshipments, we had a very significant \nsurplus in Mexico. In 1992, it was $5.7 billion. In 1993, when we had \nNAFTA passed, it was $1.6 billion. Last year it shrunk to $.5 billion. \nAnd, if the first 3 months of this year are any indication--and almost \nall economists say it is--we will have a $15 billion trade deficit this \nyear with Mexico.\n  Take a look at that and see which direction we are headed. Are those \nprophets who predicted these wonderful things for America now looking \nat their chart and saying, ``Gee, this is wonderful''? I do not think \nso. We went [[Page S8129]] from a significant trade surplus with Mexico \nnow to a very significant trade deficit.\n  What does that mean in terms of jobs? Mr. Scott's study shows what it \nmeans in terms of jobs.\n  What it shows is ``The Promise.'' We have all kinds of studies \nranging from 220,000 to 2.8 million new jobs if we would just pass \nNAFTA. That is ``The Promise.'' The reality is last year we lost 17,000 \nnet jobs in the United States as a result of NAFTA. This year we are \ngoing to lose about 220,000 jobs in the United States as a result of \nNAFTA.\n  If anyone has other figures and would like to debate these, I would \nlove to do so on the Senate floor. I would be glad to take time to do \nit. These are the real numbers. Take all of the transshipments out, and \ntake out all of the statistical nonsense and find out what the net \neffect of jobs is. The net effect of jobs is that in the United States \nwe were promised massive new job creation. And what we have gotten is a \nmassive loss of jobs as a result of the United States-Mexico trade \nagreement.\n  Mr. Scott's study also shows that the jobs that we have lost as a \nresult of the imports coming into this country are good jobs, good-\npaying jobs.\n  What are we importing from Mexico? Is it items produced by unskilled \nworkers? No. The top imports are electrical and electronic machinery, \nequipment and supplies, transportation equipment, automobiles, \nautomobile supplies, and automobile parts. That is what is being \nshipped into this country from Mexico. Those kinds of products \nrepresent good, high-skill jobs. Those are the jobs this country is \nseeing displaced. Those are the jobs this country is losing.\n  We note that in Mexico there is an area along the border called \nmaquiladora plants. The maquiladora plants are the creation of big \ncompanies, many of them United States companies, building manufacturing \nand processing plants just across the border to produce in Mexico and \nship to the United States.\n  What have we seen along the border since NAFTA?\n  There were about 2,000 maquiladora plants in 1994, and recent news \nreports tell us that the Mexican authorities are approving applications \nfor two to three new plants, new manufacturing plants, every single \nday. At this rate of approval, the number of factories in the \nmaquiladora zone in Mexico will increase by 50 percent in 1995. These \nplants are not being built to produce for Mexico. These plants are \nbeing built to dramatically increase exports from Mexico to the United \nStates and dramatically displace jobs in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I do not know how those who were paid for those \nelaborate NAFTA studies that predict massive numbers of new jobs for \nAmerica can walk around holding their head up these days when they see \nwhat has happened with Mexico. Yes. Some of it is because Mexico \ndevalued the peso. I understand that. But we should never have a trade \nagreement with anybody under any condition that does not have an \nadjustment for currency fluctuations anyway.\n  But the point is, this country got with NAFTA what it got with the \nCanadian trade agreement, which is what it got with GATT--we lost in \nthe trade negotiations; we lost in a way that hurts American workers \nand costs our country desperately needed good-paying jobs for the \nAmerican people.\n  I hope that in the coming weeks, as a result of Mr. Scott's study, we \ncan have a real debate again now about NAFTA and maybe renegotiate \nNAFTA. Maybe this trade agreement was not such a good idea. If ``The \nPromise'' was nirvana, massive numbers of new jobs and a bright promise \nfor America, but the reality is massive loss of jobs, big corporations \ntaking advantage of the American people under trade rules they wanted \nand they pushed for, going across the border to produce in Mexico and \nto ship back into this country, maybe, understanding all of that, it is \ntime for our country to decide these trade agreements do not make so \nmuch sense after all.\n  Maybe our trade agreements ought to be trade agreements that \nrepresent the interests of our country, not just the interests of \nmultinational companies who want to produce, yes, in Mexico, but also \nin Indonesia, Malaysia, and all around the world where they can get \npeople to work for 12 cents an hour, 12-year-olds working 12 hours a \nday, to produce a product they can ship to Pittsburgh, Denver, or \nDetroit. That is not fair trade. That is not trade that helps our \ncountry. That is not trade that produces a vibrant, strong American \neconomy.\n  Every time we have these debates, those who support these trade \nagreements that, in my judgment, have irreparably injured our economy \nand have put Americans into a circumstance where they are looking for \ngood jobs and cannot find them. They say, ``Well, the issue is we have \nto have competition. We have to compete. If American workers and \nAmerican business cannot compete, then we are doomed in the \ninternational economy.''\n  My response is: Compete with what? Do you really want the American \npeople to have to compete with people working for 25 cents an hour or \nworking in factories that are unsafe, working in factories that dump \nchemicals into the streets and pollution into the air? If that is what \nwe should compete against, as far as I am concerned, count me out. That \nis not fair competition. It is not what we fought 50 years for in this \ncountry on the issue of decent living wages, good environmental \nstandards, good work, and safety laws. That is not what we fought 50 \nyears for in this country, to surrender all of that, to give all of \nthat up, because the largest enterprises in the world want to construct \nan economic circumstance where they can produce where it is cheap and \nsell into established marketplaces. Such a scheme consigns this \ncountry, in my judgment, to a future with fewer jobs, especially fewer \ngood jobs and fewer good paying jobs.\n  I hope that soon we will see more aggressiveness and more activity on \nthe issue of requiring fair trade.\n  Mickey Kantor and the President are confronting the Japanese on the \ntrade issue, and it requires some strength and courage to do that. None \nof us want a trade war. We understand that. But this is the first time \nthat an American President or a Trade Ambassador has stood up and said \nwait a second; there is a price to pay to trade with us and the price \nis fair trade. Our markets are open to you. You open your markets to \nus. That is what we call fairness in our country.\n  I support the President. I do not want a trade war. It will not serve \nanybody's interests. But I want all of our allies to understand this is \nno longer post-World War II economic aid we are talking about. That is \nwhat our trade policy was for 50 years. Our foreign competitors are now \nstrong and tough. Now we want trade fairness, and we insist on it.\n  On the issue of NAFTA, let us keep score. I can understand missing \nthe bull's-eye. I can even understand missing the target, we find a lot \nof folks do that around here, especially economists. But I cannot \nunderstand missing the bull's-eye, missing the target and shooting \nyourself in the leg instead and not have people in Congress decide \nmaybe this was a bad decision. I hope all of us will rethink these \nissues and decide whether or not there is a different strategy or \ndifferent approach that really supports good jobs in our country and \ndoes not give away our economic future with unfair trade strategies \nthat do not work for the interests of America.\n  Mr. President, I intend to send to other Members of the Senate copies \nof Mr. Scott's work, which I think is original, interesting, and good \nwork that ought to point us in a different direction on trade policy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to address the issue of payment \nof benefits to illegal aliens and how it relates to the welfare reform \nbill that [[Page S8130]] the Senate will be considering very shortly. \nAs other Senators may know--and I hope that they all know--I have long \nhad an interest in curtailing Federal benefits to illegal aliens as a \nmatter of both sound immigration policy and sound fiscal policy. I have \nintroduced that measure as either a stand-alone bill or an amendment in \nevery Congress since 1989, long before measures like California's \nproposition 187 arrived on the scene.\n  In 1993, when we debated the comprehensive crime bill, the Senate \noverwhelmingly accepted my amendment to restrict the benefits, but \nunfortunately those provisions were dropped in conference with the \nHouse of Represenatives. That happens all too often.\n  I need not remind the Senate of the growing concern for what the \npublic considers a runaway immigration policy and porous borders. It is \ntrue that many Federal programs specifically exclude illegal aliens and \ntheir criteria for eligibility. But we now have the sorry condition of \nthe money flowing out just the same due to expansive and misguided \nagency regulation and court interpretations.\n  We also now have large border States filing lawsuits against the \nFederal Government as a result of failures in our Federal immigration \npolicy, with other States threatening to follow suit.\n  It should be noted that the long-awaited report from the U.S. \nCommission on Immigration Reform, headed by respected former \nRepresentative Barbara Jordan, has generally recommended that illegal \naliens not--not--receive publicly funded services or assistance. I \nagree wholeheartedly with that recommendation.\n  I am hopeful that we will soon make significant progress in \nimmigration reform and welfare reform. I am concerned, however, that \nmeaningful measures to restrict Federal welfare benefits to only \ncitizens and legal aliens will be lost in the shuffle.\n  I submit, that when we turn to welfare reform, we have a golden \nopportunity to create a new and more coherent policy and stop, once and \nfor all, paying benefits to illegal aliens.\n  The Senate appears ready to give States more funding flexibility and \nresponsibility to oversee our welfare programs. I think it is only fair \nthat, in exchange for that high degree of flexibility, the Federal \nGovernment asks the States to stand with us in verifying immigrant \nstatus and identifying illegal aliens for speedy deportation. With the \nassistance of the States in the verification process, fewer illegal \naliens will receive benefits and both Federal and State budgets will \nreflect those savings. It is a simple fact that a deported alien will \nnot continue to collect welfare benefits for months and even years.\n  To this point, the Federal Government and the States have essentially \nbeen working at cross-purposes in enforcing the immigration law. The \nStates have decried the inability of the Federal Government to police \nits borders. But when Congress considers dropping benefits to illegal \naliens, the States complain that they will be saddled with the full \ncost of providing these services. But aside from just a few exceptions, \nthe point remains, and the point is this: Neither the Federal \nGovernment nor the States should be paying for those benefits to those \nhere illegally.\n  Illegal alien means just that, illegal. That is why I believe the \nState agencies must help us identify illegal aliens so that they may be \ndeported before they sap either the State or Federal budgets.\n  It is time for a whole new way of thinking about this subject. We \nmust initiate a joint new State-Federal resolve--a new compact, if you \nwill--to put an end to these abuses.\n  Call it a fully funded mandate, and a cost saver as well. I think it \nis only reasonable to require States to verify the status of \napplicants, provided we help them give the resources that they need to \ndo the job. It is my opinion that this change in the compact between \nthe States and the Federal Government would yield benefits for both. \nAnd this principle should apply to whatever welfare reform compromise \neventually passes.\n  Believe me, Mr. President, I feel that we also need to do more \nspadework on immigration reform itself. I feel strongly that \ndeportation proceedings should be expedited. I also feel that there \nneeds to be greater enforcement in those many cases where holders of \ntemporary visas intentionally overstay their visas. And I feel that \nthere needs to be stricter enforcement of the sponsor affidavits, aimed \nat ensuring that immigrants will not be a burden on the taxpayers.\n  Efforts to provide better border patrol and to attack asylum abuse \nare also needed. The President has made tough, new proposals in this \nregard, and I also applied the results of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service's Operation Hold the Line at El Paso.\n  The passage of a welfare reform bill this year is the perfect \nopportunity to take a step back to look at what has gone wrong in the \npast and to stop the robbery of the American taxpayers by illegal \naliens.\n  America has a rich history of diversity. Most of our forebears came \nfrom abroad, but I do not know how anyone can justify payment of \nFederal benefits to illegal aliens.\n  So I put my colleagues on notice.

Mr. President, today, and very probably tomorrow, almost \ndefinitely we will be back into debating a very important part, if not \na critical part, of the rewrite of the telecommunications laws of our \ncountry. They obviously need rewriting because we have not done \nanything about it since 1934, and we all know what has happened to \ncommunications and the distribution of information since that time.\n  In the mind of this Senator from Nebraska, who has been involved in \ntelecommunications and distributions of information for 17 years on the \nCommerce Committee, and before that in other pursuits, a very important \npart of that legislation, as reported out of the Commerce Committee, \ndealt directly with something that is sweeping this country, and that \nis pornography, directed at children primarily, on the information \nsuperhighway, generally called the Internet. Too many people are \nsweeping this aside and saying everything is constitutionally \nguaranteed, and there is nothing we can do without violating the \nConstitution. That is nonsense, Mr. President.\n  I am up this morning just briefly to address this matter and alert \nevery Member of the U.S. Senate, all 100 Senators, to this growing \nperil in America that needs the direct attention and action, in a \nconstitutional manner, by the U.S. Senate.\n  A measure cosponsored by Senator Gorton and myself was unanimously \nadopted in the committee and incorporated in the telecommunications \nbill before the body. At the time of that action, I said this was not a \nperfect piece of legislation. I felt it had to be very carefully \ndrafted in great detail to make certain that we did not pass a piece of \nlegislation that would almost immediately be ruled unconstitutional by \nthe courts.\n  I had amendments to that measure that I was principal sponsor of, \nalong with the Senator from Washington State, in the committee that \nwill further clarify, further define, and further alleviate any \nlegitimate concern for anyone about trampling on the Constitution.\n  I would simply recite once again the statement of presentation made \nat some point on this floor on Friday last. It is printed in the \nCongressional Record of Friday, June 9, 1995, starting on page S8089 \nand running through page S8092. I would like my colleagues that are not \non the floor at this particular moment, or their staffs, to take \n[[Page S8131]] a look at that presentation and bring themselves up to \ndate on what is going on on this very important matter, and have an \nindependent judgment made by every U.S. Senator as to what is right and \nwhat is wrong in this area.\n  I was especially taken, Mr. President, by the prayer of the Chaplain \nof the U.S. Senate that was offered this morning as we began our \ndeliberations. The Chaplain prayed for guidance and prayed for action \non this matter that he and others see as a very, very, serious threat, \nespecially to our youngsters.\n  Therefore, I say, Mr. President, I hope that there will be some study \ngiven to this. I hope that my colleagues and their staffs will listen \nto this Senator and others, who try and make our case for doing \nsomething constructive about this menace that is engulfing the \nInternet; statements to the contrary by those who do not agree, \nnotwithstanding.\n  I simply say, Mr. President, that this is something that needs our \ndefinite attention. It is something that needs some study. I would hope \nthat my colleagues and their staffs would do some study and make \ncertain individual judgments on this matter, because I am sure that \nwhether they agree completely with this Senator or not, they cannot \nhelp but be concerned about this very real threat that is out there \ntoday that I happen to feel is the greatest polluter of the minds of \nour children and grandchildren, that must have some rules and \nregulations.\n  In short, Mr. President, what this Senator from Nebraska is \nattempting to do is to merely copy the legislation that we have had on \nthe books for a long, long time with regard to the spread of \npornography and obscenity, especially addressing the many court \ndecisions that have said that the community standard rules, and \nbasically rules in law have been recognized for a long time, that we \nhave the right, and I think the responsibility, to make sure that our \nchildren do not have instant access to material on the Internet. That \nwe prohibit them by law and constitutionally to see or read or view on \nour magazine stands, even in our motion pictures, certainly in our sex \nshops around the country.\n  The law that we have in place now that I am attempting to get into \nthe legislation with regard to the Internet basically says that we \nshould have the same laws in place with regard to pornography and \nobscenity that we have had for a long, long time, that everyone seems \nto generally agree with.\n  We have laws at the present time to prevent pornography and obscenity \nin our telephone system. We have laws on our books to prohibit the \nmailing, through the U.S. mails, of pornography and obscenity. I do not \nmean that those laws have eliminated any and all type of material, of \nthe type that I am suggesting, of getting through.\n  I simply say, Mr. President, that without those laws, there would be \nmuch more of it, and particularly our children would be placed in \nharm's way from all of this sex sickness that is rampant on the \nInternet today.\n  I will have more to say about this in some more detail as the debate \nmoves forward.\n  Once again, I would like to reference pages in last Friday's \nCongressional Record that I hope might be of interest to my colleagues \nand members of their staff. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/12/senate-section/article/S8130-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8131-S8132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO BRIG. GEN. EDWARD M. FRIEND, JR.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. With the recent celebration of Memorial Day, we paused to \nremember all those who gave their lives in service to their county. \nThis Memorial Day has been especially heartfelt because of the recent \nanniversary of the end of World War II. Brig. Gen. Edward M. Friend, \nJr., gave his life in service to his country, not by losing his life on \nthe battlefield, but by surviving the misery and horrors of war, and \nreturning home to live a life aimed at improving, and bettering his \ncommunity, State, and Nation. He devoted his time, efforts, and \nconsiderable energy to achieving these goals, living up to a \nlongstanding commitment he had to serve others.\n  General Friend was a highly decorated World War II veteran, having \nfought in the Normandy and Sicily invasions and the Battle of the \nBulge, the last attempt by the Third Reich to break through the Allied \nlines moving toward victory in Europe. Those with whom he served \nrecognized his bravery and skill. He received the Legion of Merit with \nCluster, the Croix de Guerre with Palm, the European Campaign Ribbon \nwith seven battle stars and the bronze arrowhead for landing in the \nNormandy invasion, and the Outstanding Civilian Service Medal.\n  General Friend's many accomplishments did not end with his \noutstanding military service. After the war, he returned home to \nBirmingham, AL, to help found the successful law firm of Sirote and \nPermutt, having already graduated from the University of Alabama Law \nSchool prior to the war. Sirote and Permutt eventually became one of \nthe largest and most prestigious law firms in Alabama.\n  For General Friend, service to the community meant serving as \npresident of the Rotary Club, United Way, the Birmingham Area Council \nof the Boy Scouts of America, the Family Counseling Association, and \nthe Metropolitan Arts Council. His organizational and leadership skills \nwere recognized by the Young Men's Business Club of Birmingham, which \nnamed him citizen of the year in 1982 for his accomplishments as chair \nof the United Way Campaign. It is not in any way an exaggeration to say \nthat he excelled at everything he undertook.\n  The many awards General Friend received during his long life are \ntestaments to his hard work and achievements. He was the recipient of \nthe Alabama Arthritis Foundation Humanitarian Award and received \nhonorary doctor of laws degrees from Birmingham-Southern College and \nthe University of Alabama. He was the Birmingham Bar Association Lawyer \nof the Year in 1980, received the Educational Advocate Award from the \nBirmingham Public School System, and was inducted into the Alabama \nAcademy of Honor, and Who's Who in America.\n  While Ed Friend led a life defined by many varied interests and \naccomplishments, he had a true passion for the law. He was one of the \nNation's great lawyers, specializing in the field of tax law. One of \nAmerica's great trial lawyers, Frances H. Hare, Sr., once told me that \nEd, who was his personal tax lawyer, was the best tax practitioner he \nknew.\n  E.M., as he was known to a great number of his friends, was vitally \ninterested in legal education and the improvement of his profession. \nHis service as president of the University of Alabama Law School \nFoundation sparked an awareness and the beginning of substantial \nfinancial assistance to the law school. His tenure as president of the \nBrimingham Bar Association likewise initiated many years of \nimprovements in the legal profession. His leadership and participation \nin the judicial reform movement in Alabama during the 1970's resulted \nin a vastly improved State court system. His concern and achievements \nin providing legal assistance for the indigent resulted in his founding \nof the Birmingham Legal Aid Society and serving as its first president. \nHe was also on the board of directors of the National Legal Aid and \nDefendant Association. At a relatively early stage of his career, Ed \nFriend joined the cause of improving race relations in Alabama, and \nthroughout his life, did a great deal to better those relations.\n  He was a great family man. He and his delightful, beautiful wife \nHermione were constantly sought out by friends for their company and \ncompanionship. Throughout Herme's period of prolonged illness, her \nhusband proved to be a devoted companion. This devotion was true of the \nentire Friend family, as their children Eddie and Ellen at all times \ndisplayed great loyalty to their mother and father.\n  General Friend gave of himself tirelessly and selflessly in ways that \nare difficult to describe in words. The impact of his work has been \nfelt by those who knew him, worked with him, served with him, and \nbenefited from his generosity. He will long be remembered for the basic \ngood he did--and the dignity with which he did it--as it continues to \ntouch the lives of others in the Birmingham area and throughout the \nState. He once said during an interview, ``Everyone should strive to \nmake the world a better place. The purpose of life is not to be happy. \nThe purpose of life is to matter, to be productive, to \n[[Page S8132]] have it make some difference that you lived at all.''\n  When I think of my great friend and how he described what life meant \nto him, I am reminded of the Ralph Waldo Emerson verse, ``Success.'' It \ngoes:\n\n                                Success\n\n     To laugh often and much;\n     To win the respect of intelligent people and affection of \n           children\n     To earn the appreciation of honest critics . . .\n     To appreciate beauty, to find the best in others;\n     To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child,\n     a garden patch or a redeemed social condition;\n     To know even one life has breathed easier because you have \n           lived;\n     This is to have succeeded.\n\n  If Emerson was correct about the definition of success, then Ed \nFriend, Jr., succeeded enough for many, many lifetimes. In knowing Ed, \nI was always struck by how his simple but eloquent family name--\n``Friend''--so defined who he was an how he lived. No other epitaph \nwould be needed than simply his name--Friend. He was a friend to his \ncommunity, State, country, profession, and to the many, many \nindividuals fortunate enough to have known him over the years.\n  I extend my sincerest condolences to Ed's wife, Hermione, and to \ntheir children Frances Ellen and Edward M. III in the wake of this \ntremendous loss, and ask unanimous consent that a copy of the June 6, \n1995, Birmingham News tribute to Ed be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objections, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             General Friend\n\n       ``He left his imprint on all segments of our society. He \n     was selfless.''\n       Those two short lines from Birmingham-Southern College \n     President Neal Berte sum up well the life of longtime civic \n     activist Edward M. Friend Jr., was passed away Monday at the \n     age of 83.\n       You'd be hard pressed to discover something Gen. Friend \n     attempted that he did not excel in.\n       As a soldier, he received numerous battlefield decorations \n     for his efforts in the Normandy invasion and in the Battle of \n     the Bulge--including the Bronze Star with Cluster, the Croix \n     de Guerre with Palm and the Legion of Merit. Later he was \n     named a brigadier general in the U.S. Army Reserve. Over this \n     past weekend Gov. Fob James appointed him a major general in \n     the Alabama National Guard.\n       As an attorney, he came back to Birmingham after World War \n     II to help form what would become one of the state's largest \n     law firms.\n       But as a community leader, he was unbelievable. Among the \n     civic organizations he served as chairman or president of at \n     some point were: the Rotary Club, the Birmingham Bar \n     Association, the United Way, the Birmingham Legal Aid \n     Society, the Birmingham Area Council of the Boy Scouts of \n     America, the Family Counseling Association, the Metropolitan \n     Arts Council, the University of Alabama President's Cabinet \n     and Temple Emanu-El.\n       In his spare time, he even occasionally penned a letter to \n     the editor about some community problem or effort.\n       During the recent Memorial Day holiday an aging soldier \n     interviewed about his war service responded that it changed \n     his whole life. Thereafter, he said, he worked hard to always \n     show that he was worthy to have been one of the survivors.\n       Who knows if that same sort of experience colored Gen. \n     Friend's life?\n       To say that his was a worthy one for Birmingham is an \n     understatement.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/12/senate-section/article/S8131-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, yesterday at Union College in \nSchenectady, NY, I was privileged to deliver the commencement address \non the occasion of the bicentennial anniversary of that institution's \ncharter. The elements, however, did not cooperate. As the thunder began \nto rumble, I cut my address short. But as this morning's Albany Times \nUnion noted, my parting promise to the gathered was: ``I'll put the \nrest in the Congressional Record.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my \naddress be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the address was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Union College Commencement Address\n\n                  (By Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan)\n\n       In a world made up of some 192 nations, of which a scant 51 \n     existed a half century ago, and of these only eight having \n     existed for a whole century without having their form of \n     government changed by violence, it is a rare experience to \n     graduate from a college founded a full two centuries ago in a \n     new and novel nation with tiny resources and doubtful \n     prospects which not only endures to this day, but stands now \n     pre-eminent among the nations of the world.\n       It is a matter worth reflection. And a setting designed for \n     just that, by an architect trained at the court of Louis XVI. \n     Union College was, of course, the first educational \n     institution chartered by New York State. It promptly broke \n     with the past creating, as Roger G. Kennedy has written, ``a \n     scientific, almost polytechnical course, in defiance of the \n     classical curriculum then almost universal in America.'' This \n     was so very much in the spirit of the new republic, evoked in \n     The Federalist papers published up and down the Hudson \n     Valley, not a dozen years earlier.\n       We do well to consult those incomparable essays from time \n     to time, and not simply because the new Speaker of the House \n     of Representatives admonishes that we ought. The first thing \n     to note, or so it seems to me, is the conscious, proclaimed \n     assertion of the Founders that they had discovered what \n     Madison termed ``a new science of politics'' based upon \n     principles--uniformities--in human behavior which made \n     possible the reintroduction of republican government nearly \n     two millennia after Caesar had ended the experiment. Given \n     what Madison termed ``the fugitive and turbulent existence of \n     ancient republics,'' who could dare to suggest that a modern \n     republic could fare better? Well, Madison could. And why? \n     Because careful study had produced new knowledge. To cite \n     Martin Diamond:\n       ``This great new claim rested upon a new and aggressively \n     more `realistic' idea of human nature. Ancient and medieval \n     thought and practice were said to have failed disastrously by \n     clinging to illusions regarding how men ought to be. Instead, \n     the new science would take man as he actually is, would \n     accept as primary in his nature the self-interestedness and \n     passion displayed by all men everywhere and, precisely on \n     that basis, would work out decent political solutions.''\n       Until that time, with but a few exceptions, the whole of \n     political thought turned on ways to inculcate virtue in a \n     small class that governed. But, wrote Madison, ``if men were \n     angels, no government would be necessary.'' We would have to \n     work with the material at hand. Not pretty, but something far \n     more important: predictable. Thus, men could be relied upon \n     to be selfish; nay, rapacious. Very well. ``Ambition must be \n     made to counteract ambition.'' Whereupon we derive the \n     central principle of the Constitution, the various devices \n     which in Madison's formulation, offset ``by opposite and \n     rival interests, the defect of better motives.'' (See Daniel \n     Patrick Moynihan, ``Came The Revolution'', Harcourt Brace \n     Jovanovich, New York, 1988, pgs. 302-303.)\n       The American revolution and the new nation emerged from a \n     crisis of legitimacy in the old European order. The Founders \n     genius was to adapt to that order rather than seeking to \n     abolish all traces of it. As, for example, the French \n     revolutionaries did when they changed the names of the days \n     of the week and declared 1792 to be L'annee Une. Year One.\n       There is a striking parallel between these political \n     revolutions of the late 18th century and the economic \n     revolutions of our time. In the course of the past half-\n     century the United States essentially has learned to manage \n     an industrial economy. This learning followed a crisis of \n     legitimacy in the old economic order which unlike the Soviet \n     Union, for example, we did not abolish but did, in fact, \n     transform.\n       1945 was, of course, the 150th anniversary of the founding \n     of Union College. It was also the year that World War II came \n     to an end. V-J Day was September 2; Union celebrated its \n     Sesquicentennial two weeks later. I was in the Navy then, (as \n     was Joseph Hinchey) and remember those days. The great \n     question here at home was whether the end of the war would \n     mean the resumption of the Great Depression of the 1930s, and \n     generally speaking, the crisis of capitalism which had \n     brought on the war, or was widely held to have done. \n     [[Page S8133]] \n       Just what does it mean to speak of a ``crisis in \n     capitalism?'' If the term seems puzzling today, it would not \n     have been then. Then it meant going from 3.2 percent \n     unemployment in 1929 to 24.9 percent in 1933, and averaging \n     about 18 percent for the remainder of the decade. Stop and \n     imagine for a moment searching for a job--let alone your \n     first job--when one-fourth of the labor force is unemployed. \n     This was the worst experience, worldwide, in the history of \n     industrial economies. At the height of the Depression 13 \n     million workers were unemployed in the United States.\n       It seemed, moreover, to be just the latest swing in a \n     steadily amplifying cycle of boom and bust. We have almost \n     lost this memory. The Panic of 1893. The Panic of 1908. The \n     Crash of 1919, of 1929, of 1938. Already, at the beginning of \n     this century, it was widely held that free enterprise \n     capitalism just couldn't work. A great socialist movement \n     began. George R. Lunn, the first socialist Mayor in New York, \n     was elected here in Schenectady in 1911. Not untypically, he \n     came out of the Midwest and was an ordained Presbyterian \n     minister--having received his Doctor of Divinity degree from \n     Union. In 1912, an ambitious Harvard graduate, Walter \n     Lippmann, came here to be the Mayor's executive secretary. \n     This seemingly was where the future lay. And, of course, \n     there was soon a Communist Party in the United States, \n     actively supported by ``Moscow gold,'' as it was sometimes \n     and not inaccurately termed. For Communists the end of the \n     age of capitalism was assumed to be instantly at hand. There \n     was thunder on the right, as well; and as the Depression \n     settled in, a great crisis of confidence in the vital center.\n       Then knowledge appeared which changed everything. It began \n     with measurement; just what were these business cycles that \n     so often turned into disaster? Obviously, not the ancient \n     rhythm of winter, spring, summer, and fall. But what? A nice \n     place to start is the foundation of the National Bureau of \n     Economic Research at Columbia University, the only \n     institution of higher learning in New York older than Union. \n     C. Wesley Mitchell, who was director of the Bureau for near \n     to half a century (1920-45), put it nicely:\n       ``Our best hope for the future lies in the extension to \n     social organization of the methods that we already employ in \n     our most progressive fields of effort. In science and in \n     industry . . . we do not wait for catastrophe to force new \n     ways upon us. . . . We rely, and with success, upon \n     quantitative analysis to point the way; and we advance \n     because we are constantly improving and applying such \n     analysis.''\n       Then theory. Principally by John Maynard Keynes in England \n     refuting the assumption of classical economics that markets \n     automatically return to an equilibrium, with all resources \n     employed. An economy could settle in at high levels of \n     unemployed people and underutilized capital.\n       Next practice. During World War II, here in the United \n     States, the new economics performed surpassingly well, \n     notably as regards inflation which actually declined during \n     the war years.\n       Finally, there was law. In the Employment Act of 1946, \n     Congress declared it to be:\n       ``The continuing policy and responsibility of the Federal \n     Government . . . to promote maximum employment, production \n     and purchasing power.''\n       Note the genius of that language. The by now century-old \n     dispute over capitalism had been a dispute over ownership, \n     with the left calling for public ownership as against \n     private. Of a sudden, we changed the terms of the debate. Now \n     we were talking about employment, production, purchasing \n     power. And measuring progress in an Annual Economic Report of \n     the President, prepared by the new Council of Economic \n     Advisers.\n       Before 1929 the average business cycle contraction lasted \n     nearly 21 months following an average expansion of slightly \n     more than 25 months. About even. Over the past fifty years, \n     however, the average recovery has lasted 50 months, with \n     contractions shortened to an average of 11 months. A very \n     different world. In all this half century, the largest \n     decline in output was 2.2 percent, in 1982. Compare that with \n     a drop of 9.9 percent in 1930; followed by 7.7 percent in \n     1931; followed by 14.8 percent in 1932. As of now, for \n     example, we are in our 10th post-war expansion which reached \n     its 50th month in May. During the half century period, the \n     size of our economy has quadrupled, and real income per \n     person has more than doubled.\n       Is our world transformed? Well, yes it is. And it would do \n     us no harm to take note between bouts of self-abasement. The \n     legitimacy of a free enterprise society, with free labor and \n     free markets is acknowledged across the globe.\n       Now then, are our troubles behind us? Assuredly not; \n     obviously not. My colleague and friend, Senator Bill Bradley, \n     observes that ``the fragile ecology of our social environment \n     is as threatened as that of our natural environment.'' (I \n     would say vastly more so.) He continues:\n       ``The market is governed by the logic of economic self-\n     interest, while government is the domain of laws with all \n     their coercive authority. Civil society, on the other hand, \n     is the sphere of our most basic humanity.''\n       True enough. Marine Corps Major Stephen Ganyard recently \n     called attention to the passage in The Theory of Moral \n     Sentiments (1759) by Adam Smith, who had something to do with \n     all this market business, in which he writes that in our \n     actions we cannot ``prefer ourselves so shamelessly and \n     blindly to others,'' even if that is the natural inclination \n     of our feelings. (As Madison would have thought.) In our \n     time, Joseph Schumpeter has explained, in Eugene D. \n     Genovese's words, ``the ways in which capitalism relentlessly \n     destroys the pre-capitalist institutions and values necessary \n     for its social and political stability.'' Consider, if you \n     will, the state of the American family. Or note that in \n     Washington today the talk is less about how the economy can \n     create jobs but how a dependent population can be induced to \n     take them. But surely that only strengthens the case for a \n     ``science of politics'' that seeks, however so often in vain, \n     to understand the world which we inherit but which we also in \n     some measure create.\n       And so, then, on to the Third Century.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/12/senate-section/article/S8132-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 CAPTURE OF GILBERTO RODRIGUEZ OREJUELA\n\n  Mr. MACK.

Mr. President, with the death of Armand F. Cocco, Sr., I, \nand I might add Senator Roth, have lost a good friend, and my State of \nDelaware has lost one of its most conscientious citizens. With his wife \nand constant teammate of 47 years, Anna Zebley Cocco, he devoted a \nlifetime to energetic service to others.\n  Mr. Cocco, a member of the Delaware Industrial Accident Board, was a \n45-year member of the Plumbers & Pipe Fitters Union Local 74, acting as \ntheir political liaison for the union and testifying in court for \nworkers who had been diagnosed with asbestosis. He had no formal \neducation beyond high school, but he was a student of human nature and \na skillful advocate who gained impressive achievements for his \ncommunity without ever claiming any character other than that of an \nordinary citizen. He was my friend for more than 25 years, but he could \nstill surprise me with interests and talents of which I had been \nunaware. He never stopped.\n  I first met Armand Cocco when I was a young man, a member of the New \nCastle County Council and a candidate for the U.S. Senate. It was then \nthat he and his wife asked whether I would meet with them, and they \ncame charging full-blown into my office with their usual brisk \nenthusiasm about a plan that was going to widen a four-lane highway, an \nexpressway through one of our oldest suburban communities. As they saw \nit, they were going to convert this modestly busy local road into an \nexpressway that would divide and overshadow their community, literally \ndivide their community right down the middle. And as Anna said, it \nwould amount to a ``Chinese wall'' in this older, stable community. \nThey were determined to stop it, with the determination they shared, \nconfidently and persistently, with Delaware public officials of both \nmajor parties.\n  I know it will surprise no one in this body that energized citizens \noften change the outcome of a predetermined decision. A quarter of a \ncentury later, that expressway still stops literally at the threshold \nof the community they were so resolute in defending.\n  If Armand and Anna Cocco were a political force to be reckoned with--\nand they certainly were--they were also friends whose support could be \ncounted on by public officials in both parties, as our Democratic \nGovernor Tom Carper could tell you and my Republican colleague, Senator \nRoth, as well as my Republican colleague, Congressman Castle could \ntestify.\n  Armand Cocco was an adroit and accomplished political activist but no \nparty could claim his exclusive allegiance. No party could claim a \nnarrow partisan interest on his part, but he consistently worked for \nthe public interest. He was a very demanding citizen, but he never \nasked more than he was willing to give. And shoulder to shoulder, along \nwith his remarkable [[Page S8134]] wife, Anna, he would work with \nwhomever was willing to work for the public interest. Anna survives \nhim, and I am confident she will continue to get things done, although \nshe has lost a very, very potent partner.\n  Mr. President, no one, no community, can lose a friend like Armand \nCocco without feeling sad, but the sadness attending his passing has an \nespecially melancholy quality for me and many of his friends because we \nfear that in losing him we are also losing one of the last examples of \nAmerican value and of an American personality that we can ill-afford to \nmove on without--the public-spirited private citizen with a traditional \nsense of community responsibility that has historically enabled us to \ndeal with a range of social problems that simply lie beyond the \ncapacity of government alone to resolve. The balance between public \ninterest and private interests, the tension between individualism and \ncommunity responsibility, has been losing the equilibrium that de \nTocqueville identified over 150 years ago as the secret to our American \ndemocracy.\n  That growing imbalance is perhaps our greatest national problem \ntoday, but it was never a problem for Armand Cocco. He was as strong a \npersonality with a keen sense of the individual as anyone I have ever \nmet. But he knew how to strike a proper balance between his personal \naspirations and the needs of his community. He was and will always \nremain among all those who knew him a model of good citizenship in a \ndemocratic society, and an assurance that our democracy will survive if \nwe take his lifelong example to heart.\n  Mr. President, a very personal note. He was also a loyal friend to my \ndeceased wife. When she passed away, it was Armand Cocco who went to \nthe citizens of that small community and asked that the park be \ndedicated in her name, the name of which it still carries.\n  And lastly, I was on my way down here to vote on Friday, but the \nfuneral was Friday. I thought it was important to vote, but I decided--\nand I must say it publicly to my constituents--it was more important \nfor me to go to the funeral because of a public man like him, who had \ncontributed so much; so I did not come down. I went and expressed my \nsympathies to his wife, Anna, and to his daughter, and all of the \nfamily.\n  I thank the Chair for its indulgence and allowing me to speak.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/12/senate-section/article/S8133-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8134-S8176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION AND DEREGULATION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 652, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The bill (S. 652) to provide for a pro-competitive, de-\n     regulatory national policy framework designed to accelerate \n     rapidly private sector deployment of advanced \n     telecommunications and information technologies and services \n     to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to \n     competition, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Dorgan modified amendment No. 1264, to require Department \n     of Justice approval for regional Bell operating company entry \n     into long distance services, based on the VIII(c) standard.\n       Thurmond modified amendment No. 1265 (to amendment No. \n     1264), to provide for the review by the Attorney General of \n     the United States of the entry of the Bell operating \n     companies into interexchange telecommunications and \n     manufacturing markets.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, we are returning to the \ntelecommunications bill. I urge all Senators to come to the floor with \ntheir statements and amendments.\n  We have made good progress on the bill. We have many challenges ahead \nto meet.\n  As I have said frequently, this bill will allow all parts of the \ntelecommunications industry to get into each other's business and allow \nnew small businesses to get into the telecommunications area. It will \nopen up our local telephone markets for the first time to competition. \nIt will allow our long distance companies to get into local and vice \nversa.\n  It will move toward the deregulation of cable by encouraging \ncompetition from DBS, direct broadcast satellite television, and by \ngiving the regional Bells video dial opportunity. There will be three \nor four competitors in each market,\n which should and will make cable prices much lower. It will mean lower \ncost telephone services, lower telephone rates and lower long distance \nrates for the average American.\n\n  Many years ago, when I was in the House, we had some great debates \nover the deregulation of natural gas, and people said if we deregulate \nnatural gas, prices will skyrocket. They did not. They have come down \nand there is competition and natural gas prices are lower than they \nhave ever been.\n  We can do our senior citizens and others a favor by getting lower \nprices through competition. That is what this bill will do.\n  This bill will also lift some regulation in the broadcast area. It \nwill allow some of our utilities to do things they have not done before \nin telecommunications. It covers a broad spectrum of American life.\n  It is a very important bill. It is a bill we need to pass. The bill \nwe have before us is not perfect in anyone's eyes. It is a good bill, \nand each Senator would write it slightly differently. Indeed, every \nSenator has had the opportunity to participate in the writing of this \nbill. It has been a long process that we held before the markup in the \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.\n  We held meeting after meeting for probably 90 days as well as meeting \non Saturdays and Sundays, with Senators and staffs being invited who \nwished to participate. We came to the Commerce Committee with this bill \nand received all except two votes. We are very proud of the bipartisan \neffort that we have made and that will remain bipartisan.\n  I want to pay tribute to my colleague, Senator Hollings, who has done \nsuch an outstanding job, and to all the Republicans and Democrats who \nhave worked hard on this bill.\n  This bill will provide a roadmap for us into the wireless age. It \nwill provide a roadmap for investors to invest in creative and \ncompetitive enterprises. It will also help consumers because it will \nmean more services at lower prices. If we look at what has happened in \nthe computer industry, every 18 months their equipment is virtually \nobsolete, there is so much competition and so much innovation. I would \nlike to see the same thing in the telecommunications area, and I think \nwe can see that in the next 10 years if we pass this bill.\n  We still have a long way to go. We have to pass the bill in the \nSenate and in the House, we have to have a conference, and the \nPresident has to be able to sign it. I hope the White House will help \nus out.\n  I began this process by going to the White House with a copy of the \nchairman's discussion draft and talking to Al Gore, trying to get his \nsupport. We hope the White House will be supportive of this process, \nbecause, if we can pass this bill, I frequently say, it will be like \nthe Oklahoma land rush for the American consumers. Right now, many of \nour telecommunications areas are in economic apartheid; they are \nlimited just to one group. If we could get them deregulated and \ncompeting, there would be an explosion of new investment, an explosion \nof new services, and a explosion of opportunities and employment.\n  Presently, many of our largest telecommunications companies have to \ninvest abroad if they want to manufacture, for example, because the \nregional Bells are prohibited. Others invest abroad because they cannot \nget into other areas. This will let everybody into everybody else's \nbusiness. It will allow competition, as it should.\n  In the future, whether it is 5 or 10 or 15 years from now, we will be \nin the wireless era. That may well be an opportunity for even more \ncompetition because presently you have to unbundle or interconnect with \nsomeone else's wires to get access to local telephone service, for \nexample. But we hope that is changed and will be changed by this bill.\n  I know there are many amendments pending, and I hope Senators will \nbring their amendments to the floor this afternoon. I plead with \nSenators to allow us to have some time agreements at some point so we \ncan debate these amendments on both sides. It is not my intention to \ndiscourage any Senator from offering an amendment. We are working with \nstaff, trying to get time [[Page S8135]] agreements on some of these \namendments so we can move forward.\n  I have asked Senator Dole and Senator Daschle for their cooperation \nin finishing this bill, and I think it is very, very important. As has \nbeen pointed out repeatedly, this bill will affect every household in \nAmerica. If we fail to act this year, it will fall over to 1997 because \nnext year, being a Presidential year, such a controversial bill \nprobably will not be able to pass.\n  This is one of the most controversial and complicated bills to come \nto the Senate floor. I think we are on the way to passing it. But we \nwill need the cooperation of all Senators. I have frequently said this \nis not the sort of bill that any one Senator can take credit for, or \nthe lead. It takes every Senator. We all have to be involved. Because \nin the telecommunications field, any one group can checkmate, almost, \nthe progress of a bill. We hope that does not happen.\n  It is very important. It will affect a third of our economy. It will \ncreate jobs. As we read in the newspapers about some of our mature, \naging industries, as they lay people off, we need to have new, creative \nareas to create jobs. We have done that in the computer industry. We \nhave done it in some of our other growth industries. This will make us \ncompetitive internationally also. It will affect our exports and our \nbalance of payments.\n  This bill also includes reciprocity for investors from abroad so we \ntreat them as they treat us. The public interest review by the FCC is \npreserved.\n  So, I urge Senators, come to the floor and offer amendments. I ask \nrespectfully that we be able to get some time agreements on some of \nthese controversial amendments that will be coming. It is not our \nintention to shut anybody off. We want people to have their vote. But \nwe must proceed.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1265, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the matter pending before the Senate is \nnow a second-degree amendment by Senator Strom Thurmond to a first-\ndegree amendment that I offered last week dealing with the issue of the \nrole of the Justice Department in the telecommunications legislation.\n  I would like to describe where we are and how we reached this point, \nand why I think this set of amendments is an important discussion for \nthe Senate.\n  First of all, the Senator from South Dakota, Senator Pressler, \ndescribed a few moments ago the importance of this bill for virtually \nevery American. There is no doubt about that. The issue of \ncommunications and telecommunications is one that will affect every \nsingle American. You cannot escape the impact of this legislation. We \nhave seen an explosion of technology, an explosion in communications in \nthis country in computers, telephones, cable, and broadcast, and we are \nseeing capabilities in this country today for every American, no matter \nwhere they live, that were only dreamed of several years ago.\n  The question before the Senate is what kind of rules shall exist for \nthe competition between various types of communication in our country? \nThe last set of rules was a set of rules in 1934 established to try to \ngovern the circumstances of operations in the communications industry \nin which we had a regulated monopoly. Phone service was a monopoly. Of \ncourse, we did not have computers then, we did not have cable \ntelevision then, but we had phone service. Communications back then was \na regulated monopoly.\n  Now, in 1995, we are moving toward a deregulated set of circumstances \nin the telecommunications industry. The question is how do we structure \nthe rules so that you get deregulation with fair competition and at the \nsame time have the buildup of the infrastructure so that communications \nis not something that exists only where you have affluent neighborhoods \nor high concentrations of people.\n  Many of us believe that the issue of communications is universal. It \ndoes not matter how big a town you live in or where you live in this \ncountry. Your ability to use a telephone or use a computer or access \nany number of devices in the telecommunications industry and be a part \nof the information superhighway--your interest and your need for that--\nis just as intense and important if you come from a town of 300 people \nin southwestern North Dakota as it is if you live in downtown Manhattan \nin New York City.\n  So many of us feel as we deregulate we must make sure there are \nsafeguards in this legislation so that the buildup of the \ninfrastructure, so the building of the information superhighway, \nreaches, yes, even the rural areas of our country.\n  As we do that we understand that there is a fundamental tension \nbetween deregulation and the search for profits and opportunities by \ncompanies who will go to the densely populated areas of our country and \nthe need to try to provide the same kind of service and the same \ncapabilities in rural areas in our country. That is the purpose of this \nlegislation, at least as far as I am concerned.\n  Some see this legislation simply as opening the door and unlocking \nthe forces of competition. That is part of it. I understand that. I \naccept that. I think competition can provide enormous benefits for our \ncountry. I happen to think that the Bell operating companies are good \ncompanies. I met a couple of CEO's of Bell operating companies in \nrecent months who have come to my office. I am most impressed. They are \ngood companies with good growth and plans for the future that are \ninteresting and stimulating.\n  I also happen to think that we have long-distance carriers in this \ncountry that are new, vibrant, and growing, and do a lot of interesting \nthings. In the long-distance area, of course, we have had competition. \nAs a result of that competition with hundreds of providers of long-\ndistance services fighting for the consumer's dollar, we have seen a \nsubstantial decrease in the rates for long distance service.\n  We have not seen a similar circumstance in local service, and this \nbill will lead to a similar circumstance, some say, in local service, \nwhere we open local service to competition.\n  Well, when we do that, when we open local service exchanges to \ncompetition, then the Bell operating systems will want to go out and \ncompete in the long distance market, and this piece of legislation sets \nthe conditions under which that will be possible.\n  Now, Senator Thurmond and I introduced amendments which said the \nquestion of when real competition exists and when the baby Bells or the \nBell operating companies shall be permitted to go off and compete in \nthe long distance arena, that is a very critical area in this bill \nbecause if the Bells are free to go compete in long distance before \nthere is true competition in the rural areas, you have the makings of a \nreal mess and the makings not of deregulation and not of unleashing the \nforces of competition for the benefit of the consumer, but instead you \nhave the prospect of once again establishing monopoly forces in the \nmarketplace.\n  So it is very important to have the right kind of ingredient in this \nlegislation that serves the interest of competition, when you are \nopening the door to have the Bell operating companies move into the \nlong distance service.\n  Both Senator Thurmond and I have offered amendments that describe a \nrole for the Justice Department in those determinations. The \nlegislation that came out of the Commerce Committee had a role for the \nJustice Department that was simply consultative. In other words, the \nFCC, the Federal Communications Commission, would essentially make the \ndetermination of the public interest standards with their checklist \nabout when certain conditions were met and when the Bells would be \nmoving into long distance service and when there was real competition \nin the local exchanges. And the Justice Department was simply \nconsultative.\n  We have had some experience on deregulation with respect to \nconsulting the Justice Department. I remember that we deregulated the \nairline industry and what we had in the airline industry was with \nrespect to mergers and [[Page S8136]] acquisitions the Department of \nTransportation would provide its approval and the Justice Department \nwould be consulted.\n  Well, what has happened since the deregulation of the airline \nindustry is pretty clear. What is happening is we now have five or six \nvery large airline carriers in this country that have bought up their \ncompetition and they are getting bigger. Why? Because that is the way \nthe market system works if it is not checked with respect to \ncompetition and what we will have is competition among four or five or \nsix behemoths in this country in the airline industry.\n  Now, the Department of Justice on a number of occasions said, well, \nwe do not think this acquisition makes sense. That is our judgment. The \nDepartment of Transportation says it does not matter; we are going to \nallow it to proceed anyway.\n  So we have seen some experience with having the Department of Justice \nin a consultative state, and frankly I think it does not work in this \narea of deregulation. I want the Department of Justice to have a full \nrole with respect to its antitrust activities and its ability to \nevaluate when these kinds of activities are in the public interest. I \ndo not want the Department of Justice to become a set of human brake \npads so that you have a bunch of lawyers down there who simply put \ntheir foot in the door and say we are not going to make any decisions; \nwe are not going to let anything happen. I do not want the Department \nof Justice to be a brake, but I do want the Department of Justice to be \na full participant and a full partner in this judgment about what is in \nthe public interest: when does competition really exist? When do you \npotentially threaten a now competitive set of circumstances with the \npotential for concentration that diminishes competition?\n  So that was the point of my amendment. My amendment used a standard, \nthe VIII(c) standard it is called, and would give the Justice \nDepartment a role in those circumstances with a time requirement by \nwhich they must act. And Senator Thurmond, feeling I think the same \nway, that the Justice Department should have a role, introduced an \namendment but his amendment uses a different standard, the Clayton 7 \nstandard.\n  We have worked over the weekend, and Senator Thurmond, I understand, \nwill be coming to the floor in the next half-hour or hour. I believe he \nis at the White House for a meeting. But we have worked over the \nweekend with Senator Thurmond and have reached agreement on a \nmodification of his amendment which provides some language that I have \nsuggested and retains the core standard in his amendment, and that is \nan approach I think both of us support, both of us think advances the \ninterests that we are attempting to advance with our amendments, and I \nhope when Senator Thurmond comes to the floor and modifies his \namendment and discusses it, we would be able to move forward.\n  It will be a common amendment that both of us will support. We have \nbeen working since late last week and worked through the weekend on it, \nand I think it does advance the interests both of us attempted or \nwanted to advance with respect to the role of the Department of \nJustice.\n  When Senator Thurmond does come to the floor and offers such a \nmodification, I know the managers want to proceed to set a vote on an \namendment of this type, and I have no objection to that at all. I know \nthe majority leader has indicated that we would not have record votes \ntoday before 5 o'clock. On the question of whether a vote is set on \nthis evening or first thing tomorrow morning, I would be happy to work \nwith Senator Thurmond and with the chairman of the Commerce Committee, \nthe majority leader, the ranking member, and others. It seems to me \nthat is something we can work out in the coming hours. I think there is \nreally not much need to spend a great deal more time.\n  There are a number of others who want to discuss this subject this \nafternoon, and we certainly need to allow time for that. The Senator \nfrom Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, who has been intensely interested in \nthis subject and been active and involved in the discussions about it I \nknow also will be interested in the conditions under which a vote is \nheld.\n  I think this is one of the most important amendments we will be \nvoting on dealing with this legislation. Frankly, there are not many \npeople who even understand it very much. I understand that this is not \na very sexy issue; it does not generate a lot of public interest. It is \nnot something that is easily understood. It is not something, the \nimpact of which will be readily known even as we vote on this \nlegislation, but I am convinced that as we tackle the changing of the \nrules for an industry that is one of the largest industries in this \ncountry and as we talk about where we move in the future with that \nindustry, if we do not provide for the public interest by establishing \nmore than a consultative role for the Department of Justice to assure \nthat the forces of competition exist, then I think we will not have \ndone a service with this legislation.\n  I know this will likely be a close vote, but I do hope that those who \nstudy this issue and who really want to deregulate but to retain as we \nderegulate the safeguards of making certain that competition exists in \nreal form and that the American people have the benefits and bear the \nfruit of that competition, I think they will want to vote with Senator \nThurmond, myself, Senator Kerrey, and many others who feel very \nstrongly about the role of the Department of Justice in providing us \nthose guarantees.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise again to discuss this bill and to \ndiscuss the amendment offered by the Senator from North Dakota, as well \nas the amendment offered by the senior Senator from South Carolina, to \ngive the Department of Justice a role in what is essentially an \namendment of the 1934 Communications Act which will again move us in \nthe direction, further in the direction of competition, further in the \ndirection of deregulation than the modified consent decree which was \nfiled in August 1982 has done over the past 13 years.\n  The central question I think for colleagues as they consider this \namendment ought to be whether or not the Department of Justice can \nperform a role in promoting competition. Indeed, I believe that the \nDepartment of Justice is the only agency in Washington, DC, with any \nexperience or any demonstrable success at moving us from a monopoly \nsituation, in this case in the communications industry, to a \ncompetitive arena.\n  Let me point out, I appreciate very much what the chairman and the \nranking member have done thus far. I believe there had been a number of \nsignificant victories that have occurred thus far in the debate \nimportant to identify because we have taken a bit more time than was \noriginally anticipated, but I think it has been time well spent.\n  First, we were successful in defeating an effort to strike the \nlanguage that the chairman and the ranking member made certain was in \nthe bill that gives preferential rates to education, libraries, and to \nhealth care facilities. It is very important, particularly in the area \nof K-12 education, that we provide those preferential rates.\n  I know some will argue it runs at odds with what we are trying to do. \nIndeed, I must confess, it essentially does run, in many ways, at odds. \nThe problem is our schools, particularly in the K-12 environment, are \nnot market operations, they are government operations. If we do not \ncarve out and provide a special opportunity for them to get access, it \nis highly unlikely they are going to be able to take advantage of the \ncommunications revolution that I think this legislation is apt to set \noff, at least accelerate. And if they do not take advantage of it, our \ntest scores are not going to be affected by technology. The capacity of \nour students to do well and prepare themselves either for the work \nforce or college will be significantly diminished. That was a big \nvictory in beating back an effort to strike that language, essentially \nwhat would amount to the new section 264 under the 1934 Communications \nAct.\n  Second, there was an effort to strike what has been described as the \npublic interest, necessity, and convenience [[Page S8137]] test. This \nis a longstanding test that has been applied by the Federal \nCommunications Commission to determine how it is that we regulate. It \nseems like it is a relatively small effort, but it is a very large \nvictory for American consumers, and I appreciate my colleagues' support \nin keeping that language in here.\n  In the managers' amendment offered earlier, the managers changed the \nregulations as it affects in-area acquisition of cable, which I think \nis going to be terribly important to maintain a competitive \nenvironment. Personally, I believe strongly, at least in the short \nterm, unless households have two lines coming in--a telephone line and \na cable line--it is not likely that you are going to get that kind of \ncompetitive situation. This in-area acquisition amendment was an \nextremely important amendment to get attached.\n  There was a joint marketing provision for small companies that was \nadded. I appreciate very much that being added. I believe that promotes \ncompetition and allows the smaller entities--I say again for emphasis, \nthat is likely to be where the jobs are going to be created subsequent \nto this legislation--it allows smaller companies to do joint marketing. \nIt is a very important procompetitive change that was made in the bill.\n  The legislation has very strong language making sure the system is \ninteroperable, though it does not establish, as I think it should \nestablish, the Government's role in setting de jure--that is, legal \nstandards. The markets should be in a de facto way establishing those \nstandards. Nonetheless, the legislation directs the FCC to put \ninteroperability very high on the agenda and has a mechanism for making \nsure we have interoperability in the system. It is a very important \nprocompetitive step and a very significant victory, in my judgment.\n  The bill already had very good rural provisions in there. The \nmanagers' amendment, as well as Senator Dole's and Senator Daschle's \namendment, strengthened the protection for rural communities, and we \nhave thus far been successful at preserving the universal service fund.\n  The distinguished Senator from Alaska--I believe it was the first \namendment placed on the bill--made certain there would not be any \nbudget point of order by placing an amendment on here that provided the \nmoney that CBO says we are going to need to pay for this universal \nservice fund. Even though the bill results in a $3 billion reduction in \nthe cost of the universal fund, CBO, in their own mysterious ways, came \nup with the $7 billion mark, and the Senator from Alaska changed the \nbill to provide the money to get that done.\n  Mr. President, this is a very difficult piece of legislation because \nit is difficult to try to assess what the impact is going to be, what \nwill it do for the households, the voters, the consumers in your \ndistrict and your State. It is undoubtedly a question that more and \nmore Members, I hope, are beginning to ask and attempt to answer. It is \nnot an easy question to answer.\n  The chairman and the ranking member of the committee have attempted \nto draft legislation that would move us very carefully from a monopoly \nsituation to a competitive situation. The question, though, is, Will \ncompetition produce something that makes my consumers happier? Will my \ntaxpaying citizens 1 year, 2, 3, 4, 5 years from now say, as I believe \nthey do in a number of other areas, including the watershed divestiture \nthat occurred starting in 1982, This has been good for me. I have \ngotten a reduction in price, I have gotten an increase in quality \ncoming as a consequence, Senator Kerrey, of a piece of legislation you \nvoted for way back there in 1995.\n  The bill is divided up into three sections. It attempts to describe \nin general terms what it is that we are trying to do. It is important, \nI think, for all of us to try to examine each one of these little words \ninside of 146 pages, now a bit longer as a consequence of amendments \nthat have been attached, because each one of them could potentially be \nthe tripwire that sets off an explosion at home. Each one of them could \nat the same time add unnecessary regulation, for all we know. We are \nattempting to balance the need to move to a competitive environment \nwith the need to preserve some regulation in order to make certain that \nthis transition is smooth.\n  The first section is one that will have an impact immediately. What \nwill happen is you will see companies--I would guess mostly long \ndistance companies, although it could be any number of other \ncompanies--coming into the local area asking permission to \ninterconnect, asking permission from the local telephone company to \ninterconnect and begin to provide local telephone service.\n  The company basically controls that. There is a checklist in there, \nbut the company basically controls the flow of that decision. There is \nno Department of Justice role there. The FCC is involved in that \ndecision. There are enforcement mechanisms in there. That is where the \nuniversal service description is maintained. There are separate \nsubsidiary requirements to protect against cross-subsidization that \nmight make it difficult for competition to occur. There is language in \nthere--I do not know how you describe it--that allows foreign companies \nto come in and buy American telecommunications companies, but only if \ntheir nations reciprocate by changing their laws. It has a snap-back \nprovision. If their countries do not change their laws, they would not \nbe allowed to come in and make investments in local or any other \ntelecommunications carriers.\n  There is language in there--very important language in there--for \ninfrastructure sharing. But in that first section perhaps most \nimportant is a checklist that says here are the sorts of things that \nhave to occur in order to provide that interconnection, in order to \ngive that interconnection opportunity, for, as I said, it is either \ngoing to be a long distance company consumers are likely to see or it \ncould be some company you never have seen before that tries to come in \nand provides local competition.\n  These requirements, in what would become section 251, are different \nthan the interconnection requirements that you find in title II. Title \nI is called transition and competition. Title II is the removal of the \nbarriers to competition. There are two subtitles there. The biggest one \nis a lengthy description of how we are going to try to remove the \nbarriers to entry. There are lots of important detail in that \nparticular section.\n  The new section 255 is the one that we are addressing with the \nDepartment of Justice role. That is where you have a checklist. If your \nlocal phone company wants to get into long distance, they then go to \nthe Federal Communications Commission and present evidence that they \nare allowing local competition.\n  As I said, it is significantly different than the language in 251. I \nfor one have not been able to determine whether 255 preempts 251, \nwhether the checklist in 251 is preempted in short by the language of \n255. I suspect it is an important question that I have not been able to \nanswer to my own satisfaction.\n  Nonetheless, the company then comes and says, ``I met the checklist \nrequired in the language.'' There is a consultative role for the \nDepartment of Justice, and the Federal Communications Commission has a \nprescribed period of time in which it has to make a decision about \nwhether or not to let that company get into interLATA or basically get \ninto long distance service.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Justice has a longstanding role in \nour lives in making sure, with its Antitrust Division, that we have \ncompetitive marketplaces,\n not just in telecommunications but in every other area of economic \nlife. The larger a business gets and the more of the market a business \ncontrols, the more likely it is, the more chances and opportunities \nthere are for that business to say, we are going to disregard what the \nconsumer wants, we do not really care what the consumer wants because, \nfrankly, we control so much now of the market that we do not really \nhave to discover what the consumer is willing to pay. We will tell the \nconsumer what they are going to go pay because we control such a large \nshare of the marketplace. There really is no competitive choice.\n\n  Well, that is the way it is for most local telephone companies. There \nis some local competition but not significant local competition. It is \nalso true for many cable companies. They have been given a monopoly \nfranchise, and [[Page S8138]] there is not much competitive choice. \nThat is why we are suggesting with this language--whether it is the \nThurmond language or the Dorgan language--a stronger role for the \nDepartment of Justice in making certain that we do have a competitive \nenvironment before that permission is granted to get into long-distance \nservice.\n  That is the carrot that is being offered. We say to the local company \nyou can either negotiate to provide interconnection, or you can provide \nthe interconnection requirements that are in 251. Or if you want to \npresent that you have done all of that, we have a separate section that \nsays you come and present that to the FCC, but the Department of \nJustice is engaged in a consultative way. We are saying with this \namendment--and again whether it is the VIII(c) test of Senator Dorgan \nor the Clayton test of Senator Thurmond, it is very important to \ndescribe the roles of both of these regulatory agencies and set a time \ncertain for the approval so you do not get into the problem of \nunnecessary delay and duplication of bureaucratic oversight.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Justice was instrumental in \nshattering the Bell system's monopoly grip on long-distance and \nequipment manufacturing markets in bringing competition to those \nmarkets. Colleagues, again, are wondering why the Department of Justice \nshould be given a role. The reason is that they are the ones with the \nmost experience, the ones that have the capacity to make this thing \nhappen. Competition has resulted as a consequence of the MFJ that was \nfiled in August 1982, and that competition has made possible the \ncommunications revolution that is changing the lives of all Americans.\n  The telecommunications legislation should take advantage of the \nDepartment of Justice's profound expertise in telecommunications \ncompetition to ensure that deregulation leads to real competition, not \nunfettered monopoly. Again, the potential for monopoly is already \nthere. Since we are beginning with a monopoly situation, the potential \nfor a monopoly situation adverse to the consumer would produce a very \nunhappy consumer, taxpayer, and citizen out there. And we are, with our \namendment, suggesting that the best way to ensure that that does not \nhappen is to provide the Department of Justice with what fairly, I \nthink, is described as a limited role in assisting the Federal \nCommunications Commission in making a decision about whether or not to \nallow a local company to get into long-distance, and whether or not the \ncompany has, in short, provided a competitive opportunity at the local \nlevel--because that is the question.\n  The question is whether or not to grant long-distance competitive \nopportunity, and that question is answered by determining whether or \nnot there is competition at the local level. The bill, as I said, has \ntwo sets of tests, one in section 251, that could occur almost \nimmediately, and 255, which is the question at hand, when a company is \ntrying to prove that they have local competition by providing the 14-\npoint checklist, as required by this legislation to the FCC.\n  The Department of Justice has effectively enforced the antitrust laws \nin the telecommunications industry on a completely bipartisan and \nnonpartisan basis throughout this century. It sued the Bell system in \n1913 and in 1949. Both times the Department of Justice succeeded in \nobtaining consent decrees and sought to protect competition. But that \nallowed AT to continue participating in local, long-distance, and \nequipment manufacturing markets.\n  In the mid-1960's, Mr. President, it filed comments with the FCC \narguing that the Bell system should not be allowed to use its local \ntelephone monopoly to force consumers to buy their telephone sets from \nit. Although the FCC agreed that customers had the right to choose \namong competitors, the Bell system succeeded in using its local \nmonopoly bottleneck to impose such burdensome conditions on the \ninterconnection of competitors' equipment to the local network that \nevidence of those conditions was an important part of the \nmonopolization case that the Justice Department then presented in 1981. \nOpen competition in so-called customer premises equipment did not \nbecome a reality until after the breakup of the Bell system in 1984.\n  The Department of Justice, Mr. President, initiated its third major \ninvestigation of the Bell system in 1969 during the Nixon \nadministration. In 1974, during the Ford administration, the Department \nfiled its historic suit against AT charging that the vertically \nintegrated Bell system illegally used its monopoly control over local \ntelephone service to thwart competition in long-distance and equipment \nmanufacturing. Over the course of the next 7 years, through the end of \nthe Ford administration and into the Carter administration, the \nDepartment litigated the case vigorously, filing and organizing the \ncomplex evidence that showed how the Bell system used the local \nmonopoly to hurt competition in other markets. In January 1981, at the \nbeginning of the Reagan administration, trial of the case began.\n  The Department of Justice offered in court almost 100 witnesses and \nthousands of documents as it systematically laid out the facts that \ndemonstrated how the Bell system unlawfully used the local monopoly \nbottleneck to hurt competition in other markets.\n  In negotiations to settle the case, President Reagan's Assistant \nAttorney General, E. William Baxter, insisted that the only way to \nprotect competition in the long-distance and equipment markets was to \nseparate those markets structurally from the local telephone \nbottleneck. Unless the local monopolist was prevented from \nparticipating in other markets, it would always have the incentive and \nability to hurt competition in those markets. At first, the Bell system \nrefused even to consider such a settlement. After hearing the \nGovernment's case, and presenting about 90 percent of its own case, 250 \nwitnesses, and tens of thousands of pages of documents, the Bell system \nrelented and agreed to settle the case based on a consent decree that \ndismantled the vertical monopoly. After it was approved by Judge Harold \nGreene, the modification of final judgment--which is referred to often \nas the MFJ--required the Bell systems to split itself into AT and the \nseven regional Bell operating companies now called the Bell companies. \nAT retained the long-distance and manufacturing operations. The Bell \ncompanies, independent of each other and of AT, retained monopolies \nover local telephone service in vast geographic expanses, subject to \nthe requirement that AT, along with competitors, have equal \nnondiscriminatory access to customers through the local networks.\n  The key point of the MFJ was that it removed the Bell companies' \nincentive to use the local monopoly to hurt competition in long-\ndistance and equipment manufacturing by prohibiting them from entering \nthese markets. By the same token, AT no longer had the ability to \nhurt its competitors in those markets because it no longer controlled \nthe local monopoly. The restrictions on the Bell company grew directly \nout of the fact noted by Judge Greene that ``the key to the Bell \nsystem's power to impede competition has been its control of local \ntelephone markets.''\n  Section VIII(c) of the MFJ--modified final judgment--the language \nthat is in the Dorgan amendment provides that the line of business \nrestrictions can be waived if a regional Bell operating company shows \nthat there is no substantial possibility that it could use its monopoly \npower to impede competition in the market it seeks to enter.\n  Removing the restrictions under any other circumstances would give \nthe local telephone company the incentive and ability to recreate the \nvertical monopoly that the Department of Justice and many others worked \nso long and hard to dismantle.\n  Since the entry of the MFJ in 1982, the Department has assisted Judge \nGreene in administering its terms--in Republican and Democratic \nadministrations alike. It has been dedicated to ensuring that the line \nof business restrictions hinder the RBOC's only to the extent necessary \nfor protecting competition in other markets.\n  The Department has supported waiver of the restrictions when it has \nconcluded that Bell companies' entry into other markets presented no \nsubstantial possibility of impeding competition in those markets. The \nDepartment now has over 50 professionals--lawyers, economists, and \nparalegals--who are [[Page S8139]] dedicated and experienced in \ntelecommunications competition issues, and who understand the complex \nmarkets and technologies involved.\n  The Department, therefore, is uniquely positioned to assess what is \nactually happening in the market and whether there is a danger that \nentry by the Bell companies could impede competition. That is exactly \nthe task that has been performed since the entry of the MFJ over a \ndecade ago.\n  Mr. President, the competition long-distance and equipment \nmanufacturing unleashed by the MFJ has benefited the United States of \nAmerica and its citizens and consumers enormously. MCI, Sprint, and \nhundreds of smaller carriers buy from AT to provide long-distance \nservice.\n  Prices have dropped and quality has improved, with the result that \nAmericans are talking to each other via long-distance more than ever \nbefore. Americans have not been shy about exercising the right to \nchoose that the MFJ guaranteed.\n  The New York Times reported that 25 million people changed their \nlong-distance carrier in 1994. In an article, ``No Holds Barred for \nLong Distance Call,'' Edmond Andrews, the New York Times, January 21, \n1995, describes the competition that exists in long-distance, and \ndescribes who was benefiting from that competition.\n  Similarly, businesses and consumers enjoy lower prices, more choice, \nbetter quality, and communications equipment, as competition has eroded \nAT's power in that market and forced it to compete for customers.\n  Mr. President, that is at the heart of what this legislation is \nattempting to do: Force existing monopolies to compete for customers. \nIf that competition occurs, the competition for your business--you as a \ncustomer--will force the company to pay more attention to quality, \ngiving not just the quality that you want but give you competitive \nprice, knowing that if either the quality or the price are not what you \nlike, you will see a competitive alternative.\n  These benefits stem directly from the strict separation of the local \nmonopoly from other markets. Although it now appears possible that the \nlocal markets can be opened up to competition, they are not natural \nmonopolies any longer. Removing the separation between the local \nmarkets and other markets without ensuring that the Bell companies \ncannot use the local monopoly to hurt competition and long-distance \ncould squander the gains of the past decade.\n  The expense of the Bell system in the years before the MFJ, when it \nfrustrated consumer choice and actual competition, long after \ncompetition and long-distance service and communications equipment \nbecame technologically and economically feasible, counsels against \nallowing the Bell companies into other markets before determining, \nbased on actual marketplace facts, the effect it will have on the \nmarket.\n  Again, there are two places in this legislation that I call to my \ncolleagues' attention who are trying to figure out what to do with this \nlegislation, whether to support this amendment. There are two sections \nin this legislation that talk about interconnection. The first will be \nthe new section 255 of the 1934 Communications Act, and the second, the \none we are talking about now, the interconnection requirements prior to \ngetting into long-distance that are described in the new section 255.\n  The fundamental goal for all should be to allow the Bell companies \ninto any market they choose to enter as soon as such entry does not \nthreaten to impede competition in the other markets.\n  That is the success that we have had to date, Mr. President. By \nensuring that there is competition, the consumer has benefited, and it \nhas been the Justice Department that has managed that effort.\n  The simple fact, however, is that telecommunications networks are so \ncomplex that the RBOC's ability to frustrate viable competition exceeds \nthe ability of legislators and regulators to specify the steps \nnecessary for opening local markets.\n  As was the integrated Bell system before the MFJ, the Bell companies \ntoday are in a position to ensure that every step forward is \naccomplished by a step backward, preserving their local monopoly as \nthey race into long-distance with the advantage of the monopoly still \nintact.\n  The way to overcome this ability of the RBOC to thwart the open local \nmarkets is to give them a positive incentive to cooperate in the \ndevelopment of competition. The RBOC's will have such incentives when \nthe specified steps for opening the local markets are supplemented by a \nprocess that ensures analysis of actual marketplace facts before the \nRBOC's are allowed to enter long-distance. That is what both the Dorgan \namendment and the Thurmond amendment attempt to do.\n  As I said, Mr. President, we have been through this bill a number of \ntimes, and there are places in this bill where I believe the Bell \ncompanies make a good case. We may have regulatory requirements that \nare unnecessary that may, in fact, impede the development of \ncompetition.\n  I am prepared to entertain discussion of regulation that is still \nrequired in this bill that may, in fact, impede competition, that may \nprovide an unnecessary burden for the regional Bell operating companies \nunnecessarily, at least that they cannot be defended in what they \nprovide for the American consumers.\n  Both the chairman and the ranking member of the committee, as they \nhave said on many occasions on this floor, are attempting to create a \nstructure where we can, first of all, begin the process of competition, \ninitiate competition at the local level, then move to end many of the \nbarriers that currently exist to entry into these markets and finally, \nin section 3, come to an era of substantial deregulation where price \nwill be determined by competition, not by regulatory fiat.\n  The Department of Justice role in promoting competition has been \nhistorically not only bipartisan but also nonpartisan. As I indicated \nearlier, the antitrust investigation against the Bell system was \ninitiated in the Nixon administration.\n  The antitrust case against the Bell system was filed in 1974 in the \nFord administration. Litigation continued through the Carter \nadministration, into the Reagan administration. The case was settled by \nrequiring divestiture during the Reagan administration. The Department \nof Justice assisted Judge Greene administering the consent decree \nthroughout the Bush and the Clinton administrations.\n  The decisionmaking process of the Department of Justice has not been \na partisan issue. It was approved last year by the House, with over 420 \nvotes. It was approved last year by the Senate Commerce Committee by an \n18-to-2 vote and supported by President Reagan's Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for antitrust, Prof. William Bater, Judge Robert Bork, a letter \nfrom a bipartisan group, and a former member of the House of \nRepresentatives, Vin Weber, in a piece he wrote in the Washington \nTimes.\n  The role for the Department of Justice is not being suggested as a \nconsequence of concern for one sector of the economy or the other. It \nis the suggestion--recommended change in this law--based both upon what \npoliticians themselves have concluded in the past was necessary, as \nwell, mostly based upon evidence at hand of the Justice Department's \ncapacity to manage what will be an unprecedented transition from a \nregulated monopoly situation to a competitive environment.\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, quite appropriate to be calling upon \nthe Justice Department to once again do more than be a consultant in \nthis matter, much more than just in the end, during the 90-day period \nduring which the FCC will make its determination.\n  It is better to have a parallel process going on with the Justice \nDepartment, where they will be making determinations as to whether or \nnot competition exists; again, whether it is the VIII(c) test of no \nsubstantial standard possible, or the Clayton test, which I will get to \nlater.\n  The Justice Department is the agency that understands the markets, \nthat knows whether or not there is competition, and it is the agency \nthat I believe we need to turn to if we are concerned about what kind \nof response it is going to be from our consumers, our taxpayers, and \nvoters.\n  Procedures for the Bell operating company's entry into long-distance \nover the Dorgan or Thurmond amendment does not represent unnecessary \nduplication. The idea that we will get a [[Page S8140]] lengthy \nprocess, in fact, is just the opposite of what will occur without this \namendment.\n  What happens is the Bell operating company would file an application \nfor entry into long-distance. The Justice Department and the FCC would \nreview and proceed simultaneously. The Bell operating company would \nhave an answer within 90 days after application, in accordance with a \ndate certain, established by Congress. This procedure is fast. It takes \n90 days.\n  The standard for the Justice Department review will be clear, again, \nwhether it is Clayton or VIII(c). The test has been litigated many, \nmany times in the past. It is not a difficult standard for the Justice \nDepartment to apply in either case, in either the Dorgan or the \nThurmond case. The procedure will reduce litigation, will reduce the \nlikelihood of subsequent antitrust suits.\n  Mr. President, I will get into that later, but one of the things, if \nSenators are concerned about what this will do after a person votes \n``aye,'' what final passage will do, what changing the law will do, one \nquestion to answer is, Is this process going to take a long time? Is it \ngoing to be slow? Can the existing companies in here sort of drag this \nthing out for a long period of time?\n  One of the reasons we need a Department of Justice role is to reduce \nthe possibility of litigation, to reduce the opportunity to drag this \nthing out in the courts, and to increase the date when real competition \nwill begin to produce benefits for the consumer.\n  Mr. President, the VIII(c) test is pretty well established. I want to \ntalk now about what the language of the Thurmond amendment does. I \nbelieve that it is likely to be that test which we will be \ndeliberating, that Members will have to decide whether or not they \napprove or want the Clayton standard.\n  First of all, the Clayton Act was passed in 1914 and it was passed to \nprevent mergers that may substantially lessen competition or create a \nmonopoly. That standard has been applied to every industry, not just to \ntelecommunications. It is applied to mergers with critical national \nimportance such as defense industry mergers like Martin Marietta and \nLockheed, applied to mergers in other high-technology industries, \nsoftware industries, the recent case of Microsoft and Intuit, applied \nto mergers, long distance mergers in the telecommunications industry \nlike AT and British Telecom-MCI mergers.\n  The standard is a known quantity. It is a known quantity and it has \nbeen developed through 80 years of litigation under that standard.\n  If the Bell operating companies want to enter into long distance by \nbuying a long distance company, this is the standard that would be \napplied. It is logical to apply the same standard if they want to enter \nlong distance in other ways under the unique circumstances of this bill \nsuperseding an antitrust consent decree with the intention of creating \ncompetition.\n  The Thurmond amendment, the Clayton language, makes entry dependent \non passing the Clayton Act test. This test is normally applied to \nmergers that would be applied to the RBOC's, even in the absence of \nthis amendment, if they propose to acquire a long distance company. The \nClayton Act test would apply to RBOC entry unless the effect of such \nentry may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create \nmonopoly.\n  This is exactly what we want. We want an agency that is experienced \nwith measuring that question engaged in the process of saying to the \nAmerican people, if you pass that test, there is no substantial \npossibility to lessen competition or create a monopoly. We see a \ncompetitive marketplace there, and we give permission and a date \ncertain, a time certain. That should remove any doubt about whether or \nnot this thing is going to be dragged on for a long period of time.\n  Under such a standard, the Department of Justice would consider \nwhether allowing an RBOC, that is a local telephone company, to provide \nlong distance service would give it the ability and incentive to use \nits monopoly power in local exchange services substantially to lessen \ncompetition in the long distance market and raise prices for consumers.\n  At the end of the game, that is what we are talking about. If you \nhave a monopoly, you have the possibility of raising prices regardless \nof what the consumers want. You can ignore the consumer if you control \na large enough portion of the market share. What we want to make sure \nis you have competition. With that competition, whether it is coming \nfrom below or coming from above, regardless of where it is coming from, \ngive that consumer choice in the household and the consumer will \nbenefit as a consequence of lower prices and higher quality.\n  The RBOC's could meet such a test and be allowed to enter the long \ndistance market in any one of three ways.\n  First, if competition has developed in local exchange services so \nthere is no longer a local monopoly that could be used substantially to \nlessen competition in long distance, or second, if, even absent local \ncompetition, safeguards or other constraints would prevent the RBOC's \nfrom using their local monopoly to substantially lessen competition in \nlong distance. A very important point, Mr. President. It may be that \nlocal competition does not develop immediately. We should not say to a \nRBOC, you cannot get into long distance under that circumstance. The \nDepartment of Justice has experience in making sure that the negative \nimpacts of lack of competition do not occur at the local level, thus \nactually saying to a Bell operating company, here is a way for you to \nget into long distance interLATA businesses even faster than what might \notherwise be possible.\n  Third, if some one combination of alternatives to the telephone \ncompany local exchange services, safeguards, and other factors should \nprevent the telephone company from substantially lessening competition \nin long distance service. More competition would require fewer \nsafeguards, and obviously the opposite is the case as well. Fewer \nsafeguards will be likely. As we get competition in these local \nmarkets, we are going to need less and less and less.\n  In several acts in the telecommunications industry, the Department of \nJustice has carefully considered the competitive risk of allowing firms \nthat dominate a market to enter into a closely related market through \nmergers and joint ventures. Based on the facts of those particular \ncases, the Department of Justice concluded that under certain market \nconditions it is not necessary to prohibit entry by a provider of local \nexchange services into long distance services. But the Department of \nJustice has required structural separation and other safeguards in the \nanticompetitive areas to protect the public interest in competition, \nfor example the GTE's 1983 acquisition of Sprint; again the AT \nmerger and the British Telecom-MCI joint venture.\n  Mr. President, I would like to now try to give Members--I see the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont is here.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the amendment, but \nI do not want to interrupt the distinguished Senator from Nebraska. I \nenjoyed listening to him, but if he did want to take a break, I would \nbe happy to express some views on this.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, let me shorten this by a couple of \nsections here and then regain the floor at a later time since this \ndebate probably will be going on for some time before we actually vote.\n  One of the questions, again, I know I have asked myself that I think \nit is important to answer is whether or not giving the Department of \nJustice a decisionmaking role in this is going to cost the taxpayers \nmore money. Many have argued against this and implied it is going to \nincrease taxpayer requirements, it is going to result in more and more \nlitigation. The ominous thought of more litigation and more taxpayer \ncost sort of hangs over the argument.\n  But a Department of Justice role would avoid complex and expensive \nantitrust suits in the future by making sure that competition is \nsafeguarded in the first instance. These suits would consume resources \nbetter spent on competing to offer American businesses and consumers \nlower prices and higher quality. I can, and will at a later time, go \nthrough many examples where that in fact is the case.\n  If you go back and look at the situation prior to the filing of the \nMFJ by the Department of Justice, that is exactly what was happening. \nIt has also [[Page S8141]] happened since that time during the years \nthat these suits would be litigated. The American economy would suffer \nfrom the effects of lessened competition and higher prices. Before the \nMFJ broke up the Bell system, there were dozens of private antitrust \nsuits against the system ongoing in courts across the country at any \ngiven time. AT's 1977 annual report said that some 40-such private \nsuits were then pending against it. Asking for more of those suits \nwould be a giant step backward.\n  Mr. President, I say with respect that without either the Thurmond or \nDorgan language here, that is precisely what we are doing. We are \ninviting suits in the absence of the Department of Justice moving at \nthe same pace, the same 90-day period. It is not an additional 90 days, \nnot an additional 180 days. During the same 90-day period during which \nthe FCC is examining the merits of the application, determining whether \nor not the intersection requirements of section 25(a) have been \nsatisfied, during that same 90-day period the Department of Justice \nwould be doing an analysis of whether or not competition exists at the \nlocal level or whether or not the negative impacts of monopoly were not \nlikely to risk higher prices for the consumer at the local level.\n  At the end of the 90-day period, just as would occur at the Federal \nCommunications Commission, the Department of Justice would have to make \nits ruling. You have a simultaneous process.\n  I say to my colleagues, if you are trying to reduce bureaucracy, if \nyou are trying to reduce the potential for lawsuit, then either the \nDorgan or the Thurmond amendment is something you must be for.\n  The opponents of the Thurmond and Dorgan amendments argue that all we \nneed to do is allow the Department of Justice to bring lawsuits after \ncompetition has been harmed. They never explain how an after-the-fact \nantitrust case will solve the problem. It took 10 years of litigation \nto resolve the Government's case against AT Years of litigation is \nnot a solution.\n  That is a problem we should avoid. Again, either the Dorgan or the \nThurmond language--either the no substantial possibility language of \nVIII(c) or the well-litigated 80-year test of Clayton--would suffice, \nin my judgment, to make certain we avoid the kind of litigation that I \nbelieve both the chairman and ranking member and other advocates of not \nhaving the Department of Justice in here are trying to avoid.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I favor the Dorgan amendment, and I wish to \ncommend Senator Dorgan and Senator Thurmond for what they have done. I \nbelieve, and I have stated before, here and in the Judiciary Committee, \nthat we have to allow the Department of Justice, our most expert \ncompetition agency, to play a more significant role, not just \nconsulting, in deciding whether a Bell company entry into long distance \nor manufacturing threatens competition in those markets.\n  Go back to the 1982 consent decree that broke up Ma Bell and \nseparated the Bell companies from AT That took 10 years to litigate \nand conclude. The decree, the modified final judgment, took all these \nyears of antitrust litigation, required a restructuring of the market, \nand led to significant consumer confusion.\n  Rather than relegate the Justice Department to a consulting role, if \nwe design a proper role for that expert agency up front, we can avoid \nthis kind of costly and time-consuming litigation from happening again. \nLet us handle it right from the start and not come in after the fact \nwhen the cure can sometimes create a new set of problems.\n  What this bill does, unless amended, is say, ``We hope the checklist \nof unbundling and interconnection requirements works to unlock the \nlocal loop to competition.'' We all hope that. But what if it does not \nwork? What if the checklist is not long enough to ensure that the local \nmonopoly power of the Bell companies is broken and competition can \ndevelop?\n  If the checklist does not work, under the bill the Justice Department \nhas to clean up the mess. They have to clean it up after the fact, \ninstead of having any say before the fact--after the Bell company has \nalready gotten into long distance and used its monopoly power to stifle \npotential competitors who need the Bell companies' pipeline to our \nhomes and businesses.\n  The cleanup after the fact could take years of litigation, just as \nthe prior case that ended with the MFJ took years. The cleanup may \nrequire a restructuring of companies, just as the prior case against Ma \nBell resulted in spinning off AT from the Bell companies. Then, of \ncourse, the cleanup could well confuse consumers. I well recall the \npress and the outrage in the public when they questioned the wisdom of \nwhat Judge Greene did in 1982 and whether the breakup would hurt the \npublic and our telephone service.\n  We have the opportunity to avoid the mess.\n  As former appellate judge, Robert Bork, recently pointed out, without \na Justice Department role in applying a ``standard with teeth,'' \nallowing the Bell companies into long-distance service and equipment \nmanufacturing, taking the course envisioned by this bill ``would result \nin even more litigation and regulatory disputes than there were prior \nto the decree.''\n  We are sometimes accused of passing a lawyers relief act in some of \nthese pieces of legislation which we consider. This bill, if passed \nwithout the amendment, would certainly be a bonanza for lawyers and \neconomists as regulatory disputes proliferated before State and Federal \nagencies and lawsuits were filed charging discrimination, theft of \nintellectual property and predation in violation of section 2 of the \nSherman Act. I think Judge Bork is right on this.\n  We should minimize this litigation quagmire by having the Justice \nDepartment, with its 25 years of expertise, look at the competitive \nimpact of Bell company entry into the long-distance and manufacturing \nmarkets.\n  The MFJ left the Bell companies with local exchange monopolies, which \npersist today. To protect consumers, those Bell company monopolies are \nregulated. Line-of-business restrictions were imposed on the Bell \ncompanies. This was to make sure they did not use their controlling \nmonopoly over the local phone service and the pipeline to the home to \nharm consumers or to gain unfair advantage over the competitors in the \nlong-distance, manufacturing, and information services markets. Any of \nthose regulations could be removed upon a showing by the Bell company \nthat there is no substantial possibility that it could use its monopoly \npower to impede competition in the particular market it is seeking to \nenter. This is the so-called VIII(c) test.\n  The test has been tried, and it actually works. The Bell companies, \nof course, have their own reasons to believe VIII(c) is overregulatory. \nBut they have been able to satisfy the test in the past and get into \ninformation and other services, and do so without harming consumers.\n  The MFJ's VIII(c) test is not even as strong as another test to which \none Bell company agreed in March of this year. Ameritech reached a \nlandmark agreement with the Justice Department, and they agreed to an \nactual competition test. We ought to look at that. Ameritech thought \nthis was an appropriate test for a temporary trial waiver of the long-\ndistance restriction. We are not talking about anything temporary here \nin this bill, but legislation with a far greater degree of permanence.\n  In discussions in which I have been involved, our colleagues are \nworking out the differences so the Thurmond-Dorgan amendment can \nprotect competition. I think that is important because the amendment \nprovides a certainty that the Bell companies claim they want.\n  Having the Justice Department apply the Clayton Act test that is \ngoing to be outlined in the amendment, I believe, would complement the \ncompetitive checklist in the bill. The Justice Department would make \nsure that, in addition to the checklist being met and the Bell \ncompanies having taken the basic steps necessary to permit local \ncompetition to develop, in fact, those steps are working.\n  The bottom line is that with the existing monopoly hold that the \nBells still have on local exchanges, the Department of Justice should \nreview the competitive impact of Bell company entry into long distance. \nOtherwise, the choices that consumers have in [[Page S8142]] services \nprovided over their phoneline may go down, but the prices they pay for \nthose services may go up. We should make sure that this legislation \ndoes not produce that kind of result.\n  Let us have a competitive environment in telecommunications and take \nsteps to deregulate.\n  Mr. President, we have had remarkable changes in telecommunications \njust in the years that I have been here in the Senate. I have seen \nchanges from competition which has brought down prices of long \ndistance.\n  We have witnessed competition that we did not use to see, which now \nallows anyone who wants to go and buy equipment off the shelf--\nequipment for everything from teleconferencing to video conferencing, \nthat we were told by the telephone companies, when they had a complete \nmonopoly, was not available--to do so. It was available in every other \ncountry. It just was not available in the United States. Once we \nstarted to get some real competition, all of a sudden it started \nshowing up here.\n  We do conference calls from home. We have automatic dialing in our \nequipment. We have speaker phones. We own our equipment. We do not have \nto go to one telephone company to buy it or rent it month by month \nanymore. It was competition that did that.\n  Rather than encouraging monopolies, we should ensure the competition \nthat will help all of us.\n  I use the Internet all the time. I will be speaking about an aspect \nof that a little later on. But I use the Internet all the time. I do \ntown meetings on the Internet. I have a home page. My State uses it. I \nhave one petition that involves legislation of mine which got 10,000 or \n20,000 names and electronic letters from all over the country in a \nmatter of days.\n  These are the things that we did not have just a few years ago. They \nare extremely important to all of us. I know the distinguished \nPresiding Officer uses the Internet. We have various services now that \nprovide access to it. We should be encouraging that kind of thing.\n  Can you imagine, Mr. President, had the Internet, for example, been \ncontrolled by just one source, one company, one gatekeeper? Does \nanybody believe it would have advanced as far as it has, even with its \nproblems? Some parts of it have worked very well, and some parts do not \nwork very well. It would not have happened, had we not had openness and \ncompetition.\n  By the same token, do you think any one of us who have in-the-home \ntelephones and can program numbers into it and have automatic dialing \nor speaker phones or call forwarding built into our phones would have \nthem without competition? That is what this is all about.\n  I commend the Senator from North Dakota and the senior Senator from \nSouth Carolina and all others who have worked on this important \namendment. I am glad I have had a chance to work with them. I think we \nare going to have a decent solution and a good compromise in the \namendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I do not know who else may be seeking the \nfloor, so I am going to yield the floor in just a moment.\n  I see the Senator from Nebraska on his feet. I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, again, the question for colleagues is \nwhether or not the Department of Justice can perform a role that would \nbe useful, that would enable us, 50 years from now, to say we have, as \nagain the chairman and ranking member have attempted to do in this \nlegislation, created a structure under which we will go from a monopoly \nsituation at the local level to a competitive environment for all \ntelecommunications services.\n  One of the statements that is very often made is that, well, there \nhave been lengthy delays. You will hear people say there are a lot of \ndelays over at the Department of Justice. A triennial review that was \nrequired has not been done, or, well, the SEC can do it just as well; \nthey will just hire some more people over here in this area and they \nshould be able to handle it very well.\n  Mr. President, what I would like to do is cite a couple of instances \nto give you an example, and they illustrate the kinds of things that \nare going to occur, the kinds of questions that are going to be raised \nwhen businesses try to do things that the current law prevents them \nfrom doing. Basically, that is what we are talking about here. \nTelecommunications corporations that are prevented from doing something \nwill be allowed to do it with this legislation.\n  It is not just the common carriers, by the way. We are allowing cable \ncompanies to price differently. We are deregulating them substantially. \nWe are changing the laws for broadcast ownership. There are lots of \nchanges in this bill besides just having to do with common carriers, \nbut it is the common carriers we are dealing with in this particular \namendment.\n  The case of GTE is very instructive, Mr. President. In this case, \nwhat you had was a company, GTE, with a local exchange monopoly in \nmarkets that were scattered around the country, and Sprint, a long \ndistance company, recently established. What the Department of Justice \ndid was to write up and get both parties to agree to a consent decree \nthat was filed in court that prevents further litigation requiring \nseparate subsidiaries and equal access for other long distance \ncompanies to make sure that GTE customers would have the benefits of \nlong distance competition. The Department of Justice ensured that there \nwas competition. They promoted and allowed the businesses to merge, in \nthis case GTE and Sprint.\n  One of the things this bill does is it sets aside that consent \ndecree. I believe it was in one of Senator Dole's amendments earlier. \nSo now this original consent decree that was filed on behalf of a \nmerger and on behalf of consumers to make sure that you still have \ncompetition at the local and at the long distance level.\n  An even more difficult one was the merger of AT and McCaw that my \ncolleagues might recall happened, I guess, about a year ago now in \n1994. AT, obviously, by far the largest of the long distance \ncarriers, was attempting to acquire initially, I think, 50 percent, \neventually 100 percent of the larger cellular provider, providing not \njust long distance but local telephone service as well. There was \nvertical integration involving two companies with substantial market \npower. AT was dominant in both long distance and manufacturing of \ncellular equipment used by McCaw's competitors. The question was \nwhether or not by acquiring McCaw, AT was going to restrict \ncompetition from competitors who were buying equipment that AT was \nmanufacturing. McCaw, on the other hand, has only one competitor in \neach of the markets it has been given by the Federal Communications \nCommission.\n  So what happened? The Department of Justice intervenes. They work \nwith both companies. They negotiate between both companies. They \ndeclare what it is they are going to be filing, and they file a consent \ndecree which required separation and nondiscrimination safeguards so \nthat McCaw customers will have equal access to long distance carriers \nand cannot be required to buy long distance from AT, and cellular \nrivals to McCaw that want to use cellular equipment will continue to \nhave access to necessary product and will be free from interference of \nAT should they wish to change suppliers. AT and McCaw will not \nmisuse confidential information obtained from AT equipment customers \nor McCaw equipment suppliers.\n  Those are the kinds of questions, Mr. President, that will occur on \nan increasingly frequent basis. Who knows? There may be hundreds of \nthese applications that are going to fall into the lap of the Federal \nCommunications Commission solely unless, again, either the VIII(c) test \nof the Senator from North Dakota or the Clayton test of the Senator \nfrom South Carolina is adopted and the Department of Justice is given a \nparallel, simultaneous role; not a new role, a historic role; not an \nunprecedented role but a role consistent with the unprecedented nature \nof this legislation itself.\n  The third example that I would cite was a very complicated one \ninvolving a foreign company, British Telecom, that had proposed to \nacquire a 20-percent stake in MCI.\n  Here again the question was that you were dealing with a company with \nsubstantial vertical integration, with substantial market power, and \nonce again the Department of Justice comes in and says, well, here is \nwhat we are [[Page S8143]] going to do. We are going to put a consent \ndecree together establishing separation together with nondiscrimination \nsafeguards so that public disclosure of rates, public disclosure of \nterms and conditions under which MCI and the joint venture gain access \nto BT's network is required.\n  Second, British Telecom is barred from providing the joint venture \nwith proprietary information about their American competitor.\n  Again, Mr. President, I do not expect my colleagues, I do expect \nmyself, to understand exactly what all this means but what it \nestablishes is that the Department of Justice has experience in making \ncertain there is a competitive environment so that neither the \nproviders nor the consumers who are out there trying either to sell or \nto buy are affected in an adverse way as a consequence of mergers, as a \nconsequence of new lines of business that are developed as we lower the \nbarriers to entry, as we decrease the regulatory burden and increase \nthe extent to which competition is going to be used to determine our \nprices and quality of our goods.\n  Now, as to the question of whether or not the Department of Justice \nhas failed to fulfill its obligation to review the need for continuing \nthe MFJ's line of business restriction--that is a statement that is \nmade relatively frequently--well, I think this criticism is not \nterribly valid. There was a triennial review that was done in 1987, 3 \nyears after the breakup of the Bell system, but the suggestion that \nbecause there has been only one triennial review, there has not been a \nconstant review, I think that suggestion does not stand up in the face \nof the evidence of what Judge Greene has been instructing the \nDepartment of Justice to do, it does not stand up in the face of the \nenormous volume of waiver applications that has been coming up and what \nhas been effectively a de facto situation of constant reviewing of the \nline of business restrictions, and it does not stand up in the face of \nthe current review leading to recommendations on line of business \nrestrictions.\n  Experience demonstrated that triennial reviews by the Department of \nJustice were not necessary to achieve the intended goal of ensuring \nreview of the need for the MFJ's line of business restrictions. Judge \nGreene himself explained why DOJ should have complete discretion as to \nwhether or when to file additional triennial reviews. In his language:\n\n       The Court and the Department envisioned a comprehensive \n     review every 3 years interspersed with occasional waiver \n     requests. What has occurred, however, is the process of \n     almost continuous review generated by an incessant stream of \n     regional company motions and requests dealing with all \n     aspects of the line of business restrictions.\n  Let me read that again for emphasis, Mr. President, because those who \nvery often criticize the Department of Justice for not doing a \nsufficient amount of review are the very companies that have created a \nconstant review as a result of their application for waiver and the \nmotions that they are filing in Judge Greene's court.\n  The original intent was for triennial review, Mr. President, because \nthe court and the Department envisioned a comprehensive review every 3 \nyears, kind of quiet period of time, interspersed with an occasional \nwaiver request.\n  So when the consent decree was filed originally breaking up AT, the \nidea was, ``Well, we will get a few waiver requests here and an \noccasional motion, but it will not be very often. Because there are not \nvery many waivers or motions, we will do a triennial review.''\n  The situation was just the opposite: Constant motions, constant \nwaiver applications and, thus, no need for a triennial review and, \nthus, it does not stand up to criticize the Department of Justice and \nsay, ``See, don't give them a role in this matter because they didn't \ndo what they were originally supposed to do.''\n  They did not do what they were originally supposed to do because \ncircumstances developed precisely the opposite of what both Judge \nGreene and the Department expected to have happen in 1981 and 1982 when \nthis decree was being negotiated between AT and the U.S. people \nthrough the U.S. Department of Justice.\n  Judge Greene further explained why he did not require further \ntriennial reviews. He said, with the stream of waiver requests, he \n``repeatedly considered broad issues regarding information services, \nmanufacturing and even long distance.''\n  Mr. President, basically he is saying that though this thing did not \ndevelop as was expected--long periods of quiet time interrupted by \ntriennial reviews--the waivers and the motions have enabled us to \nconstantly review the line of business restrictions and determine \nwhether modifications need to be made.\n  The judge also explained that ``as soon as there is a change, real or \nimaginary in the industry or other markets, motions are filed and all \naspects of the issue are reviewed in dozens of briefs.''\n  These observations are still valid. In the life of the MFJ, Bell \ncompanies have filed an average of one waiver every 2 weeks. In fact, \nwhat amounts to a triennial review is underway right now as the Justice \nDepartment investigates a motion to vacate the entire decree pursued by \nthree Bell operating companies. This investigation will culminate with \na report to Judge Greene in the next few months, and that report will \nbe a comprehensive review of the need for continuing the line of \nbusiness restrictions. It is likely the recommendations that are going \nto be made at that time will support most, if not all, of the changes \nthat are being recommended in this legislation.\n  Let me talk about this purported delay. You hear, ``Well, the \nDepartment of Justice takes a long time; this waiver process takes a \nlong time.'' Typically what is done is a statistical analysis is used \nof the average age of pending MFJ waivers; that is to say, the request \nfor waiver of the consent decree. There was a consent decree filed in \nthe court. Judge Greene is administering that consent degree on behalf \nof American consumers who benefited enormously as a result of that \nDepartment of Justice action and what Judge Greene has done.\n  The statistical analysis, in my judgment, is a red herring. This \nargument that is used against DOJ decisionmaking is that you will see \nan unnecessary delay as a consequence of this statistical analysis, to \nback up the assertion this analysis purports to show that a Department \nof Justice role will cause a long period of time for decisions to be \nmade.\n  Again, two things argue against that. One is what I will get to here \nin a minute. The other is in the language of the amendment, either as \nmodified by the Senator from South Carolina or as originally contained \nin Senator Dorgan's amendment. It is a review process that takes place \nsimultaneous in the Department of Justice and in the Federal \nCommunications Commission. Both have a date certain of 90 days. Only \nwith the Department of Justice role, in my judgment, are you going to \nlimit it to 90 days. Without that Department of Justice role, I stand \nhere and predict you are going to have substantial litigation and the \nvery delay we all seek to avoid.\n  Congress can and should require the Department of Justice to make \nthis determination by a date certain. It is as simple as that. That is \nwhat the amendment does. That is what either one of these amendments, \nin fact, would accomplish.\n  The amendments guarantee the Bell companies will get an answer on \nlong distance entry by a date certain. The legislation will replace the \nwaiver procedure with specific deadlines. You eliminate the waiver \nprocedures included in the 214 waiver procedures that are in current \nlaw under the 1934 Communications Act. The Department of Justice review \ncannot possibly slow Bell company entry into long distance unless such \nentry would be harmful to competition and, thus, undesirable for \nAmerican consumers and businesses.\n  Under that situation, you want the Department of Justice to slow it \ndown if, in their reasoned judgment, based upon the experience that \nthey have had, it is going to restrict competition. They are the ones \nwith the experience. You do not want this process to end if the \nDepartment of Justice, before granting permission, interprets the \nproposal to mean less choice, less competition, because in a monopoly \nsituation, with all the other things that we are doing with this \nlegislation, you are unquestionably going to get increased prices and \nmarginal, if any, improvement in quality. [[Page S8144]] \n  Entry will be permitted to occur as quickly as possible, consistent \nwith the appropriate entry tests that have been established by Congress \nin this legislation.\n  But there is a follow-on question, which is, does the MFJ waiver \nprocess show that the Department of Justice has been a barrier to \ngreater competition by unnecessarily delaying waiver requests that are \neventually approved? No, the users of that argument imply the \nDepartment of Justice review of waiver request has been worthless \nbecause the Department of Justice has supported and the district court \nhas approved some 95 percent of those requests.\n  Mr. President, that examination, that figure of 95 percent does not \ntell all the story. A typical pattern is for one or more of the Bell \ncompanies to file an overbroad waiver request seeking relief that could \nnot possibly be consistent with section VIII(c) of the MFJ. These \nunreasonable requests evoke extensive public concern and comment. The \nDepartment of Justice then has two choices: Recommend denial when the \nrequest is made, which would be relatively quick, or work with the Bell \ncompany or companies to fix the request so that it satisfies the \nrequirements for approval.\n  Fixing the request is harder and takes much longer than just saying \nno. But the Department of Justice has committed itself to this harder \ncourse because it believes that the cause of competition is better \nserved by taking the time to negotiate a reasonable request than by \nmerely opposing an unreasonable request itself.\n  Of the waivers approved by the courts in 1993-1994 that were not mere \ncopies of other waivers, fully 60 percent were the product of \nnegotiations between the Department of Justice and the Bell companies \nthat resulted in a modification of the original waiver request. That is \nthe bottom line analysis, Mr. President: Fully 60 percent with the \nproduct negotiations between DOJ and the Bell companies that resulted \nin a modification of the original waiver request. Thus, the approval \nrate to which opponents refer is, in large part, a testament to DOJ \nsuccess in preserving competition while working to minimize the burden \nof MFJ's line of business restrictions.\n  Another argument that is very often thrown up in this debate is that \nyou are seeing an increase in the age of pending waiver applications. \nThe timetables for waivers under the present court-administered consent \ndecree is irrelevant. The Thurmond and Dorgan amendments require that \nthe Department of Justice render its determination no later than 90 \ndays after receiving an application for long distance entry.\n  So, to refer to the current delays and say, here is the problem and \nthis is going to be perpetuated by either the Thurmond or the Dorgan \namendment is wrong, Mr. President. These amendments specify 90 days of \nparallel processing during which both the FCC and the Department of \nJustice will consider an application by a local telephone company to \nget into long distance service.\n  Mr. President, there is, by the way, some reasons why these waiver \nrequests are pending with the Department of Justice and why they have \nincreased since the early years of the MFJ. I would like to go through \none or two of them. But, again, I am actually offering some examples of \nwhy the Department of Justice is more competent than they might appear, \nif this is your only method of evaluation.\n  I am not offering these to try to persuade any colleagues that this \nis why you should trust that the process is not going to take very \nlong. The amendment itself says 90 days. There is a date certain in the \namendment. Do not worry about this dragging on forever, the law does \nnot allow it.\n  Well, again, opponents have compared and taken to resolve waiver \nrequests in the early years of the modified final judgment and the time \ntaken more recently and asserted from the Department of Justice fails \nto deal with requests in a timely manner. But this comparison is \nsimplistic and ignores fundamental changes in the character of waiver \nrequests. It is worth noting that when you compare the age of waivers \nin 1984 to the age of waivers in 1994, it is not surprising that the \naverage age of waivers in 1984 would be low, since they could not even \nbe requested before that year. Why would they not be low then? A filed \nwaiver application in 1984 is a year old. It is understandable and \nlogical and indeed would be surprising if the opposite was the case if \nthese waivers would not age the longer the consent decree is in place.\n  More recent waiver requests require more time, as well, to evaluate \nfor several additional reasons. I think it needs to be understood. They \nare not illegitimate reasons. If they are not legitimate fines, that is \nfine. But do not come and say merely that we have one single statistic \nthat shows in 1984 here is the age of the waiver application, and in \n1994, here is the age of the waiver application and say, see, that \njustifies the conclusion that the Department of Justice should not be \ngiven a role.\n  Again, there are two reasons why that argument does not stand up. One \nis a fact I will isolate it in a minute. The other is that both the \nThurmond and Dorgan amendment say a 90-day time certain. The recent \nwaiver requests, however, deal almost entirely with lifting the MFJ's \ncore business restrictions--that is, inter-exchange, information \nservices, manufacturing--while early request waivers were primarily for \nthe local company entry into the nontelecommunications business--a much \neasier waiver to grant. When you get into the core business \napplication, the waivers are more difficult to grant and assess and \nthus take more time to either approve or to deny. They also evoke more \npublic concern and comments. It is a tough deal when a person comes up \nand says, ``A company has applied for a waiver, and I do not like it.''\n  One of the reasons the Department of Justice has taken longer is that \nyou have an increase in the numbers of public comments and expressions \nof concern. For example, of waivers filed with the Department of \nJustice in 1993 and 1994, the Department receives nearly six times as \nmany comments per waiver as in the 1984 to 1992 period. So just in the \nlast 2 years, you have had a substantial increase in the number of \npublic concerns and comments which are made on the waiver applications \nthat are put to the Department of Justice. The recent waiver \napplications present broader and more complex issues. A number of \nwaivers still considered pending are actually subsumed within broader \nrequests that have already been addressed by the Department of Justice.\n  Despite these challenges, the Department of Justice succeeded in \nspeeding up the waiver review process. In 1994, DOJ disposed of 43 \npercent more waiver requests than in 1993, while the average age of \npending waivers decreased by 17 percent. So if you are looking for how \nthey are doing over there, the 900 or so employees in the Antitrust \nDivision of the Department of Justice who have the responsibility for \nassessing concentration in the meat packing industry and concentration \nin all other industries--they have the responsibility for antitrust \naction in all sectors of the U.S. economy, these 900 employees--if you \nare looking for facts as to how well they are doing, I urge my \ncolleagues to look at the progress they have made from 1993 to 1994. \nLook at the complexity of the cases, and look beyond merely an \nexamination that says from 1984 to 1994 in the cases the age of the \nwaiver applications has been lessened. For all kinds of reasons, it is \nunderstandable, and it does not indicate that the Department of Justice \nis incompetent or unqualified. If that does not persuade you, look at \nthe language of the Dorgan amendment and the Thurmond amendment, \nbecause they remove all possibility of this thing being delayed for a \nlong period of time by putting a 90-day time certain, a date certain in \nthe law.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Justice is the agency with the \nexpertise in the competition and telecommunications markets. The \nDepartment of Justice has had an unwavering focus on the protection and \npromotion of competition. All facts support that conclusion. No facts \nthat I have heard support the conclusion that the Department of Justice \ndoes not have the capacity to assist the people of the United States of \nAmerica, as we the Congress attempt to move this local \n[[Page S8145]] monopoly into a competitive environment. They have \npromoted competition in telecommunications on a nonpartisan and \nbipartisan basis throughout this entire century.\n  The Department of Justice has deepened its expertise in \ntelecommunications competition over the past quarter century by \ninvestigating the Bell system's monopoly, suing to break up the \nmonopoly, and allow competition in long-distance and equipment markets \nto flourish, and in assisting the Federal district court in \nadministering the modification of final judgment, the consent decree \nthat dismantled AT The benefits to the Nation from the Department's \nrole in promoting competition have been more jobs, more exports, \ngreater innovation, and more products available to businesses and \nconsumers at lower prices than at any time in our history.\n  I see that the Senator from South Carolina is here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1265, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I have a modification at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Thurmond-\nD'Amato-DeWine-Inhofe amendment which will protect competition and \nconsumers by providing that antitrust principles will be applied by the \nDepartment of Justice in determining when the Bell operating companies \nshould be allowed to enter long distance.\n  I wish to explain a modification which I have made to this amendment. \nWith this modification, which clarifies the separate roles of the FCC \nand the Department of Justice, Senator Dorgan has agreed to support my \nsecond degree amendment and not to seek a vote on the Dorgan first-\ndegree amendment. I have appreciated working with Senator Dorgan, \nSenator Leahy, and their staffs, and wish to thank them for their \ncooperation and assistance in this important matter.\n  The second degree amendment that I introduced last Thursday contained \nlanguage to ensure that there is no duplication of functions between \nthe Department of Justice and the FCC. This was accomplished in the \namendment by limiting the public interest analysis of the FCC so that \nthe Commission shall not consider the antitrust effects of entry. \nAnalysis of the antitrust effects of Bell entry into long distance \nshould only be conducted by the Department of Justice, the antitrust \nagency with great expertise and specialization in analyzing \ncompetition.\n  The modification that I have made today clarifies that this \nrestriction of the FCC applies only to FCC's public interest analysis \nof Bell entry into long distance. This clarifies the FCC public \ninterest in a way that is entirely consistent with the original goals \nand purposes of my amendment and ensures that there is no duplication \nof functions. Although the FCC may appropriately consider competition \nin other aspects of its analysis, this specialized antitrust analysis \nprior to Bell company entry is to be conducted solely by the Department \nof Justice.\n  Under my modified amendment, the antitrust standard applied by the \nJustice Department remains the Clayton section 7 standard. The standard \nis whether Bell company entry would substantially lessen competition or \ntend to create a monopoly. This is the standard applied to every merger \nand acquisition in order to determine whether companies can expand or \nmove into\n new lines of business. That is the issue that requires analysis before \nBell companies enter long distance markets.\n\n  One issue I wish to emphasize is that my amendment is necessary to \nreduce duplication in the telecommunications legislation. Currently, S. \n652 provides that the FCC will conduct a public interest analysis of \nBell entry into long distance, with consultation by the Department of \nJustice. This results in both agencies being involved in antitrust \nanalysis, which is wasteful and inefficient. The Department of \nJustice--and not the FCC--has developed special expertise and \nspecialization in antitrust analysis during the past 60 years.\n  I would also note that the language we are using from section 7 of \nthe Clayton Act also appears in section 2 and section 3 of the Clayton \nAct. These sections deal with price discrimination and exclusive \ndealing arrangements which may harm consumers by inhibiting competition \nin the marketplace. Thus, not only is this standard familiar because of \nthe experience and case law under section 7 of the Clayton Act, but \nalso because of sections 2 and 3.\n  We all strongly support competition. We all support competition \nreplacing regulation. The question is how to make sure competition \nexists, and whether competition is achieved by a fixed list of rules or \nby flexible antitrust analysis.\n  Mr. President, the bottom lime is whether we believe the antitrust \nlaws are the means by which we protect competition or not. It is that \nsimple. If we believe in the antitrust laws--which have protected free \nenterprise for over 100 years--then we should pass the Thurmond - \nD'Amato - DeWine - Inhofe amendment.\n  For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Dorgan as a \ncosponsor of my second-degree amendment, as modified. Additionally, I \nask unanimous consent to add Senator Kohl as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as \na cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Laura \nPhilips, a fellow in the office of Senator Lieberman, be permitted \nprivilege of the floor during consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would like to respond to some of the \nremarks made here today, in part, to say that we already do have \nantitrust laws that will continue to exist.\n  We have the Sherman Antitrust, the Clayton Act, and the Hart-Scott-\nRodino Act, which will remain in full application.\n  I would like to go through the regulatory safeguards that already \nexist in S. 652, to break up local Bell monopolies without a new \nDepartment of Justice bottleneck.\n  It is my strongest feeling that having the Department involved as a \ndecisionmaker here is a mistake. The Department is already involved. \nThe Department can be a party to any case on appeal from the FCC. Under \nthe Hobbs Civil Appeals Act, it involved the Department as an \nindependent party in all FCC appeals.\n  The point is, the Department has an antitrust role. It has a role as \nan independent party in all FCC appeals. It can use the Sherman \nantitrust standard or it can use the Clayton, or indeed the Hart-Scott-\nRodino can be used when there is an application for a merger.\n  Now, we already have several safeguards in the process. We do not \nneed bureaucracy. Having the Department do the same thing, basically, \nthat the FCC is already doing is a mistake. I might say that even if \nthey do it, it will take them a long time.\n  My friends have said we will put a time certain. The legislation \nalready requires the Department to try to act within 30 days. That is a \nrequirement that is already on them.\n  Presently, the appeals last up to 3 or 4 years. I have a chart. I \nwill show how long the appeals last. They already have a 30-day \nrequirement that they have not been meeting. [[Page S8147]] \n  I want to go through some of the regulatory safeguards in this bill. \nFirst of all, the State certifies compliance with market requirements. \nThe State has to act on this. That is a safeguard. That is a check.\n  Second, the FCC affirms public interest. That is also public \ninterest, convenience, and necessity.\n  That means that the FCC can look at this from the traditional public \ninterest, convenience, and necessity standpoint. We had a discussion \nabout that here on the floor of the Senate. There was an effort to \nrepeal that by some Members of the Senate who feel that the public \ninterest gives the FCC too much latitude, too much power.\n  Next, the FCC certifies compliance and requests a 14-point checklist. \nThe FCC has to go through a 14-point checklist to certify that the \nregional Bells have acted. I have the 14 points on another chart. I \nwill go through that.\n  The Bell companies comply with separate subsidiary requirement. They \nmust have a separate subsidiary in a certain period of time in many \nareas. Nondiscrimination requirement. They cannot give all the business \nto one long distance or one subsidiary. They have to act in a \nnondiscriminatory way.\n  There is a cross-subsidization ban.\n  Fifth, FCC allows the Department full participation in all its \nproceedings. The Department of Justice will be there as the FCC \nproceeds. Indeed, the bill, as written, gives the Justice Department a \nrole.\n  Next, the Bells must comply with existing FCC rules in rigorous \nannual audits; elaborate cost accounting; computer-assisted reporting, \nand special pricing rules.\n  Seventh, there will remain the full application of the Sherman \nAntitrust, the Clayton Act, and the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. This is very \nimportant.\n  It is not as though, if we defeat the Dorgan-Thurmond amendments, \nthat the Justice Department will have no role. They will have a very \nactive role as they have had in the past. I think that that is \nsomething to remember. Again, the Hobbs Civil Appeals Act lets the \nDepartment of Justice participate as an independent party in all FCC \nappeals.\n  Let me go over here to the competitive checklist, if I may. This is \nS. 652's measure to assure breakup of local Bell monopolies.\n  First, access to network functions and services. The interconnect \nrequirement is on the checklist. I think everybody in the Chamber has \nbeen in on drawing up this checklist. It is a checklist that the FCC \nwill have to go through before a Bell company is certified that it has \nmet the requirements. This is a definite checklist. It is something \nthat we have worked on around here since January in meetings every \nnight and on Saturdays and Sundays.\n  Next, capability to exchange telecommunications between Bell \ncustomers and competitors' customers;\n  Third, access to poles, ducts, conduits, and rights of way;\n  Fourth, local loop transmission unbundled from switching;\n  Fifth, local transport from trunk side unbundled from switch;\n  Sixth, local switching unbundled. These are the so-called unbundling \nportions of it, whereby a company will have to open up and unbundle its \ncodes so that competitors can come in. It is only once they form a \nsmall telephone company that there is interconnection and unbundling \navailable.\n  Next, access to 911 and enhanced 911, directory assistance and \noperator call completion service;\n  Next is the white pages directory listing;\n  Next is access to telephone number assignment;\n  Tenth, access to data bases and network signaling;\n  Eleventh, interim number portability;\n  Twelfth, local dialing parity;\n  Thirteenth, reciprocal compensation;\n  Fourteenth, resale of local service to competitors.\n  Mr. President, this is the competitive checklist, the 14 points that \nmust be met first of all to be certified by the FCC. Then we also have \nthe so-called public interest requirement. We also have State \ncertification.\n  What I am saying is, here we have a carefully crafted bill that \nalready requires much review, and what is being proposed in the \nThurmond and Dorgan amendments is that, when we finish all this with \nthe State and the FCC, then we go over to the Justice Department and \nstart all over again with another decisionmaker.\n  The Justice Department is not supposed to be a decisionmaker in this \nsense. The Justice Department is not a regulatory agency. It has become \none under Judge Greene's rules, but those attorneys theoretically \nrespond to Judge Greene from the district court. They have gotten in \nthe habit over there of having several hundred lawyers who are \nbasically regulators. As, for example, in the Ameritech case, they are \neven approving phone books and things of that sort over at the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  The Department of Justice is supposed to deal with antitrust issues \nand the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act and go act as an independent \nparty under the Hobbs Appeals Act. They are supposed to be lawyers \nbringing cases and lawyers giving interpretations and antitrust rulings \nand so forth.\n  What the Justice Department, like so many departments in Washington, \nwants to do is become a regulator, to have a permanent staff of people \nwho regulate and make decisions. That is supposed to be done over at \nthe FCC.\n  So I say to my friends who propose this change that, if they want \nanother standard of regulation, let us do it at the FCC where it is \nsupposed to be. Why go over here to the Department of Justice--which \nhas its role, which has its traditional role, and a good role, let me \nsay.\n  We have read a lot in the paper about the Hart-Scott-Rodino rulings \nof this year and the Clayton Act standard, which is in the proposal of \nSenator Thurmond. And, of course, the Sherman Antitrust Act, which \nstarted all this, in Judge Greene's decision. The point is the \nDepartment of Justice already has a role and will have a role without \nadding another layer of bureaucracy.\n  The Dorgan-Thurmond amendment or variations thereof, is the opposite \nof proconsumer legislation. Consumers want wide open competition. They \nwant lower costs. They want more and better services, and they want \nthese without delay.\n  The Department of Justice, in carrying out the MFJ, is now averaging \nnearly 3 years. I believe I have here a list of small charts which show \nthe average time, ``Average Age Of Waivers Pending Before the District \nCourt.'' In 1993 it is 1,600 days, is the average age of the waivers. \nThat is how long it takes to get a decision out of the Department of \nJustice, 1,600 days.\n  The ``Waivers Disposed Of Through the District Court,'' that is \nthrough the Justice Department, has declined in 1993. It reached a \nheight in 1986 but they are doing less, even slower, even more slowly.\n  The average age of waivers pending before the Department of Justice \nyear-end is 1,200 days. This is in a Department that in present law \nsays it will endeavor to get these done within 30 days. They have \ncompletely ignored that.\n  Next we come to ``Waivers Disposed Of By DOJ.'' It has dropped to an \nall-time low in 1993 for some reason.\n  The point I am making--requests filed with the DOJ hit an all time \nlow in 1992, again in 1993--is people have given up. If they have to \nwait 3 years or more, it is too frustrating, too futile. I think that \nis something we should think about very carefully before we add another \nlayer of bureaucracy.\n  I know my colleagues have the best intentions here, but I have a \nchart showing the ``Average Age of Waivers Before the District Court \nYear-end.'' It started in 1985. They were supposed to get theirs, in \nthe law, done within 30 days. They were supposed to get the work done \nwithin 30 days. In 1985 it took them an average of about 100 days to \nget the waivers issued. In 1986 it was up to about 200 days.\n  Anyway, to make a long story short, if you file a waiver before the \nDepartment of Justice today you will wait, on the average, nearly 1,500 \ndays, about 4 years. That is why they dropped so much.\n  I say to my colleagues, do we want this extra layer of bureaucracy? \nOr do we really want to open up competition?\n  I would say it is a great mistake. We are doing all these checklists. \nWe are doing public interest. We are having [[Page S8148]] the States \nbe involved. All this has to happen first. This is a formidable task. \nWe are probably talking about delaying competition 3 years at least if \nthis amendment passes in any form.\n  The way the bureaucracy works around this town--I have been around \nhere awhile watching it--it will probably be more than that before we \nare through. We are probably talking about a 3- to 5-year delay.\n  Some of my colleagues have talked about a LeMans start--that is, just \nstart right now, in terms of competition. We would let everybody \ncompete. There are some problems of unbundling or interconnecting with \nthat, but there are Members of this body, indeed we had two members in \nthe Commerce Committee who voted against this bill who felt strongly \nabout an immediate start. There is much merit to that.\n  But the bill we came up with is a balance between those two. The bill \nwe came up with allows States to certify, then the FCC to go through a \n14-point checklist, then the FCC to go through the public interest \ntest, then competition would begin under our bill.\n  But under the proposal of my colleagues here today on the Senate \nfloor, the Dorgan-Thurmond proposal, after we finished all that process \nand went through all those approvals and went through that checklist, \nthen we would go over to the Justice Department and start all over \nagain with some more regulators and they would go through yet more \ntests. It would take more time.\n  What we have here is a lawyer's dream, a lawyer's paradise.\n  Mr. KERREY. Will the Senator from South Dakota yield on that?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I will, just as soon as I am finished. I am almost \nfinished.\n  What we have here is a lawyer's paradise if this passes. It will mean \nthe piece of regulation we have before us, which is deregulatory, will \nbecome in part regulatory. We are trying to simplify, to have less \nGovernment making approvals. This amendment would mean we would need a \nwhole other layer of people making the same approvals. It is more \nregulation, in my judgment.\n  Let me also say that we had quite a debate in the Commerce Committee \nand here on the floor on this matter of public interest, convenience, \nand necessity. There are many in the think tanks in town who would be \ndescribed as on the conservative side of things who think we should not \nhave the standard of public interest, convenience, and necessity \nbecause, they said, that is more bureaucracy, it lets the FCC have too \nmuch power.\n  This Chamber and the Commerce Committee had votes on that and it was \ndetermined to leave it in, but a lot of people think that is too much \nregulation. These companies are going to have to go through all the \nchecklists, the public interest test, State approval, they are going to \nhave to go through all that. Then my friends want them to go on over to \nthe Justice Department with their lawyers and start all over again. We \nshould not allow that. That is my point.\n  Mr. KERREY. Will the Senator from South Dakota yield?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator twice has said an applicant must go to the \nFCC, go through all that, and then they have to go to the Department of \nJustice. Will the Senator from South Dakota agree the language of the \namendment calls for simultaneous application? It does not call for \nconsecutive application, where you go to one and then have to go to \nanother. You do not get approval at FCC and then get approval at the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  The Senator twice said that you get your approval at the FCC. Then \nyou have to go to another agency. Does the Senator allow that the \nThurmond-Dorgan amendment calls for a simultaneous process?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my friend will allow me, the Senators' amendment \nwould require that they go to two places, first of all, for sure. There \nis no debate about that. You have to go to two places.\n  Mr. KERREY. The question I am asking----\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Let me answer the question.\n  Mr. KERREY. The question is, is there simultaneous application?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I do not yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from South Dakota has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I would like to answer that question, if I may.\n  First of all, the amendment would require the applicant to go to two \nplaces; actually more than that. You have to go to the State, to the \nFCC, and the Justice Department. It is true that the Senator says \nsimultaneous. But, as a practical matter, most people are not going to \nhire some lawyers. They are going to see if they meet the public \ninterest test and the checklist first before they go to the Justice \nDepartment, as a practical matter. But, even miraculously, if they \ncould do both simultaneously----\n  Mr. KERREY. I do not give----\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I will not yield until I complete answering the \nquestion.\n  The point is, you clearly would have to go to two places. One, you \nhave to go to the State and the FCC. Under this amendment, then, you \nwould have to go to Justice. Even if you could miraculously get all of \nthis done simultaneously, if you had three sets of lawyers, you go to \nthe State. Before the FCC could really act, they would have to see the \nState thing. The fellows over at Justice, I guarantee you, would want \nto see what the guys at the State and the FCC did.\n  Let us say, if you had enough lawyers, they could miraculously do it \nall on the same day, and that each agency plus the Justice Department \nwill not delay things for 3 years, you would still have the situation \nthat you could need three sets of lawyers. As a practical matter, most \npeople, if the State is not going to approve, they will not spend the \nmoney to go on to the FCC and go on to the Justice Department. The \npoint is, if my friend will yield, he has to admit that there is one \nextra place you have to go. There is clearly one more place. You have \nto go to the Justice Department.\n  Mr. KERREY. I am pleased to yield.\n  The Senator keeps saying miraculously, and three sets of lawyers. I \njust do not think the facts support that. I do not think the facts \nsupport that is what a company would do, have to hire a whole separate \nset of lawyers or, being a miracle, that there would be simultaneous \napplication. The application process is different at the Department of \nJustice because the Department of Justice is the agency that has the \nexperience of determining whether or not there is competition. They are \nthe ones with the experience. The FCC does not have that experience. \nIndeed, the checklist the Senator is referring to is the placement for \nthe VII(c) test. The Senator voted for an VII(c) test last year. Last \nyear, the Senator from South Dakota was quite willing to have \nsimultaneous application then because the Department of Justice had a \nruling with an VII(c) test involved.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I yielded for a question. What is the question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from South \nDakota if he is almost finished. Senator Thurmond has offered a \nmodification, which has been accepted as a second-degree amendment. I \nwould like to describe the circumstances of the bipartisan support for \nthat modification which is the second-degree amendment to my amendment. \nSo when the Senator is finished, I would like to do that.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I will quickly wrap up in deference to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. I have a few more things. In fact, I am trying to keep \nthings moving along. So I will yield the floor so the Senator can do it \nright now.\n  I hope other Senators who have amendments will bring them to the \nfloor so we can get some amendments stacked up. We are trying to move \nthis. I will demonstrate an eagerness to move things forward by \nyielding the floor right now.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it was not my intention to ask the Senator \nfrom South Dakota to discontinue if he was not finished. I appreciate \nvery much his courtesy. Again, I think he and the Senator from South \nCarolina have done a real service in bringing this legislation to the \nfloor, and while we disagree on parts of it, disagree strongly on this \npart of it, I, nonetheless, admire the work that both managers have \ndone. [[Page S8149]] \n  But let me describe where we are. We worked over the weekend with \nSenator Thurmond and his staff, and Senator Kerrey and his staff were \napprised. We now have an agreement. Senator Thurmond's second-degree \namendment was modified a half hour or so ago. That modification \nincludes some additional language that was agreed to this weekend so \nthat we retain the standard proposed by Senator Thurmond in his second \ndegree. We add some additional language that we wanted to be included, \nand it now represents in my judgment a satisfactory resolution on the \nquestion of the role of the Justice Department. I, therefore, will be \nsupportive by voting yes on a motion that is offered in the second \ndegree. It represents something that Senator Thurmond, myself, Senator \nKerrey, and others agree with and think will advance the interests of \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, while I am on my feet, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Leahy be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I heard the description by the Senator \nfrom South Dakota. With all due respect, I disagree very strongly with \nthe description. We are not attempting to establish new barriers. In \nfact, it is quite the opposite. Just exactly the opposite is happening \nhere. We intended to, and with this amendment describe the different \nroles for the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of \nJustice. We have specifically created the circumstance where there is \nno overlap. That was the entire purpose of what we have done over the \nweekend with this amendment.\n  So there is no overlap. We are not talking about creating a level of \ncomplexity that will be a lawyers' relief act. In fact, the only relief \nthe lawyers in this country will get is if this is not in the bill. If \nwe do not include in the bill a role in the Justice Department, I \nguarantee you that we will have an ocean of litigation on this question \nforever.\n  So if one is interested in life and making lawyers happy, one would I \nsuppose vote against this because it will result in an ocean of \nlitigation. We have very carefully--and I think in a considered way \nwith Republicans and Democrats--crafted something that says here is the \nrole for the Federal Communications Commission, here is the role for \nthe Department of Justice, and they do not overlap but they are both \nessential roles. And they are both important, in any judgment, in \nmaking sure that as we move this forward, we do in fact have \ncompetition.\n  I am probably the last one expected to stand here and extol the \nvirtues of lawyers down at the Justice Department involved in the \nantitrust business. In the House of Representatives, I went to the \nfloor I suppose half a dozen times over the decade of the 1980's, \nthreatening to put the pictures of lawyers down at DOJ on the side of \nmilk cartons, because my notion was we were paying 900 or some \nattorneys involved in antitrust activity who essentially had vanished. \nThey were not doing anything. So my assumption was they disappeared and \nthat we ought to find them someplace. That was under the old scheme of \na Department of Justice that really could not find any activity that \nthey felt threatened the free market system. Any merger was just fine. \nAny hostile takeover was terrific. They became more like cheerleaders \nfor concentration in the marketplace than they were the guardians of \npublic interest with respect to competition and those who were fighting \nagainst antitrust activities.\n  If you care about the marketplace, then you care about what is called \na free market, and a free market in which competition is a robust, \ndynamic force that serves the interests of the consumers. A free market \nrequires a little care and attention on our part.\n  You can have your pockets picked in an economy like ours if you do \nnot have free markets. How do people pick your pockets? The influence \nthat can pick your pockets in a marketplace like ours is when you have \nconcentrations, so much so that enterprises can actually fix their \nprices, represent anticompetitive behavior, do things in a way to \nextract money from the consumers in a manner that protects themselves \nprotects the enterprises from the whims of competition. Those things \nare not healthy. We have been through periods in our country where we \nhad some trust busters that had to break up the cartels and trusts. \nFree market systems work only when there is a free market, only when \nthere is competition.\n  Our whole point about this legislation is we want there to be \ncompetition. We believe competition is good. Ancillary to that, as I \nalso believe in my home county where you do not have very many people, \nthere is not going to be much competition. So I ought to make sure that \nwe provide some basic protections for those areas of the country where \ncompetition is not going to be the allocator of resources and services. \nNotwithstanding that, in much of our country, you will have robust \ncompetition. But the potential exists in a very substantial way for \nsome to use market advantage to restrict competition. That is why we \nwant to find in this amendment a mechanism by which we provide \nguarantees, and we provide assurances for the consumers in our country. \nThat is what we are attempting to do.\n  So I understand, if I were one participant in this battle for the \nconsumers' dollar in the telecommunications industry, I might say, \n``Gee, it is a real inconvenience for you all to be suggesting that the \nDepartment of Justice ought to have any more of a role than a \nconsultative role.''\n  This is not about inconvenience. This is about protecting the public \ninterest and protecting the market system to make sure we have a free \nmarket with competitive forces.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Indeed, I have enjoyed working with my friend on so \nmany issues, and we do have occasional disagreement. This is one of \nthem. Let me ask a question.\n  Would this amendment require the Administrative Procedures Act to be \napplied in Justice Department procedures? What I am getting at here is \nthe procedures at the FCC would be under the Administrative Procedures \nAct so there is an open process. There are ex parte rules. The Justice \nDepartment has rules over there that are prosecutorial, and they do not \nhave to be open; they do not have to meet all of the same requirements \nthat an administrative agency does. What is the status of the \nAdministrative Procedures Act regarding this amendment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I do not know the specific answer to the Senator's \nquestion except to say that the amendment that we have now modified \nestablishes a Clayton 7 test which is a test below the VIII(c) test \nthat we had in my underlying amendment, which, I might say, the Senator \nfrom South Dakota and others voted for last year as it moved out of the \nCommerce Committee. To whatever extent the procedure followed last year \nwith respect to VIII(c), which is a higher threshold which would have \nbeen required, I would suggest that same procedure is now required in \nthe Justice Department except that we have agreed with a somewhat lower \nstandard.\n  We do not agree, however, with a notion that the Justice Department \nought to be dealt out of this altogether, reserving only a consultative \nrole for the Justice Department.\n  I understand the question. I will try to get an answer with respect \nto the Administrative Procedures Act I believe the Senator asked about.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes. We have to resolve the Administrative Procedures \nAct matter or clarify it to the Senate. The Justice Department, being a \nprosecutorial branch of our Government, can operate in secret or does \nnot have to follow the administrative procedures rules. Therefore when \nyou file a waiver--presently when a telephone company files for a \nwaiver--they do not have the same rights to know what is going on or ex \nparte rules or rules of openness that one has with an agency such as \nthe FCC.\n  And under the 14-point checklist that we have and under the public \ninterest rules at FCC, they have to follow the administrative \nprocedures. This provides openness and and protects the rights of \nparties. But when they go over to the Justice Department--and it was \none problem we had with the VIII(c) test very frankly--there is not \nthat openness. The Justice Department does not have to have open \nmeetings [[Page S8150]] and hearings. It does not have to have ex parte \nrules. Your rights over there are less than they are when you are \nbefore an agency that has the Administrative Procedures Act.\n  I think this goes to the core of the debate here on the Senate floor. \nThe Justice Department is a different sort of an agency. It is a \ncabinet agency that does not have to be under the Administrative \nProcedures Act. It can prosecute people. It interprets the antitrust \nlaws. It interprets the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act and the Hart-\nScott-Rodino Act, and it does a good job in those areas.\n  I might say that the present Assistant Attorney General, a fine \nwoman, has done a great job, in my opinion, on Hart-Scott-Rodino, and \nshe has done a great job in administering this huge group of lawyers \nover there who are regulators presently under the MFJ. And I suppose \nthat somebody fears they are going to have to let all their lawyers go, \nsomewhere between 200 and 900 lawyers, and I do not know where they are \ngoing to go. Maybe that is the problem.\n  Seriously, on a serious note, the Department of Justice wants to keep \non being a regulator without being under the Administrative Procedures \nAct. And that is a problem. When you get over to the Justice \nDepartment--first of all, under the Dorgan amendment, you go to the FCC \nand you have openness. You can have an open hearing. If one of the \ncommissioners talks to somebody even at a reception about this case, he \nhas to file a report of it and give equal time to somebody else. But \nyou go over here to the Justice Department, you are not under the \nAdministrative Procedures Act. They can operate in secret if they want \nto. They are a prosecutorial agency. They can operate without the ex \nparte rules.\n  I think that is a very important thing. Constitutionally, I do not \nthink you should be able to apply all of the aspects of the \nAdministrative Procedures Act to the Justice Department. They have a \ndifferent role in the nature of our Government. They have a different \nmission to carry out. Now, every agency would like to have several \nrooms full of lawyers who are regulators. And, indeed, if you look in \nthe present Ameritech case, the Department of Justice had regulators \nchecking on the validity of telephone books, to see whether they fit \ninto the rules. They have regulators checking into the validity of \nYellow Pages. This is in the Department of Justice, where we hold up \nthe hand of the balance of justice.\n  This has nothing to do with the balance of justice. This belongs in \nthe regulatory agency that we spend so much money on, the FCC. So that \nis I think a very core point here in the nature of this debate.\n  I am going to yield any further time. I will just conclude by saying, \nbecause we have to get this debate moving, I challenge my friend from \nNorth Dakota to name another area of commerce where the Department of \nJustice has a decisionmaking role. This is trying to give the \nDepartment of Justice a decisionmaking role.\n  And the answer to that question, which I will get, is none, not \nanother single area--not transportation, not aviation, not financial \nservices or any other area. Why telecom, which is an important area? \nWhy are they putting them over in the Department of Justice? It is \ngoing to take a thousand regulators at least to carry out the Dorgan \namendment. And we have this job done twice already, once at the State \nlevel and once at the FCC. I hope when we get into the wireless age I \nwill still be around here offering a bill to eliminate the regulation \nthat we have, but that may be 10 years down the road.\n  In any event, this is a bad concept, from the Administrative \nProcedures Act to the decisionmaking role.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I just disagree with the Senator from \nSouth Dakota. We are not talking about a regulatory role for the \nDepartment of Justice. We must be talking about a couple different \npieces of legislation. We are not talking about putting Justice into a \nregulatory environment, the Justice Department, although I would admit \nthat the term ``justice'' itself is a useful term for us to use as we \ndiscuss this because this is not about some mom and pop businesses \nhaving to confront the Justice Department. The real pawns in this \ndebate are the American people, the consumers who are going to have to \npay the bill for whatever communications services they purchase.\n  We would hope, all of us in this Chamber would hope they can go to a \nmarketplace that is a free, open, competitive marketplace and purchase \nthose services, even in the local exchanges. And the question for the \nJustice Department is the question of when is there competition and \nunder what conditions this competition exists in the local exchanges, \nbecause then the regional Bell operating companies will be able to go \nout and compete in long distance service.\n  However, we are not suggesting the role of the Justice Department be \na regulatory role. I think somehow the Senator and others are mistaken \nabout that. I do think, though, that when one makes the point we have \ncrafted an amendment that attempts to set up competing forces here that \nrepresent dual obstacles for an applicant is just wrong. It is not the \nway it is written. It is not what the amendment is about. And it is not \nwhat we are trying to do.\n  We are saying the absence of a substantive Justice role in this \ntelecommunications bill we think has the potential of cheating the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. KERREY. Will the Senator from North Dakota yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Just for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator from South Dakota asked and then raised in \nthe following series of arguments against, after having asserted that \nthe Department of Justice has a different role and function, which it \nunquestionably does--it has been managing the movement from a monopoly \nto a competitive environment. Why should it not be different? Of \ncourse, it is different. As to the Yellow Pages case, it is a very \nimportant anticompetitive case, very important anticompetitive case.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me yield the floor to the Senator from Nebraska, if \nthat is sufficient.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I am sorry for the \nlong warmup to the question. I appreciate the yielding of the floor.\n  As to the question the Senator from South Dakota is asking, the \nlanguage of 652 on page 89 appears to be--and I ask my colleague if he \nreads it the same way--on line 7, it says:\n\n       The commission shall issue a written determination . . .\n\n  And here is the language that triggers the administrative procedures \nthat the Senator was asking whether or not would exist. As I understand \nit, case law says this is the language that you need in order to \ntrigger the very administrative review that the Senator is for. The \nlanguage is:\n\n       . . . on the record after a hearing and opportunity for \n     comment.\n\n  I think it is a legitimate concern. I think the question that is \nbeing raised by the Senator from South Dakota is quite legitimate.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, if I could just answer that question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Nebraska yield?\n  Mr. EXON. I yield.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. On page 89, ``determination by the Commission,'' that \nis the Administrative Procedures Act applied to the Federal \nCommunications Commission. My point is that it does not apply in \nDepartment of Justice proceedings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I stand by the committee-reported bill's compromise on \nthe role of the U.S. Department of Justice. As one of the architects of \nthe Justice Department's advisory role compromise, I believe that this \ncompromise delicately balances provisions that hold together very well \nunder even the most dedicated scrutiny. The survival of the Federal \nCommunications Commission public interest standard is a testament to \nthat fact.\n  As a lesson in the art of compromise, the role of the Department of \nJustice is an example of how Congress should work together. Chairman \nPressler [[Page S8151]] presented a draft on behalf of his Republican \ncolleagues which embraced a day certain for Bell entry into long \ndistance, no role for the Department of Justice in the long distance \ndecisionmaking, and no savings clause to preserve antitrust authority.\n  Our ranking member, Senator Hollings, presented a draft on behalf of \nthe Democrats which held equally firm to the position of no date \ncertain, a separate decisionmaking role for the Department of Justice, \nand a full preservation of antitrust authority over the \ntelecommunications issue.\n  What I am explaining is that a lot of thought and compromise and \ndiscussions and ``-cussions'' have taken place with regard to this very \nimportant matter. I happen to feel that the Commerce Committee, on \nwhich I have served for 17 years, since I have been here, has done \nitself proud on this particular issue. We have, I think, by compromise, \nby understanding, by persuasion convinced all that the Department of \nJustice, indeed, has a role to play.\n  What we are talking about and debating today--and I think the debate \nis very worthwhile--is how much authority, how far can the Justice \nDepartment go in this area. I happen to believe that while this, like \nmost other bills and most other amendments that we adopt from time to \ntime, is not perfect, we are not certain how it is going to work out. \nBut we are certain in that this issue has been debated very, very \nthoroughly, and I believe that we have something that makes a great \ndeal of sense. I hope we will hold to the committee position.\n  Following months of consultation, negotiations and bipartisan \ncompromise, the committee recommended to the full Senate a bill which \npreserves an advisory role for the Department and certainly, without \nany question, preserves what I think was a necessary addition, making \nsure that the antitrust authority is maintained in the Department of \nJustice where I think it rightfully belongs.\n  The compromise did not include a day certain for Bell entry into long \ndistance, but it did include a certain procedure for entry that I think \nis important. It is a compromise, and I think it will work. It is a \ncompromise which is balanced. It is a compromise which presented a win-\nwin proposition as best we could for both sides. I certainly think that \nChairman Pressler and ranking Democratic member Hollings should be \ncomplimented for reaching out to each other and the Democratic and \nRepublican sides of the aisle to come up with something that I think is \nsomething that could be best described as providing a lot of wisdom.\n  I have been somewhat proud in the role of breaking the logjam between \nDemocrats and Republicans on this particular critical issue, and \ncertainly I appreciate the fact that there are others in this debate, \nincluding my friend and colleague from Nebraska, who have made some \nexcellent points with regard to the debate that has taken place on this \nvital issue.\n  At the heart of this debate is the appropriate role for independent \nregulatory agencies, of which the Federal Communications Commission is \nan important one. It is often said that these agencies are a half-step \namong the legislative, judicial and executive branches of Government. \nWe should keep it that way, I suggest. It has not been my experience \nthat the Justice Department has always been the hallmark of cooperation \nor understanding of the needs of the public at large. The Senate \nCommerce Committee has a unique relationship with all of the entities \ninvolved in these decisions. I have found over the years that Congress \nhas a much easier time working to implement policy with the independent \nregulatory agencies than it often does with the executive branch and, \nspecifically, in many instances, with the judicial branch.\n  The central purpose of this telecommunications reform bill is for the \nCongress, the representatives of the people, to regain control of \ntelecommunications policy. It is ironic that the Justice Department and \nJudge Greene removed telecommunications policy from the congressional \ndomain, and now here is a move to shift that control back to the world \nof the unelected, which I think the suggested amendment would do.\n  Make no mistake, the Department of Justice will have a key role in \ntelecommunications policy. Its expertise will not be wasted, and there \nis a great amount of expertise within the Justice Department on this \nand other things with regard to communications. Nothing in this \nlegislation repeals the antitrust statutes, and I debated and cited \ninstances of that on Friday last. This legislation specifically \nrequires that the Department consult with the Federal Communications \nCommission.\n  The bottom line is there should be one rule book and one referee. The \npreservation of the public interest test assures that the Federal \nCommunications Commission will give the Department's advice the most \nserious of consideration, as I think, by and large, history will prove \nthey have done in the past.\n  At this time of reinventing Government, there is added merit to \navoiding duplication from shopping around, looking to different \nagencies of Government to get relief.\n  To my colleagues who have expressed shock at the recent attacks on \nthe Federal Communications Commission and the irresponsible suggestion \nthat the Federal Communications Commission should be abolished, I \nsuggest now is an appropriate time to stand up and show confidence in \nthe independent judgment of that important agency.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the Senate will follow the well-thought-\nout and, I think, well-compromised and well-done effort on the measure \nthat we have been debating now for some time.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nebraska for what I think has been a very articulate statement \nabout his opposition to the pending amendment and why it is not \nnecessary.\n  I wonder, as we have these debates on the floor, about how difficult \nit must be for all of our colleagues who have not sat through weeks and \nmonths and, in fact, years of hearings as a member of the Senate \nCommerce Committee discussing the very complicated telecommunications \nbills and language and amendments. I know that, as a member of that \ncommittee since I have been in the Senate, it is incredibly complicated \nto me. We use acronyms and talk about so many different agencies and \nabout long distance versus RBOC's. It is very complicated for all of \nus, including those of us on the committee. I can just imagine how \ncomplicated it is for a Member not on the committee to come to the \nfloor and be immersed in the telecommunications debate, trying to \nfigure out what is right and wrong, and trying to understand a little \nbit about the history of this legislation, knowing that something \nhappened several years back when we had the Department of Justice \ninvolved in breaking up the AT operations into separate operating \ncompanies known as the regional Bell companies. And we see that we are \nconstantly being bombarded by all of the telecommunications suppliers \nin this country advertising about their services being better than \nsomebody else's services; you will save a penny here or a penny there \nif you pick us over somebody else. All of this is truly very \ncomplicated. I guess there is no way to get around that, because what \nwe are talking about is multibillion-dollar industries.\n  What I said at a hearing one time when we talked about one side wants \nto do this and the other side wants to do that, was, ``Who is right?'' \nI summarized by saying it is like all of these companies were coming \nbefore the committee and saying: I want in yours but you stay out of \nmine. Long distance companies were saying: I want to do local service \nbut you cannot do long distance service. And the local Bell companies \nwere saying: Well, I want to do long distance service, but I do not \nwant you to come do local service. Hence, the summary of the situation \nbeing: I want in yours but stay out of mine.\n  I think the committee is to be congratulated for coming up with a \nscenario whereby we favor competition. We are going to say that the \nmarketplace, when properly allowed to do so, can be the best regulator \nfor the benefit of the consumer. The problem is, we have not had a \ntelecommunications bill really since 1934. For all of our colleagues \nnot on the committee, the reason why the judges have been involved in \nsetting telecommunications policy in this country is because we in the \n[[Page S8152]] Congress have really not substantially written a \ntelecommunications bill for the 1990's. The telecommunications bill \nthat we operate under was written in 1934. Does anyone doubt the \ntechnology increases we have had since 1934? We have had 60 years of \ntechnological developments, and we are still being guided by an act \nwritten in 1934. You wonder why we have problems in this industry and \nyou wonder why the Department of Justice has had to use not a \ntelecommunications statute but an antitrust statute to help set \ntelecommunications policy for the 1990's.\n  The reason why it is not being handled very well in many cases is the \nfact that the law they are applying has nothing to do with \ntelecommunications. It has to do with antitrust. The breakup of the \nBell companies was not based on telecommunications policy set by this \nCongress. It was based on antitrust laws that were concerned about the \nsize and monopolistic practices of companies in this country. \nTherefore, all of that was achieved in sort of a haphazard fashion. We \nhave a Federal Judge, who, to his undying credit, has done a heroic job \nin trying to set policy for the telecommunications industry--Judge \nGreene here in Washington. He has had to do all of that because we have \nnot done our jobs. We have never tried to come up with policy that \nmakes sense for the nineties and the years thereafter.\n  I congratulate the chairman, Senator Pressler, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Hollings, for their long contribution in trying to come \nup with a bill that balances those interests, that says to the billion-\ndollar companies on this side and the billion-dollar companies on that \nside that we, for the first time, are going to create an atmosphere in \nthis country that allows the marketplace to work and fashion what is \ngood for the consumers and good for technology development and for the \ncompanies that provide telecommunications services. That is what this \nbill tries to do.\n  There are those who are going to argue that we cannot change the way \nwe have been doing business because that is the way we have been doing \nbusiness. We are not going to make any changes in the roles of the \nvarious agencies in Government because, well, that is what they have \nbeen doing since 1934.\n  I think we have to understand that, with this legislation, we are \ncalling for fundamental changes in the telecommunications business. We \nare going back to allowing people to be able to compete, and there will \nbe losers and there will be winners among the companies. But I think \nthat the competition that we will provide will make sure that consumers \nare the ultimate winners in what we do with this legislation. I think \nit is very, very important. The role of the Department of Justice--and \nI have a great deal of respect for the junior Senator from Nebraska, \nSenator Kerrey, for his comments. I understand the points they make, \nsaying that the Department of Justice needs to be involved in order to \nprotect consumers and make sure nobody does things to other people and \nother companies that they should not. I understand that. But that was \nappropriate when the old system existed. I suggest that that is not \nappropriate under the new system.\n  Let me give examples of why I think the Department of Justice --which \nis sort of the policeman or the cop when it comes to looking at various \nindustries in this country--should not be, in this case, the policeman, \ncop, judge, jury, and everything rolled into one. It will still have a \nrole under the chairman's legislation. Their role will be to enforce \nthe antitrust laws of this country. Nothing changes in that. No one can \nsay that this bill somehow guts the Department of Justice's role in \nenforcing antitrust laws, because it makes no changes in that. They \nwill still look at the whole array of communications companies and \napply the antitrust laws of this country to make sure that they are \nbeing held up to the standard that the Department of Justice says they \nshould be held to.\n  But what is different is that they will not be the agency that \nregulates telecommunications in their day-to-day activity. They will \nenforce antitrust laws, yes, but they will not have to be an agency \nthat sits back and says to all these industries, please come to us and \nask if you can provide telecommunications service. Please come to the \nDepartment of Justice building and file some more applications which \nmay take 2, 3 years to get filled out because fundamentally the system \nis being changed. That is the big point that I think needs to be \nunderstood by all of our colleagues who are not on the committee--that \nthis legislation of Senator Pressler and Senator Hollings and the \nmajority of the committee fundamentally changes the way \ntelecommunications policy is going to be carried out.\n  Therefore, under the old system when you needed the Department of \nJustice to enforce the law using antitrust laws, it is no longer \nnecessary, because we have a new document, a new set of rules and \nregulations, as to how this industry is going to work in this country. \nThe old way was defective. It was written in 1934. Like I said, you had \nto go back and find antitrust laws to come in and protect the interests \nof consumers because we did not have the plan, a bill, a document that \nmade sense. This bill makes sense, and this is the new rule book. It \nsays that the Department of Justice's role will be to make sure that \nantitrust laws are not violated.\n  Let me give some examples. When you have competition and when you \nhave deregulation, then you do not have the same role for the \nDepartment of Justice, and that is what we are following in this \nlegislation here today. I will give you an example with regard to the \nairline industry. The airline industry is regulated by the Federal \nAviation Administration. They look at questions about safety and make \nsure that airlines are doing what they are supposed to do to make sure \nthat they are economically sound before they come in and start \nservicing a particular area. When they do that, they do it in a manner \nthat is safe to the consuming public. There is competition and there \nare prices, and what have you. When you want to start an airline, you \ndo not have to go to the Department of Justice and ask, ``Can I do \nit?'' You do not go to them for a permit to run an airline in a \nparticular area. Now, if they become involved in antitrust violations, \nthen the Department of Justice can get in right away and say, ``Shut \nthis down; it is in violation of the antitrust laws of this country.''\n  The airline industry, however, does not have to go and beg to the \nDepartment, ``Please approve and give us a permit to serve a particular \narea.'' That has changed.\n  Why has it changed? Because they have been deregulated. Now \ncompetition is how they operate. As long as they do it within the \nboundaries of antitrust laws, DOJ is not involved in that endeavor, the \nFAA is, the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  Let me give another example; that is, the trucking industry. When I \nserved in the other body for 14 years, I was on the Transportation \nCommittee. We worked the Department of Transportation, dealing with the \ntrucking industry. I was there during decontrol and deregulation of the \ntrucking industry. A carrier today, when they want to operate, goes not \nto the Department of Justice to get approval. They go to the Interstate \nCommerce Commission and get a license to serve a particular area.\n  They look at the financial condition of the company. Can they \noperate? They look at the soundness of that company. In terms of its \nequipment, can they operate safely? Do they have enough equipment to do \nwhat they are supposed to do? And then they are granted permission to \ngo out and serve areas--by the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n  They do not go to the Department to say ``Please let us be a trucking \ncompany.'' The Department still has the enforcement rights of the \nSherman Antitrust Act. Of course, if they violate that act, the \nDepartment of Justice can come in and shut them down.\n  Now, the two examples I gave, I think, are apropos to the situation \nwe have with the telecommunications industry. We have fundamentally \nchanged how, with this legislation, how they will operate.\n  We are going to allow long distance companies, which in the past have \nbeen prevented from providing local service, to provide local service. \nThere will be more people providing local service. It just will not be \nthe regional Bells. There can be MCI, Sprint, AT, and a \n[[Page S8153]] whole array of new companies providing local service.\n  Guess what? In return, we will allow local companies, principally the \nregional Bells, to be able to provide long distance service. There is \ngoing to be competition both in long distance and there will be \ncompetition in local service.\n  Therefore, it is the committee's opinion, and I think, wisely \nreached, that we have a different set of procedures and rules that are \ngoing to work.\n  That is why the committee said there is a different role for some of \nthe agencies in Government, that they are not needed to do what they \nused to do because there is a different setup in the competition of \nproviding telecommunications service.\n  What some of the Federal agencies want, we have new players, a whole \nnew system, but we still want to play by the old rules. We have sort of \na paternalistic attitude by some of the Federal agencies that say, \n``Well we used do that. You mean you are going to change it? We can't \ndo it anymore?''\n  Yes, because we have fundamentally changed how business is going to \noperate in the telecommunications business.\n  This committee, I think, has done a terrific job in trying to say to, \nfor instance, the Bell companies, what they have to do to allow \ncompetition to come into the local market.\n  There are pages of this bill that spell it out. It is a very \nextensive, very detailed list of what all the Bell companies have to do \nto allow their competitors to be able to come in and compete.\n  This is extraordinary in the sense of telling private industry that \nthis is what they have to do in order to let the competitors come in \nand try to beat your economic brains out. It is there on page 823, \ncalled a competitive checklist. It says a Bell company may provide long \ndistance service if, first, they go through all of these things that \nthey do, to allow the long distance companies to provide local service.\n  It is kind of almost a jump-start. You can get in my business when I \ncan get into your business. But I will do everything I have to let you \ninto my business, because we used to be a bottleneck; we used to be a \nmonopoly; we used to control everything.\n  Now, this legislation says you will not control much of anything. You \nwill have to allow for nondiscriminatory access on an unbundled basis \nto the network functions and services of the Bell operating companies \nnetwork that is at least equal in type, quality, and price to the \naccess Bell operating company affords to itself.\n  That is pretty long. It says we will let you do anything with our \nnetwork that we do with our network that we built. It says, second, the \ncapability to exchange telecommunications between customers of the Bell \noperating companies and the telecommunications carrier seeking \ninterconnection. So they have to be able to exchange communications \nbetween the Bell's customers. That is, we are giving you our customers \nand you can talk to them. Go for it.\n  Next, nondiscriminatory access to poles, ducts, conduits, and right \nof ways owned or controlled by the Bell operating company. That is a \nvery significant requirement that not only are we inviting you to come \nin and compete with us, but we will give you access to all of our \nequipment--telephone poles, the conduits, the right of ways.\n  You got it; you want it, come on in, you can use it, provide local \nservice, talk to our customers, use our networks, because we want you \nto have access to our business. In addition, they say that local loop \ntransmission from the central office to the customer's premises, \nunbundled from local switching or other services; and next, local \ntransport from the trunk side of local exchange carrier switch, \nunbundled from switching or other services.\n  Finally, local switching unbundled from transport, local loop \ntransmission, or other services.\n  All that is very complicated, but what it essentially says is that \nBell operating company has to do all of these things, give permission \nto all your competitors to come in and use your equipment, use all of \nthese things so you can compete for local customers, but in return for \nthat we are going to start providing interLATA service or long distance \nservices.\n  Legislation says the Commission shall consult with the Attorney \nGeneral regarding that application. The Attorney General may apply any \nappropriate approval or any appropriate standard that they desire under \ntheir rules and regulations.\n  The Commission must find that the requested authorization is \nconsistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity.\n  Mr. President, I think that pretty well spells out what this bill is \ntrying to do in terms of long distance versus local service. It spells \nout why I think the committee has crafted a very good proposition, one \nthat protects the interests of the consumer.\n  The FCC deals with this issue like the ICC deals with transportation, \nand like the FAA deals with aviation. When we changed the rules in \nthose industries by deregulation and bringing about greater \ncompetition, of course, the role of the Department was changed, as \nwell. Like those other industries, those industries that do not have to \ngo to DOJ to get approval or to let them say no to an application, that \nis not their role. Their role is to look at criminal violations, \nviolations of the Sherman Antitrust Act. And all the other criminal \nrules that the Department has the authority to use when there are \npotential violations of the antitrust statutes are not affected at all.\n  What is affected is that we are putting into the FCC the proper role \nthat it should have, like we have in these other areas.\n  If we look at the history of the Department in trying to approve all \nof these mergers, the time that they have taken to give a ruling has \nincreased from an average pending application of 2 months in 1984 to 3 \nyears in 1993.\n  No wonder we have problems making the bureaucracy work, and I suggest \nthat that is a very good example.\n  In addition to having a Federal Communications Commission, we have \npublic service commissions in all 50 States plus the District of \nColumbia which appropriately and properly will be involved in \ncommunication and telecommunication policies and issues, as they have \nbeen in the past.\n  Mr. President, I ask that all of our colleagues who are trying to \nfigure out what is the proper answer to this very complicated process \nthat we are involved in will just look at the history of where we have \nbeen, the fact that the committee has crafted a very balanced bill.\n  There were differing opinions in our committee as to what the proper \nrole should be. I think after debate, we reported this bill out with a \nvote of 18 to 2. I think it is very clear that both Democrats and \nRepublicans agree that this is by far the best approach. I would \nrecommend it to my colleagues in the Congress.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I received word that the leadership \nwould like this matter to be voted on at about 6 o'clock, for the \nnotification of all Senators. That would give Members 2 hours.\n  I shall have more remarks, but I will yield to other Senators. Those \nSenators wishing to speak on the Dorgan amendment should bring their \nspeeches to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I inform the Senator from South Dakota, I \nobject to the time of 6 o'clock. We should talk about it.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Why would my friend object? We debated Friday afternoon \nand today. We are trying to move this process along.\n  Mr. KERREY. I understand we are trying to move the process along. It \nis not so much that I have an interest in debating this all night long. \nIt is that there have been requests from a number of people who \nindicated they prefer to stack votes and vote tomorrow morning. I am \nobliged to tell you I think that is not an unreasonable request.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I am a great admirer of my friend and I plead with the \nSenator, we must move forward. I received word that there are many who \nwould like to vote at 6. We will have to resolve it, perhaps in a \nprivate conversation. But for purposes of other Senators in their \noffices, it is our intention to try to put this to a vote at 6 this \nevening. [[Page S8154]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me join in the desire of our \nchairman here to get a vote this evening. When we broke on Friday the \nunderstanding was we would vote at 5 o'clock, perhaps. Not specifically \non this amendment. We would have votes. This is the amendment that is \nup. We discussed it some, actually, on Thursday; all day Friday. This \nhas been a crucial amendment.\n  I guess the world is not going to end if we put it over to tomorrow \nmorning for this particular Senator. But you could not call a vote at 6 \no'clock, or 7 o'clock, or this evening at all, unreasonable. Because we \nhave debated. We look for the Members to come and join in.\n  In fact, it has been debated on the telephone all weekend long. \nBecause the pressure has been on. As a result, now, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and the senior Senator from South Carolina have gotten \ntogether on the one amendment to get the best vote, I take it, possible \non this particular issue.\n  With respect to the issue, Mr. President, I hearken back to the \nhearings we had over a year ago. We commenced with the Secretary of \nCommerce, Secretary Ron Brown. The reason I refer to this is we are \nconstantly being admonished: Wait a minute, you voted for this last \nyear. Wait a minute, you voted for this last year.\n  I wish I could be as charming as the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois, the former minority leader--momentarily I think he may have \nbeen majority leader but he was mostly minority leader, Senator Everett \nDirksen. And he said--I think he was quoting Emerson, ``Consistency is \nthe hobgoblin of little minds.''\n  So, yes, the Senator from South Carolina voted for this last year. \nHowever, the Senator from South Carolina, and referring to Secretary \nBrown's appearance in February of last year--I refer on page 40:\n\n       Secretary Brown. Well, I certainly respect that view, \n     Senator Danforth, and the one expressed by the Chairman. It \n     is our view that VIII(c), administered by the Department of \n     Justice, which has a good deal of experience, as the Chairman \n     points out, would achieve the purposes of the committee and \n     achieve the purposes of S. 1822. That is the only difference \n     we have. We have the same goal.\n\n  Mind you me, S. 1822 did not have the Department of Justice as a \ncheckoff at all when I introduced S. 1822, after much discussion with \nmany of the Members.\n  ``The Chairman,'' as I was acting chairman at that particular time:\n\n       You are suggesting that this be administered by the FCC and \n     the Department of Justice?\n       Secretary Brown. That is correct, Senator.\n       The Chairman. Well, that is the basic difference, then. You \n     want two entities to start administering communications.\n\n  Going on over two or three pages at the bottom of page 43, because \nhere we have at the present time the law with respect to \ntelecommunications is unchanged, as respects the Department of Justice. \nSection 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act is untouched, absolutely \nuntouched.\n  Let me emphasize that. That is where the so-called Department of \nJustice got all of this wonderful experience that we keep hearing \nabout. They have all of the experience over the years and they have the \nmarketing expertise and what have you. So, on page 8 of the bill, if \nyou follow now, on 8 of the bill down at the bottom on section 7,\n\n       Effect On Other Law . . . nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to modify, impair, or supersede the applicability \n     of any antitrust law.\n\n  Mr. President, you cannot say it more clearly than that. I elaborated \non it in the committee report and I turn to page 43 wherein:\n\n       The FCC is required to consult with the Attorney General \n     regarding the application during that 90 day period. The \n     Attorney General may analyze a Bell operating company \n     application under any legal standard (including the Clayton \n     Act, Sherman Act, other antitrust laws, section VIII(c) the \n     [modified final judgment], the Robinson-Patman Act, or any \n     other standard).\n\n  You see, that had not changed and is not changed by S. 652. So what \nwe were trying to do, and as I pointed out as we started out on S. \n1822, was to cut out the duplication, and certainly not give authority \nfor regulation to the Department of Justice. The Department of Justice \nis a law enforcement department. In fact, under Sherman, Section 2 of \nthe Sherman Antitrust Act, are civil and criminal penalties. I said \nwhen we started on this last week the telephone companies were not a \nbunch of criminals and there was not any reason to start getting them--\nyes, there is a difference. My distinguished colleague from Nebraska \nsays get a different lawyer. You bet your boots you get a different set \nof lawyers. It is just like going to a doctor for a broken arm, on the \none hand, and going to a doctor, on the other hand, for diabetes. They \ndo not know anything in broken arms about diabetes, and diabetes cannot \nset any broken arms.\n  Similarly, in the legal profession, if you are going before \nantitrust, I can tell you now as I have had to face antitrust lawyers \nand this particular attorney was not expert, I had to go up to \nVanSeiss, in New York, for a solid week seminar, because we did not \nhave any particular antitrust lawyers in Charleston, SC, at the time \nthat were willing to take this case. I told the prospective client, I \nsaid, ``Wait a minute I am not an antitrust lawyer. I am not steeped in \nthat particular discipline.''\n  I had met VanSeiss and he had a seminar, and we buddied off, my law \npartner and myself, for a week's seminar and came back and figured we \nlearned enough not only to defend but to prevail. But that is another \nstory.\n  But I can tell you from hard experience, the answer is ``yes.'' You \ndo not get the same lawyers before the FCC, necessarily, and the same \nlawyers before Justice and the Criminal Division of section 2 of the \nSherman Antitrust Act.\n  The Clayton Act, in all fairness to the amendment of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, Senator Thurmond, that deals strictly with civil \npenalties, with the matter of measuring whether there is excessive \ncompetition that could lead to extensive--not competition but \nmonopolistic practices.\n  But in any event, let me refer back to page 43 of the hearing \ncommittee record so everybody who is interested about how we change--\nyou are going to tell how change comes about. The chairman, which was \nSenator Hollings, said, and I quote:\n\n       Well, let me just comment on the matter about antitrust \n     because I did discuss with Anne Bingaman this particular bill \n     before it was introduced. And I made it known to her that, \n     and she well knows I recommended her for the position of \n     Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust \n     Division. She is a breath of fresh air. I am the \n     appropriations chairman of the Antitrust Division of the \n     Justice Department. I have been dealing with the moneys for \n     this Antitrust Division of the Justice Department for \n     numerous years, and I can tell you categorically we are way \n     behind the curve in this particular field. And she has got \n     more . . . grace . . . the FCC has its responsibility. On \n     that basis, trying to eliminate lawyering, trying to \n     eliminate the delays, trying to simplify the procedure, we \n     really do not need more of a role for the Department of \n     Justice other than consultation. Well, there is an egregious \n     situation of monopolization . . . they do consult, and we put \n     that in there. But otherwise we did not want to get into \n     Justice and get into the Judiciary Committee and get bogged \n     down.\n\n  That is exactly where we had intended, as I said at the very \nbeginning, the one-stop shopping. But the White House disagreed, and \nthe Justice Department disagreed, and numerous Senators disagreed, and \nthe task of a chairman of a committee is to get the best product you \npossibly can so long as you do not do injury to the overall goal of \nderegulation and fostering competition.\n  So I went on in the bill S. 1822. But those who continually say, \n``Well, you voted, you voted--last year. You should be admonished.'' \nRather than admonishing me, my original intent as the chairman of the \ncommittee was to do just as Senator Pressler has provided in S. 652. So \nin S. 652 we provided the one-stop shopping at the Federal \nCommunications Commission. The Department of Justice is totally \nunhindered and unaffected with respect to their antitrust \nresponsibilities and authority. There is no question about that. No one \nhas raised that question. They are seeking in the amendment additional \nauthority and responsibility, which I think very positively confuses \nthe situation and constitutes a bad amendment.\n  Why do I say that? I say that for this language here in the Thurmond-\nDorgan amendment. It says the ``FCC, in making its determination \nwhether the requested authorization is consistent [[Page S8155]] with \nthe public interest, convenience and necessity, the Commission shall \nnot consider''--listen to this--``the Commission shall not consider the \nantitrust effects of such authorization in any market for which \nauthorization is sought.''\n  I am your lawyer. You have a communications company. You come to the \nlawyer and say, ``Lawyer, tell me. What about this thing?'' I say, \n``Well, it says it should not have any authority at the FCC over any \nantitrust section of marketing, in any market for which authorization \nis sought. However, we know marketing forces and we know forces of \ncompetition. And we know measuring market competition. You have an \naffirmative action responsibility empowered in the FCC by S. 652.'' I \nsay, ``It is the present law,'' or the law as my client would come to \nme. And I say, ``They have to do all of this unbundling, dialing \nparity, interconnection, number portability.'' And I list all of these \nparticular things. ``You have the public interest section in here about \nmarketing. Yet, you have a section in there that says you cannot touch \nthe marketing thing if they reflect antitrust. Well, marketing \ncompetition, antitrust marketing competition, could be, as we lawyers \nsay, the mime shows, or the same thing.''\n  I can tell you here and now you have a bad amendment where they are \njockeying around to get Justice into this and mess it up. I can tell \nyou, leave the Justice Department Antitrust Division, leave section 2 \nof Sherman antitrust, leave section 7 of the Clayton Act, leave all of \nthose things as they are. S. 652 does. But do not come wandering down \nthe road with dual committee jurisdiction, dual jurisdiction, two types \nof attorneys, and everything else. And about the time, if you were \ngoing at the same time and think you are making progress now with \nrespect to the Federal Communications Commission, after, say, two or \nthree hearings, some antitrust lawyer gives out a release, saying, \n``Well, we are concerned about the XYZ communications company getting \ninto this section 2 of the Antitrust Division,'' it will stop. Boom. It \ngoes right straight on down because you have the criminal department of \nthe Justice Department, the law enforcement department, it is not \nregulatory, the public is confused, the market is confused, the \nCongress is confused. It is a bad, bad amendment. And let us not talk \nabout where the expertise is.\n  I want to relate to the function now of the Federal Communications \nCommission. The Federal Communications Commission for year on end was \nto maintain a monopoly. They were there to protect AT and its \nmonopolistic Bell companies. Today, we are supposed to protect the \nRBOC's in a general sense. That has been the primary function in the \nFederal Communications Commission. But getting in the 1960's, due to \nthe pressure of Congress, the market and the evolving technology, in \n1969 the Federal Communications Commission separated out the equipment \nfrom services somewhat as was later done with the modified final \njudgment in AT We began to sort of measure competition and market \nforces.\n  Then in 1971, the Federal Communications Commission allowed \ncompetition for long distance services. Then in 1980, for the computer \nindustry to get in, they provided competition for information services. \nThat is the computer services and information. Then in 1990, the \nFederal Communications Commission approved video dial tone in \ncompetition for the cable companies, which, in short, allowed the \ntelephone companies to get into the cable business.\n  Most recently, last week--I will get that decision because we have it \nall lined out here--I think this is powerfully interesting, the Federal \nCommunications Commission was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia in the case of the Warner Entertainment Co., \npetitioners, versus the Federal Communications Commission.\n  I wish you could read the lawyers. They are talking about lawyers. \nThis is what we are trying to do. Look. They have three pages of \nlawyers in this thing; three, four pages, lawyers upon lawyers upon \nlawyers. I could interest the U.S. Senate no end about the lawyers for \nWarner Entertainment Co., for the Cable Television Association, Inc., \nfor petitioners from the city of Austin and Dayton and King County, WA; \nMiami Valley Cable; Montgomery County, MD; St. Louis, MO, and the \nlawyers for the Cable Telecommunications Co.; Larry Tribe, and \neverybody else for Bell Atlantic, and on and on.\n  You talk about not getting lawyers in the Justice Department. There \nare lawyers coming out of my ears in one decision. Guess what the court \nsaid in this decision.\n\n       With respect to rate regulation, Congress determined that \n     local governments should be permitted to regulate only the \n     basic service rates of those cable systems that are not \n     subject to effective competition.\n\n  Yes. Measuring market forces, measuring market competition. You have \nheard all afternoon, ``Wait a minute now. The Department of Justice is \nthe expert on measuring market competition. The FCC over here is with \nmegahertz, some kind of radio technicians and TV aerial boys. They do \nnot know anything about marketing competition.'' That is absolute \nnonsense.\n  Here is the most recent decision on measuring market competition \nsaying that they did an outstanding job. The Federal Communications \nCommission struck an appropriate balance between the competing \ninterests of the cable companies and their subscribers in violation \nneither of the 1992 Cable Act nor of the Administrative Procedures Act.\n It is listed as one of the FCC's most significant legal victories \nbecause it is stated here--and it is the best wording I thought--that \nnot only the Government--I will have to read that part. I wanted to \nrefer to it. But they did an outstanding job in substance, take my \nword, and we will put the decision in the Record.\n\n  The Federal Communications Commission did an outstanding job in \nmeasuring competition--that is everybody in the world about measuring \nmarket competition.\n  I think it is highly significant that we do not start dividing the \nroles in your mind. The role of the Justice Department and the \nAntitrust Division is law enforcement, antitrust law enforcement, under \n2 of Sherman, civil and criminal, civil and criminal penalties. I can \ntell you here and now that is the fundamental basis of the modified \nfinal judgment. That is untouched by S. 652.\n  What is suggested by the amendment is that we want to start \nsuperimposing a whole new series of hearings. About the time you think \nyou can get through the FCC, here is the Congress that has come to town \nand said we are going to reregulate, we are going to let market forces \noperate but, oh, by the way, we are going to put the law enforcement \ninto the regulatory and have two regulatory bodies. Here we are getting \nrid of the ICC because other than railroad mergers it has become \nderegulated--and the trucking industry. Here we have done away in a \ngeneral sense with the Civil Aeronautics Board. Mergers, that is under \nthe Justice Department, but under regular routes and approvals and \ngates and slots and safety we have the Department of Transportation and \nthe Federal Aviation Administration. In communications, we have the \nFederal Communications Commission and they have talent coming out of \ntheir ears over there on measuring market competition.\n  So the section 7 of Clayton under the Thurmond amendment of trying to \ndetermine substantially lessening competition is another market measure \nthat the FCC has to make. That is why we wrote this bill this way. We \nare trying to get market competition. And we certainly do not want \nanother division of government coming in. At one time they had it \nwritten so you had the Federal Trade Commission because under section 7 \nof Clayton you have both the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice \nDepartment.\n  And for a while, reading this thing, they had the Federal Trade \nCommission, the Justice Department, and the Federal Communications \nCommission, and then refer it to Congress and let them have a hearing \nand the Congress will say let us get a commission and study like we \nhave done with Medicare. Come on.\n  Let us kill this amendment here once and for all and do not act like \nit is anything other than what it is. We have not affected the \nfundamental responsibility and authority of the Department of Justice. \nThe amendment is a [[Page S8156]] jerry-built amendment of two \ninterested Senators trying to get the Judiciary Committee on the Senate \nand House side with a say-so. They had a similar move over there. They \nhave not reconciled it over on the House side. But it is bureaucracy at \nits worst. That is why you cannot come to the Government and you need a \nSenator to go through and lead you through here and lead you through \nthere and everything else of that kind. Let us just get the one place, \nthe one-stop shopping and say come in and here is what you have to \nprove and here is the entity that has the expertise and they will have \nit. And we will have the money for them. They made 7 billion bucks the \nother day in an auction so we have plenty of money at the Federal \nCommunications Commission to do this unbundling, dial parity, \nnonportability, interconnection, public interest standard, measuring \nmarket forces and its competitive nature.\n  We have all that and let us put it in one place. Let the lawyers get \nthis in one place. Let them get a formative decision. And if at any \ntime the Justice Department finds, as they did against AT in the \n1970's, and they started in and they went with the antitrust procedures \nand everything else of that kind on law enforcement enforcing the \nantitrust laws, fine business.\n  I admire the Justice Department, particularly the Antitrust Division, \nparticularly Assistant Attorney General, Ms. Bingaman, who has been in \ncharge. She has done wonderful things with Microsoft and many of the \nother cases, and she has plenty of work to do without adding more on \nnow to have another regulatory commission or body resolved into the \nAntitrust Division of the Department of Justice and come in, walking \ndown the same street, measuring market forces and everything else. \nThere is no separation, as they say, where we have the technology and \nthe technicians and the experts with respect to megahertz and TV towers \nand radio frequencies and all of these other things, whereas they \nmeasure the market.\n  On the contrary, the FCC has not only measured the market but \nmeasured it most successfully according to the circuit court of appeals \njust last week. I think we ought not to come in particularly with this \nphrase in here, where here we have the FCC with responsibility and they \ncome in with the phrase that is devastating. It says here--people do \nnot study these amendments that you have to read.\n  Look at that amendment. I hope they can get a picture of that thing. \nYou need a civil engineer and a compass, not just a lawyer. But it says \nhere:\n\n       In making its determination whether the requested \n     authorization is consistent with the public interest, \n     convenience and necessity, the Federal Communications \n     Commission shall not consider the antitrust effects of such \n     authorization in any market for which authorization . . .\n\n  Well, the antitrust affects all within the marketing measurements \nthat we have in here with the unbundling and the checklist and \neverything else, plus the public interest. So how in the world can they \ndo half a haircut at one department and another half a haircut at \nanother department and call this good law? It is a terrible amendment \nand it ought to be killed.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment.\n  I recommend that my colleagues in the Senate carefully consider the \nimplications of this effort to grant an unprecedented role to the \nDepartment of Justice. I happen to have the privilege of serving in the \nU.S. Senate now, but I once had the responsibility of being attorney \ngeneral for the State of Missouri. I hope that my comments as an \nenforcement officer of an antitrust unit carry extra weight as we \nexamine these very important issues.\n  We have heard the word ``power'' used often in this debate. On \nThursday morning in summarizing this bill, S. 652, one Senator said, \n``It is about power, Mr. President, power to do what they want to do.''\n  I see it differently, Mr. President. Let us make no mistake about it, \nthis bill is about change. This is a bill which allows us to look at \nthe future and embrace it. This bill will allow us to look at the \ntechnology and opportunity and creativity of the future and take \nadvantage of it. This amendment is about power, and this amendment \nwould layer bureaucracies in the face of change.\n  Those individuals who want to set another layer of bureaucracy on the \ncommunications industry and upon the technology, creativity and \ninnovation, those who would sponsor this kind of an amendment that \nwould place lawyer after lawyer of the Justice Department in this mix, \nare individuals who have gone to the precipice of the future. They have \nlooked into the future, and they are running back in fear, running for \nthe old ways of saying that we need Government to protect us from the \nsystem of competition.\n  The truth of the matter is, nothing could be further from the truth. \nFor what we have seen not only in the cellular area, where we have had \ncompetition, but in the long distance area, where we have had \nincreasing competition, is that we do not need protection from the \ncompetition. Certainly not multiple governmental bureaucracy \nprotection. We need to let competition help us to have the lower rates \nin local telephones which we have found in the long distance area. We \nneed competition to provide for us the benefits, as in the area of \ncellular phones, which competition has been very valuable to us in \nimproving our opportunity for service. So competition is what will help \nus, and competition in the context of regulation under the Federal \nCommunications Commission, but not with the needless layering of \nbureaucratic regulation by the Justice Department.\n  George Gilder is an individual whose name has already been mentioned \nin several of the conversations in the debate, particularly by the \nSenator from Alaska. Before publishing his more recent volumes about \ncomputers, microcosms, and telecosms, Mr. Gilder wrote:\n\n       In every economy, there is one crucial and definitive \n     conflict. This is not the split between capitalists and \n     workers, technocrats and humanists, government and business, \n     liberals and conservatives, or the rich and poor. All of \n     these divisions are partial and distorted reflections of the \n     deeper conflict: The struggle between past and future . . .\n\n  The truth of the matter is, we are confronted again by a struggle \nbetween the past and the future, between the existing configurations of \nindustries and the industries that may someday replace them.\n  Gilder goes on to say:\n\n       It is a conflict between established factories, \n     technologies, formations of capital, and the ventures that \n     may soon make them worthless--ventures that today may not \n     even exist; that today may flicker only as ideas, or tiny \n     companies, or obscure research projects, or fierce but \n     penniless ambitions; that today are unidentifiable and \n     incalculable from above, but which, in time, in a progressing \n     economy, must rise up if growth is to occur.\n\n  I believe that is the division we see today. It is the division \nbetween those who want to protect us from the future and from those who \nwant to capitalize on the future. It is a division that divides the \npeople who want to embrace the past and those who want to accelerate \nthe future to bring the benefits of the communication age to the \nAmerican people and to protect the capacity of the American worker to \ncontinue to provide the very best, the foremost, the cutting edge of \ncommunications technology to the technology industry worldwide.\n  Mr. President, George Gilder wrote in 1981 about the division of the \npast and the future, but I believe we are unlikely to find any better \nexplanation for the intense activities surrounding this bill. Both in \nCommerce Committee sessions and on the floor, one Senator after another \nhas testified to the extraordinary attention given this single piece of \nlegislation. Most Senators imply what the Senator from Arizona said in \nhis opening remarks last week that never before has there been such \nintense and continued and high-priced lobbying. I imagine that the two \nmanagers must have felt the urge last Wednesday evening to stand up and \nsay, ``Mr. President, I rise to bring S. 652 kicking and screaming to \nthe floor of the Senate.''\n  These two Senators, along with other senior Senators on the Commerce \nCommittee, have fought the telecommunications battles longer than I \nhave even been aware of them, and the counsel of experience rings \nthrough their testimony. This is no ordinary bill. The stakes are \nhigher than any of us can [[Page S8157]] quantify. This bill is \nfundamentally about change. As Mr. Gilder told us 15 years ago, change \nis always the definitive conflict.\n  So, Mr. President, with these thoughts in mind, I want to focus on \nthe amendment we are now considering, the compromise between Senator \nDorgan of North Dakota and Senator Thurmond of South Carolina. Unlike \nthe bill in general, this amendment is not about change in our world, \nbut about power in our Government. It is about the power to choose the \nwinners and the losers in our economy, to stand above the marketplace \nand to play gatekeeper.\n  I think it is important for us to resist that temptation, to resist \nthe idea that Government should somehow choose the winners, choose the \nlosers; that the pollution of politics would possibly infect those who \nwould succeed and those who would fail. Let us have a level playing \nfield, let us have a clear competition, let us let the marketplace make \nthose decisions.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to stand between the marketplace and \nthe people. It is to play gatekeeper. The purpose of the amendment is \nto hand to the U.S. Department of Justice unprecedented power in \nshaping the future of the telecommunications of America. This is not a \nlight matter. This is not a matter of no consequence. This is an \nunprecedented power that Congress has never before granted to anyone.\n  Supporters of this amendment have been asked to give us a precedent \nfor their proposal, but they have not provided one. As we have learned \nfrom the debate last week, the precedent is not to be found in the MFJ \ndecree. Justice only has an advisory role in the court action of Judge \nGreene, the same role that is reserved and preserved in this bill in \nits current form.\n  It is not in our best interest to elevate or escalate that role. I \nwill not get into the entire argument here; however, it is worth \nmentioning that a very insightful colloquy took place on this floor \nlast Thursday night. I encourage all Senators to read the outstanding \narguments presented by the two managers, the Senator from South Dakota \nand the Senator from South Carolina. This issue should have been put to \nrest that evening. But proponents of the amendment press ahead, \nignoring the experience of those Senators most able to judge whether or \nnot balance has been reached in this bill.\n  Senator Hollings stood up and admitted he is a good witness to settle \nthis case. I wish the other Senators would accept this.\n  I do wish to briefly comment on a specific argument that was \nsuggested Thursday night that handing the Justice Department \nunprecedented authority is somehow justified because we are passing \nunprecedented legislation. Throughout this debate, that particular \nargument has been advanced by a Senator, and that Senator has advised \nthis body to proceed with caution on such a monumental piece of \nlegislation. We should instead have caution before putting the Justice \nDepartment and its lawyers into a historic role of replacing Congress \nas the Nation's policymaker.\n  The transition from monopoly to competition requires great care. \nIndeed, it requires clearly defined parameters. For this reason, we \nhave developed a substantial checklist. It is in the legislation. It is \nhere in specific detail. The checklist requires safeguards, so we put \nsafeguards into the bill. Some have suggested that it requires \nexperienced counsel, so we provide for an advisory role by the \nantitrust experts at the Department of Justice.\n  Let me emphasize this final point about the advisory role. We provide \nfor an advisory role by antitrust experts, as the Department of \nJustice. Contrast this to what the others are saying. Some Senators \nbelieve that the lawyers at the Justice Department are the only experts \nin competition in this country. I quote from a statement made last \nWednesday evening.\n\n       Lawyers from the Justice Department understand competition. \n     The Antitrust Division of DOJ understands where and when \n     competition is, and they are about the only ones in this town \n     that, at least by my measurement, are out there fighting to \n     make sure the marketplace is in fact working.\n\n  That argument was made on the floor of this Senate. Mr. President, I \nfind this statement hard to believe. If the Justice Department is the \nonly entity in this town, or in America, that is fighting to make sure \nthat the marketplace really works, why do we not hand over \nmicromanagement of the entire economy to them? You could extend the \nlogic of this amendment from the telecommunications industry--it is an \nimportant industry--if you have to have the Justice Department \nmicromanaging that part of Government, why not apply it to all other \ncommercial industries? Why not start with all of the other departments \nwithin the Antitrust Division--transportation, energy, agriculture, \ncomputers, finance, foreign commerce, professions, intellectual \nproperty--take the professions divisions. Do we hear the call from \nCongress to regulate lawyers from entering different types of practice? \nCan you imagine the uproar if Congress proposed to have the Department \nof Justice determine when each law firm could practice different types \nof law? Well, we do not have to imagine what they are proposing here. \nWhat they propose is to single out the most dynamic economic sector of \nthe American economy, the sector undergoing the most rapid and dramatic \nchange, the sector in which we have perhaps the most dramatic \ncompetitive advantage in a marketplace--a productive competitive \nmarketplace, the world marketplace--and they want to add the ingredient \nof governmental cement to the process. We do not need to freeze and to \nrepress the developments in our industry, we need to energize them, and \nhaving the Federal Communications Commission there is enough \nregulation, particularly when you have the Justice Department with its \nability to be advice givers in antitrust.\n  Then we are told that we should not fear more governmental \ninvolvement in the private sector. This is not some ``big \nbureaucracy,'' one Senator said. They only have 800 lawyers over there \nat the Antitrust Division. Imagine that, Mr. President. We are trying \nto convince the American people that a group of 800 Government \nattorneys are going to be helpful in providing productivity and \ncompetitiveness for our telecommunications industry. In fact, we tell \nthe people that if these 800 lawyers do not help us by picking the \neconomic winners and losers, then the fastest growing industry will \nfail and rain unknown harm on American consumers.\n  Well, let us consider, stop and take a look at some of the decisions \nwe have made in this bill that were influenced by the present policies \nof those 800 lawyers at the Department of Justice. Let us see if their \npast performance leaves us with nothing to worry about. Take the GTE \nconsent decree. In 1982, GTE purchased a company called Sprint. The \nDepartment thought that these two companies getting together providing \nlocal and long distance services could be dangerous to competition, so \nthey said that GTE, before the acquisition of Sprint could take place, \nwould have to agree to a consent decree, with which the company \ncomplied. With that consent decree, 10 years later, in place, GTE had \ndisposed of all the Sprint assets, and had divested itself of the \nentire acquisition. But the Justice Department refused to lift the \ndecree.\n  By 1992, GTE was essentially the same company that had existed before \nit had purchased Sprint when it had operated without the oversight of \nthe Justice Department and its army of lawyers. But was the Justice \nDepartment willing to relinquish its control over a private business \nonce the bureaucracy had worked its fingers into the situation? \nObviously not.\n  The Justice Department would not lift the decree, and has not lifted \nthe decree to this very day, in spite of the fact that the acquisition \nof Sprint was the reason for the decree, and the divestiture of Sprint \nhappened years ago. And GTE has returned to the kind of company it was \nprior to the acquisition. This issue of Sprint was a high priority for \nme during the course of drafting this bill. If Justice was not prepared \nto act properly on this matter, then I felt Congress should not \nreassert the authority of the Justice Department. I am happy to say \nthat having passed the majority leader's deregulation amendment last \nweek, the Senate has finally removed GTE from the micromanaging \ninfluences of the Department of Justice. [[Page S8158]] \n  Please note, Mr. President, that the GTE consent decree was lifted by \nCongress--or will be lifted by Congress, not by 800 of the so-called I-\nam-here-to-help-you friendly lawyers at the Justice Department.\n  In a case similar to the GTE case, a company called AirTouch has been \nrelieved of its restrictions by this bill. This was a cellular carrier, \nonce a subsidiary of PacTel. It has been an independent, publicly \ntraded company since April 1994. Again, Justice would not remove the \nMFJ restrictions that were reserved for Bell companies. Again, Congress \nlifts the restrictions in this bill.\n  It might be interesting to add here that after AirTouch submitted an \nopinion at Justice stating its position that it was no longer bound by \nthe MFJ, a competitor in the long distance market filed a letter \nopposing MFJ relief for the cellular carrier. We cannot say for certain \nwhether pressure from a long distance carrier played any role in the \ninaction of Justice--their failure to relieve AirTouch of the \nrestrictions. We can say for certain that this is the exact type of \nlegal and political pressure that will be finding its way into an \ninhibition of the productivity and competitiveness of the \ntelecommunications industry if we layer bureaucracy upon bureaucracy, \nintermeddling, and seeking to micromanage what the marketplace can \nproperly regulate. We can say for certain that we do not want this type \nof legal and political pressure, which would be intensified to a degree \nbeyond comprehension if Justice is put in the position of deciding MFJ \nrelief for all Bell companies.\n  I am not saying, by any means, that 800 friendly lawyers at Justice \ndo not know what they are doing. I am sure that they are experts in \nantitrust matters. Again, this amendment does not ask them to \ninvestigate antitrust. It authorizes them to implement congressional \npolicy.\n  The question is whether this is the proper role of Justice. I think \nthe answer is clear, and I think the answer is resounding. I think the \nanswer is simple. I think it is time for the Congress to make that \nanswer unmistakable. The answer is no. Let Justice continue its role as \na prosecutor of the Sherman and Clayton Acts.\n  Let us consider another example in the cellular phone industry. As we \nall know, several years ago in every city and town, two licenses were \ngranted for providers of cellular phone service. In each of the seven \nBell service areas, the incumbent Bell company was granted one of the \ntwo licenses. But the playing field was not even. One of the great \nadvantages of cellular is its independence of the traditional landline \nand wire infrastructure. Cellular operators are not subject to the \nlimitation of the LATA boundaries. They are, by definition, mobile \nphone systems. This allows some cellular companies to offer creative \nprice discounts to their customers. I say some companies are allowed to \noffer these creative price discounts, because others are not. In each \nservice area, some carriers can offer customers one price for all \ncalls, whether they are local or long distance.\n Some carriers cannot. The law says so.\n\n  The Department did not act to change this policy. A combination of \ncourt decisions and the Department's inaction has left Bell cellular \naffiliates unnecessarily restricted to its wireline boundaries, while \nnon-Bell competitors enjoy the complete benefits and flexibility that \nthe wireless world presents.\n  In fact, an interesting case developed that led to an incredible \nsituation in Arizona. The non-Bell cellular carrier could offer the \nentire State in Arizona as a local call. The Bell affiliate could not, \nbound by the rules that govern wire transmissions. When the non-Bell \noperator sold its license to another Bell affiliate, that Bell \naffiliate, having purchased the cellular company, could no longer offer \nthe entire State as a local call. Even though it was not even operating \nas a cellular carrier in its own landline region, the Bell affiliate \noperating in another part of the country had to respond to criterion \nthat governed, according to the Department, its own operation in the \narea of the landline.\n  So on one day, the cellular customer in Flagstaff could call Tucson \nfor the price of a local call. Because the company that he was using \nwas bought by a Bell company, the next day they were charged long \ndistance rates.\n  Now, the customers in Arizona were denied substantial savings because \nof the Department policy. It is that simple. That kind of officious \nintermeddling, micromanagement is counterproductive, distorting \ncompetition rather than promoting competition, and costs consumers \nbenefits.\n  The Department did not move aggressively to end this disparity. It is \nstill undecided now on how to proceed.\n  Making the decision is one of the tough things. The marketplace makes \ndecisions efficiently and effectively. I believe competition also \nrewards those who make the right decision in the marketplace.\n  The Department is not the group which, in the words of one Senator \n``is out there fighting to make sure that the marketplace really \nworks'' in that sense. The Department in Arizona and other cases like \nwe just mentioned really stood between the benefits and the marketplace \nand the consumer. The Department denied Americans the opportunity to \nbenefit from competition that we all believe brings out the best in \neach of us and the best in industry.\n  Mr. President, once again, Congress must act to correct this \nsenseless policy. Parity had to be reinstated, and Congress had a \nchoice. Either we lift all restrictions on cellular carriers so that \nthere be a level playing field, allowing cellular phone operators and \nproprietors of cellular companies, saying any call you make is like a \nlocal call. Or we could extend the artificial restrictions to all \ncarriers.\n  Now, the bill that we have here lifts those restrictions. This bill \nlifts all restrictions on the cellular industry and allows the cellular \nprovider to say: Go ahead, make a long distance call for the same price \na local call.\n  Congress acts in its proper role, and the FCC is instructed to \nimplement that policy.\n  Supporters of this bill have expected the delicate balance contained \nin the bill to be severely tested. The first test was on the definition \nof public interest. There are many who think that 14 criteria are \nenough, and that should do it.\n  There was a balance struck in the development of this bill. That \nbalance was that we would protect the public interest by adding a \ndefinition including the public interest.\n  I must admit, Mr. President, I find merit with the arguments of the \nSenator from Arizona, [Mr. McCain], among the cosponsors of the \namendment that sought to take that public interest out of the bill.\n  I am uncomfortable with the breadth of the term ``public interest,'' \nand I would otherwise prefer that we leave as little room for \nsubjective analysis as possible; that the Congress, representatives of \nthe people, actually specify the policy, and that policy be carried out \nby the FCC.\n  But the managers called for a balance and they vowed to defend the \nbalance. They are to be commended for defending that balance. I cannot \nthink of two Senators who would better understand this matter than the \ntwo Senators who bring this bill to the floor. They may have brought it \nhere kicking and screaming. This has been a hard bill to put together. \nThey deserve our support in maintaining this balance.\n  This amendment is one of the most serious assaults on the bill's \nbalance. A vote in favor of this amendment would not only destroy the \nbalance of the bill, it would destroy the reason for having the bill, \nand that is to promote more competition and to extricate from this \narena the heavy hand of Government.\n  The idea that when we look into the face of the future, we are so \ngripped with fear, we not only have to have regulation, but we have to \nhave layered regulation, is an idea that we need to reject.\n  Let me leave a few final observations. The committee has heard from \nover 30 entities with a direct involvement in this legislation. Senator \nHollings, to his credit, went through the entire list last week.\n  Sure, it involved some big companies engaged in big battles. We even \nhave present monopolies battling against former monopolies. The Baby \nBells are battling against AT, Mama Bell.\n  But the American people know who has the biggest monopoly of all. The \nbiggest monopoly of all is the monopoly of Government. The biggest \nbattle [[Page S8159]] of this bill is not between the Baby Bells and \nMama Bell, and the long distance companies and the local exchange \ncarriers; the biggest battle is found right here in this amendment. It \nis between the Congress and the Department. It is a battle over who \nsets policy in this country.\n  I received a copy of a letter sent to Chairman Pressler by Henry \nGeller, former communications policy advisor under President Reagan, \nwho also happened to testify at one of the committee hearings. If the \nchairman has not already done so, and if the Senator from South Dakota \ndoes not mind, I would like to submit the entire letter for the Record. \nI ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Henry Geller, Communications\n                                Fellow, The Markle Foundation,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 1995.\n     Senator Larry Pressler,\n     Chairman, Senate Commerce Committee, Russell Senate Office \n         Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Mr. Chairman: We are disinterested parties who have \n     participated in the legislative process leading to S. 652. We \n     address here the question of the appropriate role for the \n     Department of Justice on the issue of entry by the divested \n     Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) into the interexchange (IX) \n     long distance and manufacturing markets. We urge that it \n     would be an inappropriate and seriously flawed process to \n     give Justice a decisional role.\n       The Department and the antitrust court were necessary to \n     effect the break-up of AT But that court, using the \n     Department as its ``staff'', is now engaged in essentially \n     regulatory activity--namely, the terms and timing of full \n     entry by the BOCs into all sectors of telecommunications. The \n     FCC, as the expert agency with centralized authority in the \n     telecom sphere, is engaged in the same area, but under an \n     antiquated law.\n       A main thrust of the pending legislative effort is to \n     remove the antitrust court from the regulatory policy making \n     process and to have the important policy guidelines set by \n     the Congress and implemented by the established Congressional \n     delegatees in this field, the FCC and the State commissions \n     (with the FCC steering and the States rowing). That is the \n     sound approach of S. 652.\n       Justice, however, argues strongly that it should continue \n     to have a decisional role on the two remaining MFJ issues--IX \n     and manufacturing--and should apply an antitrust standard to \n     these issues. But that makes no sense at all. If these \n     matters are to be settled under antitrust law, there is no \n     reason to remove the antitrust court or the appellate court--\n     to, in effect, leave the ``staff'' as the decisional point in \n     the antitrust field. The whole point of the legislative \n     exercise is to end the antitrust chapter and in its place to \n     substitute Congressional guidelines implemented by the \n     traditional regulatory scheme. Stated differently, with the \n     antitrust court removed, what is left is a regulatory scheme. \n     Justice's role is to prosecute antitrust cases--not to be a \n     regulatory agency duplicating the FCC, so that there will now \n     be two regulatory agencies.\n       This is not a new position for us. In a 1989 Report to the \n     Benton Foundation on the Federal regulatory structure for \n     telecom, the same analysis and conclusion--that this is a \n     ``cockamamie policy arrangement''--are set out in the context \n     of the then contentious issue of BOC entry into the \n     information services. The pertinent discussion is attached as \n     an appendix. We particularly recommend perusal of the 1988 \n     statement of Assistant Attorney General Charles Rule, who was \n     then in charge of the Antitrust Division in the Reagan \n     Administration.\n       The Department asserts that it has developed considerable \n     expertise on the issues involved. Of course it has. It can \n     fully bring that expertise to bear in submissions to the FCC. \n     As a party respondent in any appeal from an FCC decision, it \n     can make known its position to the appellate court (and \n     indeed it can appeal in its own right). It can participate \n     fully in any oversight proceedings of the Congress. Finally, \n     it continues to have broad authority under the antitrust laws \n     to prosecute anti-competitive conduct that it regards as \n     violative of those laws.\n       The Department's expertise is thus not lost at all. What is \n     to be avoided is for the Congress to establish two regulatory \n     agencies at the Federal level to deal with the regulatory \n     problems of BOC entry into the IX manufacturing fields. Such \n     duplication constitutes bureaucratic layering that the \n     Congress and indeed, the Administration should avoid.\n       The Administration, perhaps unconsciously, may be motivated \n     by what is a common phenomenon in this town--protection of \n     ``turf.'' There is no question as to what is motivating the \n     opposition of private opponents of BOC entry. The more hoops \n     the BOCs have to jump through--the more decisional hurdles \n     for them, the more chance there is of delaying their entry \n     and thus delaying having to face their competition. We do not \n     blame the opponents for this effort: As the late Senator \n     Magnuson wisely said, ``All each industry seeks is a fair \n     advantage over its rivals.''\n       But if the Administration for reasons of ``turf'' has lost \n     its way, it is all the more reason for Congress to adhere to \n     sound process. We hope, therefore, that S. 652 follows the \n     appropriate procedure now set forth in the bill.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views on this \n     important issue.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                      Henry Geller\n                                           (For Barbara O'Connor).\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I would like to share the key point expressed:\n\n       A main thrust of the pending legislative effort is to \n     remove the antitrust court from the regulatory policymaking \n     process and to have important policy guidelines set by the \n     Congress and implemented by the established congressional \n     delegates in this field, the FCC and the State commissions. . \n     . . That is the sound approach of S. 652.\n\n  In closing, what is the role of Congress, if not to set policy? Mr. \nGeller goes on to ask the same question I asked today. He put it this \nway:\n\n       If these matters are to be settled under antitrust law, \n     then why are we passing this legislation? One Senator keeps \n     mentioning the length of this bill. Well, we could reduce \n     these 140 pages down to one simple paragraph and let the \n     Justice Department take over from there. But that is not what \n     we want to do, nor is that what we ought to do. That is not \n     to be the case because the role of Justice is to prosecute \n     cases, not to manage or micromanage industry. Congress has \n     the role of setting national policy. These two roles are \n     fundamentally different, and I know which one I expect to \n     fulfill on behalf of the people of Missouri. I will not vote \n     to transfer policymaking to the Department of Justice, and I \n     encourage the Senate to reject this amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, in closing, I offer an observation: We are debating \nfundamental differences in attitudes. Some Senators say the competition \nis not the best regulator. I say the American people are the best \nregulator. Some Senators have looked into the future and they recoil in \nfear. They argue that the American people are afraid of the future, \nthat they are begging for Government to protect them from the unknown.\n  I have more faith in the American people. That faith springs from my \nbelief that the enterprising spirit of our people will reap \nimmeasurable benefits in our country, especially in this exciting \nindustry.\n  We do not wait for a busload of citizens to march into our office and \ndemand this bill. We should pass this bill because Congress must also \nlet the people have the benefits of the 21st century. We should pass \nthis bill because this bill will provide a basis for our \ncompetitiveness and productivity, and the growth of this industry is \nvital to our future, and the benefits will go to every citizen in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. Dole addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have been discussing the situation with \nthe Senator from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey. As I understand it, he would \nbe willing--I do not want to cut anybody off. This is an important \namendment, as I said on Thursday and again on Friday. If we could agree \nthat we could take up other amendments and then move to table the \nKerrey amendment, say at noon tomorrow, would that be satisfactory to \nthe Senator from Nebraska?\n  Mr. KERREY. That would be satisfactory. I have no objection to that. \nIt is the Dorgan-Thurmond amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Dorgan-Thurmond, excuse me. I know the Senator from \nNebraska has an interest in it. I would have to check with both Senator \nDorgan and Senator Thurmond to see if we could get that agreement so at \nnoon the Senator from South Dakota, Senator Pressler, could move to \ntable. That would satisfy the Senator from Nebraska.\n  I think Senator Bumpers is prepared to come to the floor to offer an \namendment and maybe Senator Leahy. I am advised that may be an \namendment that would take a considerable amount of time.\n  As I look at the list of amendments, there are 24 amendments that are \npending. Maybe there are some that will be accepted. I only see one \nhere noted that would be accepted.\n  That would indicate we still have a number of amendments to deal with \nin addition to the major amendment offered by Senators Dorgan and \nThurmond. I hope we could complete action on this bill tomorrow evening \nso we could start on welfare reform on Wednesday.\n  I know the managers are prepared. I have just been advised by the \nchairman [[Page S8160]] of the committee he is prepared to stay here \nall night if necessary. So I urge my colleagues on both sides, I looked \ndown the list. There are Democrats and Republicans who have amendments. \nWe are open for business. We will have votes this evening. I think most \neverybody has been able to return from their States, and I hope we can \ndispose of some of these amendments tonight.\n  I notice an amendment by Senators Exon, Leahy, and Coats, a \nbipartisan amendment. I do not know what it is; something on pay \nphones, foreign ownership, red lining, burglar alarm. Senator Leahy has \nanother amendment. Senator Feinstein has three amendments.\n  So there are a number of amendments on each side. If I could just ask \nmy colleagues to cooperate with both Senator Hollings and Senator \nPress- ler.\n  As soon as we get clearance, then, I will ask consent that at noon \ntomorrow the Senator from South Dakota be recognized to table the \nDorgan-Thurmond amendment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I know the Senator from Montana is on the floor, and I \nwill be here for a while longer. I just want to respond. There were \nactually three speakers previously who opposed this amendment and said \nmany things. The distinguished Senator from Missouri did not cite me by \nname, but he quoted me generously during his own presentation, and \nevery quote he opposed.\n  Let me begin. One of the strongest arguments the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri and others have made is that you cannot trust the \nDepartment of Justice. You should not involve them with this. They do \nnot have a role.\n  I, last week, made a mistake in assessing the Department of Justice. \nI said they have approximately 800 lawyers because I was informed that \nin 1982, when the consent decree was filed, that is approximately how \nmany people were down there. That is true, 860 --about 800 actually, in \n1982. But today there are 323 lawyers and 686 total employees, total \nstaff at the Antitrust Division at the Department of Justice. It is a \nvery small agency.\n  This bill is about power. I do not walk, as the Senator from Missouri \nimplied, to the precipice of change and be afraid of change. I am not \nafraid of this bill other than what it might do if we do not have the \nagency that has not only current responsibility but experience in \nmanaging what this bill describes we are going to do. This bill says we \nare going to move from a monopoly to a competitive environment. That is \nwhat it attempts to do. We are going to move from a monopoly in local \ntelephone service in a market--no free market down there, folks. This \nis not a little mom and pop shop that started in business 10 years ago \nnow with local telephone service. They were given a monopoly franchise.\n  If the people of the United States of America are trying to figure \nout who do I trust in this deal, it was not the peoples' Congress in \n1982 that busted up the monopoly, that gave them a competitive \nenvironment in long distance, that managed that transition from \nmonopoly to competition that is cited over and over and over by people \nwho come down here to the floor. It was not the U.S. Congress. It was \nthe Justice Department. A Reagan appointee goes to the court and files \na consent decree with AT, and that is what this is all about.\n  To set this thing up as ``you are either for the devil or for the \nangels'' sort of an argument does not, it seems to me, lead to a very \nconstructive argument. The question really is how are we going to \nmanage this? How are we going to manage this transition now? We have \ndecided. There is very little argument. I do not think there is a \nsingle Member of this body, maybe there is, maybe there is somebody who \nbelieves we ought to preserve the monopoly at the local level. I do \nnot. The Senator from Missouri acts like that is the argument here: \nChoose the market or choose a regulatory environment. Have the \nGovernment tell you what to do or let the market tell you. That is \nnonsense, baloney. That is not the argument here. That is not the \nquestion that needs to be answered.\n  If you believe you want to preserve the local monopoly and keep it \nthe way it is, fine. I do not hear anybody or have not heard anybody \nyet argue that is what ought to occur. I caution Members that when we \nmove from that monopoly to a competitive environment, there is going to \nbe trauma, there is going to be real trauma, and we better make sure we \nget this thing right because it is not the demand for change we are \ntalking about here and that I am an advocate for. The demand for change \nis not coming from townhall meetings. It is not coming from citizens in \nMissouri or citizens in Nebraska or citizens in Ohio who are saying, \n``I am unhappy with local telephone service, I am unhappy with my cable \nservice, I am unhappy with broadcast, except for some of the things \nhaving been raised having to do with obscenity and violence and that \nsort of thing.'' That does come from town hall meetings. But as far as, \n``Do I want a monopoly or do I want to deregulate?'' That is hardly a \ndebate going on out there on Main Street.\n  We have made a reasoned judgment based upon input from a variety of \ndifferent people that we can go to a competitive marketplace in local \nservice. These arguments have a way of turning it around every now and \nthen. In 1986, a couple of years after the consent decree was fully in \nplace and the divestiture had occurred, I supported legislation in the \nNebraska Legislature to deregulate the telephone companies on the \nquestion of pricing. I tried to get them to change the law. The \nlegislature changed the law to allow competition at the local level and \nwas told--indeed I was rolled at the time, not told--I was told and \nrolled we were not going to do that. Technology would not allow \ncompetition. That was the argument in 1986. So I lost that battle.\n  We deregulated on price but we did not deregulate to produce a \ncompetitive environment because we were told the technology would not \nallow it. And lest anybody think I have walked to the precipice and am \nfearful of embracing change, as was suggested earlier, in 1986 I asked \nand was given the authority to be the lead Governor for \ntelecommunications for the National Governors' Association. We reached \na conclusion--I had a little task force --that we ought to, in an \nexpeditious fashion, eliminate the restrictions that were currently in \nplace in the modified final judgment. I thought we had the votes. It \nwas one of those deals where you were sure you had all the votes, did \nall the calling and everything. We had a meeting, annual meeting, in \nSouth Carolina in 1986. I was sure I had that thing won. That year I \ngot rolled by AT They came to that deal and said: Oh, no, if you \nloosen the restrictions and you have competition, all these things--\nthey did, like many of the speakers have said--here are the horrible, \nterrible things that are going to happen. Here are all the bad. Jobs \nare going to go down the toilet, things are going to explode and be \nbad. And we lost. We got rolled in 1986 trying to change that policy.\n  So I understand that there is a lot of active interest in whether or \nnot the Department of Justice should have a role. Earlier, the Senator \nfrom Missouri said, ``I am a former Attorney General and I have \nexperience doing this.'' And he said ``I hope I am listened to.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a letter from 24 State \nattorneys general be printed as part of the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               State of Wisconsin,\n\n\n                                        Department of Justice,\n\n                                        Madison, WI, June 2, 1995.\n       Dear Member of Congress/Senate: The undersigned state \n     attorneys general would like to address several \n     telecommunications deregulation bills that are now pending in \n     Congress. One of the objectives in any such legislation must \n     be the promotion of deregulation that fosters competition \n     while at the same time protecting consumers from \n     anticompetitive practices.\n       In our opinion, our citizens will be able to look forward \n     to an advanced, efficient, and innovative information network \n     only if such legislation incorporates basic antitrust \n     principles and recognizes the essential role of the states in \n     ensuring that citizens have universal and affordable access \n     to the telecommunications network. The antitrust laws ensure \n     competition and promote efficiency, innovation, low prices, \n     better management, and greater consumer choice. If \n     telecommunications reform legislation includes a strong \n     commitment to antitrust [[Page S8161]] principles, then the \n     legislation can help preserve existing competition and \n     prevent parties from using market power to tilt the playing \n     field to the detriment of competition and consumers.\n       Each of the bills pending in Congress would lift the court-\n     ordered restrictions that are currently in place on the \n     Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs). After sufficient \n     competition exists in their local service areas, the bills \n     would allow RBOCs to enter the fields of long distance \n     services and equipment manufacturing. These provisions raise \n     a number of antitrust concerns. Therefore, telecommunications \n     deregulation legislation should include the following \n     features:\n       First, the United States Department of Justice should have \n     a meaningful role in determining, in advance, whether \n     competition at the local level is sufficient to allow an RBOC \n     to enter the long distance services and equipment \n     manufacturing markets for a particular region. The Department \n     of Justice has unmatched experience and expertise in \n     evaluating competition in the telecommunications field. Such \n     a role is vital regardless of whether Congress adopts a \n     ``competitive checklist'' or ``modified final judgment \n     safeguard'' approach to evaluating competition in local \n     markets.\n       Second, legislation should continue to prohibit mergers of \n     cable and telephone companies in the same service area. Such \n     a prohibition is essential because local cable companies are \n     the likely competitors of telephone companies. Permitting \n     such mergers raises the possibility of a ``one-wire world,'' \n     with only successful antitrust litigation to prevent it. \n     Congress should narrowly draft any exceptions to this general \n     prohibition.\n       Third, Congress should not preempt the states from ordering \n     1+intraLATA dialing parity in appropriate cases, including \n     cases where the incumbent RBOC has yet to receive permission \n     to enter the interLATA long distance market. With a mere flip \n     of a switch, the RBOCs can immediately offer ``one-stop \n     shopping'' (both local and long distance services). New \n     entrants, however, may take some time before they can offer \n     such services, and only after they incur significant capital \n     expenses will they be able to develop such capabilities.\n       In conclusion, we urge you to support telecommunications \n     reform legislation that incorporates provisions that would \n     maintain an important decision-making role for the Department \n     of Justice; preserve the existing prohibition against mergers \n     of telephone companies and cable television companies located \n     in the same service areas; and protect the states' ability to \n     order 1+intraLATA dialing parity in appropriate cases.\n       Thank you for considering our views.\n           Very truly yours,\n         Tom Udall, Attorney General of New Mexico; Grant Woods, \n           Attorney General of Arizona; James E. Doyle, Attorney \n           General of Wisconsin; Winston Bryant, Attorney General \n           of Arkansas; Richard Blumenthal, Attorney General of \n           Connecticut; Garland Pinkston, Jr., Acting Corporation \n           Counsel of the District of Columbia; Calvin E. \n           Holloway, Sr., Attorney General of Guam; Tom Miller, \n           Attorney General of Iowa; Chris Gorman, Attorney \n           General of Kentucky; M.

McGraw, Jr., Attorney \n           General of West Virginia.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, with some assist from my drugstore eye \nglasses, let me read one paragraph from it. It says, ``The United \nStates Department of Justice should have a meaningful role in \ndetermining, in advance--not after the fact--whether competition at the \nlocal level is sufficient to allow an RBOC to enter the long distance \nservices and equipment manufacturing markets for a particular region.''\n  Understand we are not just talking about the interLATA long distance. \nWe are also talking about removing the restrictions on manufacturing.\n  So the question is, ``Do you have some competition at the local \nlevel?\"\n  If you have it, it will allow you to get into previously restricted \nareas.\n\n       The Department of Justice has unmatched experience and \n     expertise in evaluating competition in the telecommunications \n     field. Such a role is vital regardless of whether Congress \n     adopts a ``competitive checklist'' or ``modified final \n     judgment safeguard'' approach to evaluating competition in \n     local markets.\n\n  Mr. President, I really do not believe this is one of those \namendments that ought to be characterized as a choice between picking \nthe ``dreaded Government regulators who are going to micromanage \neverything in your life'' or choosing the market. But what we are \nattempting to do in good faith is answer the question, ``How do we \nmanage this thing?'' This is an unprecedented change, unprecedented \nthat Congress is going to attempt to manage. We have reached the \ndecision, I believe a majority of us have, that we should use \ncompetition in the local market, competition in manufacturing, \ncompetition in services, competition in switching, not to regulate but \nto determine what is the best service, what is the best piece of \nequipment, what is the best switching offered out there. Let \ncompetition determine that. We have been successful in long distance. \nWe grow confidence based upon success. We can do it at the local level \nand in manufacturing. We are about at the edge of enacting legislation \nto do that.\n  The question before us is, ``Should we give the Department of Justice \nmore than a consultative role?\"\n  I would like to offer a couple of things. Earlier the Senator from \nSouth Dakota I believe had a question having to do with administrative \nlaw with the Department of Justice, a very good question. I will try to \nrestate the question--I do not know if I will get it right--the \nquestion was with the Federal Communications Commission, we have an \nopen process. You have an administrative law that governs hearings and \nso forth. It has to be open. Then the Senator from South Dakota asked--\nat that time it was the Senator from North Dakota on the floor--would \nthe Department of Justice have that same kind of law apply to it? The \namendment specifically inserts on the page that the Senator from South \nDakota referenced on page 89, and it refers to the determination by the \nCommission and the Attorney General. They would issue a written \ndetermination on the record--after hearings and the opportunity for a \ncommitment. So the language that we discussed earlier, I say to the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, does not just refer to the \nCommission. It also refers to the Department of Justice.\n  Second, I say it again for emphasis, we are not talking lawyering or \na new bureaucracy. It is a parallel process. You apply specifically \nwhat one does, and what the other one does. You ask the guy that has \nthe experience. We are trying to figure out. Do we have the competitive \nmarket, perhaps in a perfect fashion? You are looking for the person \nthat got the job done before this, the person you ought to call on in \nthe agency, a very small agency I point out, again to attempt to manage \nthis transition again.\n  Then one of the questions that comes up says, ``Well, we did not do \nthis with airlines, we did not do this with trucking, and we should \nnot, therefore, do this with telecommunications.'' Telecommunications \nis by many people's estimate one-half of the U.S. economy directly or \nindirectly. It is a big part of the economy, probably two or three \ntimes the size of the entire health care industry which was of great \nconcern to us during our debate in 1993-1994. At least that is what has \nbeen represented to me. It leads directly to the manufacturing and the \nproduction of goods and services, or indirectly the information \nindustry is now roughly half the U.S. economy. Not all of these are \nregulated. Many of these are unregulated businesses. We are talking \nabout in any event managing a substantial amount of the U.S. economy; \nthat is to say, not managing it. We are managing from a monopoly \nsituation trying to transfer the control of the decisions away from \nregulators so that the marketplace is making those decisions. The \nreference earlier was that airline and trucking \n[[Page S8162]] would be a good example to use and based upon the \nsuccess of airline and trucking deregulation we should not have a DOJ \nrole.\n  However, Mr. President, I look at a couple of incidents.\n\n       From 1985 to 1989, during the transition from airline \n     regulation to competition, the Department of Transportation \n     (DOT) had the authority to approve airline mergers, subject \n     to advice from DOJ. In 1986, DOT approved two mergers over \n     DOJ's vigorous objections: Northwest Airlines' deal with its \n     main rival in Minneapolis, Republic, and TWA's acquisition of \n     its main competitor in St. Louis, Ozark. DOJ advised DOT that \n     each transaction would sharply reduce competition for air \n     travel into and out of the affected city. DOT rejected this \n     advice, concluding that the deals would not result in a \n     substantial reduction of competition in any market.\n       Unfortunately, DOT--with little expertise in assessing \n     competition--was wrong. Just as DOJ predicted, the \n     transactions resulted in higher air fares and less choice for \n     travelers at the Minneapolis and St. Louis hubs. In fact, a \n     study by the General Accounting Office found that TWA's air \n     fares at St. Louis shot up at two to three times the rate of \n     all other air fares in the wake of the merger.\n       The Department of Transportation now concedes that \n     assigning the job of making competitive assessments to it, \n     instead of DOJ, ``was not a success.''\n\n  Mr. President, we are not talking about an assignment of \nresponsibility here that is heavily bureaucratized. We are talking \nabout a question that we ought to be able to assess, particularly given \nthe fact that I believe it is the case that an awful lot of us are \ngoing to be held accountable for this vote. Those of us who are \nadvocates of deregulation are attempting to answer the question, ``How \ndo we do this in a fashion so that our consumers get the benefit of \nlower prices and higher quality that comes at a competitive \nenvironment?'' We want to make sure that, as you move from a monopoly \nto a competitive environment, the consumers indeed benefit from that \ntransition.\n  DOJ still has the role. It is not enough. DOJ has the role after the \nfact, not prior to the decision being made. The Antitrust Division is \nnot doing the same thing as the FCC. It is not duplication, as has been \nalleged.\n  As to the delays, I can go through that argument. I have gone through \nit once before. If you examine the detail of why there has been delay, \nI think the presentation of the charts going up to the right, in fact, \nfall on their face.\n  The Department of Justice is not asking to be a regulator in this \nthing. I am not coming to the floor because I am concerned about the \nDepartment of Justice. I am not on the Judiciary Committee. I am on the \nAgriculture Committee, the Appropriations Committee, and the \nIntelligence Committee. I am not trying to figure out how to give some \nadditional authority. They are not asking for regulatory authority. \nThey are merely asking, and I think correctly so in this case, for some \nadditional authority as we try to move from a regulated sector at the \nlocal level, at the local loop, and regulated sector in manufacturing \nas well to a competitive environment. If we get it right, we will end \nup being rewarded right along with the consumers with the praise as a \nconsequence.\n  Mr. President, I believe again that the 146 pages that we are about \nto vote on, whatever it is, relatively soon, we will be voting on final \npassage, I presume, is one of the most important pieces of legislation \nthat I have had the opportunity to be a part of in my entire political \ncareer.\n  I really want, as I have done before, to pay tribute to the Senator \nfrom South Dakota and the Senator from South Carolina both who have \npushed on this thing. Leadership in the majority changed in November \n1994. That change did not result in the stopping of this legislation. \nThese two men have worked very, very closely together. They have worked \nto try to come up with a reasonable solution. I think they have made a \ngood-faith effort.\n  I think this amendment improves the legislation. It does not repeal \nthe legislation. It improves the legislation. The risk that we will be \ntaking in giving the Department of Justice this role is relatively \nsmall given the risk of not giving them this role, in my opinion. If it \nturns out that things get slowed down and the wheels of progress start \nto grind, we can always reverse it. We are literally in uncharted \nwaters. To my knowledge this has never been done before with a sector \nof the economy as large as this and which is growing. We are trying to \nfigure out how to go where we have not gone before. This bill does not \nderegulate in a massive fashion.\n It is a structured for the movement from a monopoly situation to a \ncompetitive situation.\n\n  I hope that this amendment can continue to be argued in a \nstraightforward fashion, as the ranking Democrat and the chairman of \nthis committee have thus far. I hope, in fact, that it is adopted. I \nbelieve it will improve the legislation. I believe the compromise \nworked out between the distinguished Senator from North Dakota and the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina, though it lowers the test, \ndoes not remove the strength from the amendment which is to keep the \nDepartment of Justice, the agency that has demonstrated its capacity to \nget the job done, involved in this process.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the pending \nDorgan-Thurmond amendment be laid aside until 12 noon Tuesday and at 12 \nnoon Senator Pressler be recognized to make a motion to table the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Senator from Nebraska. I think this will work. \nHe may want to reserve some of that time before noon for final \nargument, maybe from 11 to 12 to be equally divided between--so you \nwould have 1 hour of debate before the motion to table. So from 11 to \n12 noon, unless there is objection, will be an hour equally divided on \nthat amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. The time will be allotted by the managers or their \ndesignees.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right.\n  Mr. DOLE. So now we are down to real business if we can get some \nother amendments over here.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I might review these checklists here.\n  Mr. President, earlier today, I pointed out the system that we have \nset up that really explains this bill, how you get into other people's \nbusiness under this bill, how we really do not need a Justice \nDepartment review.\n  First of all, the first thing that happens under the bill that we \nworked out in the Commerce Committee between Senator Hollings and \nmyself and other members--with all the other Members of the Senate \ninvited to participate--the first thing is that the State certifies \ncompliance with market-opening requirements. So the States are involved \nfirst of all.\n  Next, the FCC affirms the public interest and convenience and \nnecessity. That is another test. We debated that here on the Senate \nfloor and in the Commerce Committee. Some of the conservative \npublications in town said we should eliminate public interest, but we \ndecided not to. So that is another test.\n  The next step is that the FCC certifies compliance with the 14-point \nchecklist. I have a chart of the checklist over here, to prove there is \ncompetition. This is in place of the VIII(c) test. This says the \nregional Bells have opened up their markets.\n  Next, the Bells must comply with a separate subsidiary requirement, \nthat is, the Bell companies, to have a separate subsidiary, for at \nleast a period of 5 years.\n  Next, they have to meet the nondiscrimination requirement. They \ncannot give all their business to one subsidiary or stack it so the \nsubsidiary is not a subsidiary.\n  Next, there is a cross-subsidization ban which the Bells must comply \nwith.\n  Now, during all the time that this is going on, the FCC allows the \nDepartment of Justice full participation in all its proceedings. In \nfact, under the Hobbs Civil Appeals Act, the Department of Justice is \nan independent party in all FCC appeals. That is, if something happens \nhere that the company is not satisfied with the FCC, they can appeal \nand the Justice Department can be their partner. So the Justice \nDepartment is involved in our bill as an active participant.\n  Now, also the Bells must comply with existing FCC rules in rigorous \nannual audits, elaborate cost accounting, [[Page S8163]] computer \nassisted reporting, and special pricing rules.\n  Meanwhile, when all this is going on, you still have the full \napplication of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Act, and the \nHart-Scott-Rodino Act. So still the Justice Department is involved. \nThere is sort of an implication here that if we do not give the \nDepartment of Justice an administrative decisionmaking role they are \nnot involved. They are very much involved. They are very involved in \nantitrust laws, but they are still involved in full participation in \nall the proceedings, and they are involved in the Hobbs Civil Appeals \nAct. The Department of Justice can be an independent party in all FCC \nappeals.\n  In addition to all this, the FCC must confer with the Attorney \nGeneral and the Attorney General can recommend an VIII(c) test or a \nClayton standard or a public interest standard, those three things.\n  So I would like to point out that we already have a lot of \nconditions. By the time you go through all of this, it is going to cost \na company and the taxpayers a lot of money, and it is going to require \na lot of tests--14 tests--public interest test, the Justice Department, \nthe separate subsidiaries. It goes on and on and on. So there is plenty \nof regulation and plenty of review in the proper regulatory agency.\n  Now, a part of this is the so-called competitive checklist. This is \nthe heart of the compromise that was reached. Some of the conservative \nmagazines and some of the Senators wanted a so-called LeMans start \nwhere you set a certain date and everybody competes. The problem in \ntelecommunications is you cannot get on everybody's wire; you have to \nuse the other guy's wires and interconnections and unbundling of his \nsystem before you can compete.\n  So we decided, after weeks of meetings--and all Senators were invited \nto these meetings, and their staffs--to develop the checklist. I must \ncommend the Senator from Nebraska and his staff because they were \npresent and helped write this bill. But so did several other Senators, \nDemocrats and Republicans. This bill has been around a long time. It is \nthe product of all 100 Senators' work.\n  But in any event, the competitive checklist was developed, and at the \nFCC the companies come before the FCC and the FCC goes through this \nchecklist, hopefully very quickly, and this replaces the market test, \nthe VIII(c) or replaces the Clayton 7 Act or it replaces some other \ntypes of tests. But this is the test.\n  First of all, access to network functions and services. That means \ninterconnect. It means that the Bell company has to open up its wires. \nI went down to the big wire station of Bell Atlantic here in Washington \nto see all those wires. They have to open them up. That is what \ninterconnect means. Let us say you and I wanted to form a local \ntelephone company. We would be able to get into the wires of the \nregional Bell. That is interconnection.\n  The second checklist item that the FCC uses before certifying is \ncapability to exchange telecommunications between Bell customers and \ncompetitors' customers.\n  Third, there has to be provided access to poles, ducts, conduits, and \nrights of way.\n  Fourth, local loop transmission unbundled from switching. These next \nthree are unbundling. That is, again, the company has to open up its \nsystems, unbundle so somebody else can get in. I guess this has been \ncompared to if you are making pizza and somebody else delivers your \npizza. It probably would not be in such good shape. But we are \nrequiring in these unbundlings that the other person, the competitor \nwith the Bells, is treated well. When he gets into the regional Bell's \nwires, he does not get a buzz tone or be told to wait 3 minutes or a \ntape recording saying his call will be handled when it becomes \nconvenient. The competitors will be given quality treatment.\n  Unbundling. That is Nos. 5, 6, and 7. Local transport from trunk \nsites unbundled from switch. Local switching unbundled. And No. 4, the \nloop transmission unbundled from switching. These three are the so-\ncalled unbundling tests.\n  Then No. seven is access to 911 and enhanced 911. Enhanced 911 is \nwhere you just push one button for an emergency. Also access is \nrequired for directory assistance and operator call completion \nservices. That is an important one in many cases. Next is white pages \ndirectory listing being available at a reasonable price.\n  The ninth test is access to telephone number assignment; tenth, \naccess to databases and network signaling, important if you are going \nto compete and get into the market; eleventh, interim number \nportability; twelfth, local dialing parity; thirteenth, reciprocal \ncompensation; and fourteenth, resale of local service to competitors.\n  What I am saying is we have a competitive checklist, which is the \nbasis for getting into the local telephone business. So we are trying \nto get everybody into everybody else's business here. These are the \nportions of requirements that the FCC certifies.\n  What the Dorgan-Thurmond amendment suggests is that after we finish \nall this, we then go over to the Justice Department for yet another \ntest, though it is not a regulatory agency. We then ask the Justice \nDepartment to give their approval under the Clayton 7 standard, which \nis another standard.\n  So if you survived in your State, if you met the competitive \nchecklist, if you have met the public-interest test, if you have met \nthe subsidiary test, and if you have met the nondiscrimination test and \nthe cross-subsidization test, when you get through all of that, then \nyou have to go over to the Justice Department.\n  We are told this will only take 90 days; we are going to put a 90-day \nrequirement on it. Even taking 90 days is another delay. Some say you \ncan do this simultaneously. As a practical matter, you cannot. You have \nto get through your State, you have to get through the FCC, and now we \nare over here at the Justice Department. We do not need this additional \nreview. That is more regulation. That is what we are trying to avoid.\n  It is true, in the past, there have been suggestions for VIII(c), but \nwe have come up with this checklist to replace it, which is quicker and \ncovers all the subjects and has been agreed to by everybody. So we have \na bill that finally has crafted a balance between the long distances \nand the Bells. We are now ready to go into business, but if the Dorgan-\nThurmond amendment is adopted, no, wait a minute, we have another layer \nof bureaucracy.\n  What is wrong with giving the Justice Department this authority? \nThere are a number of things wrong with it. First of all, the Justice \nDepartment's enabling statute does not say that it is a regulatory \nagency. The Antitrust Division's enabling statute does not say that it \nis a regulatory agency.\n  The Justice Department got into regulation the first time with Judge \nGreene's consent in 1982. They have several lawyers over there who \ncarry out, administer the MFJ. That was unprecedented, but it came \nabout. They are working for Judge Greene, not the Attorney General, and \nthat is an important thing. They carry out Judge Greene's orders, a \ndistrict court order.\n  But our friends would have us make the Justice Department for the \nfirst time in history by law a regulatory agency. There is no other \narea in commerce that this is true. It is not true in aviation, it is \nnot true in transportation, it is not true in railroads. Originally, \nthe ICC was created in about 1887. The FCC was patterned on it in 1934. \nBoth agencies were intended to be the regulatory agencies. There is \ntalk of abolishing the ICC. There is talk when we get into the wireless \nage of substantially reducing FCC, or that perhaps we will not need the \nFCC. I do not know about that. That is another debate for a later time.\n  But this bill will take us into transition from the wired age to the \nwireless. We are in the last stages of the wired communications age. I \nthink it will last 10 years. Some people think 15; others think it will \nlast about 5. But this bill will provide us with competition and \nderegulation in the last stages of the wired telecommunications era.\n  But to give the Justice Department a regulatory role at this time \nwould be a step backward. That is regulation. That is another layer of \nregulation. Everybody here, even my good friend Al Gore, talks about \nderegulating and privatizing. Here it is. Here is our chance. \n[[Page S8164]] \n  So I think that debating whether or not to have a Justice role on \nthis particular part of this bill is very important.\n  Let me say that in all aspects of this bill, we are trying to \nderegulate, whether it is letting the utilities into telecommunications \nwith safeguards, moving toward deregulation of cable with safeguards, \ngetting the Bell companies manufacturing and letting them get into \nother areas, such as cable, letting the long distance people into the \nlocal market, de- regulating the broadcasters--this is a vast bill. It \nderegulates almost everything.\n  But if we adopt this amendment, we are going back to a major layer of \nregulation regarding the Bell companies in long distance. I cannot \nconceive of why we would do that. Our consumers have an interest in \nderegulation and competition. They are protected by the FCC with the \npublic interest necessity and convenience standard. They are also \nprotected by the checklist and by other safeguards. If the FCC appeals, \nthe Justice Department can join independently on that appeal. So there \nis already heavy Justice Department involvement.\n  So I say to my friends that we really need to decide if we are \nderegulating or if we are shuffling along with more regulation. If we \nallow the Dorgan-Thurmond amendment to be adopted, we would be delaying \ncompetition at least 2 or 3 years. My friends say, ``Oh, it will only \ntake the Justice Department 90 days to get this done.'' That is not \ntrue. They already have a 30-day requirement on them, and they are \ntaking as much as 3 years to get something done over there.\n  I see some other Senators on the floor. If anybody else would like to \nspeak, because I am going to be here all night, if necessary, I will \nyield the floor to anyone who wishes to speak.\n  Mr. KERREY. I would like to speak in response.\n  Mr. DOLE. Can I just change the consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n              Modification of Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, earlier I asked that the Senator from South \nDakota be recognized at 12 o'clock to move to table. I modify that part \nof the agreement and ask unanimous consent that he be recognized at \n12:30 tomorrow to make a motion to table the Dorgan-Thurmond amendment, \nand that the hour for debate be from 11:30 to 12:30 instead of 11 to \n12.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I might indicate, this is made to accommodate a number of \nSenators, Vietnam veterans, who have a special event that does not end \nuntil about 12:15, as I understand.\n  Before the Senator from Nebraska speaks, let me say that it is my \nunderstanding that there will be a vote fairly soon, as soon as Senator \nFeinstein comes to the floor. She has an amendment with Senator Lott. \nIt should not take much debate.\n  So I tell my colleagues, or members of their staff, there probably \nwill be a vote in the next 45 minutes.\n  I am now advised she cannot be here until about 6:30. Let me think \nabout that, and I will say something after the Senator from Nebraska \nspeaks.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, we have been debating this particular \namendment, although in its current incarnation just about 4 or 5 hours, \nbut we have been debating the overall role of the Justice Department \nfor a couple of days now.\n  I am beginning to learn that in debate--I had not noticed it used \nquite so often--but one of the devices that one uses in debate is you \nset up a straw-man and you say, ``Do you want that strawman?'' And you \nsay, ``No, I don't want that strawman,'' and then you knock it down \nwith your argument.\n  The strawman in this argument is to say that this amendment would \nrequire the poor old phone company, little old mom-and-pop phone \ncompany, to go through all this burdensome procedure before the Federal \nCommunications Commission and then go over to the Department of Justice \nand that we are setting up a whole new level of bureaucracy.\n  It is not true. That is not what is going on. It is a simultaneous \nprocess. The idea that somehow it is not going to occur simultaneously \nis an idea that is sold, but I do not believe is an effective sale. The \nquestion is not do you want the Department of Justice to regulate--we \nare not asking for regulatory authority--the question before the body \nis, do you want, as you proceed to a competitive environment--when\n you get right down to the application, the FCC will be making a \njudgment, just as the Department of Transportation did, as referenced \nearlier, when TWA tries to acquire Ozark, or when Republic is the \ntarget of Northwest Airlines. In the deregulation of the airline \nindustry, we did not give the Department of Justice the authority to \nsay we do not approve of it. We do not think there is competition. We \ndo not think there will be competitive choice. We think this will \ndecrease that.\n\n  That is the question before us is not do you want the Department of \nJustice, in an unprecedented fashion, to regulate, but do you want the \nDepartment of Justice to have a role more than ``What do you think?'' \nThe Department of Justice, under this amendment, would have a role to \nsay, ``There is not competition at the local level, and we do not \nbelieve this application should be approved.'' That is the question \nbefore us.\n  We are going from a monopoly to a competitive environment. We are not \nciting enormous power in a conspiratorial fashion. With or without this \namendment, I say to my colleagues, there is substantial deregulation. \nWithout this amendment, if this fails, your cable company can still \nprice its premium service without being regulated. With or without this \namendment, Rupert Murdoch can still acquire 50 percent of the \ntelevision stations in a local area. With or without this amendment, \nyou have companies out there that will be doing things they were \npreviously prevented from doing. This bill will deregulate without this \namendment.\n  So this is not a question before the body that you have to answer, \nsuch as, ``Do I want to deregulate, or do I want to continue the \ncurrent regulatory structure?'' We are going to deregulate either way.\n  The question before the body is, do you want the Department of \nJustice, with a date-certain requirement, involved not just, ``Oh, what \ndo you think about this proposed''--I almost said merger. But that is \nwhat it becomes. One of the ironies is, if a local telephone company \nacquires or merges with a local cable company, the Department of \nJustice has to approve it. Nobody suggests that is undue regulatory \nauthority. Effectively, when you go from a monopoly with a local \nfranchise into long distance, it is effectively the same thing. The \nquestion before us is: Do you want the Department of Justice to say we \ndo not think there is competition?\n  Now, very instructive for Members, as you try to reach that decision, \nI think, would be to go through either one of the checklists. There are \ntwo, by the way. In section 251, there is a checklist that says here is \nwhat a local company has to do, if a long distance or another carrier--\nand my vision for competition, by the way, again, is that you get \ncompetitive choice not for the existing line of businesses, but you get \nit for a package of information services. So it is likely to come, this \ndesire to compete at the local level, and the competition and the \ndesire is just as likely to come from a medium-sized entrepreneur that \nwants to deliver information services to a resident in Cleveland, or \nOmaha, or wherever. That is apt to happen.\n  In section 251 there is a checklist, as well, that says here is what \nyou have to do. It is a pretty tough checklist. In fact, it may be \ntougher than in 255. In 255, you have a checklist that says this is \nwhat you have to do if you want to do interLATA, or long distance \nservice. If you are a local telephone company, this is what you have to \ndo. Well, I do not doubt--and indeed I know--that the committee spent a \nlong time putting this checklist together. There are 14 things. But \nread them. Read them and then ask yourself the question: Does this mean \nI have competition? Does this mean I have competitive choice at the \nlocal level? For the consumer a competitive choice means that if they \ndo not like the business [[Page S8165]] that is offering to sell them \nsomething, they can shop it someplace else. That is a competitive \nchoice. Competitive choice means that business person that is selling \nyou something has to make sure that the price and quality and all of \nthe other terms and circumstances of the sale are what you want, or you \ntake your business someplace else. That is what a competitive choice \nprovides a consumer.\n  Well, I do not know if this 14-point checklist gets that job done. \nMaybe it does. Maybe it does. I do not know. Again, it is a very \nimpressive checklist. Members ought to read it. Ask yourselves what \ndoes it mean if I have ``nondiscriminatory access on an unbundled basis \nto the network functions and services of the Bell operating company's \ntelecommunications network that is at least equal in type, quality, and \nprice to the access the Bell operating company affords to itself or any \nother entity.''\n  That would appear to mean that you have a competitive opportunity. I \ndo not know. The real test of competition is going to occur when the \nconsumer says, ``I have competitive choice,'' and when that person in \nthe neighborhood says, ``I do not like my service. I do not like this. \nThe price is too high. The quality is not what I want. I am going to \ntake it someplace else.'' You do not have that today with local \ntelephone and cable.\n  We are trying to move from that monopoly situation to a competitive \nsituation, and we are merely saying with this amendment: Ask the \nDepartment of Justice--not giving them regulatory control in some sort \nof dark and mysterious fashion, but ask the agency that, on a regular, \nroutine basis, is charged with a responsibility of assessing whether or \nnot you have competition. If you do not think they can do it, look at \ntheir success in this industry.\n  Again, it was not Congress in 1982 that stood up to AT Congress \ndid not stand up to AT and say we have had enough of this monopoly, \nour consumers and citizens are complaining; we are going to pass \nlegislation and divest you. Congress did not do that. The people's \nCongress did not respond to that and pass legislation. It was the \nDepartment of Justice that filed a suit against them originally, and \neventually, as a consequence of AT believing they would win the suit, \nwrite up a consent decree and file it with the judge.\n  I hope that colleagues understand that this amendment is not offered \nas a consequence of our desire to continue regulation. As I said, we \nare deregulating telecommunications with or without this amendment. So \nthe choice is not do I favor deregulation. With or without this \namendment, you will have deregulation. I hope my colleagues do not fall \ninto the illusion that this is a choice between, do I want another \nlayer of bureaucracy, or do I want to prolong the process? If there is \na specific objection to the language of this bill that implies there \nmight be an unreasonable delay or might layer on bureaucracies, bring \nit. We have made modifications already in the amendment. I do not want \nto layer on excessive bureaucracy.\n  I urge my colleagues to go back and look at airline deregulation, in \nparticular, not with the purpose of trying to revisit and reargue that \nthorny, old problem, but to look at what happened to the Department of \nTransportation, which was making the decisions, and the Department of \nJustice was merely in a consultative role. They merely said, ``We \nadvise against them,'' rather than being in a position where the \ncompanies understand that they do have the ability to say there is \ncompetition, thus, let us go forward, or say there is no competition, \ndo not allow it to go forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as one of the members of the Commerce \nCommittee, who reached the decision to balance this legislation in the \nfashion that it appears here on the floor, and also as a Senator who \nhas great respect for the views of the Senator from Nebraska, I must \nsay that I find myself unpersuaded by his case--unpersuaded on a number \nof grounds.\n  First, it is not necessary to bandy about the word ``bureaucracy'' to \nunderstand that the fundamental nature of this amendment is to \nsubstitute a required approval on the part of two very distinct Federal \nagencies\n with two very distinct roles for a single such determination, before a \nregional Bell operating company can go in to the long distance \nbusiness.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, there is no question but that the entry of a \nregional Bell operating company in the long distance business will be \ncompetitive in nature. The long distance business is highly competitive \nat the present time. Not just with that handful of large companies \nwhich constantly advertise in the newspapers and on television, but by \ndozens, if not hundreds, of smaller companies, as well.\n  Now, it is true that those companies presently in the long distance \nbusiness, naturally enough, fear the entry of the Bell operating \ncompanies into their business. They make the case--not entirely \npersuasively, but not entirely unpersuasively, either--that allowing \nthe Bell operating companies into that business may give those Bells an \nunfair competitive advantage.\n  It is in order to meet that argument, Mr. President--not the argument \nabout local service, but the argument about long distance service--that \nthis bill says to the Bell operating companies, ``No, you cannot start \ncompeting in that very competitive business unless and until your own \nsystem is open to those who want to provide competition where \ncompetition in large measure does not exist right now, in the local \nexchange service.''\n  It is to assure that companies now providing long distance service or \ncable television service or simply seeking to get into the long \nexchange business, are able to do so that the various conditions--some \nof which have been referred to by the Senator from Nebraska--are \nincluded in the bill.\n  The goal of the bill, Mr. President, is to create added competition \nin both telephone fields, in both long distance and in the local \nexchange.\n  Any additional requirement which slows down that process on both \nsides of the equations, seems, to this Senator, to be undesirable.\n  So what the bill does is to set up a set of 14 reasonably objective \nconditions that must be met by the regional Bell operating companies to \nopen up their local exchange before they could get into the long \ndistance business and provide competition and, one hopes, lower prices.\n  The committee was not absolutely satisfied any more than the Senator \nfrom Nebraska is absolutely satisfied that the simple mechanical \nmeeting of those 14 conditions would, under all circumstances, be \nsufficient to open up the local exchange.\n  So it added the public interest convenience and necessity condition, \nrequiring the Federal Communications Commission, which almost from time \nimmemorial, has been the Government entity and agency with expertise in \nthis field, to determine in the broadest possible sense that the \nrequested authorization was consistent with the public interest, \nconvenience, and necessity. A test which has been a test utilized by \nthat Commission ever since or almost ever since its creation.\n  Mr. President, in adding the Department to this mix directly as a \nregulatory rather than as an advisory entity, the amendment, it seems \nto me, creates the worst situation, worse then abolishing the FCC and \nhaving this done only by the FCC, worse than leaving it the way it is \nin the bill at the present time.\n  Because, Mr. President, the Attorney General expressly has advisory \nauthority to the Federal Communications Commission in this connection.\n  I suspect that in most cases, the Attorney General goes to the \nCommission and says, ``This is a terrible idea, to let this Bell into \nthe long distance business.'' We think it is going to, somehow or \nanother, create a tremendous monopoly.\n  I strongly suspect that the FCC will listen to and abide by that \nadvice unless, in its own greater expertise in the communications \nbusiness, it feels that the Attorney General is flatout wrong, just \ndoes not know very much about this particular subject.\n  The sponsors of the amendment, in their desire to have two different \nentities involved in this business, have really created a most curious \ndivision of authority.\n  Where, in the bill as it stands without this amendment, the authority \nof the Federal Communications Commission in dealing with a \ndetermination of [[Page S8166]] public interest, convenience, and \nnecessity, is essentially unlimited, this amendment deprives the \nCommission of the ability to consider the effects of the authorization \nin any market for which the authorization is sought, with respect to \nantitrust matters.\n  Mr. President, it is very likely that may be the centerpiece of what \nthe FCC would base its determination of public interest, convenience, \nand necessity on under normal circumstances.\n  This mention of public interest, convenience, and necessity is carved \nout in order to be given to the antitrust division of the Office of the \nAttorney General. In other words, the FCC is really going to no longer \nbe able to consider all of the elements which go into a determination \nthat authorization is in the public interest, convenience, and \nnecessity.\n  Just last week, Mr. President, in balancing this bill, we turned down \nan amendment which would have stricken that authority. We did not feel, \na majority of the Members did not feel, any more than a majority in the \ncommittee felt, that we could absolutely and under all circumstances \nrely on the 14 categories.\n  So now, in the interests of speaking out on antitrust matters, the \nsponsors of this amendment were normally thought to be on this side of \nthe debate, while those who sponsored last week's amendment were on \nthat side, and the committee in the middle, are doing much of the work \nthat the sponsors of last week's amendment sought to do themselves and \nwere rejected in that course of action by, I believe, all of the \nsponsors and most of the supporters of this amendment.\n  So, to recapitulate, this proposal deprives the Federal \nCommunications Commission of authority it ought to have in order to \ngive a new kind of authority to the Attorney General of the United \nStates, a kind of authority that the Attorney General does not have at \nthe present time.\n  I want to go back. The Attorney General in this bill is to be \nconsulted by the Federal Communications Commission, and in this bill \nthe Attorney General is not deprived of any of the authority of that \noffice with respect to monopolization or the enforcement of the \nantitrust laws. Just as it can stop a merger, if it finds that the \nultimate impact of such authority is to create a monopoly, it may bring \nthe same kind of litigation that it brought that resulted in the \nbreakup of the old AT But one further matter, as that is brought up \nas something which took place through the Department of Justice, not \nthrough the Congress, the Department of Justice did not determine to \nsue AT to break up that monopoly in 90 days. And here in this bill \nthe Attorney General is given only 90 days to make this determination, \nnot of something that has happened in the past--which is fairly easy to \ndetermine--but something that might possibly happen in the future. I do \nnot believe that the authority given the Attorney General in this bill \ncan effectively be used in a period of time like that. It is clear that \nwe now have two different Federal entities under this amendment having \nauthority over the grant of this authorization based on two quite \ndifferent sets of tests and that, apparently, they will not relate to \none another.\n  Finally, it is clear to this Senator, at least, that it is more \nlikely than not that this added authority, this two entities of the \nFederal Government rather than one, is likely to slow down the creation \nof competition, certainly in long distance, and very unlikely to speed \nit up in connection with the local telephone market.\n  So, I would summarize by saying I do not believe the committee on \nwhich I serve and on which this structure was worked out by the careful \nwork of the chairman and the ranking Democratic member, and for that \nmatter almost all the members of the committee, is some kind of jerry-\nbuilt political compromise. It is the result of careful and sober \nthought as to what was the best system available for reaching two \ngoals: one, the creation of competition in the most rapid possible \nfashion, both in long distance and in the local exchange; and at the \nsame time the prevention of monopoly and the service of the public \ninterest.\n  So, my own summary is that the bill, as it stands, is greatly \nsuperior, from the perspective of the public interest and competition \nand consumers, than it would have been had the McCain amendment been \nadopted last week striking the public interest section and, equally, \nthan it will be if this amendment is adopted putting two different \nentities of the Federal Government into the same mix, artificially \ndivorcing them from one another, frustrating the traditional role of \nthe Federal Communications Commission and, in my view, frustrating the \ndevelopment of new technology and of competition.\n  For those reasons I trust when the distinguished chairman of the \nCommerce Committee moves to table this amendment tomorrow, that his \nmotion will be successful.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my friend will yield for a question? Let me say, in \nthe context of this, I hope the Senator from California will offer her \namendment. The leader has asked that there be a vote--if that is \nagreeable to everybody--at about 6:30 on the Feinstein-Lott amendment. \nBut I would like to, just in concluding, commend the Senator from \nWashington, a former State attorney general. There is one question, if \nhe could make a response before, hopefully, the Senator from California \nwill speak on the floor, and that is the extraordinary, unprecedented \ndecisionmaking role for the Department of Justice that is proposed in \nthe Dorgan-Thurmond amendment.\n  As a former State attorney general, has he ever seen a proposal where \nthe Justice Department would become the decisionmaker, a regulatory \ndecisionmaker? I guess this question goes to the heart of \nthe division of powers in our Government.\n  Mr. GORTON. I do not believe I have. I would hate to make a totally \ngeneralized statement on that, but certainly I would say not in the \nmemory of my experience as State attorney general nor did I find the \nDepartment of Justice have such authority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have actually two amendments, one \ninvolving the cities and a preemption clause in the bill, and the \nsecond is an amendment I would like to send to the desk right now.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1269\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for the full scrambling on multichannel video \n            services of sexually explicit adult programming)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] for herself \n     and Mr. Lott, proposes an amendment numbered 1269.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 145, below line 23, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 407A. SCRAMBLING OF SEXUALLY EXPLICIT ADULT VIDEO \n                   SERVICE PROGRAMMING.\n\n       (a) Requirement.--Part IV of title VI (47 U.S.C. 551 et \n     seq.), as amended by this Act, is further amended by adding \n     at the end the following:\n     ``SEC. 641. SCRAMBLING OF SEXUALLY EXPLICIT ADULT VIDEO \n                   SERVICE PROGRAMMING.\n\n       (a) Requirement.--In providing sexually explicit adult \n     programming or other programming that is indecent and harmful \n     to children on any channel of its service primarily dedicated \n     to sexually-oriented programming, a multichannel video \n     programming distributor shall fully scramble or otherwise \n     fully block the video and audio portion of such channel so \n     that one not a subscriber to such channel or programming does \n     not receive it.\n       (b) Implementation.--Until a multichannel video programming \n     distributor complies with the requirement set forth in \n     subsection (a), the distributor shall limit the access of \n     children to the programming referred to in that subsection by \n     not providing such programming during the hours of the day \n     (as determined by the Commission) when a significant number \n     of children are likely to view it.\n       (c) Definition.--As used in this section, the term \n     ``scramble'' means to rearrange the content of the signal of \n     the programming so that audio and video portion of the \n     programming cannot be received by persons unauthorized to \n     receive the programming.''

Will my friend yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a vote occur on \nthe Feinstein and Lott amendment at 6:30 this evening and the time \nbetween now and 6:30 be equally divided in the usual form.\n  I might say I am going to yield as much of my time to the Senator \nfrom California as she wishes. And I ask unanimous consent no second-\ndegree amendments be in order to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from South Dakota and I thank the \nChair.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Lott I offer this \namendment, which is a rather simple and direct amendment. It concerns \nthe proliferation of adult video programming that is easily accessible \nfor children to view. It is a commonsense amendment and it is simple. \nIt would require multichannel video programmers, such as cable \noperators, to fully scramble or otherwise block sexually explicit adult \nprogramming unless a subscriber specifically requests such programming.\n  The full blocking requirement would apply to those channels primarily \ndedicated to adult sexually oriented programming, such as the Playboy \nand Spice channels. Until these channels are fully blocked, cable \noperators would have to restrict their broadcasts to certain times of \nthe day when children are least likely to view it, such as at night.\n  Last year I learned that in many households across America, adult \nprogramming was being broadcast around-the-clock on certain primarily \nsexually orientated channels, with only partial audio and video \nscrambling.\n  This issue first came to my attention when a local city councilman in \nPoway, CA, a suburb of San Diego, wrote to me about the problem in his \ncommunity. He said that in San Diego County, partially scrambled video \npornography--replete with unscrambled and sexually explicit audio--was \nbeing automatically transmitted to more than 320,000 cable television \nsubscribers.\n  Unfortunately, many subscribers and parents were unaware of these \ntransmissions until they or their children accidentally discovered the \nprogramming. In San Diego County, for example, the partially scrambled \npornography signal was broadcast only one channel away from a network \nbroadcasting cartoons and was easily accessible for children to view.\n  Parents would come home after work only to find their children \nsitting in front of the television watching or listening to the \nadult's-only channel, a channel that many parents did not even know \nexisted. In Poway, the city councilman's young son learned about the \nadult's-only channel at school, where the easily accessible programming \nwas a hot topic among children.\n  This is not an isolated program.Until just a few months ago, the \nlocal cable company here in Washington also automatically transmitted \npartially scrambled video pornography--replete with unscrambled and \nsexually explicit audio--to all of its subscribers.\n  To their credit, some local cable companies are taking voluntary \nsteps to address this problem. For example, in San Diego, one local \ncable company restricted the times when such programming was broadcast. \nIn Washington, the local cable company eventually fully blocked the \nprogramming so both the video and audio portions of the signal are now \nundistinguishable.\n  However, numerous other cable services across the country are still \ntransmitting similar adult video and audio programming that is not \nsufficiently scrambled, with many subscribers and parents unaware of \nits contents. And, with the emerging information superhighway and other \nforms of video programming now or soon to be available, such sexually \nelicit adult programming will be even more prevalent.\n  The problem is that there are no uniform laws or regulations that \ngovern such sexually explicit adult programming on cable television. \nCurrently, adult programming varies from community to community, as \ndoes the amount and effectiveness of scrambling on each local cable \nsystem. Right now, it is up to the local cable operator to regulate \nitself. This is like the fox guarding the hen house.\n  Following complaints from myself and other officials--and the threat \nof legislation--the National Cable Television Association recognized \nthat this was indeed a problem and adopted voluntary guidelines that \nlocal cable operators can follow. The California Cable Television \nAssociation also adopted similar guidelines.\n  However, the voluntary guidelines simply recommend that local cable \noperators ``block the audio and video portions of unwanted sexually-\noriented premium channels at no cost to the customer, upon request.'' \nWhile this is a somewhat commendable effort on the part of industry, I \ndo not believe that it goes far enough.\n  First, the guidelines are only voluntary and simply recommended that \nlocal cable operators take action. There is no guarantee that such \nblocking will be provided and no enforcement mechanism.\n  Second, the guidelines put the burden of action on the subscriber, \nnot the cable company, by requiring a subscriber to specifically \nrequest the blocking of indecent programming. As I stated earlier, many \nsubscribers do not even know that such programming exists, only to \ndiscover their children watching and listening to adults-only channels.\n  I do not believe that sexually explicit adult programming should \nautomatically be broadcast into a program subscriber's home. On the \ncontrary, I believe that sexually explicit adult programming should be \nautomatically blocked, unless a program subscriber specifically \nrequests the programming.\n  The amendment I am proposing today is similar to language approved by \nthe Commerce Committee last year as part of S. 1822 and contained in \nSenator Exon's bill, the Communications Decency Act of 1995. It would \nrequire that all sexually explicit adult programming be fully scrambled \nunless requested by a subscriber.\n  This amendment does not prohibit or out-right block indecent or \nsexually explicit programming. Anyone requesting such programming is \nentitled to receive it, as long as it is not obscene, which is not \nprotected by the first amendment. The amendment, however, protects \nchildren by prohibiting sexually explicit programming to those \nindividuals who have not specifically requested such programming.\n  The cable television industry, in meetings over the past year or so \nwith my staff, have expressed their opposition to this amendment, \nciting technological and fiscal concerns. The bottom line, however, is \nthat fully scrambling both the audio and video portion of a cable \nprogram is technologically feasible. In fact, several cable operators \nhave already instituted such blocking, such as here in Washington. With \nregard to their fiscal concerns, I have never been given any \ninformation from the industry to document what the actual costs to \ncable operators would be.\n  This amendment gives the industry flexibility in implementing the \nrequirement to fully scramble all sexually explicit adult programming.\n  Until a cable operator or other multichannel video programming \ndistributor is in full compliance, access to such programming will be \nlimited to protect children from the sexually explicit material. The \nprogramming will be prohibited from those times of the day--to be \ndetermined by the FCC--when a significant number of children are likely \nto view it, such as during the mid and late morning, afternoon, and \nearly evening.\n  So, the amendment leaves it up to the local cable operator on how and \nwhen to come into full compliance. Some cable operators, for example, \nare already in full compliance. For those operators that are not in \nfull compliance, children will be still be protected until the adult \nprogramming can be fully scrambled or otherwise blocked.\n  This amendment also does not become effective until 30 days after \nenactment, so cable operators will have plenty of time to either fully \nblock the programming, or restrict access to certain times of the day.\n  While I realize that some cable operators may incur costs in \nimplementing [[Page S8168]] this amendment, I believe that the price to \nprotect children from sexually explicit programming is well worth it. \nIn addition, as I stated above, the amendment gives the industry \nflexibility in coming into compliance; it lets individual cable \noperators decide what costs, if any, they will incur and when they will \nincur such costs.\n  It is unfortunate that this amendment is necessary. One would have \nhoped that cable operators and other multichannel video programming \ndistributors would have automatically fully blocked or scrambled \nsexually explicit adult programming or, at a minimum, restricted the \nprogramming to certain times of the day.\n  But, industry has only taken baby steps to address this problem \nthrough voluntary policies that simply recommend action. The end result \nis that numerous cable operators across the country are still \nautomatically broadcasting sexually explicit adult programming into \nhouseholds across America, regardless of whether parents want this or \nsubscribers want it.\n  So I believe the provision is both necessary, timely, will be \nhelpful, and will disadvantage no one. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis commonsense amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a CRS analysis of this amendment as it \nrelates to the first amendment, which is in support of the amendment of \nSenator Lott and myself, and some recent court decisions, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                      The Library of Congress,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 1995.\n     To: Hon. Dianne Feinstein, Attention: Robert Mestman.\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: Indecent Programming on Cable Television.\n       This memorandum is furnished in response to your request \n     for a brief analysis of the constitutionality of your \n     proposal to limit ``sexually explicit adult programming or \n     other programming that is indecent and harmful to children on \n     any channel . . . primarily dedicated to sexually-oriented \n     programming.'' Subsection (a) of the proposal provides that \n     ``a multichannel video programming distributor shall fully \n     scramble or otherwise fully block the video and audio \n     portions of such channel so that one not a subscriber to such \n     channel or programming does not receive [such programming].'' \n     Subsection (b) of the proposal states that, until a \n     distributor complies with subsection (a), it shall not \n     provide ``such programming during the hours of the day (as \n     determined by the [Federal Communications] Commission) when \n     children are likely to view it.''\n       The First Amendment prohibits Congress from abridging the \n     freedom of speech, and the Supreme Court has held that speech \n     on cable television has full First Amendment protection.\\1\\ \n     ``The Government may, however, regulate the content of \n     constitutionally protected speech in order to promote a \n     compelling interest if it chooses the least restrictive means \n     to further the articulated interest.''\\2\\ In the case in \n     which this quotation appears, the Supreme Court struck down a \n     federal statute that banned dial-a-porn ``[b]ecause the \n     statute's denial of adult access to telephone messages which \n     are indecent but not obscene far exceeds that which is \n     necessary to limit the access of minors to such messages . . \n     . .''\\3\\ The Court in this case also reiterated that ``the \n     government may not `reduce the adult population . . . to . . \n     . only what is fit for children.'''\\4\\\n     Footnotes at end at article.\n       Subsection (a) of your proposal would apparently be \n     constitutional, under the reasoning of this week's decision \n     in Alliance for Community Media v. Federal Communications \n     Commission.\\6\\ The court of appeals in this case upheld the \n     constitutionality of provisions of the Cable Television \n     Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, Public Law \n     102-385, including section 10(b), 47 U.S.C. Sec. 532(j), \n     which requires the FCC to prescribe rules requiring cable \n     operators who have not voluntarily prohibited indecent \n     programming under Sec. 532(h) to place such programs on a \n     separate channel and to block the channel until the \n     subscriber, in writing, requests unblocking. This statute \n     applies only to programming on leased access channels, but \n     otherwise it does essentially the same thing your proposal \n     would do. It requires a separate channel for indecent \n     programming, and it requires blocking until the subscriber \n     requests unblocking. Your proposal would apply to ``any \n     channel * * * primarily dedicated to sexually-oriented \n     programming'' (in effect, to a separate channel), and would \n     require blocking to non-subscribers (in effect, until they \n     request the channel).\\6\\\n       The reason that the court of appeals upheld Sec. 532(j) \n     despite the First Amendment's prohibiting Congress from \n     abridging the freedom of speech is that it found that the \n     government has a compelling interest in protecting the \n     physical and psychological well-being of minors, and that the \n     method Congress chose in Sec. 532(j) was the least \n     restrictive means available to meet this compelling interest. \n     The same analysis apparently would find subsection (a) of \n     your proposal constitutional.\n       Subsection (b) of your proposal would give distributors an \n     alternative to the subsection (a): instead of blocking they \n     could not provide ``such programming during the hours of the \n     day (as determined by the Commission) when children are \n     likely to view it.'' To the extent that it is not \n     technologically feasible for distributors to comply with \n     subsection (a) immediately, they will be forced to comply \n     with subsection (b) until they are able to comply with \n     subsection (a). Therefore, subsection (b) should be viewed as \n     a requirement that must be consistent with the First \n     Amendment.\n       In Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica \n     Foundation, the FCC had taken action against a radio station \n     for broadcasting a recording of George Carlin's ``Filthy \n     Words'' monologue at 2 p.m., and the station had claimed \n     First Amendment protection.\\7\\ The Supreme Court upheld the \n     power of the FCC under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1464 ``to regulate a \n     radio broadcast that is indecent but not obscene.''\\8\\ \n     However, the Court emphasized the narrowness of its holding:\n       The Commission's decision rested entirely on a nuisance \n     rationale under which context is all-important. The concept \n     requires consideration of a host of variables. The time of \n     day was emphasized by the Commission. . . .\\9\\\n       Furthermore, the Commission ``never intended to place an \n     absolute prohibition on the broadcast of this type of \n     language, but rather sought to channel it to times of day \n     when children most likely would not be exposed to it.''\\10\\\n       In 1992, Congress enacted Public Law 102-356, section 16 of \n     which required the FCC, within 180 days of enactment, to \n     promulgate regulations that prohibit broadcasting of indecent \n     programming on radio and television from 6 a.m. to midnight, \n     except for public radio and television stations that go off \n     the air at or before midnight, which may broadcast such \n     material beginning at 10 p.m.\\11\\ This statute was \n     challenged, and, in Action for Children's Television v. \n     Federal Communications Commission (ACT III), a three-judge \n     panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals declared it \n     unconstitutional.\\12\\ The full court of appeals agreed to \n     decide the case, but a decision has not yet been issued.\n       Even with this uncertainty, it is clear from the Supreme \n     Court's decision in Pacifica, supra, that the time in which \n     indecent programming is proscribed must be limited. In ACT \n     III, the three-judge panel held that the ban was ``not \n     narrowly tailored to meet constitutional standards.''\\13\\ It \n     found ``that the government did not properly weight viewers' \n     and listeners' First Amendment rights when balancing the \n     competing interests in determining the widest safe harbor \n     period consistent with the protection of children.''\\14\\ \n     Furthermore, the government did not demonstrate that its \n     ``interest in shielding children from indecent broadcasts \n     automatically outweigh the child's own First Amendment rights \n     . . . .''\\15\\ The court directed the FCC to ``redetermin[e], \n     after a full and fair bearing, . . . the times at which \n     indecent material may be broadcast . . . .''\\16\\\n       Similarly, in a previous decision by a three-judge panel on \n     a 6 a.m. to midnight ban on indecent programming, the D.C. \n     Circuit held ``that the FCC failed to adduce evidence or \n     cause, particularly in view of the first amendment interest \n     involved, sufficient to support its hours restraint.''\\17\\ \n     The court of appeals considered the evidence that the FCC had \n     cited to justify its action against the nighttime \n     broadcasters, and found it ``insubstantial,'' and found the \n     FCC's findings ``more ritual than real.''\\18\\ The court of \n     appeals concluded ``that, in view of the curtailment of \n     broadcaster freedom and adult listener choice that channeling \n     entails, the Commission failed to consider fairly and fully \n     what time lines should be drawn.''\\19\\\n       Assuming that the full court of appeals applies these \n     principles, it appears that the phrase in subsection (b) of \n     your proposal ``during hours of the day (as determined by the \n     Commission) when children are likely to view it'' may be \n     overboard. This is because some children seem likely to be \n     watching television at all hours of the day (and night), and \n     it would apparently be unconstitutional to ban indecent \n     programming around the clock. To be constitutional, your \n     proposal might have to be changed to prohibit such \n     programming only during hours when the ratio of children to \n     adults watching television is significantly high. This, \n     again, is because ``the government may not `reduce the adult \n     population . . . to . . . only what is fit for \n     children.'''\\20\\\n       Please let us know if we may provide additional assistance.\n                                                      Henry Cohen,\n                                             Legislative Attorney.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\Turner Broadcasting System, Inc v.

I yield the floor. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join the distinguished \nSenator from California, Senator Feinstein, in cosponsoring this \namendment. It is an amendment that I think is needed. It is one that \nwill complete the effort that is being made by a number of groups and a \nnumber of people that are very much concerned about sexually explicit \nprogramming on our televisions.\n  But I do not want to exaggerate what this amendment will do. It \nsimply requires cable operators to fully scramble sexually explicit \nprogramming if someone has not subscribed for such programming.\n  Cable systems, in many cases, are not fully scrambling the audio and \nvideo of their adult programs. The pictures fades in and out. You can \nhear the audio. Clearly, that is not what should be done if the person \npurchasing these services has not subscribed to have that type of \nprogramming. It should be fully scrambled. I think we do need this \namendment for many reasons. Today, the cable systems across the country \nare sending uninvited, sexually explicit and pornographic programming \ninto the homes. I want to emphasize that not all cable operators are \ndoing that, but there are too many that are doing it.\n  Children are being exposed to these obscene and harmful programs, and \nthe Nation has been shocked to learn just in the last month of the rape \nof a 6-year-old by a 10-year-old and an 8-year-old.\n  Studies and exposes are showing young people, elementary-age \nchildren, are acting out the behavior they are seeing in this type of \nprogramming. Teachers and parents are becoming alarmed by the effect of \nsuch programming. It is time that we do something about it. We have \nexpressed for over a year our concerns about this matter. We made calls \nto the industry. Yet in many instances, they have not adequately taken \naction to safeguard the children. It is an example in my opinion of \nwhere we need more corporate responsibility. But since we have not \ngotten that yet, we need this amendment.\n  In the amendment, the critical definition is this:\n  The term ``scramble'' means to rearrange the content of the signal, \nof the programming so that the audio and video portion of the \nprogramming cannot be received by persons unauthorized to received the \nprogramming.\n  I think that sums it up. I think it is a very simple amendment, but I \ndo think it is one that should be added to this very important bill. \nAnd it will be well received by a lot of people who are concerned by \nwhat we have seen in the past months in the cable programming of this \ntype of material.\n  So I yield the floor, Mr. President, at this time unless there are \nany other Senators wishing speak on this particular amendment.\n  Could I inquire, Mr. President, about the parliamentary procedure. \nHas there already been an agreed to vote at 6:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will occur at 6:30.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nFeinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that tomorrow \nthe second Feinstein amendment, which will be offered tonight, be voted \non at 9:30--Mr. President, I think we better proceed with the vote. I \nwithdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1269, offered by the \nSenator from California [Mrs. Feinstein]. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. MACK (when his name was called). Present.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I urge those Senators who have \namendments to bring them to the floor. We are trying to get a final \nlist.\n  I have been asked by Senator Dole, with the concurrence of Senator \nHollings, to file a cloture motion. I urge all Senators to come to the \nfloor with amendments they might have, or Senators who wish to speak. \nWe will be here as late tonight as any Member wants to speak on this \nbill or offer amendments.\n  We will try to stack the votes. I know there is an event tomorrow \nmorning, and the Les Aspin ceremony. There is the one vote that has \nbeen ordered on the Dorgan-Thurmond amendment at 12:30, after 1 hour of \ndebate. We will be taking other amendments in the morning. We want to \nmove this bill forward.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on the adoption of the Feinstein \namendment, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Let me join in the remarks of the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Dakota with respect to amendments. We killed the day looking \nfor amendments. We started on this bill last Wednesday.\n  I have been in the vanguard of opposing cloture, but I would have to \nsupport it in this particular instance because we cannot get amendments \ndrawn and presented and voted upon. So a day passes by and everybody \ntalks about how they would like to get out early and do these other \nthings. [[Page S8170]] \n  This is the Senate's business. We hope that we can move along now \nexpeditiously on this side of the aisle. If there are any amendments, \nwe do appreciate the Senator from California, ready and willing and \nable to present the next amendment. Beyond that, I hope we can get some \nother amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1270\n\n    (Purpose: To strike the authority of the Federal Communications \n    Commission to preempt State or local regulations that establish \n   barriers to entry for interstate or intrastate telecommunications \n                               services)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Kempthorne and \nmyself, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself \n     and Mr. Kempthorne, proposes an amendment numbered 1270.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 55, strike out line 4 and all that follows through \n     page 55, line 12.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today joined by \nour colleague, Senator Kempthorne, to offer this amendment on behalf of \na broad coalition of State and local governments. Since announcing my \nintention to proceed with this amendment, I have received letters of \nsupport from hundreds of cities across the country, including the \nStates of Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, California, \nKentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, \nMissouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oregon, Ohio, Texas, and \nWashington.\n  This amendment is supported by the National Governors' Association, \nthe National Association of Counties, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, the National League of Cities, and the U.S. Conference of \nMayors, to name a few.\n  Mr. President, as a former mayor, I fully understand why Governors, \nmayors, city councils, and county boards of supervisors question \nallowing the Federal Communications Commission to second-guess \ndecisions made at State and local government levels.\n  On one hand, the bill before the Senate gives cities and States the \nright to levy fair and reasonable fees and to control their rights of \nway; with the other hand, this bill, as it presently stands, takes \nthese protections away.\n  The way in which it does so is found in section 201, which creates a \nnew section 254(d) of the Cable Act, and provides sweeping preemption \nauthority. The preemption gives any communications company the right, \nif they disagree with a law or regulation put forward by a State, \ncounty, or a city, to appeal that to the FCC.\n  That means that cities will have to send delegations of city \nattorneys to Washington to go before a panel of telecommunications \nspecialist at the FCC, on what may be very broad question of State or \nlocal government rights.\n  In reality, this preemption provision is an unfunded mandate because \nit will create major new costs for cities and for States. I hope to \nexplain why. I know my colleague, the Senator from Idaho, will do that \nas well.\n  A cable company would, and most likely will, appeal any local \ndecision it does not like to the telecommunications experts at the \nFederal Communications Commission.\n  The city attorney of San Francisco advises that, in San Francisco, \ncity laws provide that all street excavations must comply with local \nlaws tailored to the specifics of the local communities, including the \ngeography, the density of development, the age of public streets, their \nwidth, what other plumbing is under the street, the kind of surfacing \nthe street has, et cetera.\n  The city attorney anticipates that whenever application of routine, \nlocal requirements interfere with the schedule or convenience of a \ntelecommunications supplier, subsection (d), the provision we hope to \nstrike, would authorize a cable company to seek FCC preemption. Any \ntime they did not like the time and location of excavation to preserve \neffective traffic flow or to prevent hazardous road conditions, or \nminimize noise impacts, they could appeal to the FCC.\n  If they did not like an order to relocate facilities to accommodate a \npublic improvement project, like the installation, repair, or \nreplacement of water, sewer, our public transportation facilities, they \nwould appeal.\n  If they did not like a requirement to utilize trenches owned by the \ncity or another utility in order to avoid repeated excavation of \nheavily traveled streets, they would appeal.\n  If they did not like being required to place their facilities \nunderground rather than overhead, consistent with the requirements \nimposed on other utilities, they could appeal.\n  If they were required to pay fees prior to installing any facility to \ncover the costs of reviewing plans and inspecting excavation work, they \ncould appeal.\n  If they did not like being asked to pay fees to recover an \nappropriate share of increased street repair and paving costs that \nresult from repeated excavation, they would appeal.\n  If they did not like the particular kinds of excavation equipment or \ntechniques that a city mandate that they use, they could appeal.\n  If they did not like the indemnification, they could appeal.\n  The city attorney is right, that preemption would severely undermine \nlocal governments' ability to apply locally tailored requirements on a \nuniform basis.\n  Small cities are placed at risk and oppose the preemption because \nsmall cities are often financially strapped. As the city attorney of \nRedondo Beach, a suburb of Los Angeles writes, every time there is an \nappeal, they would have to find funds to come back to Washington to \nfight an appeal at the FCC.\n  Recently, the engineering design center at San Francisco State \nUniversity, conducted an interesting study for San Francisco on the \nimpact of street cuts on public roads. The expected life and value of \npublic roads and streets directly correlates with the number of cuts \ninto the road.\n  Although this is rather dull and esoteric to some, the study reveals \nthat streets with three to nine utility cuts are expected to require \nresurfacing every 18 years, a 30-percent reduction in service life, \nrelative to streets with less than three cuts. The more road cuts, the \nsteeper the decline in value of the public's asset will be. Streets \nwith more than nine cuts are expected to require resurfacing every 13 \nyears, a 50-percent reduction in the service life of streets with less \nthan three cuts.\n  An even more dramatic decline in a street's useful life is found on \nheavily traveled arterial streets with heavy wheel traffic. For those \nstreets, the anticipated useful life declines even more rapidly, from \n26 years for streets with fewer than three cuts to 17 years for streets \nwith three to nine cuts, a 35-percent reduction, to 12 years for \nstreets with more than nine cuts, a 54-percent reduction.\n  What does this mean? It means that financially struggling cities and \ncounties will undoubtedly be forced to include in franchise fees, \ncharges to allow the recovery of the additional maintenance \nrequirements that constantly cutting into streets requires. The \nexemption means that every time a cable operator does not like it, the \nWashington staff of the cable operator is going to file a complaint \nwith the FCC and the city has to send a delegation back to fight that \ncomplaint. It should not be this way. Cities should have control over \ntheir streets. Counties should have control over their roads. States \nshould have control over their highways.\n  The right-of-way is the most valuable real estate the public owns. \nState, city, and county investments in right-of-way infrastructure was \n$86 billion in 1993 alone. Of the $86 billion, more than $22 billion \nrepresents the cost of maintaining these existing roadways. These State \nand local governments are entitled to be able to protect the public's \ninvestment in infrastructure. Exempting communication providers from \npaying the full costs they impose on State and local governments for \nthe use of public right-of-way creates a subsidy to be paid for by \ntaxpayers and other businesses that have no exemptions.\n   [[Page S8171]] I would also like to point out the preemption will \nchange the outcome in some of the dispute between communication \ncompanies and cities and States. The FCC is the Nation's \ntelecommunications experts. But they do not have the broad experience \nand concerns a mayor, a city council, a board of supervisors, or a \nGovernor would have in negotiating and weighing a cable agreement and \nsetting a cable fee.\n  If the preemption provision remains, a city would be forced to \nchallenge the FCC ruling to gain a fair hearing in Federal court.\n  This is important because presently they can go directly to their \nlocal Federal court. Under the preemption, a city, State, or county \ngovernment would have to come to the Federal court in Washington after \nan appeal to the FCC.\n  A city appealing an adverse ruling by the FCC would appear before the \nD.C. Federal Appeals Court rather than in the Federal district court of \nthe locality involved. Further, the Federal court will evaluate a very \ndifferent legal question--whether the FCC abused their discretion in \nreaching its determination. The preemption will force small cities to \ndefend themselves in Washington, and many will be just unable to afford \nthe cost.\n  By contrast, if no preemption exists, the cable company may challenge \nthe city or State action directly to the Federal court in the locality \nand the court will review whether the city or State acted reasonably \nunder the circumstances.\n  Edward Perez, assistant city attorney for Los Angeles, states this \nwill be a very difficult standard to reverse, if they have to come to \nWashington. On matters involving communication issues, courts are \nlikely to require a tough, heightened scrutiny standard for matters \ninvolving first amendment rights involving freedom of speech. Courts \nare likely to defer to the FCC judgment.\n  The FCC proceeding and its appeal in Washington will be very \ndifferent from the Federal court action in a locality. Both the city \nand the communications company are more likely to be able to develop a \nmore complete and thorough record if the proceeding is before the local \nFederal court rather than before a Government body in Washington.\n  We also believe the FCC lacks the expertise to address cities' \nconcerns. As I said, if you have a city that is complicated in \ntopography, that is very hilly, that is very old, that has very narrow \nstreets, where the surfacing may be fragile, where there are earthquake \nproblems, you are going to have different requirements on a cable \nentity constantly opening and recutting the streets. The fees should be \nable to reflect these regional and local distinctions.\n  Mr. President, this stack of letters opposing the preemption includes \nvirtually every California city and virtually every major city in every \nState.\n  What the cities and the States tell us they want us to give local \ngovernments the opportunity for home rule on questions affecting their \npublic rights-of-way. If the cable company does not like it, the cable \ncompany can go to court in that jurisdiction. By deleting the \npreemption, we can increase fairness, minimize cost to cities, \ncounties, and States, and prevent an unfunded mandate.\n  If the preemption remains in this bill, it creates a major unfunded \nmandate for cities, for counties, and for States. I hope this body will \nsustain the cities and the counties and the States, and strike the \npreemption.\n  So I ask unanimous consent to have a number of letters printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objections, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Office of the City Attorney,\n\n                                   Los Angeles, CA, June 12, 1995.\n     Re S. 652, Section 245(d) Preemption.\n     Mr. Kevin Cronin,\n     Office of Senator Diane Feinstein,\n     Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Cronin: You asked for our thoughts regarding S. \n     652, Sec. 254(d), which would create broad preemption rights \n     in the FCC with respect to actions taken by local \n     governments. Specifically, you are interested as to how \n     section 254(d) could frustrate the ability of local \n     government to manage its rights of way as Congress believes \n     Local Government should (See Sec. 254(c)) and how it could \n     prevent Local Government from imposing competitively neutral \n     requirements on telecommunications providers to preserve and \n     advance Universal Service, protect the public safety and \n     welfare and to ensure the continued quality of \n     telecommunications services and safeguard the rights of \n     consumers. (See Sec. 254(b)).\n       Section 254(d) would permit the Federal Communications \n     Commission (``FCC'') to preempt local government:\n       ``(d) preemption.--If, after notice and an opportunity for \n     public comment, the Commission determined that a State or \n     local government has permitted or imposed any statute, \n     regulation, or legal requirement that violates or is \n     inconsistent with this section, the Commission shall \n     immediately preempt the enforcement of such statute, \n     regulation, or legal requirement to the extent necessary to \n     correct such violation or inconsistency.''\n       Section 254(d) reposes sweeping review powers in the FCC \n     and in effect converts a federal administrative agency into a \n     federal administrative Court. The FCC literally would have \n     the power to review any local government action it wishes \n     (either sua\n      sponte or at the request of the industry.) The undesirable \n     consequence of this result will be that a federal agency--\n     with personnel who do not answer directly to public--will \n     be dictating in fine detail what rules local government \n     and their citizens in distant places shall have to follow. \n     The FCC would be given plenary power to decide what \n     actions of local government are ``inconsistent with'' the \n     very broad provisions in the bill and, without further \n     review, to decide to nullify or preempt such governmental \n     actions. That is unprecedented and for reaching authority \n     for a federal agency to have over local government.\n       The FCC does have an important role to play in the scheme \n     of things. It has a professional staff with proven expertise \n     in telecommunications matters such as technical requirements. \n     Moreover, issues that transcend state borders need the FCC as \n     the overseer in order to ensure consistency and fairness \n     between the states. On the other hand, the FCC is not in the \n     best position to know what is best for citizens at the local \n     level regarding local issues. An example of a singularly \n     local issue, historically recognized by Congress and the \n     Courts, is the local government's right to manage the public \n     right-of-way (See Section 254(c)). Federal officials do not \n     have an adequate understanding of local issues nor do they \n     have the staff, either in size or proficiency, to resolve \n     local issues about every city in this country. Local \n     Governments and the local courts (entities which are \n     knowledgeable about local issues) should be the forum for \n     resolution of local issues.\n       An important point that needs to be explicated to Congress \n     is the procedural problems associated with the FCC resolving \n     local issues in Washington. First is the obvious problem. \n     Most citizens, community groups and cities do not have the \n     financial wherewithal to litigate before a federal agency \n     located in Washington. Even if an action of the FCC is \n     reviewed by the Courts, that also would occur in the \n     Washington D.C. Circuit miles away. Section 254(d) does \n     contain due process language and such a provision may meet \n     the technical requirements of the U.S. Constitution. However, \n     the provision ``If, after notice and an opportunity for \n     public comments * * *'' provides little solace for local \n     governments and its citizens. The FCC all too often provides \n     too little time to respond to its rules and rulemaking \n     proceedings for anyone other than the expensive FCC Bar. It \n     is impractical for local people to respond in a timely \n     fashion and FCC preemption consequently precludes the voice \n     of those most effected.\n       Second, as a general rule the courts pay great difference \n     to administrative agencies that are created for specific \n     purposes.\n      There is no argument with that proposition because of the \n     proven expertise of federal agencies in matters properly \n     within their purview. However, a serious problem is \n     created when a federal administrative agency is given \n     power over issues where it has little expertise, such as \n     the management of local rights-of-way. This is largely so \n     because of the legal standards for review of \n     administrative decisions. Generally, a decision will stand \n     unless the agency has abused its discretion or has \n     exceeded its authority.\n       Again, for matters properly within an agency's purview \n     there is no quarrel. However, the sweeping review powers that \n     Section 254(d) places in the FCC would in essence permit the \n     FCC to preempt any statute, regulation, or legal requirement \n     that it believes is inconsistent with the Section 254(a) of \n     the Act. This awesome power clearly belongs with the Courts \n     and not distant administrative staffers. As written, it will \n     be extremely difficult for a court to find that the FCC has \n     exceeded its authority. Consequently, with regard to this \n     standard its decisions may in effect be unreviewable.\n       Equally troublesome is the abuse of discretion standard \n     applied to federal agency actions. Practitioners in \n     administrative law know all too well that the courts will \n     uphold administrative decisions the vast majority of the \n     time. A reversal occurs only when there is a clear abuse of \n     discretion, a condition infrequently found by the Courts.\n       The bottom line becomes very clear to local governments, \n     such as Los Angeles, and its citizens. Control regarding \n     telecommunications and zoning issues will be exercised by \n     federal officials three thousand miles away. Individuals who \n     know little or nothing about local interests. the important \n     everyday decisions that should be made by local officials and \n     that should be reviewable by local [[Page S8172]] courts, \n     will be made by faceless names in Washington.\n       In addition, because if the procedural structure of the \n     FCC, the normal right to cross-examine witnesses and their \n     testimony is not present. The right to comment and reply to \n     another interested party's comments theorically permits the \n     FCC to make a fair and impartial judgment. However, the \n     comments are not under oath and the testimony that is filed \n     under penalty of perjury is never is reality tested for truth \n     and accuracy. The practical effect is that anybody may say \n     anything they wish with impunity. The decisionmakers, \n     therefore, may be misled into believing erroneous ``facts''. \n     This view is not intended to suggest that the courts are the \n     answer for all issues. There exist some practical problems \n     with the courts; they may be too slow and they may lack\n      the technical expertise. However, Section 254(d) appears to \n     effectively eliminate the courts because of the absence of \n     any real or effective review of FCC decisions. Senate Bill \n     652 must be amended to leave local issues to local \n     government and thereby permit local citizens, local \n     governments and local courts to be active participants in \n     the resolution of local issues.\n       Finally, the industry has clearly captured the decision \n     making of officials at the FCC. In recent years the voice of \n     local governments and its citizens have been routinely \n     rejected by the FCC and the industry appears to have a \n     lopsided influence.\n       We recommend that Section 254(d) be eliminated in its \n     entirety. If that is accomplished, violations of S. 652 will \n     be decided in the forum properly equipped to do so--the local \n     Federal Courts.\n       As an additional note, we wish to comment that section (a) \n     of S. 652 also represents a serious and significant invasion \n     of local government authority over local interests. Most any \n     action taken by local government in this area can be \n     construed as having ``the effect of prohibiting'' an entity \n     from providing telecommunications services. Surely more \n     precise wording can be developed which would not so \n     significantly erode the power of local government over local \n     matters. Please advise if you would like further comment \n     regarding this section.\n       If I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate \n     to call on me.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Edward J. Perez,\n     Assistant City Attorney.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                          Office of City Attorney,\n\n\n                             City and County of San Francisco,\n\n                                                    June 12, 1995.\n     Re Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to commend you for \n     sponsoring an amendment to the telecommunications bill to \n     preserve local control over the public rights of way. It is \n     critical to local governments that subsection (d) of proposed \n     47 U.S.C. Section 254, which would authorize the FCC to \n     preempt state and local authority, be deleted from the bill.\n       In San Francisco, as in other cities, we welcome the \n     prospect of new telecommunications providers making expanded \n     services available on a competitive basis. However, \n     deregulation only increases the importance of local control \n     over our streets because it brings many new companies seeking \n     to install facilities in our streets.\n       City laws now require all street excavators--including \n     telecommunications providers--to comply with \n     nondiscriminatory local laws designed to preserve the public \n     health and safety and minimize the costs to the public of \n     repeated street excavation. Throughout the country, such \n     local laws are tailored to the specific characteristics of \n     each local community, including local geography, density of \n     development and the age of public streets and facilities. The \n     language of subsection (d) would severely undermine local \n     government ability to apply such locally tailored \n     requirements on a uniform basis.\n       Whenever application of routine local requirements \n     interferes with the schedule or convenience of a \n     telecommunications supplier, subsection (d) would authorize \n     the company to seek FCC preemption. To identify just a few \n     examples, my colleague city attorneys and I will have to send \n     an attorney off to Washington every time a telecommunications \n     company challenges our authority to:\n       (1) Regulate the time or location of excavation to preserve \n     effective traffic flow, prevent hazardous road conditions, or \n     minimize noise impacts;\n       (2) Require a company to relocate its facilities to \n     accommodate a public improvement project, like the \n     installation, repair or replacement of water, sewer or public \n     transportation facilities;\n       (3) Require a company to place facilities in joint trenches \n     owned by the City or another utility company in order to \n     avoid repeated excavation of heavily traveled streets;\n       (4) Require a company to place its facilities underground, \n     rather than overhead, consistent with the requirements \n     imposed on other utility companies;\n       (5) Require a company to pay fees prior to installing any \n     facilities to cover the costs of reviewing plans and \n     inspecting excavation work;\n       (6) Require a company to pay fees to recover an appropriate \n     share of the increased street repair and paving costs that \n     result from repeated excavation;\n       (7) Require a company to use particular kinds of excavation \n     equipment or techniques suited to local circumstances to \n     minimize the risk of major public health and safety hazards;\n       (8) Enforce local zoning regulations; and\n       (9) Require a company to indemnify the City against any \n     claims of injury arising from the company's excavation.\n       All of the requirements described above are routinely \n     imposed by local governments in exercise of our \n     responsibility to manage the public rights of way. Granting \n     special favors to telecommunications suppliers, compared for \n     example to other utility companies, will undermine the \n     uniformity of local law and could dramatically increase the \n     costs to local taxpayers of maintaining public streets.\n       In these times, when the federal government is asking state \n     and local governments to take on many additional duties, the \n     FCC should not be empowered to interfere in this area of \n     classic local authority. This is especially true because, for \n     many cities, the FCC is a remote, costly and burdensome arena \n     in which to resolve disputes. The courts are well-suited to \n     resolve any disputes that may arise from the ``Removal of \n     Barriers to Entry'' language of Section 254 without placing \n     heavy burdens on local governments.\n       I appreciate the leadership you have shown on this \n     difficult issue. Please let me know if I can offer any \n     further assistance with your efforts on behalf of cities.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Louise H. Renne,\n                                                    City Attorney.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am honored to join my friend from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, in this amendment. This is not the first \ntime we have teamed up together. I think perhaps our background as both \nbeing former mayors has allowed us to bring to this position some \nperspective to help us realize, with regard to local and State \ngovernments, how this Federal-State-local partnership really ought to \nbe ordered.\n  The Senator from California was very helpful when we brought forward \nthe bill, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, which the majority \nleader had designated Senate bill 1, and which allowed me to team up \nwith the Senator from Ohio, John Glenn. In March of this year, as you \nknow, Mr. President, that unfunded mandates legislation was signed into \nlaw.\n  Part of that new law in essence says that Federal agencies must \ndevelop a process to enable elected and other officials of State, \nlocal, and tribal units of government to provide input when Federal \nagencies are developing regulations.\n  The conference report of that legislation passed overwhelmingly. In \nthe Senate it was 91 to 9. In the House it was 394 to 28.\n  An overwhelming majority said in essence enough is enough, that the \nFederal Government must reestablish a partnership with local \ngovernment. It is very straightforward. This movement toward local \nempowerment has consistently been expressed in the legislative reform \noccurring in both Houses of Congress. But I feel, as I think the \nSenator from California feels, that this provision in this \ntelecommunications bill is causing a slippage back to our old habits. \nWhat we have before us in section 254 of the bill before us is a \nreversal of the positive progress that we have been making.\n  As the Senator from California pointed out, in subsection (d) the \ncommittee has added broad and ambiguous FCC preemption language that \nstates, if the FCC ``determines that a State or local government has \npermitted or imposed any statute, regulation, or legal requirement that \nviolates or is inconsistent with this section, the FCC shall \nimmediately preempt the enforcement of such statute, regulation, or \nlegal requirement to the extent necessary to correct such violation or \ninconsistency.''\n  We are going to give this power to the FCC over the jurisdictions of \nthe local communities and the State governments. This is a disturbing \ndirective that instructs the Federal Commission to invalidate duly \nadopted State laws and local ordinances that the independent Commission \nmay deem inappropriate. This preemption would be generated by a \ncommission that in a majority of cases would be thousands of miles away \nfrom the local government jurisdiction that would be affected by their \ndecision.\n  I know of no one in local government who objects to the language \nwhich ensures nondiscriminatory access to the [[Page S8173]] public \nright of way. But what they do vigorously object to is that this \nproposed FCC preemption does not allow them the prerogative to manage \ntheir right of way in a manner that they deem to be appropriate and in \nthe best interest of their community.\n  If I may, Mr. President, let me give you an example. When I was the \nmayor of Boise, ID, we had a particular project that on the main \nstreet, on Idaho Street, from store front to store front, we took \neverything out 3 feet below the surface and we put in brand new \nutilities. I think it was something like 11 different utilities all \nbeing coordinated, put in at the same time, then building it back up, \nnew sidewalks, curbs, gutters, paving of the main street. I will tell \nyou, Mr. President, that there is no way in the world that the FCC, \n3,000 miles away, could have coordinated that.\n  I think one of the things that you hear so often if you are in local \ngovernment or if you tune into the radio talk shows, is when a new \nstreet has been paved, within 6 months you see crews out there cutting \ninto that new pavement, and they are putting in a new utility. That is \nexpensive, and it is unnecessary if you can coordinate things. Surely, \nwe do not think that an independent commission in Washington, DC, is \ngoing to be able to better coordinate that than the local government in \nSan Francisco or the local government in Boise, ID. It just does not \nhappen.\n  This proposed preemption is based on two assumptions. First, that it \nis the role of the Federal Government to tell others what to do; \nsecond, that local units of government are not capable or responsible \nenough to make the right decisions. I reject both of those \npresumptions.\n  Like the Senator from California, with the hands-on experience that \nshe has had at the local government level, we realize that Federal \nsolutions do not always meet local problems. You have to take into \naccount the local conditions and the local innovations. These Federal \nsolutions have not worked in the past. They are not working now. They \nwill not work in the future.\n  So why would we step back with all of the progress that we have been \nmaking this congressional session in reordering the partnership between \nthe Federal, the State and the local governments in a working \npartnership?\n  This language which introduces expanded FCC jurisdiction into the \nlocal decisionmaking process is ill-conceived, and it should not be \nincluded in the final language of this important legislation. Our \namendment would strike the offending subsection in its entirety. This \nwould leave control of local right of way matters with local elected \nofficials, which is exactly where it belongs.\n  The goal of Congress in regulatory reform should be to remove \nexisting Federal roadblocks that limit productivity and creativity and \ninnovation. We should legislate in a manner that enhances Federal-local \nintergovernmental partnerships for mutually beneficial results. We \nshould not be guilty of imposing new, unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles \nas has been done in this case.\n  So, again, I am so proud to join the Senator from California in this \neffort. We make a good team. This is a worthy effort to team up with \nbecause this present preemption needs to be removed from the \ntelecommunications bill.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nIdaho for those excellent remarks. I think he hit the nail on the head \nwith respect to the rights of local government, and the way in which \nthis Congress is moving. This preemption sets all of our progress \nregarding the relationship between Federal and local government back, \nand hurts cities, counties, and States in the process.\n  So I want the Senator to know how much I enjoy working with him on \nthis. I thank him very much.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I reluctantly rise in opposition to this \namendment from two of my most respected colleagues in the Senate. The \nissue addressed in this amendment goes to the very heart of S. 652, \neliminating barriers to market entry.\n  In the case of section 254, which I have here in front of me, \nentitled ``Removal of Barriers to Entry,'' we do preempt any State or \nlocal regulation or statute or State or local legal requirement that \nmay prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any \nentity to provide telecommunications services.\n  The actual authority granted to the FCC in subsection (d) is critical \nto ensuring that State and local authorities do not get in a way that \nprecludes or has the effect of precluding new entry by firms providing \nnew telecommunications services. At the same time, make no mistake \nabout it, the authority granted in subsections (b) and (c) to the State \nand local authorities respectively in turn protect them. For example, \nin subsection (c) it says, ``Nothing in this section affects the \nauthority of local government to manage the public rights of way.''\n  Mr. President, this is a particularly difficult problem because all \nof us want to leave authority with State and local government. But this \nis a deregulatory bill to allow companies to enter and to compete \nwithout barriers. If this section were allowed to fall, it could mean \nthat certain requirements would be placed on companies, such as public \nservice projects or certain types of payments of one sort or another \nfor a local universal service, or whatever. We are trying to deregulate \nthe telecommunications markets in the United States. I know it sounds \ngreat to say let every city and municipality have a virtual veto power \nover what is occurring in their area.\n  Now, it is my strongest feeling that sections (b) and (c) to the \nState and local authorities, respectively, are more than sufficient to \ndeal in a fair-handed and balanced manner with legitimate concerns of \nState and local authority. Sections (b) and (c) take into account State \nand local government authority, (b) says:\n\n       State Regulatory Authority. Nothing in this section shall \n     affect the ability of a State to impose, on a competitively \n     neutral basis and consistent with section 253, requirements \n     necessary to preserve and advance universal service, protect \n     the public safety and welfare, ensure the continued quality \n     of telecommunications services and safeguard the rights of \n     consumers.\n\n  Section (c):\n\n       Local Government Authority. Nothing in this section affects \n     the authority of a local government to manage the public \n     rights of way or to require fair and reasonable compensation \n     from telecommunications providers, on a competitively neutral \n     and nondiscriminatory basis, for use of public rights of way \n     on a nondiscriminatory basis if the compensation required is \n     publicly disclosed by such Government.\n\n  Now, the preemption clause (d) reads as follows:\n\n       If, after notice and an opportunity for public comment, the \n     Commission determines that a State or local government has \n     permitted or imposed any statute, regulation, or legal \n     requirement that violates or is inconsistent with this \n     section, the Commission shall immediately preempt the \n     enforcement of such statute, regulation, or legal requirement \n     to the extent necessary to correct such violation or \n     inconsistency.\n\n  The intent therefore is to leave protected State regulatory \nauthority, to leave protected local government authority, but there \nhave to be some cases of preemption or a certain city could impose a \nrequirement of some sort or another that would be very anticompetitive, \nand that is where we come out.\n  I have joined in a lot of efforts here to ensure that our State and \nlocal authority be preserved. And I understand there will possibly be a \nsecond-degree amendment. We have worked closely with Senator Hutchison \nand the city, county, and State officials to achieve this balance. That \nis where the committee came out.\n  I feel very strongly that it is a fair balance. It takes into account \nState regulatory authority, takes into account local government \nauthority. But it also recognizes the need to open up markets, the \nremoval of barriers to entry. In many cases these do become barriers to \nentry, barriers to competition.\n  So I rise in reluctant opposition to the amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  [[Page S8174]]\n  \n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, you have to be sure of foot to be \nopposing two distinguished former mayors. The Senator from California \nis the former mayor of San Francisco, and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Idaho is a former mayor of Boise. Both had outstanding records.\n  But let me suggest that what they have read into the preemption \nsection is a requirement and an idea that just does not exist at all. I \nwill have to agree with them in a flash that the Federal Communications \nCommission has no idea of coordinating, as the Senator from Idaho has \noutlined, the digging up in front of all of the sidewalks and stores \nand everything else, putting in the regular necessary conduit, \nrefirming the soil and the sidewalks again in front. We have no idea of \nthe FCC doing it.\n  Let us tell you how this comes about. Section 254 is the removal of \nthe barriers to entry, and that is exactly the intent of the Congress, \nand it says no Government in Washington should, well, vote against it. \nBut I think the two distinguished Senators are not objecting to the \nremoval of the barriers to entry. What we are trying to do is say, now, \nlet the games begin, and we do not want the States and the local folks \nprohibiting or having any effect of prohibiting the ability of any \nentity to enter interstate or intrastate telecommunications services. \nWhen we provided that, the States necessarily came and said, wait a \nminute, that sounds good, but we have the responsibilities over the \npublic safety and welfare. We have a responsibility along with you with \nrespect to universal service.\n  So what about that? How are we going to do our job with that \noverencompassing general section (a) that you have there. So we said, \nwell, right to the point: ``Nothing in this section shall affect the \nability of a State to impose on a competitively neutral basis''--those \nare the key words there, the States on a competitively neutral basis, \nconsistent with opening it up--``requirements necessary.''\n  We did not want and had no idea of taking away that basic \nresponsibility for protecting the public safety and welfare and also \nproviding and advancing universal service. So that was written in at \nthe request of the States, and they like it. The mayors came, as you \nwell indicate, and they said we have our rights of way and we have to \ncontrol--and every mayor must control the rights of way.\n  So then we wrote in there:\n\n       Nothing shall affect the authority of a local government to \n     manage the public rights of way or to acquire fair and \n     reasonable compensation . . . on a competitively neutral and \n     nondiscriminatory basis.\n\n  ``Competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis.'' Then we said \nfinally, indeed, if they do not do it on a competitively neutral or \nnondiscriminatory basis, we want the FCC to come in there in an \ninjunction. We do not want a district court here interpreting here and \na district court in this hometown and a Federal court in that hometown \nand another Federal court with a plethora of interpretations and \ndifferent rulings and everything else. We are trying to get uniformity, \nunderstanding, open competition in interstate telecommunications--and \nintrastate, of course, telecommunications.\n  Now, that was the intent and that is how it is written. And if our \ndistinguished colleagues have a better way to write it, we would be \nglad and we are open for any suggestion. But somewhere, sometime in \nthis law when you say categorically you are going to remove all the \nbarriers to entry, we went, I say to the Senator, with the experience \nof the cable TV. I sat around this town--I was in an advantaged section \nup near the cathedral. I had the cable TV service, but two-thirds of \nthe city of Washington here did not have it for years on end because we \nknow how these councils work. We know how in many a city the cable \nfolks took care of just a couple of influential councilmen, and they \nwould not give service or could give service or run up the price and \neverything else of that kind.\n  We have had experience here with the mayors coming and asking us. And \nthis is the response. That particular section (c) is in response to the \nrequest of the mayors. If they do not do that, if they put it, not in a \ncompetitively neutral basis or if they put it in a discriminatory \nbasis, then who is to enjoin? And we say the FCC should start it. Let \nus not go through the Administrative Procedures Act. Let us not go \nthrough every individual.\n  Yes, we want those mayors and all to come here and everybody to \nunderstand rules are rules and we are going to play by the rules and \nthe rules protect those mayors to develop, to administer, to \ncoordinate. I agree 100 percent, I say to the Senator from Idaho, that \nthe FCC has never performed the job of a city mayor. But they shall and \nmust perform this job here of removing the barriers to entry. And if we \ndo not have them doing it, then I will yield the floor and listen to \nwhat suggestion they have. But do not overread the preemption section \nto other than centralizing the authority and responsibility in the FCC \nto make sure, like they have in administering all the other rules \nrelative to communications here and all the other entities involved in \ntelecommunications, they have that authority to make sure while the \ncities got their rights of way, while the States have got their public \nwelfare and public interest sections to administer, that it is done on \na nondiscriminatory basis.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to respond to my two \nfriends, the floor managers of this bill, and then I know the Senator \nfrom California would also like to respond.\n  They referenced, of course, section 254, which is removal of barriers \nto entry. That is the section and that is the key. They stated it:\n\n       That no State, local statute or regulation or other State \n     or local legal requirement may prohibit or have the effect of \n     prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any \n     interstate or intrastate telecommunications services.\n\n  Period. Period. And nothing in this amendment alters that at all. We \naffirm that. It is my impression, Mr. President, that when it is \nreferenced that section (b), State regulatory authority, yes, the \nStates feel that that language is good; and section (c), local \ngovernment authority, yes, mayors had something to do with the writing \nof that language. They feel good about that. But the problem is, then \nyou go on to section (d) which, it is my understanding, came very late \nin the process. In section (d), there is this line that says: ``The \nCommission shall immediately preempt * * *''\n  We see this so many times with Federal legislation: On the one hand, \nwe give but, on the other hand, we take it away. In section (b) and \nsection (c) we give, but, by golly, we have section (d) that then says \nthat this Commission will immediately preempt. That is the problem. We \nare not saying that we should not be held accountable to this. That is \nwhy there is no language in this amendment to alter the opening \nstatement of section 254. No problem. It is section (d) that then comes \nright along and, after everything has been said, preempts and pulls the \nplug, and that is wrong. We should not do this to our local and State \npartners. It is absolutely wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, my colleague from Idaho took the words \nright out of my mouth. I think he is exactly right in his \ninterpretation of this section. The barrier for entry is clearly done \naway with by this section. Nothing Senator Kempthorne or I would do \nwould change that. What we do change, however, is simply delete the \nability of a remote technical commission to overturn a city decision \nand create an enormous hassle for cities all across this Nation.\n  I would like to just give you the exact wording of what the city \nattorney of Los Angeles said this section does. He says:\n\n       It proposes sweeping review powers for the FCC and, in \n     effect, converts a Federal administrative agency into a \n     Federal administrative court. The FCC literally would have \n     the power to review any local government action it wishes, \n     either on its own or at the request of the industry.\n       A Federal agency, with personnel who do not directly \n     respond to the public, will be dictating in fine detail what \n     rules local government and their citizens across the country \n     shall have to follow. The FCC would be [[Page S8175]] given \n     plenary power to decide what actions of local government are \n     ``inconsistent with'' the very broad provisions in the bill \n     and, without further review, hold the authority to nullify or \n     preempt state and local governmental actions. That is an \n     unprecedented and far-reaching authority for a Federal agency \n     to have over local government.\n\n  I could not agree more. Senator Kempthorne and I were both mayors at \none time and we both understand that every city has different needs \nwhen it comes to cable television.\n  I remember as the mayor of San Francisco when Viacom came into the \ncity. It wired just the affluent sections of the city. It refused to \nwire the poorer areas of the city. Unless local government had the \nright to require that kind of wiring, it was not going to be done at \nall. That is just one small area with which I think everyone can \nidentify.\n  But when it comes to the rights-of-way and what is under city \nstreets, the city must be in the position to set rules and regulations \nby which its street can be cut. This preemption gives the FCC the right \nto simply waive any local rulemaking and say that is not going to be \nthe case. It gives the FCC the right to waive any local fee and say, \n``That's not the way it is going to be.''\n  That is why countless cities and counties across the country, not \njust one or two, but virtually all of the big organizations, including \nthe League of Cities, the national Governors, local officials and \nothers, say, ``Don't do this.'' If a cable company has a problem with \nanything we in local government do, let them go to court. Let a court \nin our jurisdiction settle the issue. I think that is the right way to \ngo. For the life of me, I have a hard time understanding why people \nwould want to preempt these local decisions with the technical, far-\nremoved FCC agency.\n  So I think Senator Kempthorne has well outlined the situation. I \nthink we have made our case.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished colleague from Idaho \nsaid ``came so late in the process.'' I want to correct that thought. I \nam referring back over a year ago to a bill with 19 cosponsors, this \nsame language:\n\n       * * * the Commission determines that a State or local \n     government has permitted or imposed any statute, regulation, \n     or legal requirement that violates or is inconsistent with \n     this subsection, the Commission shall immediately preempt the \n     enforcement of such statute, regulation, or legal requirement \n     to the extent necessary to correct such violation or \n     inconsistency.\n\n  It did not come late in the process. We have been working with mayors \nand we have several former mayors who were cosponsors. That was S. \n1822. So this is S. 652, which is, of course, over a year subsequent \nthereto.\n  Is it the language that is inconsistent with this subsection? Is that \nthe bothersome part? It sort of bothers this Senator. I think if you \nare going to violate your authority with respect to being neutral and \nnondiscriminatory and you have to have somewhere this authority, in the \nentity of the FCC, to do it rather than the courts, each with a \nplethora of different interpretations and law, I would think if we \ncould take that, maybe that would satisfy the distinguished Senator \nfrom California and the Senator from Idaho.\n  I yield the floor. I make that as a suggestion.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I appreciate the good efforts of the \nSenator from South Carolina, because I have always found him to be a \ngentleman whom I can work with and we can find areas on which we can \nsee some common ground.\n  With regard to my comment that it came late in the process, this may \nbe a concept that had been discussed quite a bit, but the mayors that \nthe Senator from South Carolina referenced, it was local officials who \ntold me that this particular language of (d) was not in the draft \nbill's language, it was not part of the draft bill when it came out. \nAnd it was really after Senator Hutchison from Texas, who raised this \nissue, had section (c) added that (d) then came back.\n  I do not know, it may have been something that has been discussed for \nsome months, but as far as putting it in the bill, it was not there.\n  The other point then about how do we deal with this, again, Senator \nFeinstein and I are in absolute agreement that with respect to this \nwhole issue of removal of barriers to entry, if there are problems, if \na cable company is getting a bad deal and being put off by a local \ngovernment, they can go to court, but they go to court in that area, \nthey do not have to come to Washington, DC.\n  The avenue for remedy already exists, so why do we then say, again, \neveryone must come to Washington, DC?\n  That is expensive. I think it is unnecessary and these cable \ncompanies, if there had been particular problems and there is a trend, \nthey can establish a precedence in the court, and I think the local \ncommunities are going to realize if there is something wrong, they will \nnot do it again because they will lose in court. I think the spirit in \nwhich Senator Feinstein and I have joined in this is on behalf of State \nand local governments, that they are going to own up to their \nresponsibilities. Let us not make them come to Washington, DC, and not \nmake every one of them subject to the FCC in Washington, DC.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I wanted to speak very briefly on this. \nI know our whip is here with some business.\n  First of all, I think we have to put this in context. As Senator \nHollings has pointed out, this section has been the result of hours and \ndays of negotiations with city officials. It was in S. 1822 last year, \nand it is here. I think we have to take a step back and look at some of \nthe cable deals and problems that have occurred in our cities. The \ncities have granted exclusive franchises in some cases and are not \nallowing competition. They have required certain programming be put on \nand other requirements on those companies.\n  Our States have granted, in the telephone area, certain exclusive \nfranchises, not allowing competition. And the point is, if we are \nhaving deregulation here, removal of barriers to entry, we have to take \nthis step. I think that is very important for us to considerate this \npoint.\n  Now, section 254 goes to the very heart of this bill, because removal \nof barriers to entry is what we are trying to accomplish with this \nbill. We preempt any State or local regulation or statute or State or \nlocal legal requirement that may prohibit or have the effect of \nprohibiting the ability of any entity to provide telecommunications \nservices.\n  The authority granted to the FCC in subsection (d) is critical if we \nare going to open those markets, because a lot of States and cities and \nlocal governments may well engage in certain practices that encourage a \nmonopoly or that demand certain things from the business trying to do \nbusiness. That would not be in the public interest.\n  At the same time, make no mistake about it, Mr. President, the \nauthority granted in subsection (b) and (c) to the State and local \nauthorities, respectively, are more than sufficient to deal in a \nfairhanded and balanced manner with legitimate concerns of State and \nlocal authority. These were negotiated out with State and local \nauthorities.\n  We have worked closely with Senator Hutchison and the city, county, \nand State officials to strike a balance. We have gone to great pains \nand length to deal with concerns of the cities, counties, and State \ngovernments that are legitimately raised. We dealt with the concerns in \nsubsection (b) and (c), while at the same time setting up a procedure \nto preempt where local and State officials act in an anticompetitive \nway, by taking action which prohibits, or the effect of prohibiting, \nentry by new firms in providing telecommunications services.\n  Now, the real problem created by the amendment offered by my friends, \nSenators Feinstein and Kempthorne, is that the very certainty which we \nare trying to establish with this legislation is put at risk. \nCertainty. A company has to go out and wonder if that local city or \nState will put some requirement on it to provide some kind of \nprogramming, or even to do something in [[Page S8176]] the city to \nprovide some service, or if it will grant an exclusive monopoly. What \nwe are trying to get are barriers to entry, and we are reserving to the \nState and local governments certain authorities. So the certainty we \nare looking for we have taken away--no guarantee that entry barriers \nwill be toppled and no guarantee of uniformity across the country.\n  The committee has dealt with federalism concerns throughout this \nlegislation. Let me say that this debate goes to the heart of a \ntechnical detail of federalism and the Federal Government's \nrelationship to State and local government. It is one of the most \ncomplicated areas of this bill. Believe me, it is hard to strike a \nbalance. But if we strike this out, it gives every city in the country \nthe right to put up barriers to entry. It lets every State have the \nright to have a monopoly unless they can extract something for the \nState in one way or another. I would not blame cities and States. If we \ndo that, it goes to the very heart of this bill.\n  Now, I take a back seat to no one in advocating federalism \nprinciples. I like much power in the State and local government. It \nmust be balanced with our other goal--removing the anticompetitive \nrestrictions at the local level which restrict competition. Exclusive \nfranchising in the cable and telephone markets is the very way that \nestablished monopolies in the past.\n  So, to conclude my statements on this, I understand that there may be \na possible second-degree amendment to this tomorrow that would deal \nwith the language on line 8 on page 55, ``preemption,'' which would \ndeal with the words, or is consistent with. But I am not certain that \nthat second degree will be offered.\n  In any event, to conclude, this particular section of the bill goes \nto the heart of dealing with the federalism issue. Are we going to \nallow the cities and the State to put up barriers of entry to \ntelecommunications firms? In the past, we have done so, with cable \ntelevision. We have allowed cities not only to add a franchise fee, but \nalso to require certain programming, and sometimes the companies do \nsomething else for the city as an incentive.\n  In telephones, we have allowed our States to set up a monopoly in the \nState and sometimes to collect certain things or to put certain \nrequirements on. In this bill, S. 652, we are trying to deregulate, \nopen up markets, and we are trying to let that fresh air of competition \ncome forward. If our companies and our investors have the uncertainty \nof not knowing what every city will do, of not knowing what every State \nwill do and each State legislature and each city council may change, \nthe companies will be in the position of having to endlessly lobby city \nofficials and State officials on these issues--not only that, at any \ntime certainty is taken out.\n  This bill, S. 652--if we pass it--will provide a clear roadmap with \ncertainty for competition. It will create an explosion of a new \ninvestment in telecommunications and new jobs and new techniques. And \nit will help consumers with lower telephone rates and lower cable \nrates. It has been carefully crafted and worked out in close to 90 \nnights of meetings, and on Saturdays and Sundays, plus last year, a \nwhole year, plus a lot of Senators' input. I know it sounds good to \ngive the power to the city and the State, and I am usually for that. In \nthis case, we reserve powers to the city and State, but we very firmly \nsay that the barrier to entry must be removed.\n  Mr. President, I wish to point out that I think there may be a \nsecond-degree amendment to this tomorrow at some point. I want to give \nSenators notice of that. There may not be. But I rise in opposition to \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do have some business to conduct, \nincluding the closing statement. At this juncture, I would like to do a \ncouple of things, and if the Senator from Nebraska wants to make a \nstatement, I will withhold on the closing unanimous consent.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/12/senate-section/article/S8134-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

A bill to delineate acceptable drug testing methods, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                        drug testing legislation\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which \nwill allow law enforcement to choose from [[Page S8178]] a variety of \ndrug testing processes. I believe that it is important to fight drug \nabuse and supply law enforcement agencies with all the available tools. \nBy expanding the range of acceptable drug testing methods State and \nFederal agencies will be able to weigh the costs and benefits of the \ndifferent processes to determine the one which best suits their needs. \nCongress should not enact legislation that limits drug testing \nalternatives but should let the agencies, with their expertise, make \ninformed choices.\n  This bill will amend the recently passed Violent Crime Control and \nLaw Enforcement Act of 1994 in three areas. The amendments would strike \nthe references to urinalysis as the only drug testing method \nspecifically listed pursuant to conditions of supervised release, \nconditions of parole, conditions of probation, and residential \nsubstance abuse treatment for prisoners. In its place it will include \nbut not limit the choices of testing to: urine, hair, and blood \ntesting. This will ensure that State and local agencies can make use of \ninnovative technology.\n  When drug testing was first introduced, the methods available for \ntesting provided only narrow windows of detection with limited \naccuracy. This bill will encourage law enforcement to incorporate new \ntechnology, such as hair analysis, into their current drug testing \nregimes.\n  Field studies conducted by the National Institute of Justice show \nthat hair analysis is more effective than urine testing in detecting \ncocaine, PCP, and opiate users. Also, this innovative form of drug \ntesting promises to be a less invasive, and potentially more revealing, \nalternative to urine screening. Finally the individual will probably \nfind that snipping a lock of hair is far less offensive than asking for \nurine samples.\n  The bottom line is that drug use among prisoners on probation, \nparole, and early release is a constant concern of law enforcement. If \nthere are means of testing which are reliable and detect abuse over \ngreater time periods then those tests should be available and \nencouraged. The new drug testing technologies have such capability and \nthis bill would simply add them to the list already set forth into law \npursuant to enactment of the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Heflin in \nintroducing this bill on hair analysis. As noted in the January 1993, \n``Research in Brief,'' published by the National Institute of Justice, \n``Hair testing is relatively well established and * * * has several \nadvantages over urine in testing for drugs.''\n  First, hair greatly expands the time window for detection of an \nillicit drug. Generally, urine tests determine if drugs have been used \nin the past 2 to 4 days, but hair provides a 90-day history of \ninformation.\n  Second, brief periods of abstinence from drugs will not significantly \nalter the outcome of hair analysis. Additionally, hair analysis cannot \nbe evaded as in urinalysis, where drug users can substitute clean \nsamples or tamper with specimens. Drug residues remain permanently \nembedded in hair. They cannot be washed or bleached out.\n  Third, hair is easy to handle, and requires no special storage \nfacilities or conditions. Compared with urine samples, it presents \nfewer risks of disease transmission.\n  Fourth, because hair records drug use chronologically and in amounts \nproportional to those consumed, the pattern and quantity of drug abuse \nis also provided.\n  Fifth, collecting comparable samples for repeat testing is easier \nwith hair than with urine; a cosmetically undetectable snip of hair is \neasily collected under close supervision without causing the \nembarrassment of providing a urine sample.\n  Sixth, contaminating or altering a sample to distort or manipulate \ntest results is much more difficult with hair than with urine. \nFurthermore, if the results of the first test are challenged, a second, \nnewly collected sample can be analyzed as a safety net. This is not \npossible with urine because the original 3-day surveillance window will \nhave passed and the subject can merely abstain from drug use in the few \ndays prior to submitting a new sample.\n  In sum, the availability of hair analysis will give law enforcement \nanother tool for drug testing.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S. 915. A bill to govern relations between the United States and the \nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO), to enforce compliance with \nstandards of international conduct, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                middle east peace compliance act of 1995\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Middle East \nPeace Compliance Act of 1995.\n  The fact of the matter is simple. The PLO is not complying with its \nresponsibilities. It has failed to restrain the radicals in Gaza; it \nhas failed to change the PLO Covenant; and it has failed to come clean \nwith the amount of its assets. Most importantly, the PLO's overwhelming \nfailure to restrain the radical elements within its areas of control is \nan insult to Israel and everyone who had placed hope in Yasir Arafat's \nability to deliver the peace. In return for all of this is the fact \nthat the United States will be sending $100 million to the PLO and \nPalestinian authorities over the next year, if the administration is \nallowed to have its way.\n  Mr. President, while it is plain to see that the PLO has not lived up \nto its commitments, despite the State Department's protests to the \ncontrary, one need only to look at the facts to understand the \nsituation. Between September 13, 1993, the signing of the Declaration \nof Principles, and May 4, 1994, the beginning of Gaza-Jericho self-\nrule, there were 373 attacks, with 110 Israelis killed, 70 of them \ncivilians. There are said to be thousands of illegal weapons in the \nGaza-Jericho area, at least 26,000, according to the Israeli newspaper \nMaariv.\n  Furthermore, reports by independent peace monitors, the Judge \nAdvocate General of the Israel Defense Forces [IDF] and the \nCongressional Peace Accords Monitoring [PAM] Group point to an \nadditional and consistently widening pattern of PLO non-compliance that \ninclude:\n  Failure to preempt terrorism;\n  Failure to control the flow of illegal weapons into and inside of \nGaza;\n  Failure to apprehend, prosecute and adequately punish individuals \naccused of criminal or terrorist acts against Israelis;\n  Failure to prevent the illegal diversion of international assistance \nto PLO activities;\n  Failure to restrict the growth of the Palestinian police force in \nGaza which now is conservatively estimated to be 17,000 instead of the \n9,000 permitted by agreement with Israel; and\n  Failure to confine Palestinian administrative offices to\n   Gaza, while allowing them to proliferate, illegally, in Jerusalem.\n\n  It is said that there are networks of terrorist training camps in \nGaza, and there is even film of recruits drilling chanting anti-Israeli \nslogans. Despite sweeping arrests in which the Palestinian authorities \nround up hundreds of Palestinians for questioning in relation to \nvarious bombings, attacks, and other violations, these demonstrations \nof supposed compliance with Israeli complaints amount to just public \nrelations, in the words of Prime Minister Rabin, himself. Soon after, \nmost of these mass arrests, the suspects are let go. Some system of \njustice.\n  As far as the covenant is concerned, the PLO shows no interest in \nabrogating those sections calling for the destruction of Israel. \nDespite promises to do so, the PLO has not even convened the Palestine \nNational Council in order to amend the covenant. All the State \nDepartment can say is that they ``hope that Arafat will do so, and [we] \nhave encouraged him to follow through with this,'' in reference to \nchanging the Covenant. This does not exactly exude confidence or the \nability to influence a change.\n  It is for this reason that I am introducing the Middle East Peace \nCompliance Act of 1995. This legislation places a series of \nrequirements on the PLO before they can receive money from the United \nStates. Briefly, the requirements are as follows:\n  Require that U.S. assistance may only be used for humanitarian \nprojects for the benefit of Palestinians living under the Palestinian \nauthority. All assistance must be channeled only through U.S. \nGovernment agencies or private voluntary organizations \n[PVO's]; [[Page S8179]] \n  Condition any U.S. assistance upon full financial and managerial \naccountability of the Palestinian authority;\n  Require the President to certify that no aid will go to individuals \nsuspected of having harmed American citizens, while requiring that the \nPLO assist in the apprehension of and extradition to the United States \nof all such individuals now, or previously under its control;\n  Direct the President to provide specific counterterrorism technology \nand technical assistance to Israel; and\n  Require that the PLO pay compensation to U.S. victims of terrorism \ncommitted with PLO support and under its direction.\n  Mr. President, this bill is not the panacea. Nor is it the popular \nthing to do. It is however, the right thing to do. I want peace for \nIsrael as much or more than anyone else does, but I don't want it on \nthe wrong terms. Neville Chamberlain said that there would be peace \n``in our time'' after Munich, and there wasn't. I want Israel to be \nsafe and secure. I don't want Israel to become locked into an agreement \nwith an organization that cannot deliver on its end of the bargain. I \nalso do not want to have the U.S. taxpayers' money wasted. The issues \nare paramount.\n  This peace agreement is like a contract. When one side abides by the \ncontract's terms and the other does not, then the deal has been broken. \nNow, I know that there will be some who will say that this aid should \ncontinue regardless, and that the violations are really not violations. \nLet me tell you, the violations of the PLO are real and they cannot be \nignored or forgiven. They must be dealt with. If this is done, then \nthere should be no problems. The terms for aid in this bill are not \nodious, they are not overreaching and they are not unreasonable. They \nare consistent with the requirements that our Government places upon \nall recipients of U.S. foreign assistance.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 915\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Middle East Peace Compliance \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Its legal status is defined by \n     U.S. law pursuant to Title X of Public Law 102-204 section \n     1002;\n       (2) for the purpose of this section, the term ``foreign \n     assistance'' shall be the same as that used under section \n     634(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (P.L. 87-195); \n     and\n       (3) the term ``Palestinian Authority'' shall be defined as \n     the administrative entity established in the self-rule areas \n     of Gaza and the West Bank in accordance with the Declaration \n     of Principles signed in Washington, D.C. September 13, 1993, \n     between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization \n     (PLO).\n\n     SEC. 3. POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy and interest of the United States--\n       (1) to contribute to the advancement of peace and security \n     in the Middle East by supporting efforts by Israel and the \n     Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to reach a non-\n     violent resolution of their conflict under the terms of the \n     Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government \n     Arrangement signed in Washington, D.C., September 13, 1993;\n       (2) to ensure that both Israel and the PLO fully and \n     meaningfully comply with the terms and conditions of all \n     agreements made between them;\n       (3) to demonstrate firm, consistent and unambiguous \n     opposition to terrorism by insisting that Israel and the \n     Palestine Liberation Organization take significant, material \n     and timely steps to preempt terrorist attacks;\n       (4) to ensure that the Palestinian Authority fully accounts \n     for basic human needs and infrastructure development funds \n     expended by the United States in Gaza and Jericho in \n     accordance with standard commercial principles and practices;\n       (5) to ensure that Israel and the Palestine Liberation \n     Organization cooperative fully with U.S. law enforcement \n     agencies to apprehend, prosecute and convict all individuals \n     involved in the criminal injury or death of United States \n     citizens or the willful damaging of United States property;\n       (6) to hold the PLO and its administrative authority in \n     Gaza and Jericho accountable for unlawful acts carried out \n     within its jurisdiction or emanating from territory under its \n     administrative control;\n       (7) to ensure that all recipients of U.S. foreign \n     assistance evidence a clear commitment to democracy, justice \n     and the rule of law and conform to established standards of \n     financial management and accountability; and\n       (8) to contribute to the long-term security, stability and \n     economic health of the State of Israel through the \n     maintenance of close bilateral ties and, to the greatest \n     extent possible, to provide such levels of assistance to \n     Israel as are necessary and sufficient to achieve these \n     objectives, irrespective of the success or failure of the \n     agreements between Israel and the PLO.\n\n     SEC. 4. FINDINGS AND DETERMINATIONS.\n\n       (a) Pursuant to the commitments between Israel and the PLO \n     described in section 6 of this Act, the Congress makes the \n     following findings:\n       (1) After decades of conflict, Israel and the PLO have \n     entered a new era which presents an historic opportunity for \n     peaceful coexistence and a stable democratic future for \n     themselves and the region;\n       (2) The basis for this new relationship between Israel and \n     the PLO is the set of agreements to which both parties are \n     signatories and which emanate from the Declaration of \n     Principles of Interim Self-Government Arrangements, signed in \n     Washington, D.C. on September 13, 1993;\n       (3) The United States agrees to serve as a partner in the \n     effort to bring about a lasting reconciliation and \n     understanding between Israel and the PLO;\n       (4) The United States recognizes all of the agreements \n     referred to in section 6 of this Act are legally binding on \n     Israel and the PLO, that they were entered into freely and in \n     good faith and that Israel and the PLO are committed to their \n     complete fulfillment;\n       (5) The United States is relying upon Israel and the PLO to \n     honor their commitments to elected representatives and \n     officials of the United States Government prior to and \n     following the signing of the Declaration of Principles, \n     including the promise of the PLO to halt terrorism emanating \n     from areas under its control;\n       (6) The United States is committee to providing funding for \n     infrastructure development and basic human needs in Gaza and \n     Jericho, but not through any institution or entity of the PLO \n     or the Palestinian Authority and only where Israel and the \n     PLO have demonstrated that they have taken substantial, \n     timely and meaningful steps toward full compliance under \n     their respective agreements;\n       (7) The United States is resolute in its determination to \n     ensure that in providing assistance to Palestinians living \n     under the administrative control of the Palestinian Authority \n     or elsewhere, the beneficiaries of such assistance shall be \n     held to the same standard of financial accountability and \n     management control as any other recipient of U.S. foreign \n     assistance; and\n       (8) Since the signing of the Declaration of Principles, the \n     United States has had sufficient time to evaluate the \n     sincerity, commitment and effectiveness with which Israel and \n     the PLO have complied with both the spirit and the letter of \n     the joint agreements to which they are signatories.\n       (b) Determinations.--Therefore, the Congress determines \n     that:\n       (1) the PLO continues to demonstrate widespread and \n     systematic disregard for both the spirit and the letter of \n     the understandings reached in a succession of agreements \n     between it and the State of Israel;\n       (2) information provided by the President on the compliance \n     of the PLO with its agreements is often ambiguous, \n     insufficient, at variance with the assessments of independent \n     monitoring groups and falls short of the standards of \n     accountability expected of other recipients of U.S. foreign \n     assistance;\n       (3) the PLO specifically has failed to take substantial, \n     timely and meaningful steps to fulfill its legal obligations \n     in the following areas:\n       (A) Amending the plo covenant.--In violation of commitments \n     made by the PLO in the letter of September 9, 1993 between \n     the PLO leader and the Prime Minister of Israel, 1993, the \n     PLO has failed to repeal the provisions of its Charter which \n     declare Israel to be illegitimate and call for its \n     elimination through armed struggle;\n       (B) Preventing terrorism.--In violation of the terms agreed \n     to in the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, Annex III, article I, \n     section 5 and the letters of September 9, 1993 between the \n     PLO leader and the Prime Minister of Israel and between the \n     PLO leader and the Foreign Minister of Norway, the PLO has \n     not legally banned terrorist organizations such as Hamas and \n     Islamic Jihad and has done little to discipline them. In the \n     19 months before the Declaration of Principles there were 318 \n     casualties from terrorism in Israel and the territories (68 \n     people were killed and 250 injured). This is in contrast to \n     the 19 months following the signing of the Declaration of \n     Principles, there were 651 casualties from terrorism in \n     Israel and the territories (134 people were killed and 517 \n     injured), an increase of nearly 100 percent;\n       (C) Prosecuting terrorists.--In violation of the terms \n     agreed to in the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, Annex III, article \n     I, section 5 and the letters of September 9, 1993 between the \n     PLO leader and the Prime Minister of Israel \n     [[Page S8180]] and between the PLO leader and the Foreign \n     Minister of Norway, the PLO has failed to investigate \n     terrorist incidents, prosecute terrorists according to the \n     rule of law, or ensure that the sentences imposed for \n     terrorist acts are more than perfunctory. The PLO repeatedly \n     has declared that it considers terrorist organizations such \n     as Hamas and Islamic Jihad as legitimate opposition groups \n     with whom they are prepared to conduct a dialog. The PLO has \n     not legally banned extremist organizations and instead, \n     employs Hamas sympathizers in its administration in Gaza;\n       (D) Preventing incitement to violence.--In violation of the \n     terms agreed to in the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, Article XII, \n     paragraph 1 and the letters of September 9, 1993 between the \n     PLO leader and the Prime Minister of Israel and between the \n     PLO leader and the Foreign Minister of Norway, PLO officials \n     continue to advocate holy war (jihad) against Israel, glorify \n     suicide bombers, lend support and comfort to terrorist groups \n     and issue propaganda delegitimizing Israeli sovereignty even \n     within its pre-1967 borders;\n       (E) Barring unauthorized forces.--In violation of the terms \n     agreed to in the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, Article IX, section \n     2, the PLO continues to permit illegal military and \n     paramilitary groups to conduct terrorist operations against \n     Israel from administrative areas under its control;\n       (F) Confiscating unauthorized weapons.--In violation of the \n     terms agreed to in the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, Annex I, \n     article VIII, sec. 8, the PLO has failed to fulfill its \n     commitment made to the United States Vice President on March \n     24, 1995, to take significant steps to disarm military and \n     paramilitary groups under its administrative control, to \n     license weapons or to substantially enforce, by judicial \n     means, individual violations;\n       (G) Excluding terrorists from security services.--In \n     violation of the terms agreed to in the Gaza-Jericho \n     agreement, Annex I, article III, sec. 4(b), the PLO continues \n     to employ policemen who have been convicted of serious \n     crimes;\n       (H) Extraditing terrorists.--In violation of the terms \n     agreed to in annex III, article II, sec. 7, the PLO \n     consistently refuses to extradite individuals suspected of \n     terrorist crimes against Israeli citizens and has not \n     complied with earlier demands of the U.S. Government to \n     extradite individuals suspected of crimes against Americans \n     to the United States;\n       (I) Prohibiting the location of institutions of the \n     Palestinian authority outside of gaza and jericho.--Under \n     Article V of the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, the Palestinian \n     Authority is limited but has attempted to extend its \n     authority beyond the boundaries of Gaza and Jericho. It has \n     failed to live up to its commitment not to operate offices in \n     Jerusalem and has opened at least 7 institutions in and \n     around the city;\n       (J) Facilitating the release of israeli pows/mias.--The PLO \n     has failed to provide Israel with information it possesses on \n     the condition and possible whereabouts of at least one \n     Israeli MIA;\n       (K) Avoiding and punishing the illegal transfer of funds.--\n     In violation of the spirit of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and \n     standard international principles and practices of financial \n     accountability, administrative authorities in Gaza have \n     diverted substantial amounts of development assistance to \n     activities of the PLO both inside and outside of Gaza and \n     Jericho; and\n       (L) Preventing infiltrations.--In violation of the term \n     agreed to in the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, Article IV(2)(c), \n     the Palestinian Police authorities has failed to halt \n     infiltrations from Egypt to Gaza and from Gaza to Israel.\n\n     SEC. 5.

These discretionary grant \nprograms expire September 30, 1995.\n  This legislation will send an important signal to family members of \ninfants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities that Congress \nintends to continue supporting and funding these important programs. \nPart H of this legislation serves more than 76,000 infants and toddlers \nwith disabilities. This extension also serves as a signal to States \nthat part H and the other discretionary programs are important programs \naddressing the education needs of individuals with disabilities. \nFurther, this bill lets our colleagues on the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee know of our intent to reauthorize these programs, so that \nthey will appropriate funds for these programs in fiscal year 1996.\n  This legislation extends the 15 discretionary programs under IDEA \nthrough September 30, 1996. This bill contains no substantive \namendments to IDEA, and is a temporary measure allowing us additional \ntime to develop a comprehensive reauthorization of IDEA. It is our \nintent to complete a comprehensive reauthorization bill in the early \nfall of 1995. When the comprehensive reauthorization is passed, it will \nrepeal the extension.\n  The following colleagues from the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources have joined me as cosponsors of this bill: Senator Nancy \nLandon Kassebaum, Senator James M. Jeffords, Senator Dan Coats, Senator \nMike DeWine, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Senator Claiborne Pell, Senator \nChristopher J. Dodd, Senator Paul Simon, and Senator Tom Harkin.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/12/senate-section/article/S8177-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8182-S8183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 25\n\n  At the request of Mr. Helms, the name of the Senator from Mississippi \n[Mr. Lott] was added as a cosponsor of [[Page S8183]] S. 25, a bill to \nstop the waste of taxpayer funds on activities by Government agencies \nto encourage its employees or officials to accept homosexuality as a \nlegitimate or normal lifestyle.\n\n\n                                 S. 304\n\n  At the request of Mr. Santorum, the name of the Senator from Montana \n[Mr. Burns] was added as a cosponsor of S. 304, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the transportation fuels tax \napplicable to commercial aviation.\n\n\n                                 S. 327\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the names of the Senator from Minnesota \n[Mr. Grams] and the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] were added \nas cosponsors of S. 327, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to provide clarification for the deductibility of expenses \nincurred by a taxpayer in connection with the business use of the home.\n\n\n                                 S. 539\n\n  At the request of Mr. Cochran, the name of the Senator from Louisiana \n[Mr. Breaux] was added as a cosponsor of S. 539, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a tax exemption for health \nrisk pools.\n\n\n                                 S. 673\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the names of the Senator from \nIndiana [Mr. Coats] and the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] \nwere added as cosponsors of S. 673, a bill to establish a youth \ndevelopment grant program, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 684\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatfield, the name of the Senator from \nTennessee [Mr. Frist] was added as a cosponsor of S. 684, a bill to \namend the Public Health Service Act to provide for programs of research \nregarding Parkinson's disease, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 715\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the name of the Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] was added as a cosponsor of S. 715, a bill \nto provide for portability of health insurance, guaranteed \nrenewability, high risk pools, medical care savings accounts, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1265\n\n  At the request of Mr. Thurmond the names of the Senator from North \nDakota [Mr. Dorgan], the Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], and the \nSenator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] were added as cosponsors of \namendment No. 1265 proposed to S. 652, an original bill to provide for \na pro-competitive, de-regulatory national policy framework designed to \naccelerate rapidly private sector deployment of advanced \ntelecommunications and information technologies and services to all \nAmericans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition, and \nfor other purposes.\n  At the request of Mr. Leahy his name was added as a cosponsor of \namendment No. 1265 proposed to S. 652, supra.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/12/senate-section/article/S8182-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n      TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION AND DEREGULATION ACT OF 1995\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n               FEINSTEIN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1269\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Lott) proposed an amendment to \nthe bill (S. 652) to provide for a procompetitive, deregulatory \nnational policy framework designed to accelerate rapidly private sector \ndeployment of advanced telecommunications and information technologies \nand services to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets \nto competition, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 145, below line 23, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 407A.

Mr. President, a few weeks ago the Senate made good \non its historic opportunity to balance our Nation's budget, and we \nvoted to save our children and tomorrow's children from a burden that \nthey did not cause and do not deserve. The American people made their \nposition on this issue crystal clear--a balanced budget is their top \npriority.\n  Even many of those who have long-standing interests in tax relief, \nincluding the small business owners that I hear from as chairman of the \nCommittee on Small Business, do not want tax cuts at the expense of a \nbalanced budget. One poll conducted by a nationwide organization \nrepresenting over 600,000 [[Page S8184]] small businesses showed that \n95 percent favored a constitutional amendment requiring the Federal \nGovernment to balance the budget and that 88 percent believed Congress \nshould focus its attention primarily on deficit reduction.\n  The Senate listened to the American people on this issue. We worked \nhard, debated earnestly, made difficult decisions, and fulfilled our \nobligation by voting to bring the budget into balance by the year 2002. \nThe result of that work is not only a better financial legacy for \nAmerica, but the production of an economic dividend of approximately \n$170 billion over the next 7 years.\n  When the opportunity for tax cuts arrives as a result of our control \nover budget deficits, Congress should view the economic dividend as a \nyoung, growing business would view a small influx of cash. It should be \ninvested very carefully. I strongly believe that some tax relief needs \nto go to families with children. I also believe, however, that we \nshould use a portion of the dividend in a way that will create jobs and \nstimulate investment and growth in our economy by providing tax cuts \nfor small businesses.\n  Year after year small businesses generate a significant number of new \njobs, even while corporate America downsizes. In fact, according to the \nSmall Business Administration, small businesses provided 100 percent of \nthe net new jobs from 1987 to 1992. By targeting some of the tax cuts \ntoward small business we will not be spending the dividend but rather \nreinvesting it in our economy. That way, all Americans will benefit \nthrough an improved standard of living. Small businesses need cash to \nmeet payroll, pay their day-to-day bills and to invest in capital \nimprovements. In a recent study, small business owners identified tax \nburdens as their No. 1 problem. The economic dividend provides us with \nan opportunity to rectify the single most important concern of that \nportion of our economy that can contribute to America's economic \ngrowth.\n  When the Committee on Finance is determining what tax cuts should be \nenacted as a result of the budget resolution and the economic dividend, \nI strongly encourage the members to include on the priority list at \nleast the following four targeted tax cuts to promote economic growth \nand job creation by American small business.\n  First, increase the small business expensing provision. Allowing a \ncurrent deduction for newly purchased assets improves the cash flow of \na small business. It also would encourage a small business to invest in \nnew equipment which in turn helps manufacturing and related industries. \nThis is a formula for maintaining and enhancing job growth.\n  Second, provide a 100-percent deduction for the health insurance \ncosts of the self-employed. With the passage of H.R. 831 earlier this \nyear, we gave the self-employed a permanent but only a partial \ndeduction for health insurance. Corporate employers already are able to \ndeduct the full cost of health insurance. This disparity in treatment \ncontinues to put the entrepreneurs of America at a disadvantage--23 \npercent of the self-employed are uninsured today. About 4 million of \nthe uninsured are in families headed by a self-employed worker. A 100-\npercent deduction will make their insurance more affordable and help \nthese families purchase the health insurance coverage they need and \ndeserve.\n  Third, estate tax relief targeted specifically for small business. \nGenerally, this would be a tax deferral for a family owned and operated \nbusiness that is passed to heirs who continue to own and operate the \nbusiness. As you know, this is a vital change because some owners of a \nsmall family businesses find they cannot afford to pass the business on \nto their children simply because they cannot afford to pay the estate \ntaxes. A recent survey of family businesses showed that a mere 57 \npercent of owners planned on keeping the business in the family; taxes \nwere cited as one of the prime reasons for their plans to sell out. \nUnfortunately, our system of taxation is working against us here. \nRather than promoting and stimulating business growth, the law is \nforcing people to make decisions to sell or close what otherwise could \nbe a viable enterprise.\n  Fourth, cut the capital gains tax rate and index it for inflation. In \norder to unlock built up asset values. Entrepreneurs that have become \nsuccessful might repeat their job-creating activities in a new company \nif it were not for the disincentive in the tax laws against realizing \nand reinvesting these gains. The effect of permitting all capital gains \nto be reinvested more freely would be to give our economy a boost that \nit otherwise would not enjoy, and much of this reinvestment likely will \nbe directed at small business. Simply said, a reduction in the capital \ngains rate will expand economic activity so all Americans will be able \nto reap the benefit of that growth by additional jobs and an improved \nstandard of living.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I urge my colleagues \nto look at tax-cutting opportunities as a way to make an intelligent, \nlong-term investment in our small business sector but will benefit the \nentire economy.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/12/senate-section/article/S8183-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           HARRY ZIMMERMAN MEMORIAL AWARD TO LEONARD FLORENCE\n\n Mr. KERRY.

Mr. President, on May 29 the State of Rhode Island \nand Providence Plantations observed not only Memorial Day but also Hope \nDay, commemorating the 205th anniversary of the State's ratification of \nthe U.S. Constitution.\n  It was at 5:20 in the afternoon of May 29, 1790, we are told, that \nthe final vote was taken at a convention of delegates from all parts of \nthe State, giving Rhode Island's belated and somewhat grudging approval \nto the new Federal Constitution. The vote was 34 to 32, making the \nsmallest of the Thirteen Original Colonies to join the new union of \nStates which had come into being the previous year.\n  The word ``Hope'', which the State took as its motto in 1875, in \nrecent years has become associated with the anniversary of the date of \nRhode Island's ratification, signifying the high expectations of that \noccasion.\n  This year, the Hope Day commemoration, under the chairmanship of G. \nBrian Sullivan of Newport, included an invitation to all churches in \nthe State and all vessels in Narragansett Bay to sound their bells and \nhorns at 5:20 p.m. in a reenactment of the ``Great \n[[Page S8186]] Tintinnabulation'' of May 29, 1790, when church bells \nthroughout the State heralded the outcome of the vote on ratification.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have reprinted in the Record proclamations of \nHope Day 1995 by Gov. Lincoln Almond and David F. Roderick, Jr., mayor \nof Newport.\n  The proclamation follows:\n        The Governor of the State of Rhode Island--Proclamation\n\n       Whereas, on May 29, 1790, Rhode Island became our country's \n     thirteenth state, fulfilling the hope of our nation's \n     forefathers who sought unity and upheld the motto ``E \n     Pluribus Unum''--``One Composed of Many''; and\n       Whereas, while Rhode Island led the thirteen original \n     colonies in rebelling against the tyrannical rule of England \n     with the destruction of the British revenue sloop ``Liberty'' \n     in 1769 and the burning of the schooner ``Gaspee'' in 1772, \n     it would not seek democracy and its status as an independent \n     state until May 29, 1790; and\n       Whereas, while Rhode Island was the last of the original \n     thirteen colonies to ratify the federal constitution, our \n     founding fathers--Dr. John Clarke and Roger Williams--were \n     instrumental in creating the Great Charter granted by King \n     Charles II on July 8, 1663, assuring Rhode Island's complete \n     religious freedom, an antecedent to the Bill of Rights; and\n       Whereas, on this fourteenth commemoration of ``Hope Day,'' \n     all of Rhode Island should stand proud in recognizing that on \n     this great day back in 1790, federal unification became \n     complete and the thirteen original colonies had become one \n     nation;\n       Now, therefore, I Lincoln Almond, Governor of the State of \n     Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Do Hereby Proclaim, \n     May 29, 1995 as Hope Day.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               Mayor of the City of Newport--Proclamation\n\n       Whereas, in May of 1776, Rhode Island became the first of \n     the thirteen original colonies to rebel against the tyranny \n     of King George III, by declaring its independence from the \n     Crown on May 4, 1776; and\n       Whereas, with the Revolutionary War won, it was not until \n     fourteen years later, on May 29, 1790 that Rhode Island \n     signed the Constitution, making it the official document of \n     law in the land; and\n       Whereas, in recognition of the Ratification of the \n     Constitution, church bells rang out through the State of \n     Rhode Island and Providence Plantations; and\n       Whereas, in recognition of that day, the fourteenth annual \n     commemoration of Hope Day and in celebration of USA Day in \n     Newport, Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That I, David F. Roderick, Jr., Mayor of the City \n     of Newport in the State of Rhode Island and Providence \n     Plantations, do hereby proclaim May 29, 1995, during the \n     Memorial Day observance, to be Hope Day & U.S.A. Day in the \n     City of Newport, and invite all cities and towns in the State \n     of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations to join with us in \n     celebrating the 205th birthday of the Constitution of the \n     United States.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/12/senate-section/article/S8185-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nCELEBRATING THE 1965 ALUMNI CLASS OF CHARLES SUMNER HIGH SCHOOL 30-YEAR \n                             CLASS REUNION\n\n Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the \nimportance of establishing a Kid's Appreciation Day to pay tribute to \nthe children of this Nation. The question that is on the lips of \nchildren is ``If there's a Mother's Day and a Father's Day, why isn't \nthere a Kid's Day?'' This is met with the standard response ``Because \nevery day is Kid's Day.'' Well, Mr. President, nothing could be further \nfrom the truth.\n  The children today deal with problems that were unfathomable when we \nwere growing up. When I was young, one of my biggest worries was making \nit home to dinner on time. In many places today, kids worry more about \ndodging bullets, drug dealers, and whether they will live to see \nadulthood. Some children rarely see their parents who must hold two \njobs in order to put food on the table.\n  There is nothing as valuable on this Earth than our children. We are \nhanding these children the impossible task of dealing with problems \nthat we have failed to solve. I know that having a Kid's Day won't \nsolve these problems. But it would show our chidren that we appreciate \nthem. I know the children of Arkansas want to be appreciated. A fine \nyoung lady named Vivian Rose has taken it upon herself to lead the \nchildren of my State toward this goal. She has presented this idea to \nGov. Jim Guy Tucker who gives it his full support. I praise both of \nthem for their efforts and commend them on their leadership in Kid's \nAppreciation Day.\n  Children are our most valuable asset and deserve to be valued on a \nspecial day. A Kid's Day would not only show our appreciation and \ngratitude but would instill in them a sense of comfort that they would \nhold dear. It would make children feel important and wanted instead of \nneglected. This holiday would give kids a chance to spend time with \ntheir parents. Time that they don't normally have. There could be free \nadmission for museums and amusement parks. Local parks and swimming \npools could be open to the public. It would be a day for parents to let \ntheir kids know that they care about them and this would help our \nchildren overcome the obstacles that they face to become the future \nleaders of tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, nations around the globe have Kid's Days. In fact, I'm \ntold that the Kiwanis Club also sponsors a Kid's Day. They have \nparades, games, races, and give awards to celebrate children. I \nstrongly recommend that we follow the lead of the Kiwanis Club, \nGovernor Tucker, and Vivian Rose by making Kid's Day a reality \nnationwide. Children that feel wanted and appreciated are a strong \ndefense against the violence these kids encounter in their \nneighborhoods. It is our responsibility as adults and role models to \nguide them toward the correct path of purpose. This holiday would place \na smile on the faces of our kids and would put comfort in our hearts \nknowing that they are facing the world with added strength and \nresilience. Mr. President, Kid's Appreciation Day is a noble cause and \nI urge you to join me and my State in its support.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do have some closing unanimous-consent \nrequests, but I would withhold if the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska has some comments he would like to make.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. President, I rise but will withhold most of my comments. The \nSenator from South Dakota and I will have an opportunity to go round \nand round again on the DOJ rule amendment tomorrow.\n  I would point out for those few who are still remaining and listening \nto this, that this amendment illustrates why colleagues should be \npaying attention to this piece of legislation.\n  I, myself, support this particular section, this preemption by the \nFederal Government. But it is a significant preemption. Any time we see \nlanguage that says, ``We hereby preempt State and local laws'' around \nhere, you only get 90 votes against it.\n  Lately, the mood is shifting, and I think quite correctly so. The \nSupreme Court is shifting right along with it to an argument that cedes \nmore and more power to the State government, whether it is welfare \nreform, health care, or whatever it is.\n  We are block granting after block granting after block granting more \nauthority back to the State law. As I said, the Supreme Court is \nincreasingly challenging our authority to intervene at all at the local \nlevel, the State level. Intervening with State laws at all gets to be a \ndifficult business.\n  This piece of legislation preempts not just State laws but preempts \nlocal laws, I think quite repeatedly so. If we want a competitive \nenvironment, these airwaves, these cables, these lines, do not stop at \na border.\n  It is, it seems to me, an interstate commerce issue. Nonetheless, it \nwill [[Page S8187]] feel very much local when we are dealing with local \ncable or local telephone. The citizens are not likely to think of it as \nan interstate issue as much as we are, who are trying to create some \nuniformity.\n  I think the Senator from South Dakota is quite right. This does get \nto the heart of the bill. It is an effort to preempt and create \nuniformity in the country and create certainty in the country so \ninvestment can be made and all the things that need to occur, if we are \ngoing to see this legislation produce the desired effect and benefits, \nfor example, reduced prices for consumers, for cable.\n  My belief is that in short order, people are going to be buying \nvideo, dial tone, text, in a package form, but if they get a reduced \nprice for that and they get improvement in quality and service, we have \nto take this action and come in and preempt the way the States can \nregulate.\n  This legislation, by this section here, not only removes the barrier, \nbut it sets up the title 3 section which moves to pricing flexibility, \nnot just allowing States, but requiring the States to end a rate-based \nrate of return system of regulation.\n  In this legislation, we are accelerating the number of States that \nhave adopted alternative regulatory regimes. We are saying that we will \nnot wait for State legislatures to take action or public service \ncommissions to take action.\n  We will preempt their authority and say we they will end rate-based \npricing and go to a price cap system and try to give these companies \nthat are selling telecommunications service more flexibility. I think \nthat has merit, frankly.\n  This idea of preemption, I think, is a very important idea as part of \nthis legislation, but I believe that it illustrates why colleagues need \nto be alert to the reaction that this will produce after this \nlegislation is enacted. With the filing of cloture, that the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi just did, this bill is coming to \na vote relatively soon.\n  Unless I have this thing figured out wrong, it is likely there will \nbe a majority of Senators voting for it. I hope my colleagues \nunderstand this is not likely to be the last situation but the first \nsituation of many, many, where we need to understand where it is we are \ngoing in order to be able to answer a citizen that will say, ``Wait a \nminute. This is big change.'' Yes, it is, American citizen. This \nlegislation represents significant change in the way that we regulate \nand the way the Federal Government establishes its presence at the \nlocal level and at the State level.\n  I see ways to interpret the amendment that the Senators from \nCalifornia and Idaho have presented, striking this particular language. \nPart of this language does appear to be a bit vague to me, as well. No \nmatter how we do it, if they want to strike the section, we are still \nleft with significant preemption in the overall title.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the legislation now before the Senate \nattempts to bring the 1934 Communications Act up to date with our \nNation's current telecommunications needs. Telecommunications reform \nhas been the subject of a great deal of debate in previous years and it \nis widely acknowledged that reform is necessary. However, as with any \nmeasure addressing such a broad segment of our national economy, there \nare many differing opinions regarding how best to proceed.\n  The telecommunications industry has expanded rapidly in recent years \ndue to significant advances in technology and increasing consumer \ndemands. A large portion of the evolution in this industry can be \nattributed to increased competition. Daily, millions of Americans at \nwork, in school, and at home rely on telecommunications networks for \ncommunication, information, and entertainment. There is an enormous \ninterest in the final outcome of this debate because enactment of a \nrevised telecommunications law will affect virtually every American.\n  The underlying goal of telecommunications reform must be to do what \nis best for consumers. There may come a time in the future when the \nFederal Government can remove itself from any involvement in this \nindustry, but we have not reached that point. I believe it is necessary \nfor government to continue to play a role in telecommunications \noversight to protect the American consumer.\n  The Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 \nattempts to deregulate this industry and largely allow market forces to \nstructure the industry. I support the free market ideals of this \nlegislation. However, we must recognize that deregulation is not always \nsynonymous with fair competition. Due to the fact that a small group of \ncompanies control most of our nation's telecommunication networks, \nthere are many concerns about the potential abuse of this advantage. In \norder to ensure the American people are the ultimate beneficiary's of \nthese services, we must provide adequate safeguards to accompany these \nderegulatory efforts.\n  There are presently a number of government entities with \nresponsibility for the oversight and regulation of the \ntelecommunications industry. Not only are many of these roles \nduplicative, but they are also extremely cumbersome for consumers and \nthe companies providing the services.\n  One historical example of these overlapping functions is the break-up \nof the AT telephone monopoly. The Department of Justice initiated \nthis action by determining that AT was in violation of Federal anti-\ntrust laws. The courts followed by establishing the modified final \njudgement which created the seven Regional Bell Operating Companies. \nCurrently, the Federal Communications Commission, the Department of \nJustice, State and local governments, and the courts each oversee \nsegments of the long distance and local telephone services in this \ncountry. The break-up of AT was a necessary development, but the \nfinal results continue to confuse and alienate consumers to this day.\n  The legislation we are debating today addresses almost every aspect \nof the telecommunications industry in some capacity. Additionally, it \nallows Congress to re-establish its responsibility for setting policy \nin this area. For the past 6 years the Congress has attempted to \naddress this issue. Though these efforts have largely been \nunsuccessful, we all recognize this area needs reform and that action \nis past due. The House and Senate have each crafted bills to revise \ncurrent telecommunication laws this year and the congressional \nleadership has also made their strong commitment to passing a \ntelecommunications reform bill very clear. This will not be an easy \nendeavor, but I remain hopeful that Congress will move forward on this \nimportant matter in this Congress.\n  During this important debate, we have heard a great deal about how \nthis legislation will impact the telecommunications industry. However, \nMr. President, it is also the Federal Government's rightful role to \nhelp our citizens receive access to advanced technologies and not just \nreserve this privilege to those who can afford it. The provision \nincluded in this bill by Senators Snowe and Rockefeller will allow \nrural health care facilities, public schools, and libraries to receive \ntelecommunication services at a discounted rate. The Snowe-Rockefeller \nlanguage, which I support, will provide telecommunications access to \nnumerous needy institutions throughout our country. For example, the \nPortals Project in Oregon, which electronically links several learning \ninstitutions, will be a beneficiary of this amendment.\n  Mr. President the reform of this industry is a huge effort and I \ncommend the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator \nPressler, and the panel's ranking minority member, Senator Hollings, \nfor their leadership on this important matter. They have both worked \nlong and hard on this contentious issue to establish a foundation for \nthe future of our telecommunications needs.\n  I continue to have several concerns with the Pressler-Hollings bill, \nwhich I hope will be addressed through the amendment process. However, \nI also believe they have crafted a bill that takes a comprehensive step \ntoward addressing the needs of the American consumer and the \ntelecommunications industry as we move further into the Information Age \nof the twenty-first century.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/12/senate-section/article/S8186-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S8188]]\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1995\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I would like to summarize where we are \nwith this bill and take a look at tomorrow and finishing this bill, \nwhich I hope we will be able to do.\n  We have a very tough vote coming up tomorrow regarding adding the \nDepartment of Justice to the regulatory scheme. I would just like to \npoint out that referral to the Department in the past precludes timely \nresolution, because the Department does not take timely action.\n  Now, the Department is filled with very brilliant lawyers and they \nhave a reputation of moving very slowly on these waiver applications. I \nwill show a couple of charts that illustrate how slow the Department \nhas been.\n  In the original 1982 MFJ, it was suggested that the Department \ncomplete its work on each waiver request within 30 days.\n And, although the decree itself contemplates that waiver requests will \nbe filed directly with the court, in July 1984 the court announced that \nit would consider application for waivers of the line of business \nrestrictions only after review by the Department of Justice.\n\n  This procedure was imposed after only 7 months' experience with the \nwaiver process and was not expected substantially to delay the \nprocessing of waiver requests. To the contrary, in establishing this \nprocedure, the court noted the length of time that previously filed \nwaiver requests have been pending and accordingly directed the \nDepartment to endeavor to return those requests to the court with its \nviews within 30 days.\n  I am going to repeat that because I think it is very important. The \ncourt noted how slow the Justice Department was moving on these waivers \nand told them the length of time requests had been pending and \naccordingly directed the Department to endeavor to return these \nrequests to the court with its views within 30 days.\n  So the framework for what I am saying is that the Justice Department \nwas asked to do this within 30 days; not 90 days, as my friends have \nput into their bill. But what actually happened? Let us look at the \nfacts. Let us go to the videotape, so to speak.\n  Contrary to the court's expectations, delays in administrative \nprocessing of waiver requests soon began to grow. In 1984 the \nDepartment disposed of 23 waivers. The average age of waivers pending \nbefore it was a little under 2 months. By 1988 the average age of \npending waivers topped 1 year. Then, in 1993, when the Department \ndisposed of only seven waivers, the average age of pending waivers at \nyear end had increased to 3 years. More recently, in 1994, the \nDepartment disposed of only 10 waivers. This left over 30 waivers with \nan average of 2\\1/2\\ years still pending.\n  The Department now takes almost as long on the average to consider a \nsingle waiver request as the total time intended to elapse before \ncomprehensive triennial reviews--which the Department has refused to \nconduct. This has occurred notwithstanding significant decreases in the \nnumber of waiver requests. While requests have decreased substantially \nsince 1986, the Department had not even made a dent in the backlog. To \nthe contrary, because the Department disposes of fewer and fewer waiver \nrequests each year, the number of pending requests continues to grow. \nNo matter how few waiver requests the BOC's file, the Department simply \ncannot keep up. In light of the multiyear delays in processing waiver \nrequests, it is remarkable the court originally directed Department \nreview within weeks, not months or years.\n  So the court directed the Department of Justice to act within a few \nweeks. And it has taken it years to act. So the point is, if we adopt \nthe Dorgan-Thurmond amendment, we will be adding probably 2 or 3 years \nto this so-called deregulatory process, because that is what has \nhappened in the past.\n  More significantly, the court ordered virtually immediate Department \naction because of prior delays that now seem comparatively minor. The \neight waivers at issue since July of 1984 had been pending just an \naverage of 5 months, with none more than 6 months old. Today, a waiver \nrequest rarely makes it through the Department in less than a year, and \n2\\1/2\\ years is the mean.\n  Think about that; it takes 2\\1/2\\ years for the Department of Justice \nto approve or disapprove a waiver request that originally the district \ncourt thought could be done in 30 days. What is going on? Why is that?\n  As AT argued in 1986, and the court noted in 1988, the Department \nis clearly overwhelmed by its decree responsibilities. Aware of this, \nthe Bell operating companies several years ago attempted to reform \nwaiver procedures within the limits of the court's orders to eliminate \nthe mounting backlog of pending requests. Following consultation with \nthe Department, during 1991 the Bell operating companies agreed to \nconsolidate the large number of pending waiver requests into a handful \nof generic requests and to limit their filings of new individual waiver \nrequests. In exchange, the Department committed to acting promptly on \ngeneric waiver motions.\n  Once again the Department has not kept its part of the bargain. Four \ngeneric waiver requests have been filed. The first covered \ninternational communications. It was filed with the Department in \nDecember 1991 but did not receive departmental approval for 7 months, \neven though AT indicated within 3 months of the waiver request that \nit had no objection. Thus, we have a circumstance where the company, \nAT party to the consent decree-- [[Page S8189]] said, after 3 \nmonths, we have no objection. It still took them 7 months to issue it. \nAnd the amendment proposes to add this bureaucracy to the present FCC \nreview. That would lead to costs and delays. It has in the past.\n  As I stated before, the court suggested 30 days and it has taken an \naverage of 2\\1/2\\ years. In the example I just cited there was no \ncontroversy. After 3 months, AT said it had no objection. It still \ntook the Department of Justice 7 months to issue that. It is tortuously \nslow, and businessmen waiting for that paperwork have been torturously \ntreated, because they sit there with that investment ready to go, there \nis no objection, and they wait and wait. This huge bureaucracy with all \nthese brilliant lawyers cannot produce the paper.\n  The second generic request, which consolidated 23 then-pending \nwaivers, covered interLATA wire services such as cellular phones, two-\nway paging, and vehicle locators. It, too, was filed in December 1991. \nIt then languished before the Department for 3 years before finally \nbeing submitted to this court. Now, 4 years after it was originally \nfiled, the waiver is still pending; 4 years, a simple waiver in that \nDepartment of Justice--the same department that the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for Antitrust is asking this body to give an additional \nreview--that would simply hold things up. I think that would be a very \ngreat mistake.\n  The period for public comment and investigation spent in connection \nwith the generic wireless waiver request alone is more than three times \nas long as the period allowed by the court for public comment and \nreview of the entire decree in 1982.\n  It is also eight times longer than it took for AT to get a \nfactually and theoretically correct request processed. When AT sought \nrelief in connection with the cellular properties in McCaw \nCommunications, it was able to file its requests directly with the \ncourt and obtain a decision in just 7 months. During those 7 months, \nhowever, the BOC's motion for generic wireless relief continued to \nlanguish before the Department, just as it had for the 3 years before. \nThis is 3 years waiting for one simple piece of paper.\n  Surely the referral procedures were not intended to bring about such \ndisparate treatment of the BOC and AT when they made similar \nrequests. The remaining BOC generic requests have followed the same \npath of delay upon delay.\n  The third request covering delivery of information services across \nLATA boundaries was submitted in June 1993 and, now, 20 months later, \nstill awaits Department action.\n  So I will go on to a fourth. The fourth, covering interexchange \nservices provided outside of SBC's region, was filed in July 1994 and \nwas fully briefed before the Department by September 27, 1994. The \nblame for these delays simply cannot be laid at the BOC's feet. The \nnumber of requests filed with the Department held steady at roughly 20 \nto 30 per year from 1987 through 1991 and dropped sharply thereafter. \nMore important, none of these requests have been frivolous and \nvirtually every one of them has been granted.\n  I have identified 266 waiver applications that have been presented to \nthe court either directly or in the form of a consolidated generic \nwaiver. Of these, the court has approved 249 in their entirety and 5 in \npart. The court has denied only six, and another six remain pending.\n  So, while the record is clear about the failure of the Justice \nDepartment to act in a timely manner, the Department of Justice is here \nnow, on the Hill, lobbying for still more power and authority and an \nunprecedented decisionmaking role. Whatever the excuses one may offer \nas to why delay has taken place, the facts are undeniable. Referral to \nthe Department of Justice precludes timely resolution because the \nDepartment does not take timely action, even if ordered to do so.\n  Now my friends who are offering this amendment tomorrow, which will \nbe voted on, and I think it is one of the key votes of this session, \nglibly say we have a requirement that everything has to be offered and \ndealt with within 90 days. Well, the district court had a requirement \nthat they be dealt with within 30 days. This is notwithstanding all the \nefforts to speed them up.\n  I think Senator Exon of Nebraska has eloquently explained that \nCongress has passed many deregulation measures--for airlines, trucking, \nrailroads, buses, natural gas, banking and finance. None of those \nmeasures, according to Senator Exon, give an executive branch \ndepartment coequal status as regulators. What Justice is seeking here \nis essentially a front-line role with ad hoc veto power. Justice would \nbe converting from a law enforcement to a regulatory agency. It would \nend up focusing chiefly on just this sector of the economy.\n  Why does Justice want to do this? They have their Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for Antitrust lobbying, so I am told, calling Senators, and \nurging that this be so.\n  Why do they wish this? It is very unusual, because the Justice \nDepartment has the Sherman and the Clayton Acts oversight. They have \nthe Hart-Scott-Rodino preapproval on antitrust. They have plenty to do. \nIn fact, I have the statistics that they are way behind on a lot of \ntheir other work. The Justice Department is not supposed to be a \nregulatory agency. It is supposed to be a law enforcement, antitrust \nenforcement agency. But they have gotten into this habit because of the \ndistrict court action in 1982. They have a bunch of lawyers and staff \nover there, who are regulators. That is what the FCC is for.\n  So we just do not need to create the equivalent of a whole new \nregulatory agency just for telecommunications. It is just not needed. \nThe sort of extraordinary power is just not needed here.\n  Let us look. There are nearly two dozen existing safeguards that are \nalready contemplated and required by this bill. There is a \ncomprehensive, competitive checklist of 14 separate compliance points--\nunbundling, portability, the requirement for State regulator \ncompliance, the requirement that the Federal Communications Commission \nmake an affirmative public interest finding, the requirement that Bell \ncompanies comply with separate subsidiary requirements, the requirement \nthat the FCC allow whole public comment and participation, including \nfull participation by the antitrust division in all its various \nproceedings, the requirement that Bell companies comply with all the \nexisting FCC rules and regulations that are already on the books, \nincluding an annual attestation, very rigorous audits, elaborate cost \naccounting manuals and procedures, computer assisted reporting and \nanalysis systems such as the FCC's new automated regulatory and \nmanagement information systems, and all the existing tariff and pricing \nrules, full application of the Sherman Antitrust and Clayton act, and \nfull application of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Premerger Notification Act \nrequiring Justice clearance in most acquisitions.\n  I think our present Attorney General, and the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for Antitrust, have done a good job in many of the Hart-Scott-\nRodino areas that I have observed. That is what the Justice Department \nis supposed to do, and not worry about creating a bureaucracy and \nkeeping several hundred lawyers employed over there.\n  There is also the full application of the Hobbs Civil Appeals Act, \nSection 402(a) of the Communications Act which makes the Antitrust \nDivision automatically an independent party in every FCC common carrier \nand rulemaking appeal.\n  Finally, a consensus approach in this bill has been hammered out in \nthe most bipartisan way possible. It has strong support on both sides \nof the aisle.\n  We are all aware that several States have moved in the direction of \nderegulating telecommunications. I know that Nebraska, Illinois, \nTennessee, North Carolina, Florida, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, \nCalifornia, Wisconsin, Michigan--none of those States has given their \nGovernors or attorneys general the kind of extraordinary new powers \nwhich this Dorgan-Thurmond amendment would create here at the Federal \nlevel for the U.S. Department of Justice.\n  There are plenty of safeguards in this bill and existing law already. \nIf any competitive challenges arise because the Antitrust Division is \nnot allowed to convert itself into a telecommunications regulatory \nagency, Congress can revisit the issue. Justice already has adequate \nstatutory powers. This amendment represents the sort of undesirable \napproach toward regulation that the American public rejected last \n[[Page S8190]] fall and which we as a country cannot afford. The \nJustice Department already has a big role in telecommunications \nregardless of whether this amendment is adopted. The Department \nenforces the Sherman and Clayton antimerger laws, and they certainly \napply to telecommunications.\n  The Department has been an active participant in dozens of Federal \nCommunications Commission proceedings over the years, and it will \nremain an active participant. Under section 402(a) of the 1934 \nCommunications Act, moreover, the Antitrust Division has special status \nin every FCC common carrier and rulemaking appeal. They are what is \ncalled a statutory respondent, which means they are automatically an \nindependent party in all of those appeals in court actions.\n  So what we are really talking about here is whether to give the \nAntitrust Division even more of a role than they will have, and will \ncontinue to have. And, frankly, I would like to know why we need to \nhave this enormous amount of overlapping and duplicative effort focused \non telecommunications. I do not think the case has been made that \nexisting law is inadequate. In fact, I think it would be almost \nimpossible to do so because, it seems to me, Justice has all the \nenforcement tools it needs without additional surplus legislation.\n  I expect what all this boils down to is the Justice Department has \nabout 50 people spending $2 or $3 million a year trying to operate like \na telephone regulatory agency, a telephone regulatory agency, and they \nlike their jobs. They are up here telling us, if we do not adopt this \namendment, all sorts of bad things are going to happen.\n  They simply do not need this amendment if they want to stick to their \ntraditional role of being an antitrust enforcement agency.\n  When this bill was introduced before the Commerce Committee, my \ndistinguished colleague, the Senator from Arizona, noted that with more \nof the little provisions we added the more jobs we were creating for \nthe Federal bureaucracy. That is exactly what we have here, the \nfunctional equivalent of a jobs bill for the bureaucracy which we just \ndo not need.\n  The historic role of the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of \nJustice has been to operate as a law enforcement agency, not a \nregulator deciding which company can or cannot get into the market. \nThat kind of market entry decisionmaking has not been one of the \nJustice's roles until very recently--indeed, not until they drafted the \nAT antitrust consent decree.\n  I do not agree that the Justice Department and the executive branch \nshould be placed in this kind of industrial policymaking role. The \nDepartment should remain a law enforcement agency. I simply do not \nagree that it should transform itself into the functional equivalent of \na regulatory agency.\n  I am also a bit concerned about what the long-run effect of this kind \nof institutional transformation might be. On April 2, the Associated \nPress reported that the total dollar volume of corporate mergers and \nacquisitions reached a record $135.2 billion worldwide during just the \nfirst quarter of 1995. Last year, there were an all-time record number \nof these megamergers totaling some $339.4 billion. That was up to 43 \npercent compared with 1992.\n  At the same time this tremendous number of mergers and acquisitions \nis taking place the Antitrust Division seems to be focusing upon \nbecoming a telephone regulatory agency. I agree that telecommunications \nis critically important. But we have the Federal Communications \nCommission. We have the Public Service Commissions in all 50 States \nplus the District of Columbia. I do not think the taxpayers should be \nforced to pay to create and then support yet another telecommunications \nregulatory agency, namely the Antitrust Division. The Antitrust \nDivision should concentrate on its traditional role of enforcing the \nantitrust laws. They should be examining all those massive mergers and \nacquisitions that are taking place. They should not be spending all of \nthis time and effort focusing on duplicating what the FCC and the State \ncommissions are perfectly capable of handling.\n  Mr. President, I have pointed out before how slow the Justice \nDepartment is. We all know that my friends in the long distance \nindustry, some of them, are pushing for this amendment. They see it as \nanother promising way to game the process. They want to game the \nprocess rather than deregulate, to use the Federal Government to block \nadditional competition. And remember, delay in this area has genuine \ncash value.\n  I am very concerned that we take a look at some of the hopes of some \nof these companies. I consider them my friends, but I think that they \nare acting against consumers here. We really need to pass this bill. \nThis bill sets up a system for competition.\n  So, Mr. President, this bill represents the work of a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators who started work in November. This telecommunications \nbill received a vote of 17 to 2 coming out of the Commerce Committee \nwith all the Democrats on the committee. There is a wide range of \nideological spectrum there among the 9 Democrats and 10 Republicans, \nbut it happened to receive all the votes of the Democratic Senators. \nNow the White House is raising questions. My friend from Nebraska is \nraising questions. But we included them in our process. We did our best \nto get a bipartisan bill.\n  It is going to be tough to pass this bill because in \ntelecommunications legislating, as we found last year and over the \ndecades, each group can be a checkmate. Any one of the economic \napartheid groups in telecommunications can checkmate at any point in \nthe process. It is like playing chess with several people and anybody \ncan checkmate.\n  What has happened since the 1934 Communications Act is an economic \napartheid has sprung up and companies have done very well with this \ncompany doing local service, this area doing long distance service, \nthis area doing cable TV, this area doing broadcasting, and utilities \nprohibited from participating in all of this. This is a massive bill \nthat brings everybody into competition. It is procompetitive, \nderegulatory if we can keep it that way.\n  What is happening, however, is that each day and each month that this \nbill has moved forward, a lot of companies have said, wait a minute, \nwhen we said deregulation we meant deregulation of for me, not the \nother guy. When we presented them a fair playing field, they said, wait \na minute, we want a fair playing field with just a slight advantage. \nAnd virtually every lobbyist in America has been working on this bill \nin one form or another.\n  We have held off granting certain special deals to certain groups in \nthis Senate bill. For example, the newspaper publishers group sought \nspecial treatment for their electronic subsidiaries, and in the Senate \nwe said, no, everybody has to compete. Now, they have obtained that \nspecial treatment in the House bill.\n  Who knows, I may well be outvoted on that. But that is an example of \nhow we have tried to hold the line on competition. We have tried to \nmake it a procompetitive bill.\n  Now, in our history, in terms of telecommunications, this bill will \ntake us into the wireless age, which I think is about 10 or 15 years \naway. Some people think it is only 5 years away. But that will be an \nage when wires may be obsolete, and we are a ways away from that. But \nwe need this bill as a road map to get everybody into everybody else's \nbusiness.\n  Right now, regional Bells have to invest abroad if they want to \nmanufacture because they are restricted from doing so here at home. \nOther companies have this line of business or that line of business \nrestriction on them. This will let everybody into everybody else's \nbusiness. It will allow a great deal of competition.\n  Now, some will say, that will just result in a group of monopolies. \nIt will not, because we have the antitrust laws. But also let us look \nback to that day in 1982 when the Justice Department made two decisions \non the same day. The Justice Department decided to allow IBM and the \ncomputer industry to go into the marketplace and to let there be \nwinners and losers. It decided to place the MFJ ruling under Judge \nGreene on the telecommunications companies and break up into regional \nBells under heavy government regulation.\n  Now, you can argue this forever. This will be argued forever in \nindustrial history. But what happened in the computer area has been \nmagnificent. We [[Page S8191]] have new technology and product cycle \nevery 18 months. The turnover is so great. There are not Government \nstandards. There have been winners and losers, some big winners and \nsome big losers, some have gone out of business, some have become the \nBill Gateses of this world. It has been truly amazing to compare the \ntwo tracks: one a highly regulated area and the other deregulated. And \nwe will have that sort of an industrial argument.\n  Now we have come to a point in our history when we need another \nindustrial restructuring, and this one should be done by Congress. \nCongress should assert its responsibility for a change. The reason the \ncourts acted regarding the telecommunications area was because Congress \ncould not, because it is so politically sensitive. It is going to be \ntough to get through conference. It is going to be tough to get it \nthrough the House. It is going to be tough to get it signed because we \nhave some indications that the President might not be willing to sign \nit. I hope he is because I think it is the best bipartisan bill that we \nwill be able to get.\n  So I am going to step back to my charts once more and explain exactly \nwhat the bill is one final time.\n  The Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 is \ndesigned to get everybody into everybody else's business in \ntelecommunications. It is a massive bill. What does it do? First of \nall, in order to get into other businesses in telecommunications, they \nwould first comply with State market opening requirements.\n  Second, they would go to the FCC where there are two tests. The first \none is the standard of public interest, convenience and necessity test \nthat has been going on for years and years.\n  Third of all is the FCC would certify compliance with the 14-point \nchecklist. That is the checklist that I will explain here in just a \nminute.\n  The regional Bell telephone companies would have to comply with the \nseparate subsidiary requirement, the nondiscrimination requirement, and \ncross-subsidization ban.\n  The fifth step would be the Federal Communications Commission would \nallow the DOJ full participation in all its proceedings.\n  Now, the Bells must comply with existing FCC rules in rigorous annual \naudits, elaborate cost accounting, computer-assisted reporting, and \nspecial pricing rules. So there are a lot of requirements here that \nwill force the Bell operating companies to open up their businesses, to \nunbundle, and to interconnect so that people can form a local telephone \nservice and be successful with it.\n  Meanwhile, the full application of the Sherman Antitrust Act would \ncontinue with the Justice Department, and the Clayton Act, and the \nHart-Scott-Rodino Act. The Hobbs Civil Appeals Act involving DOJ as an \nindependent party and all FCC appeals would continue, so the Justice \nDepartment is already involved. What we would create through the \nDorgan-Thurmond amendment is just another layer of bureaucracy.\n  The competitive checklist has been distributed to all Senators. This \nchecklist was developed as a compromise to the VIII(c) test to \ndetermine when companies should be deemed eligible to enter the market, \nwhen they have opened up their local markets.\n  The problem with competition in telecommunications is that you have \nto use somebody else's wires to get where you are going. There have to \nbe some ground rules. So we came up with this checklist that the FCC \nwould use, in addition to the public interest standard.\n  The first one is access to network functions and services. That is an \ninterconnection. I went over to visit the Bell Atlantic facility here, \nand I've seen what interconnection and unbundling actually is.\n  Next is capability to exchange telecommunications between Bell \ncustomers and competitors' customers.\n  Next, access to poles, ducts, conduits, and rights of way.\n  Next, local loop transmission unbundled from switching. There are \nthree points on unbundling the system so other people can get into it \nand market things through the Bell company's system and wires.\n  Next, local transport from trunk side unbundled from switch.\n  Next, local switching unbundled.\n  Next is access to 911 and enhanced 911--which for emergency you might \npush one button--directory assistance and operator call completion \nservices.\n  Next, white pages directory listing available at a reasonable price.\n  Next, access to telephone number assignment.\n  Next, access to databases and network signaling.\n  Next, interim number portability.\n  Next, local dialing parity.\n  Next, reciprocal compensation.\n  And last, resale of local service to competitors.\n  So there we have the measures to assure the breakup of local Bell \nmonopolies. Now the big question is, will the regional Bell companies \nlet competition in? Well, if they do not, under S. 652 they will pay \nimmense financial penalties.\n  This checklist was agreed to. We had night after night of meetings in \nJanuary and February. We first wrestled with the VIII(c) test. Other \nSenators wanted a LeMans start. We came up with this checklist on a \nbipartisan basis, and I think it is the thing that will move us towards \ncompetition.\n  I have already talked a little bit about the problem with the \namendment tomorrow. I wanted to just point out again the average length \nof time that some of these waivers require. This first chart shows the \nnumber of days from zero to 1,200, starting in 1984, how the length of \ntime has expanded for the average age of waivers pending before the \nDepartment of Justice at year end.\n  What has happened is the Department of Justice has gotten slower and \nslower and slower. As the court has told it to go faster and faster, it \nhas arrogantly gone slower and slower. What is going on? Can someone \ngive me an explanation?\n  How can it be in 1993 it averaged nearly 1,200 days to get an answer, \na piece of paper, out of the Department of Justice?\n  What the Dorgan-Thurmond amendment is suggesting is that we finish \nall the checklist, all the public interest requirements, all the other \nrequirements and all the other safeguards, then we go to the Justice \nDepartment. My friends say, ``That will only take 90 days,'' but look \nat the record, look at the videotape, as they say in reporting sports.\n  On this chart it illustrates the number of requests with the \nDepartment of Justice and how frustrated industry has become. They \nstart out about at 86, shortly after that they were hopeful, up to 80. \nIt dropped way down in 1992 and 1993. It is not because there are too \nmany requests filed. People are just giving up. There is a lot of \nbusiness not being done. That is what we mean by drying up enterprise, \ndiscouraging competition. Imagine how it is when a business faces 3 \nyears of delays and 3 years of hiring lawyers and 3 years of having \nnothing but uncertainty to offer investors. Imagine asking your \ninvestment people to wait 3 years just for a decision. You do not get \ncompetition that way, and that is what the anticompetitive forces are \nlooking to. They want to use Government to keep other people out of \ntheir business. They want to use Government regulation to stop \ncompetition.\n  I say let us deregulate, let us be procompetitive and not go on with \npractices such as waiting 1,200 days for a piece of paper that the \ndistrict court thought could be issued in 30 days.\n  Mr. President, we have before us a procompetitive deregulatory bill. \nEverybody says they want to deregulate. Al Gore has a commission for \nprivatizing and deregulating and cutting Government. This bill before \nus will reduce the size of Government, it will protect those people who \nare applying, but it will not allow this sort of thing--1,200 days \nwaiting for a piece of paper.\n  This bill will also provide, for the first time, a number of market \nopenings: Utilities will be able to get into telecommunications with \nsafeguards, the subsidiary safeguard; the cable companies in this \ncountry will move towards deregulation and will be deregulated when 15 \npercent of their market has direct broadcast satellite or video dial \ncompetition. With the Dole, Pressler, Hollings, Daschle amendments \nthere is further deregulation for small cable; the newspaper publishers \nwill be in the electronics subdivision though there is a difference in \nthe [[Page S8192]] House and Senate versions; the broadcasters will get \nfurther deregulation because they are facing more competition, radio \nwith satellites, so forth.\n  The giant regional Bell companies will be forced to open up their \nmarkets to competition. They will be allowed to manufacture in this \ncountry. A long distance company will be able to get into the local \nmarkets.\n  So this is a vast, vast bill. If we do not pass this bill this year, \nit will be 1997 before we can try it again. We tried it last year. \nSenator Hollings did a terrific job, so did other Senators, Republicans \nand Democrats. But as I said, this sort of bill can be checkmated even \nat the last minute by any one of the interest groups.\n  I compare passing a telecommunications bill and some of the problems \nlike being in a room with a giant buffet table stacked high with food \nand people gathering about it ready to eat, but no one starts to eat \nbecause they want to be guaranteed that no body else is going to be \ngetting an extra carrot. The fact is, there is plenty for all.\n  I have never seen companies and groups so nervous, so anxious to get \none final slight advantage. This bill affects the burglar alarm \nbusiness because they have to go on to using other companies' wires. \nTomorrow there is going to be an amendment offered to give the burglar \nalarm companies 6 years protection before they have to compete. In the \nbill as it stands the burglar alarm companies get 3 years protection. \nThat is more than most others get. But now there is going to be an \namendment to give them 6 years of protection.\n  So every group wants to delay their entry into competition 3 to 6 \nyears. They are trying to figure out ways to get amendments. I say for \nthe American consumer that that is not right. The American consumer \nwants all these companies to compete, they want new small businesses to \nbe able to be formed to get into telecommunications. Today nobody but \nthe monopolies can get into local telephone service in this country, \nbut if this bill passes, two people can go out and form a local \ntelephone company.\n  This bill was not drafted by industry, as some may suggest. There has \nseldom been more of a bipartisan effort in this Senate. When we \nfinished the first draft, I walked a copy of this bill to every \nDemocratic Senator on the Commerce Committee, of whom there are nine, \nand put it into the Senator's hand. I said I wanted their staffs there. \nWe sent a memo around to everybody, saying, if you want to get involved \nin meetings at night and Saturdays and Sundays, come on around. I \ncommend my friend from Nebraska, because he sent a very able staffer \nwho helped write much of it. We are very glad for that assistance. We \nworked on this bill in a bipartisan way.\n  I said earlier this year that I felt if we did not get legislation \nout of the Senate by June, it is going to be tough going. I thank the \nleadership on both sides. My colleague Senator Daschle has been very \nhelpful, Senator Dole has been extraordinary, and Senator Lott, too--\nall of the leadership. My colleague here, Senator Hollings, has done a \ngreat job on the Democratic side. But if we do not get this bill \nthrough conference and to the President's desk and signed this year, it \nis not going to happen next year.\n  I say to all those legions of lobbyists and others who are calling in \nand doing their jobs--this is a democracy and people can petition their \nGovernment--I say to them that whatever their interest is, they have an \ninterest in this bill passing because it is procompetitive and \nderegulatory.\n  People who want to work and compete will do well under this bill. I \nthink we should all remember that, because this bill is, in my opinion, \nthe most important bill in terms of creating jobs for the next 10 or 15 \nyears. This bill will cause an explosion of new investment, it will \ncause an explosion of new jobs, the kind of jobs we want in this \ncountry.\n  Now, Mr. President, I have cited frequently that our regional Bell \ncompanies, and others, frequently are investing overseas. For example, \nEngland has deregulated its telecommunications. Many years ago, when I \nwas a student there, they were a socialistic economy. Now they have \nprivatized, deregulated, de-nationalized. England is, at last, coming \nout of its long recession as it deregulates. They have deregulated \ntheir telecommunications area, and our people can go there and build \ncable systems, as NYNEX and U.S. West, I believe, are doing. Our \ninvestors can go over there and participate. If they keep deregulating, \nthey are going to have a booming economy. You can mark my word on that. \nThey are on the way back. They figured it out that socialism was not \nbeneficial.\n  We are doing somewhat the same thing in our telecommunications area. \nOur telecommunications industry has not moved forward as fast as our \ncomputer industry has. There are all these companies which want to keep \nregulation to keep others out. They want Government-set standards, so \nthat the private standards cannot leap forward. They want another \nreview at the Justice Department after they have gone through two \nreviews. This is inside-the-beltway thinking. The further west I get in \nthis country the more agreement I find that we should deregulate and \nprivatize wherever possible.\n  So in conclusion, Mr. President, I may have some more remarks later. \nBut I think the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of \n1995 will be a signal point in our Nation's history if we pass it. If \nwe do not, we will remain locked up in economic apartheid--each sector \nprotected from the other, kept from getting into the other's business. \nWe will see more of our jobs going overseas and more and more of our \nmanufacturing and innovation going overseas, American workers not \ngetting the new kinds of jobs we need.\n  Many of our industries are aging industries, and we read in the paper \nabout this many people being laid off here and that many being laid off \nthere. This is one of the great jobs bills ever to come before \nCongress. I remember being in the House and we used to debate the \nHumphrey-Hawkins job creation bill--whether or not the Government could \ncreate jobs through the Federal Government paying people to do make-\nwork types of things. I opposed it many years ago in the 1970's when I \nwas in the House of Representatives.\n  But S. 652 is a jobs creation bill that does not cost the Government \nanything. In fact, the government costs will be reduced. There will be \nless in regulation than there is now, provided we do not adopt the \nDorgan amendment tomorrow, which would add another layer of regulation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I may have some more remarks to \nmake later.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I do not know how long I am going to \nrespond, but we will have time tomorrow to discuss this.\n  In my judgment, the Senator from South Dakota just misdescribed both \nour amendment and what the Department of Justice is doing and why the \npeople of the United States of America should want this amendment \nadopted.\n  He repeatedly comes to the floor and says that this is ``another \nlayer of bureaucracy,'' and describes himself as being beleaguered with \nopponents who are trying to prevent something from happening, that we \nare deregulating, and we ought not interfere with this process.\n  I say again for emphasis, Mr. President, that nobody in my campaign \nin 1994 came to me and said, gee, I hope you deregulate the telephone \ncompanies. I am an advocate of doing this. But the Senator from South \nDakota says, gee, this was not written by industry. It may not have \nbeen written specifically by industry, although I daresay you would \nhave to struggle long and hard to find a Member of this Congress that \ncould come up with that 14-point checklist. That is a technical \nchecklist that does not look like it is in the language that at least I \nhear us using as we describe telecommunications.\n  It may not have been written by industry, but American industry is \nasking for this legislation. It allows them to do things they are \ncurrently prohibited from doing. I am an advocate of allowing them \ndoing some things they are prohibited from doing. I favor deregulation. \nI am tired of hearing the straw man set up time after time that somehow \nyou are either for deregulation and therefore against this amendment, \nor you are against deregulation and, therefore, you support the \namendment. That is a nonsense straw man argument. [[Page S8193]] \n  The questions for consumers, for citizens to ask is, what is this \nthing all about? What do you mean, Senator Kerrey, that these companies \nwant to do something they cannot currently do? The long distance \ncompanies want to come in and sell us local telephone service. So there \nis a section in here that tells them not only how they get in the \nbusiness but how others can get in the business.\n  Section 251 is a pretty darn good section. Section 255 is the one \nthat is in question now, which is the local companies saying we want to \nprovide long distance service. We want to enter the long distance \nservice market. By the way, I heard the Senator from South Dakota \ntalking about the Humphrey-Hawkins Act and full employment. The \ncompanies that are arguing the loudest and strongest for this \nlegislation have reduced their employment. They have reduced their \nemployment in the decade of the 1980's, since divestiture occurred. Do \nwe have more jobs in computers? No. We have 150,000 fewer. Do we have \nmore jobs in local telephone companies? No, smaller employment. Do we \nhave more jobs at AT long distance? No, smaller employment.\n  I would be, as a Member of this body, real careful not to promise \nthat somehow when I deregulate and say to a company, you can start \npricing at cost, that that is going to result in an increase in \nemployment. I will bet you this results in additional downsizing of \nbusinesses. This promise of jobs is going to taste real bitter to the \nfamilies who get laid off. You can say, well, Senator, but there are \ngoing to be jobs created in other sectors. I think that is likely to be \nthe case. It is likely to be the case.\n  The Senator from South Dakota asks why would I want the Department of \nJustice role, and says, look at the lousy job they have done. Those \ncharts misrepresent what the Department of Justice has done. They are \nthe competition agency, not the Congress. This Congress did not have \nthe guts to stand up to the AT monopoly in 1982. It did not have the \nguts to stand up to them. Who filed the consent decree? Who sued the \nAT monopoly? Who led to this competitive environment in long \ndistance? Was it the people's Congress, out of concern for the citizens \nand the rates they were paying? No, siree, it was not. It was the \nJustice Department suing on our behalf.\n  Because we did not have the guts to take them on. That is what \nhappened.\n  So citizens say, why do I want the Justice Department to be involved? \nThe answer, plain and simple, is when it comes time to go after a \nmonopoly who is preventing competition, they are the ones that have \ndone it. They are the ones that have done it.\n  The second reason we want them involved, I would argue, is they are \nthe ones, for a relatively small amount of money, that are likely to \nmake the tough calls.\n  I am not going to get into a great discussion about this here this \nevening, but there was a newspaper article this morning in the New York \nTimes. It talked about whether or not the Federal Communications \nCommission, the agency that has all the responsibility here, is doing a \nvery good job.\n  I have not up until now, and indeed even now I will not say as the \nSenator from South Dakota just said, ``I suspect that the reason \nSenator Kerrey wants a DOJ rule is there are a few lawyers that want to \nkeep their job.'' What baloney. Leave that argument off the floor. That \nis baloney. That is not what is going on.\n  Go back to airline deregulation. When we passed deregulation for the \nairline industry, we said precisely what we are saying in this bill. We \nsaid we are not going to give the Department any role beyond \nconsultation.\n  Guess what happened when TWA proposed to acquire Ozark, when \nNorthwest Airlines proposed to acquire Republic? What happened? The \nDepartment opposed it, objected to it, offered strenuous objections, \nbut they had no ability to say no. They had no legal authority.\n  We are trying to correct, based upon lessons of the past, mistakes of \nthe past. That is what we are trying to do, on behalf of consumers. If \nwe do not get a competitive environment, they will not get any \nadvantages.\n  I bet, of the seven regional Bell operating companies, there is at \nleast $1.5 billion cash flow average from these corporations. These are \nbig corporations. These are big businesses. They are hungry to expand \ntheir business, and I want to allow them to expand their business.\n  Unless we get competition at the local level, we will end up having \nwhat we had with airline deregulation, when the Department, with only a \nconsultative role, only could object to the mergers in question. And \nlook what happened to St. Louis when TWA was allowed to come in and \nacquire Ozark. Look what happened in Minneapolis when Northwest \nproceeded without any obstacle being offered to the acquisition of \nRepublic Airlines.\n  Mr. President, all the Dorgan-Thurmond amendment says is, do the \ncitizens want the Department of Justice to be able to say yes or no? Do \nyou want the Department to be able to say yes or no? All the \npresentations about the waiver requests that have been slowing up; the \nvery people that filed the applications very often cause the cases to \ngo slow because they make an overly broad application for waiver of the \nproblems that the Department can say, we can, in an expeditious \nfashion, say no. Or we can sit with a company and try to work through \nthis application that they know is too broad, that goes at the core of \nthe restrictions under the modified final judgment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article that appeared in this \nmorning's New York Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the New York Times]\n\n                    Has the F.C.C. Become Obsolete?\n\n                         (By Edmund L. Andrews)\n\n       WASHINGTON, June 11--David Margolese is a bit player on the \n     information highway, barely a footnote in the $700 billion \n     communications industry. But his experience over the last \n     five years provides a textbook example of why the Federal \n     Communications Commission is under attack as never before.\n       Mr. Margolese, head of a tiny company called CD-Radio Inc., \n     has gambled $15 million since 1990 to develop a satellite \n     service that beams 30 channels of music to radios nationwide. \n     He thinks it would fill a big gap, reaching rural hamlets and \n     lonely stretches of interstate highway that ordinary radio \n     stations do not reach.\n       There is a problem, though: the F.C.C. will not let him do \n     it. Traditional radio broadcasters have adamantly fought \n     satellite radio, fearing it as a competitor. Agency officials \n     are torn. Having repeatedly inched forward and back, the \n     agency plans to inch forward again as early as Monday by \n     proposing rules about what kind of service a satellite radio \n     company will be allowed to provide.\n       Mr. Margolese is fuming. ``All we want to do is give people \n     a choice that they don't have now,'' he said. ``That's all we \n     want to do--give consumers a chance to choose whether our \n     idea is a better idea.''\n       Anti-government fever is a given in Newt Gingrich's \n     Washington, and agencies ranging from the Food and Drug \n     Administration to the Commerce Department are under sustained \n     attack. But bureaucrat for bureaucrat, few agencies wield as \n     much influence over industry and consumers as the F.C.C. \n     Created during the Depression, when AM radio was king and \n     government regulation was considered essential by many \n     people, the F.C.C. was chartered as the guardian of the \n     public airwaves, charged with insuring that they were used \n     wisely.\n       ``Do you or do you not want a consumer protection function \n     in this arena?'' asked Reed E. Hundt, the commission's \n     chairman. ``If you don't, where else would literally tens of \n     thousands of complaints go?''\n       Today, the agency has an immense impact on almost every \n     communications medium. It has opened the air-waves to \n     cellular phones and direct-broadcast satellites. It parcels \n     out billions of dollars worth of broadcast licenses, defining \n     the terms of competition for television, radio, satellites \n     and phone service.\n       But the word into which it was born has gone the way of \n     Norman Rockwell, and critics abound. Conservatives argue that \n     the commission does more harm than good, hindering \n     competition and delaying valuable new services. Consumer \n     advocates say it is often a captive of the industries it \n     regulates. Little mentioned in all this is that the F.C.C.'s \n     most-criticized restrictions have been initiated at the \n     behest of business groups.\n       Mr. Gingrich has said he would like to abolish it entirely. \n     Republicans on the House Commerce Committee, vowing to cut \n     back its authority, held a series of closed-door meetings \n     with industry executives and agency officials last week to \n     explore ideas intended to curb the agency's powers.\n       Examples of gridlock are abundant. Nearly three years ago, \n     the F.C.C. moved to promote competition in cable television \n     by adopting rules to let telephone companies offer a rival \n     service called video dial tone. But telephone companies saw \n     their applications to offer the service languish as agency \n     [[Page S8194]] officials insisted on changes in many plans. \n     Today, only a handful of tiny experiments exist, and many \n     telephone companies have decided to ask cities for \n     traditional cable TV franchises.\n       If the agency and its video dial tone rules had never \n     existed, economists say, telephone companies might have \n     offered cable service two decades ago and perhaps have \n     prevented cable television monopolies in local markets.\n       In the meantime, the F.C.C.'s efforts to regulate cable \n     prices have been plagued by policy shifts and the complexity \n     of its pricing rules. The first set of such rules, intended \n     to carry out a law passed in 1992, inadvertently sent rates \n     up rather than down for many customers.\n       A second effort early in 1994 pushed cable rates down 17 \n     percent. But after incurring a storm of criticism from the \n     industry and from conservatives in Congress, the agency has \n     in recent months adopted still another series of rules that \n     give breaks to small cable systems and to companies that add \n     programming.\n       Today, some critics of the cable industry say the price \n     regulations are more trouble than they are worth. ``The \n     system is a brain-dead patient on life support,'' said Barry \n     Orton, a professor of telecommunications at the University of \n     Wisconsin and a consultant to many small towns that want to \n     start regulating cable prices. ``The smaller towns and cities \n     that I work with say that they've had it. It's too \n     complicated, and it's too full of holes.''\n       But for all the complaints by businesses and their \n     Congressional champions, it is business groups that typically \n     have sought to have the agency umpire their disputes. Some of \n     the most onerous and ridiculed F.C.C. rules are those \n     resulting from intense industry lobbying.\n       For instance, Hollywood studios fought ferociously three \n     years ago to keep television networks out of their business, \n     until a Federal court overturned the F.C.C.'s rules. Local \n     phone companies lobby fiercely to preserve universal service \n     and to delay rules exposing them to new competition. Cable \n     companies have filed more than 20,000 pages of briefs to \n     block phone companies from providing TV programming.\n       But defenders of the commission, who argue that it is the \n     crucial guardian of the public interest, note that it has \n     consistently tried to promote market competition and move \n     away from traditional regulation. And even the staunchest \n     conservatives have praised one of the commission's \n     initiatives--the auctioning of thousands of new licenses for \n     wireless telephone and data services, a revolutionary \n     departure that raised more than $9 billion in the last year \n     and is expected to increase competition sharply in the \n     cellular telephone market.\n       ``Everybody agrees that you want competition,'' said Mr. \n     Hundt, the F.C.C. chairman, who was appointed by President \n     Clinton. ``But you have to have rules of fair competition if \n     you want to have competitors to enter the market.'' He \n     conceded that the agency had in the past been guilty of \n     micromanagement, but passionately defended its charter to \n     protect the public interest.\n       A schoolmate and soulmate of Vice President Al Gore, Mr. \n     Hundt promotes a vision of linking all schools to advanced \n     computer networks, and he has proposed rules to expand \n     educational television programs for children. He also \n     vigorously defends the commission's duty to protect consumers \n     from overpricing and to open traditional monopolies in \n     telephone and cable television.\n       Republican lawmakers agree on that point. They are seeking \n     to pass a sweeping bill deregulating the telecommunications \n     industry, in part by knocking down barriers that prevent \n     cable television and phone companies from attacking each \n     other's markets. The same bill asks the F.C.C. to start \n     dozens of new proceedings, some to find ways of insuring \n     affordable prices for rural areas and for the poor.\n       In addition to the flak it takes from Capitol Hill, the \n     agency has its own civil strife. It never seemed more at war \n     with itself than in its attempt to let telephone companies \n     offer video dial tone services. The goal of the rules, \n     adopted in 1992, was to break the monopolies enjoyed by most \n     cable companies.\n       Yet the phone companies became bogged down, and F.C.C. \n     officials complained that the companies were reserving too \n     many channels for themselves and leaving too few for \n     independent programmers. They argued about how the phone \n     companies were allocating for construction costs and sought \n     volumes of technical information.\n       ``It makes no sense,'' said Peter W. Huber, a senior fellow \n     at the Manhattan Institute. ``After 15 years of cable \n     monopolies, almost anything would be an improvement. Even if \n     the phone company keeps most of the channels for itself, you \n     would at least have two competitors instead of only one.''\n       F.C.C. officials say they are not entirely to blame for the \n     delays, noting that many phone companies had voluntarily \n     withdrawn applications, citing technological uncertainties.\n       ``At a minimum, there has got to be dramatic reform,'' said \n     Representative Jack Fields of Texas, chairman of the House \n     Commerce telecommunications subcommittee.\n       Business interests may turn out to be the agency's white \n     knight. With competition heating up among industries, cable, \n     phone and even satellite companies will all be looking to the \n     agency for help in attacking each other's market while \n     defending their own turf.\n       Some consumer advocates add that the agency has often \n     provided crucial support for competition. Though it stalled \n     MCI's effort to enter long-distance service in the 1970's, \n     the F.C.C. later adopted a wide variety of rules that helped \n     it compete with AT\n       ``What many critics fail to see are the tremendous \n     benefits,'' said Gene Kimmelman, a lobbyist for Consumers \n     Union. ``It's unlikely that MCI and Sprint would have been \n     able to make it without regulatory protections designed to \n     move the long-distance industry from monopoly to \n     competition.''\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, it is an interesting article for citizens \nsaying what is going on here.\n  Will the consumer get a fair shake? Let me call your attention to the \namendment that actually is in front of the Senate, which is the \namendment of the Senator from California and from Idaho, on behalf of \ncities saying, ``Wait a minute.''\n  In the midst of all this talk, is it not part of the Republican \nContract With America to shift more authority back to the States? Those \nengines of innovation. What happened to the engines of innovation \nargument? Forget that.\n  Thirty-some States that have deregulated from rate-based rate of \nreturn, we are saying, that is enough. We will preempt all and go to \nprice caps. States do not have authority any longer in this regard. \nThey have authority under price caps, or pricing regulation, but no \nlonger do they have a choice.\n  If you are a State legislature or citizen out there wrestling with \nthe early stages of debate, the Federal Government will decide it for \nyou. Rate-based rate of return is out the window, and we are going to \nprice caps.\n  The Senators from California and from Idaho point out not only that, \nbut anything that local government does, if it interferes with a \ncompetitive environment, can be prohibited under reducing and \neliminating the barriers to competition. This is a substantial move, I \nthink a correct move, in general.\n  By the way, I am not trying to come to the floor and say I think the \nFCC is a lousy organization or I think there is a bunch of lobbyists \ntrying to influence my vote or anybody else's vote.\n  I am trying to say on behalf of consumers based upon the experience \nboth that created the breakup of AT in the first place and the \nairline deregulation case where the Department of Transportation now \nsays they made a mistake not asking for more than merely a consultative \nrole from the Department.\n  Mr. President, the story in the New York Times this morning is \nheadlined ``Has the FCC Become Obsolete?'' I understand the Senator \nfrom South Dakota is basically saying let the FCC do it all, with only \na nominal Department of Justice role. We will run this whole thing \nthrough the Federal Communications Commission. We do not want \nduplication of the bureaucracy. We know how the bureaucracies get. They \ntie things up.\n  Let me read things in this article. This touches the tip of the \nproverbial iceberg. CD Radio, Inc, that says, with $15 million since \n1990 to develop a satellite service that beams 30 channels of music to \nradios, they think they fill a big need.\n  The FCC will not let them do it. Why? Because traditional radio \nbroadcasters have adamantly fought satellite radio, fearing it as a \ncompetitor. The FCC is blocking competition in this case, not allowing \nit, nervous about it. Why? Because they are the most vulnerable to \npolitical pressure, frankly, Mr. President, a lot more vulnerable than \nthe Department of Justice.\n  That has been the competitive agency, the one that has promoted the \nmost competition between the FCC and the Department of Justice. I get a \nlot more citizens questioning the existence of the FCC than I get \ncitizens coming to me saying, ``Why don't you abolish the Antitrust \nDivision of the Department?''\n  I do not get people saying, ``I think the Antitrust Division \noverstepped its bounds. Why not get rid of them?'' But I am hearing \ncomplaints from people who question decisions of the Federal \nCommunications Commission.\n  This agency, as I indicated, is an interesting agency. We will hear \nbusinesses complain about it an awful lot. ``They are slowing me \ndown,'' and all the arguments that the Senator from South Dakota makes, \n``Poor old businesses. They are making it difficult for \n[[Page S8195]] me to get the approval, my waiver, granted,'' and all \nthat.\n  It says for all the complaints by businesses and their congressional \nchampions, it is business groups that typically have sought to have the \nagency umpire their disputes. Some of the most ridiculed FCC rules are \nthose resulting from intense, industry lobbying.\n  For instance, Hollywood studios fought ferociously to keep television \nnetworks out of their business, until a Federal court overturned the \nFCC's rules. Local telephone companies lobby fiercely to preserve \nuniversal service and to delay rules exposing them to new competition. \nCable companies have filed more than 20,000 pages of briefs to block \nphone companies from providing TV programs.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that the FCC intentionally is \ncreating bottlenecks so as to employ themselves. I do not come down \nhere to the floor saying I know why they are doing this.\n  There is nothing devious going on. The fact of the matter is our \nproblem is we have a tough time making political decisions. I have a \nbusiness come and say, ``I want to compete,'' and the next day someone \nsays, ``I don't want to compete.'' It is tough to say you have to \ncompete. That is what this legislation purportedly attempts to do.\n  The Department needs a role, Mr. President. The Department can, on \nbehalf of consumers, say, not that you have a 14-point checklist. You \ncould have the 14-point checklist and a consumer not have any choice. \nHow do I know I have a choice with a 14-point checklist? I would rather \nabolish the checklist and have the DOJ with a role in this deal, if \nthat is what the Senator from South Dakota wants to do, wants to get \nrid of some of the things the FCC does under this legislation, I am \nwilling to do it.\n  I am willing to deregulate the companies, so you have less regulation \nfor them. I am not an advocate of the status quo, of maintaining the \nstatus quo. But I want the agency that has had, I think, the best \nsuccess, being able to say to the monopoly we are not going to allow \nyou to prevent competition. I want that agency on behalf of consumers \nto make sure I do have competition. I do not want a bunch of mumbo-\njumbo rules and regulations that everybody can cook and game and hire \nlawyers to try to figure out how to come out on the winning side. That, \nit seems to me, is what happens if you set up all these little rules \nand regulations and hoops you have to jump through, down at the FCC. I \nwould sooner have the Department of Justice sitting there saying: We \nwant competition at the local level. If we see competition at the local \nlevel we are going to allow you to go into long distance. I would much \nsooner have the Department of Justice be that arbiter--not regulator, \nbut an arbiter of the question: Do we have competition? Yes or no? Is \nit competitive down there at the local level? Do we have the kind of \ncompetition that allows us, now, to run the risk--and it is a risk--of \nallowing the telephone companies to get into long distance?\n  I hope this amendment is accepted. I hope the Thurmond amendment is \naccepted, because I believe it is one of the few proconsumer things in \nthis legislation. I think consumers will benefit enormously the quicker \nwe get to competition, where true competition exists at the local level \nand across the range of telecommunications industries.\n  This bill does not get us there immediately. It sets a structure in \nplace to move from a monopoly to a competitive environment. That is \nwhat it does. No one denies that. The idea that somehow we are \nderegulating these companies automatically--it is not true. We allow \nthem to keep their monopoly in place. We phase it out. We set \ntimetables in place. We have tests they have to meet and all that sort \nof thing. They are allowed to stay in a monopoly situation. The sooner \nyou get to a competitive environment where the consumers are deciding \nwhat they want and what is best for them the sooner we are going to get \nrapid decreases in prices and rapid increases in quality.\n  I believe the Senator from South Dakota is well-intended with this \nlegislation, as I have indicated before. I support large portions of \nthis. I do not come down here and say this bill is anticompetitive or \nanticonsumer. But I do believe strongly that if we want the consumer to \nbenefit from competition then we have to make sure the Department of \nJustice has a role in telling us when competition exists.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would like to say that, first of all, \nin the drafting of this bill, it was done by Senators and staff. But \nRepublican and Democratic staff sat down together. I do not know if \nthat has ever been done before with a bill. This bill was not drafted \nby industry. It was drafted by Senators and staff here in the Senate. \nThey negotiated and worked, and met with Senators with the product of \ntheir work, and invited the input from other Senators, and came up with \nthe competitive checklist, which was not proposed by industry. It was \nproposed by staff as a compromise between the ``actual and \ndemonstrable'' and VIII(c) tests that had been used last year and the \nconcept of a date certain standard which was utilized by my initial \nchairman's draft--to find a way in this complex telecommunications \narena to have a test of when markets are open.\n  This has not been easy. For instance, let us say you are in the \nspaghetti business and you have to have somebody else deliver your \nspaghetti for you. Can you imagine what shape it is going to be in when \nit is delivered? Especially when the person delivering it is your \ncompetitor.\n  But in this telecommunications area it is so complicated to get \ncompetition in because you have to depend frequently on your \ncompetitors' wires to get to where you are going. That is why we still \nneed some level of regulation. That is why we still need an FCC at this \npoint. Although I hope in the very near future we can see the FCC \nreduced a great deal and ultimately whither away.\n  This bill was drafted with the public interest in mind. This bill \ncontinues to have universal service, which will assure that those high \ncost areas and regions of the country will have telecommunications. Our \nantitrust laws continue under this bill. In fact, the Justice \nDepartment has a major role.\n  But assigning a decisionmaking role, as the Dorgan-Thurmond amendment \ndoes, to the Justice Department, is unprecedented. The Department is \nalways required to initiate a lawsuit in the event it concludes the \nantitrust laws were violated. It has no power to disapprove \ntransactions or issue orders on its own, generally speaking.\n  Indeed, Judge Greene's court kept the power to make the decisions \nthrough all these years. The people who work there really work for him, \nor for his court. This would be the first time we are giving the \nJustice Department this kind of regulatory power--a decisionmaking \nrole.\n  If you look at history, the law, regulation and history of railroads \nclosely mirrors that of telephony. The Telecommunications Act of 1934 \nwas modeled on the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887. The Federal \nCommunications Commission was modeled on the Interstate Commerce \nCommission. Both industries involved common carriage, and the \nestablishment of networks. Both industries have been required to \nprovide essential service to rural areas. Both industries have been \nregarded as monopolies. They share issues related to captive customers, \ncompetitive access, the desire to enter related lines of business, and \nthe loss of traffic to alternative carriers.\n  Congress has delegated exclusive Federal authority to the Interstate \nCommerce Commission to decide whether a railroad should be permitted to \nenter into new lines of business. The Department of Justice may file \ncomments in the proceeding but is given no specific statutory role. \nEven in proceedings involving mergers, acquisitions and other \ntransactions between two class I railroads, Justice has no specific \nstatutory role. Although the Department can and usually does submit its \nviews on the excessive effects of a proposed transaction, the ICC can \napprove a merger over the objections of Justice.\n  Indeed, the potential adverse effect of competition is only one of \nfive factors considered by the ICC in its determination whether to \npermit a proposed merger or acquisition between the Nation's largest \nrailroads. Congress has given the ICC a broader mandate than \n[[Page S8196]] simply competition. As the agency of expertise, Congress \nhas directed it to balance transportation and employee interests, among \nothers, with competitive concerns and to accord substantial weight--not \nto recommendations of Justice--but to any recommendation of the \nSecretary of Transportation. Justice is not even mentioned in the \nstatutory mechanism.\n  I could go on through various other areas. But the point is, it is \nthe intent of our structure that this be done at the FCC. What we in \nCongress want the FCC to do, if it is universal service or whatever it \nis, or if it is compensation or whatever is decided, the idea is that \nthe representatives of the people are supposed to decide, not the \ncourts. And if it is good or bad, Congress should be thrown out of \noffice or held accountable for it.\n  Presently we have no one here who is accountable for what is \nhappening in telecommunications because the courts have taken it over. \nAnd that is a major part of this bill, to put Congress back in charge \nof telecommunications and information policymaking and to let the \npeople make judgments on us as they do in elections. That is the basis \nof democracy. That is what democracy is about.\n  So, the Federal Communications Commission regulates the communication \nindustry. It should. The Department of Justice should enforce the \nantitrust laws. Or we can change the antitrust laws if we want. But to \ncreate a group of regulators over at the Department of Justice is not \nwise. Legislation pending before Congress supersedes the provisions of \nthe modification of final judgment that governed Bell company entry \ninto business now prohibited to them. Once legislation is signed into \nlaw, a continued Department of Justice role in telecommunications \npolicy is no longer necessary except in the area of enforcing the law.\n  DOJ does not need an ongoing regulatory role as part of an update of \nour Nation's communications policy. Such a role would be duplicative of \nthe FCC's authority. Actual regulatory oversight is not what DOJ is \nequipped to provide. DOJ's claim that it ``alone among Government \nagencies understands marketplace issues as opposed to regulatory \nissues'' is inaccurate. I agree with many of the objectives as my \nfriend from Nebraska. Indeed, I think the Senator from Nebraska and I \nhave the same objectives. But we have carefully crafted this bill over \nmonths of work, included universal service, included more competition, \nincluded more deregulation, included more freedom. It has been a very \ndelicate balance.\n  Dual Department of Justice and FCC bureaucracies to regulate the \ncommunications industry delay the benefits competition brings \nconsumers.\n  These benefits include lower prices, new services, and more choices \nfor communications services. I have already gone through the length of \ntime and the cost, and ultimately these costs are paid by consumers. \nYou know you can do more for a senior citizen by helping them have \nlower gas prices to heat their home in the winter than you can by \ngiving them a check, frequently. For example, when we deregulated \nnatural gas in the late 1970's, early 1980's-- I must say that it was a \nDemocratic President who took the lead on that-- and we followed \nthrough with a Republican President. But when that occurred I was over \nin the House and coming to the Senate. I heard all the speeches about \nhow, if we deregulate natural gas prices will skyrocket, the companies \nwill gouge the public, and senior citizens will need subsidies to pay \ntheir heating bills. Look at what has happened with natural gas prices. \nThey collapsed. They have been low. They almost give the stuff away \nthere is so much competition. Senior citizens have had cheaper gas \nbills, and farmers have had cheaper bills in drying corn.\n  Some people think you are compassionate if you give checks out to \npeople, if the Federal Government gives a senior citizen a check every \nmonth. That is nice, if we can afford it, and it is needed in some \ncases. But I say that you do just as much for consumers in this country \nof providing competition for cheaper products and new innovations.\n  Let us take the computer industry. Forty percent of our homes have a \npersonal computer. The price is dropping and dropping. There is new \ntechnology of every 18 months because there is not Government \nregulation, because there is competition. Some people would say the \nGovernment should set standards for computers or provide for regulation \nof the computer industry. Then it would take 10 years to get a new \ncomputer. Some people would say why not model the computer industry on \nthe telecommunications model. But the fact is that prices are dropping, \ntechnological innovation flourishing and America's leading the world \nbecause of the fierce free market competition in the computer industry. \nSo I say let us model the telecommunications sector on the computer \nmodel.\n  Let us look at cellular telephones, for example. That is one of the \nfew parts of the information highway that we have. Everybody talks \nabout the so-called information superhighway. What is it? It is cable \nTV, it is some cellular, and some computer Internet. But in reality we \nhave not gotten much of it yet, whatever it is going to be. But it is \ngoing to be invented and sold when we have competition and \nderegulation. Cellular technology was invented in the late fifties. \nThen Government regulation took 30 years before it was approved for \nsale. Government regulation said it could only be sold in certain areas \nby certain people. It was not until the 1990's that we finally got full \nderegulation and competition in cellular phones. And within a few \nyears, everybody is carrying a cellular phone. They are getting smaller \nand smaller. Government regulation is off. But it was delayed from the \nlate 1950's until the late 1980's--30 years of delay because of \nGovernment regulation. We could have had this in the 1960's or the \n1970's. It is estimated that that delay cost American consumers $89 \nbillion. That stimulates our economy when people can communicate \nbetter, and do business deals faster. They can be safer. A senior \ncitizen can push a button on an emergency communications device in \ntheir bathroom and have an emergency call placed. These things were not \navailable. They were known since the 1950's but because of Government \nregulation they did not come into being until very recently.\n  So I could cite computers. I could cite cellular phones. I could go \non and cite many other areas. But in this particular area of \ntelecommunications we are going to see a boom of new devices, and a \ndropping of prices. We are going to see telephone prices drop \nsubstantially. We are going to see long distance rates drop. We are \ngoing to see cable television rates drop. Presently people are paying \ntoo much for telephone calls. As I have indicated in an earlier stage \nof this debate, based on the same ratio as how much computer prices \nhave dropped and processing power increased, you should be paying only \na few cents for most long distance calls and fewer cents for most local \ncalls. That is the fact.\n  So we need competition and deregulation. This bill has it in it but \nit is being opposed. Talk about corporate interest, the companies who \nare supporting the Dorgan amendment have been running full-page ads in \nour newspapers. That is fine. They can do so. But this idea that one \nside is all corporate interests and the other side is not is not true. \nThere are large corporations on both sides of this amendment. But the \npeople supporting the Dorgan amendment have been spending millions on \nlobbyists and full-page ads just like the opposition has been.\n  So those people who cry corporate interests, pick up yesterday's \nnewspapers and read the full-page ads. Both sides have done it. But \nlately, all the spending has been done by people who supported the \nDepartment of Justice role because they want to slow competition down \nand game the process.\n  So there is corporate interests on both sides of this. I do not like \npontificating by either side. I hope I am not pontificating. But the \npoint is, look at the newspapers of last week and see who was buying \nthe full-page ads.\n  So, Mr. President, I conclude by saying that I think we have a good \nbill. I hope that we hold it together. I am confident we will pass this \nbill with overwhelming bipartisan support. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, one very quick response. One of the rules \nof debate is say something over and over and over and pretty soon \npeople begin to believe it is true. This amendment [[Page S8197]] does \nnot give the Department of Justice a regulatory role. It gives them a \nresponsibility to make a determination as to whether or not there is \ncompetition. That is what it does. It does not carve out some new area \nof the Department of Justice to regulate. Indeed, the legislation \nitself is as a consequence of our recognizing that there is too much \nconfusion in current law; that there are too many bottlenecks in \ncurrent law. That is what we are attempting to do about the underlying \nlegislation, to come up with a simplified test in a simplified way for \nbusinesses to know what it is that they can do and try to remove the \nregulatory hurdles of entry into various markets. That is what we are \ntrying to do.\n  This underlying amendment very simply says, first by Senator Dorgan \nand now by Senator Thurmond, merely that the Department of Justice \nshould not just have a consultative role. ``Oh, by the way. What do you \nthink?'' Instead, the Department would have a role based on section 7 \nof the Clayton Act in making a determination as to whether RBOC entry \ninto interLATA services would substantially lessen competition or tend \nto create a monopoly. That is the idea.\n  I just appeal to the consumers out there trying to figure out which \nside to come down on. Look at that 14-point test. It all looks fine to \nme. They say, ``Well, this was put together by staff or it was put \ntogether by us here in Congress.'' It took me a long time to figure out \nwhat all 14 mean, and I am still am not sure what each one means. I do \nnot know if they will produce competition.\n  I can imagine a scenario under which you get no competition with \nthose 14 items. Competition again means the consumers have real \nchoices. The Senator from South Dakota talks about the cellular \nindustry being restricted. It was restricted by the monopoly of AT \nThe monopoly kept the technology from coming online. It was not \nCongress. Congress did not say in the 1970's we have this great new \ntechnology, cellular. So what we are going to do is take on the \nmonopoly, and we do not care what AT says. We are going to disregard \nthis influence on Congress and we will come down here and pass \nlegislation that will break them up. That did not happen, I say to \nconsumers now who have benefited from reduced rates for long distance \nand increased quality in long distance. The increase in quality and \ndeployment of fiber occurred as a consequence of this competition. That \nbenefit did not come as a result of Congress having the courage to take \non the monopoly. It came as a consequence of the Department of Justice \nsuing on behalf of the American consumer.\n  So this amendment is simply something that says to consumers you are \ngoing to have the Department of Justice who brought you competition in \nthe long-distance arena, who objected to mergers that were allowed to \ngo forward in airline deregulation which reduced competitive choice and \nincreased prices, we are going to give this agency not a consultative \nrole but the opportunity to say that there is or there is not \ncompetition.\n  If there is competition, have at it. It may be that they say it is a \nheck of a lot faster. Judging from the evidence at hand, it is likely \nthey come at least as quick to the conclusion as to whether or not \nthere is competition as the FCC looking at this 14-part test.\n  So we are going to have a vote on this tomorrow at 12:30. We will \nhave an opportunity to debate it a little bit in the morning. I look \nforward to it, and I hope it will be that the amendment passes because \nI believe on behalf of American consumers it is going to ensure \ncompetition and only by ensuring competition are we going to get the \nbenefits that both the Senator from South Dakota and I wish to see \nhappen in the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would disagree with my colleague on \ncellular. I do not think it was AT It was Government regulation. \nMaybe AT went to the Government. Maybe AT used Government \nregulations. But cellular phones were held up by Government regulation, \nby all accounts. But that is the point. A lot of companies use \nGovernment regulation to hold up competition and to hold up \nderegulation.\n  Also, I would be in disagreement with my friend that the computer \nindustry has lost 150,000 jobs. Maybe they have lost 150,000 but \noverall they have gained. One measure of the relative market growth is \nthe number of employees. In 1980, there were a little more than 300,000 \nAmericans employed in the computer industry while more than 1 million \nwere engaged in the provision of telephone products. And our statistics \nshow there has been a steady increase. There have been some jobs lost \nbut overall there has been a substantial gain, and I shall put that \ninto the Record.\n  By 1993, computer products and services accounted for more than 1.2 \nmillion jobs, a fourfold increase. At the same time, the number of \ntelephone employees had dropped to less than 900,000. So unless those \nnumbers are incorrect, I think we have to say that the computer \nindustry has been an expansive industry operating largely without \nGovernment standards and regulation where there has been fierce, free \nmarket competition.\n  Indeed, I also serve on the Senate Finance Committee, and every 18 \nmonths the computer industry wants to get depreciation; that is, they \nwant their schedule to be 2 or 3 years or less because product cycles \nchange so quickly because there is rigorous competition.\n  This chart tells what we are trying to do with S. 652--The \nTelecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995. This is \nthe most comprehensive deregulation of the telecommunications industry \nin history and it will promote international competitiveness, job \ngrowth, productivity, and a better quality of life. It provides open \naccess to full competition. Interconnection and unbundling will put new \ncompetitors including cable and long distance on the same footing with \nformer monopolies. Consumers will use the same phone number and dial \nthe same number of digits no matter what local telecommunications \ncompanies they choose, and the competitive checklist for compliance \nwith open access will assure certainty and simultaneity.\n  Let me also say that universal service is preserved. All providers \ncontribute. We make subsidies explicit. There have been some people who \nhave said, well, this is like a new tax. In fact, it has been reduced \nfrom $10 to $7 billion. But all on a bipartisan basis felt strongly \nthat universal service should be preserved.\n  Removal of restrictions to competition in all markets. Telephone and \ncable firms are free to compete in each other's markets. For the first \ntime we end this economic apartheid. We let them go into each other's \nmarkets and compete and some of them do not like that. But they will \nhave to do it. This is transition to the wireless age, but we have to \nmake them compete.\n  Utility companies free to enter telecommunications markets. And there \nare some safeguards here, but we need to unleash our utility companies \nso they will come into the other markets with a burst of energy and \nwill create new jobs, new products, new service offerings.\n  The removal of long distance and manufacturing restrictions for Bell \ncompanies. Presently, the Bell companies cannot manufacture in this \ncountry, so they go abroad to do it. This will unleash new investment \nin this country, create jobs in this country, instead of having them \nsend their money overseas. And they will be able to get into the long \ndistance business if they wish.\n  Let me say that some people are worried that the Bell companies are \ngoing to become monopolies. We still have Hart-Scott-Rodino. We can \nchange the antitrust laws.\n  That is something I should say here. Everybody has been saying what \nthe Justice Department should and should not do. If we do not like the \nantitrust laws, we should change the antitrust laws. We should not \ncreate a group of bureaucrats over there who are regulators. Let us \nchange the antitrust laws if we wish to. And I would say that regarding \nthe airlines if necessary.\n  Market pricing, not Federal price controls for cable. And I predict \nthat the same thing will happen to television in cable rates as \nhappened in natural gas. We will have video dial tone from regional \nBell or some other telephone companies. We will have other cable and \nvideo providers coming into the market, plus we will have \n[[Page S8198]] cable TV, plus we will have broadcast and more than one \nDBS operator--probably three or four. So you will be able to choose \nbetween seven or eight television services. When that happens, the \nprices are going to go down because there is real competition. But if \nwe do not pass this bill, frequently the average consumer will only \nhave one choice. And that is what competition and deregulation will do. \nThe prices will drop, will just collapse when they have to compete, \njust as telephone prices will as well. When there are more providers, \nthose telephone calls are only going to cost a few cents and long \ndistance calls are only going to cost a few cents. That is all that \nthey should be costing.\n  Next, rate of return regulations for large telcos eliminated.\n  New flexibilities for broadcasters who offer digital service.\n  End arbitrary limits on broadcast ownership because they are really \nout of date. And I know that we have increased to 35 percent the amount \nof the national audience one television broadcast group can have. I \nwould like to raise it to 50 or 100 percent if I could do it. In my \noriginal chairman's mark, it did. There will be an effort tomorrow to \nlower it to 25 percent. I think the old line networks are trying to use \nGovernment regulation to avoid competition. They need to get in there \nand compete instead of coming to Washington to the FCC and to Congress \nfor limits on what can be owned, and so forth, because it will take \ncare of itself. Just as in computers we saw this immense resurgence and \nregurgitation and these bursts of energy from new companies, we will \nsee the same thing in media and telecommunications.\n  Extend broadcast license term to 10 years with expedited renewal \nprocedures. Most of the broadcast limitations, in my opinion, are \nobsolete and should be eliminated.\n  State and local barriers to market entry repealed. I hope we can hold \non to that one tomorrow. We have another crucial vote tomorrow \nafternoon on preemption of local barriers to entry. Because we cannot \nallow States and cities to just grant monopoly franchises if we are \ngoing to have real competition.\n  Now, also we are working on investment and growth in the global \nmarkets.\n  We open U.S. telecommunications markets for more investment on a fair \nand reciprocal basis. A reciprocal basis. This is international law at \nits best. We will allow other countries to invest here on the same \nbasis that they permit U.S. invest there.\n  U.S. comparative advantage in products, services, and software with \nno domestic content provision. That is a very significant change from \nlast year.\n  Let me explain that. Some of our large unions want to have a domestic \ncontent provision but that is anticompetitive. Through GATT and these \nother international trade agreements we want international competition. \nWe want deregulation and competition. And we did not put the domestic \ncontent provision in this year's bill. And that is what Mickey Kantor \nand members of the administration say they want--members of the \nadministration should be supporting this bill. These are all things \nthat, as I understood it, Al Gore and the administration are for. \nMickey Kantor came up last fall and told us in the Commerce Committee \nthat he did not like the bill last year because it had domestic content \nin it, and we took domestic content out this year. This is \nderegulatory. We are making some progress toward being an international \ncompetitor, and we cannot go on demanding domestic product content and \nsay that we are for international trade.\n  Next we have sunset for regulation. Biennial review of all remaining \nFederal, State, and local rules, regulations and restrictions.\n  It is time we reduce the Federal bureaucracy. We are going to have \nsystematic regulatory review and reform through S. 652. This means \nevery 2 years after reviewing every regulation, we will do away with as \nmany as we can. Inside the beltway, these agencies grow and grow, and \nthey do not want to give up their turf. That is what we have, a turf \nbattle. The Justice Department wants to do the same thing the FCC is \ndoing, and some big companies say, ``That is good, because that will \nslow down competition.'' They are running full-page ads supporting that \nconcept.\n  Next we have regulatory forbearance authority ordered, then \nderegulatory parity for telecommunications providers offering similar \nservices, so that we can get them all competing.\n  So there it is. That is what we are trying to do. That is what is in \nthis bill. It is not a perfect bill, but it passed the Commerce \nCommittee 17 to 2. We had two Republicans who had some concerns. They \nwanted it to be more deregulatory, and I sympathize with them. Every \nDemocrat on the committee voted for it. Now the White House says it has \nconcerns. I took this draft over to Al Gore in January. I gave it to \nhim and asked for his help.\n  We need the administration's help when we get into conference on this \nbill. It really delivers on all the reform ideas we hear them talk \nabout all the time. This is what the President says he is for. This is \nwhat the Vice President says he is for. Let us pass it.\n  Tomorrow we have two crucial votes. We have to defeat the Dorgan \namendment, which would add another level of bureaucracy. We also have \nto beat back the effort to erect new State and local barriers when we \nare tearing down Federal barriers.\n  So, Mr. President, I will conclude by thanking the Members of the \nSenate for the debate today. I have tried to accelerate the pace of \nthis bill.\n  I do not see any other Senators who wish to speak.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/12/senate-section/article/S8188-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECESS UNTIL TOMORROW AT 9:15 A.M.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER.
