The Senate will now resume consideration of S. \n1745, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1745) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 1997 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed Forces, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Dorgan amendment No. 4048, to reduce funds authorized for \n     research, development, test, and evaluation for national \n     missile defense.\n       Kyl amendment No. 4049, to authorize underground nuclear \n     testing under limited conditions.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4048\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 15 minutes of debate on the \npending Dorgan amendment No. 4048, equally divided.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand there is a period of time to \ncontinue debate ever so briefly prior to the scheduled vote. Senator \nLevin, I believe, wishes to take just a couple of minutes. I intend to \nyield to him when he arrives. When Senator Thurmond comes through, I \nwill be happy to yield to him.\n  Let me describe just briefly exactly what this amendment is and what \nit is not. The Defense authorization bill that comes to the floor of \nthe Senate includes in it $508 million for research and development for \na national missile defense program. That is a program that has been \nbantered about around here. Some call it national missile defense, some \ncall it Defend America, some call it star wars. Whatever you call it, \nit is a program to try to find a way to intercept potential incoming \nmissiles launched by a rogue nation, an adversary, or launched \naccidentally by someone else. This is the outgrowth of the old star \nwars proposals back in the early 1980's.\n  There is in the Clinton budget a proposal for continued research and \ndevelopment of $508 million. The majority party, in constructing the \npiece of legislation brought to the floor today,\n\n[[Page S6422]]\n\nsaid, ``That is not enough. We want to add $300 million to that; $508 \nmillion is not enough. We want it to be $808 million.''\n  My amendment very simply says, ``no,'' we should get rid of the $300 \nmillion that was added extra, and go back to the $508 million base \nproposal offered in the administration's budget, $508 million requested \nby the Pentagon, $508 million requested by the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, by the Secretary of Defense, saying, ``This is what \nour country needs. This is what is advisable to spend.'' The bill \nbrought to the floor said ``No, the Defense Department does not know \nwhat it is talking about. We want to authorize you to spend $300 \nmillion more.''\n\n  I read a quote from General Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, who says, in speaking of this kind of activity, adding \n$300 million--which, by the way, is designed to provide for and require \nan early deployment on a national missile defense program of some type \nwhich would provide multiple sites and spaced-based components which \nwill undercut the arms control agreements, the very agreements that are \nnow leading to a reduction in the nuclear threat. There are missiles \nbeing destroyed in the old Soviet Union, in Russia today, because we \nhave arms control agreements that provide for the destruction of those \nmissiles. The world is safer because those missiles do not exist, those \nnuclear warheads do not exist, and they do not exist because of arms \ncontrol agreements that have provided that both the Russians and the \nIndependent States of the old Soviet Union are reducing launchers, \nwarheads, bomber airplanes and others. We are doing the same. This \nmakes eminent good sense.\n  This proposal, incidentally, leads to an undercutting of all those \narms control agreements. Should we protect our country? Of course we \nshould. However, should we do so in a way that undercuts the arms \ncontrol agreements that are now leading to a reduction in the threat? \nNo, I do not think that makes any sense.\n  General Shalikashvili says the following:\n\n       Efforts which suggest changes to or withdrawal from the ABM \n     Treaty may jeopardize Russian ratification of START II and \n     could prompt Russia to withdraw from START I. I am concerned \n     that failure of either START initiative will result in \n     Russian retention of hundreds or even thousands more nuclear \n     weapons, thereby increasing both the costs and the risks that \n     we face.\n\n  In short, the decision, in fact, the requirement by those who support \nthis piece of legislation that we spend $300 million more in pursuit of \na policy that may result in a potential adversary having hundreds or \neven thousands of more nuclear weapons is, in my judgment, a failed \npolicy.\n  Mr. President, $300 million ought not be added to this. My amendment \nwithdraws the $300 million.\n  How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes and 5 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Michigan, Senator \nLevin.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank Senator \nDorgan for his leadership on this. We ought to rely on the uniformed \nmilitary in terms of what is needed to produce a national missile \ndefense in a sensible time period so that we can make a decision to \ndeploy at a time a decision to deploy is needed.\n  What do the uniformed military say about funding levels? We have \nheard a lot of political rhetoric about national missile defense. The \nproposed budget in front of us would add $300 million to the $500 \nmillion the administration requested. These are not just numbers \nhopefully pulled out of the air. The $500 million that the \nadministration asked for is what our uniformed military say is needed \nto produce and develop a national missile defense in a timely way.\n  Now, that is not President Clinton saying it, that is not Secretary \nPerry saying it; that is the uniformed military saying it. It is called \nthe Joint Requirements Oversight Council, the JROC. The JROC, in \nJanuary of this year, wrote to their chiefs--these are the Vice Chiefs \nof the four Departments--saying that they wanted and needed no more \nthan $500 million per year for national missile defense. This is a \nmemorandum which I am going to ask to have inserted into the Record. \nThis is what our uniformed military say: The JROC believes that with \nthe current and projected ballistic missile threat that the funding \nlevel ``for national missile defense should be no more than $500 \nmillion per year.'' That is in the budget request of the \nadministration. They went on to say, ``We believe that the proposed \nacquisition level for national missile defense is balanced in \nproportion.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the Chiefs of the Army, \nNavy, Marine Corps, and Air Force, be printed in the Record at this \ntime in support of the administration's request and which is very \ninconsistent with the add-on of $300 million by the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          The Vice Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Memorandum for the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition \n         and Technology.\n     Subject: National Missile Defense.\n     1. This memorandum is to inform you of The Joint Requirements \n     Oversight Councils (JROC) position of prioritizing a Theater \n     Missile Defense (TMD) capability over a National Missile \n     Defense (NMD) capability.\n       2. The JROC believes that with the current and projected \n     ballistic missile threat, which shows Russia and China as the \n     only countries able to field a threat against the US homeland \n     the funding level of NMD should be no more than $500 million \n     per year and TMD should be no more than $2.3 billion per year \n     through the FYDP. These funding levels will allow us to \n     continue to field critical TMD/NMD systems to meet the \n     projected threats and, at the same time, save dollars that \n     can be given back to the Services to be used for critical \n     recapitalization programs.\n       3. We believe the proposed TMD/NMD acquisition levels are \n     balanced and proportional and after great potential for \n     achieving an affordable ballistic missile defense \n     architecture that meets our joint warfighting needs.\n     W.A. Owens,\n       Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n     Thomas S. Moorman, Jr.,\n       General, USAF, Vice Chief of Staff.\n     J.W. Prueher,\n       Admiral, U.S. Navy, Vice Chief of Naval Operations.\n     R.D. Hearney,\n       Assistant Commander of the Marine Corps.\n     Ronald H. Griffith,\n       General, U.S. Army, Vice Chief of Staff.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, before we vote on the Dorgan amendment, \nI would like to make a few brief remarks and strongly urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  First of all, let me be clear that the additional funds added in the \nbill for national missile defense are not to support a space-based or \nstar wars defense system. In fact the funds are not to support a \ndeployment decision at all. We have simply followed the advice of the \nDirector of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization who has informed \nthe committee that about $800 million per year is needed to support a \nrobust technology development effort. This additional funding is \nconsistent with the administration's own NMD Program, which is supposed \nto preserve the option of deploying a system by 2003. Regardless of \nwhether you support the Defend America Act, the administration's NMD \nplan, or some other approach, you should support the funding \nrecommended by the committee to allow for a more comprehensive testing \nprogram.\n  The Armed Services Committee did not earmark the funds for systems \nthat are not currently being developed by the Department of Defense. We \nsimply suggest more robust testing within the administration's own \nprogram. This program would rely on a ground-based system. Nothing \nassociated with the additional funds in any way conflicts with the ABM \nTreaty or even with the administration's own 3-plus-3 NMD Program.\n  I would also remind all Senators that Congress added $375 million \nabove the budget request for NMD in fiscal year 1996, which the \nadministration is presently obligating. The Department of Defense \nrecognized that additional funds were needed. The Director of BMDO has \nstated this explicitly, and the committee added the funds in an\n\n[[Page S6423]]\n\neffort to reduce technical risk and preserve a realistic deployment \noption around 2003.\n  Mr. President, in closing, let me urge my colleagues to oppose the \nDorgan amendment and to support the additional funds for NMD risk \nreduction.\n  I yield to the able Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be very brief. I compliment the Senator from \nSouth Carolina for his leadership. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' \non this amendment. This amendment would strike $300 million of money \nthat is used for research and development for missile defense. It is \nkind of a shocking thing for most Americans to find out that we do not \nhave capabilities now to shoot down incoming missiles if you think the \nprimary responsibility of the Federal Government is the protection of \nour people, the protection of our freedom. Yet, we do not have the \ncapabilities today to shoot down an incoming missile from wherever it \ncomes from. It may come from a belligerent nation, it may come from \nother rogue nations, it may come from someone getting control over \nmissiles in the former Soviet empire.\n  But we do not have the capability to shoot them down. That bothers \nme. Somebody might say, well, we have the Patriot. The Patriot worked \nsemisuccessfully in the Persian Gulf war. It shot down some Scud \nmissiles when they were right over their backyard. Not very effective. \nAs a matter of fact, we had American soldiers who lost their lives in \nSaudi Arabia because of Scud missiles that were 20-some-odd years old \nthat landed in that neighborhood. The Patriot did not stop these. They \nstopped some missiles. It is not effective.\n  We need to be able to have the capability to shoot down missiles \nbefore they end up in our backyard. The threats are becoming more \nserious all the time, and we need to be moving now in research and \ndevelopment so we will have the system capability sooner rather than \nwhen it is too late. When you have North Korea firing missiles in the \ndirection of Japan, when you have China firing missiles in the \ndirection of Taiwan, when you have China making implicit threats to the \nUnited States, and even specifically Los Angeles, you realize this is a \nmuch more dangerous world than it was 3 years ago.\n  We are now using our money to help Israel develop missile defense \ncapabilities. I support that. But it is very ironic that we do not give \nourselves the capability and enough resources to develop missile \ntechnology to defend ourselves against an incoming missile, whether it \nbe an incoming intercontinental ballistic missile, with whatever \nwarheads--nuclear warheads, biological or chemical warheads. We should \nnot leave ourselves defenseless.\n  I am afraid that if we adopt the amendment by our friends on the \nother side, we are doing just that--we are cutting back too much. \nPeople like to call missile defense star wars, and maybe they score \npolitical points by doing so. But they leave us without the capability \nof moving forward rapidly, as quickly as possible, to shoot down \nincoming missiles. The No. 1 priority of the Federal Government should \nbe the protection of our people, the protection of our freedom. We need \nto have the capability to destroy incoming missiles from whatever \nsource. We need this money.\n  I compliment the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. I hope our \ncolleagues will vote to delete and vote against this amendment. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 1 minute \n45 seconds. The Senator from North Dakota has 45 seconds.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. I will yield back my time, unless somebody wants to \nspeak.\n  I understand the Senator from Oklahoma desires to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nickles). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his leadership in \nthis issue that we are discussing. Nothing new can be said on this \nsubject. I know what the final remarks will be from the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. I want to talk about two things. No. 1, the threat; No. \n2, the cost. If anybody out there believes it is going to cost so that \nwe will ultimately have the ability to save ourselves, protect \nourselves from missile attack--look at the CBO report and the figures \nthat they are batting around, $30 to $60 billion over 14 years, and \nthat has now been downgraded.\n  It is quite obvious that we wanted to have an Aegis ship with the \nspace sensors. We already have a $50 billion investment in 22 Aegis \nships that are out there. We can upgrade those, and reach into the \nupper tier for about $3 to $4 billion over 4 years. If you add the $5 \nbillion for sensors we could have a system in place that will stop an \nincoming ballistic missile for the United States. Right now we have \nnothing.\n  The vast majority of American people believe that after we have spent \nall of this money that we have a system but we do not. We are almost \nthere. It is 90 percent paid for, and the threat is real.\n  For those who question the threat, remember the words of James \nWoolsey who was the CIA Director for President Clinton. He said 2 years \nago that we know of between 20 and 25 nations that have or are in the \nfinal stages of developing weapons of mass destruction and the missile \nmeans of delivering those weapons. One expert after another expert \ntestified that threat is out there, that threat is real.\n  So, I would only say when you are considering taking out this little \nbit of money that we have to try to go forward with this program, stop \nand realize and stop and ask yourself the question. What if all of \nthese experts are right? Look at Oklahoma City. The Presiding Officer \nand I represent the State of Oklahoma. We saw the devastation that took \nplace there. That was what is comparable to one ton of TNT. The \nsmallest nuclear warhead known is a kiloton, 1,000 times that power.\n  So if you are wrong, we are making a terrible mistake if we pass this \namendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is not about whether there should be \na missile defense program in this country. There exists in the bill \nbrought to this floor $2 billion for theater missile defense. I think \neveryone probably knows that. It has not been mentioned. The \nimplication was that there was nothing in this bill for missile \ndefense. There is $2 billion for theater missile defense and $508 \nmillion was proposed by the Pentagon for national missile defense. The \nbill comes to the floor saying $508 million for research and \ndevelopment is not enough.\n  I simply say for the people who support throwing dollars at this \nproblem on national missile defense that it is not going to solve the \nproblem. The uniformed officers say $508 billion is enough of research \nand development. Those of you who think that there is not an amount \nthat is enough, the more the merrier and let us spend as much as we can \nspend are wrong.\n  This is a very simple vote to cut $300 million from this \nauthorization bill.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The question is on agreeing to \nthe amendment of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, how much remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from North Dakota.

Mr. President, I rise today to deplore in the strongest \npossible terms the brutal assault last Saturday on former Bosnian Prime \nMinister Haris Silajdzic.\n  For more than 4 years, I have protested the bloody aggression by \nSerbia and its Bosnian Serb proxies against the Republic of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. Even today Senator Lieberman, Senator Lugar, and I are \nintroducing a resolution calling upon our Government to give stronger \nsupport to the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague, \nincluding making it an urgent priority for IFOR to detain and bring to \njustice persons indicted by the tribunal.\n  But, Mr. President, it was not Bosnian Serbs under the direction of \nthe war criminals Karadzic and Mladic who attacked Haris Silajdzic. Nor \nwas it carried out by the notorious Bosnian-Croat thugs from \nHerzegovina.\n  No, the attack was carried out by Bosnian Muslims belonging to the \nruling party of democratic action, the SDA, of Bosnian President \nIzetbegovic. Former Prime Minister Silajdzic was making an election \ncampaign speech in the Bihac area of northwestern Bosnia when about 100 \nyoung toughs waving SDA flags reportedly began terrorizing citizens at \nthe rally. Some of them struck Prime Minister Silajdzic on the head \nwith a metal bar, opening a bloody wound on his temple. He was rushed \noff to a hospital.\n  Many of my colleagues and I regard Haris Silajdzic as the single best \nhope for a multireligious democracy in Bosnia. For years he has fought \nagainst the vicious tribalism that unscrupulous politicians have used \nto stir up hatreds, even as he has tirelessly struggled to keep his \nembattled country alive.\n  Undaunted earlier this year after he was forced out of the prime \nministership, Haris Silajdzic founded the party for Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, a coalition of Bosnian Muslims, Bosnian Serbs, and Bosnian \nCroats whose vision rises above the pathetic provincialism of the \nethnic and religious-based parties intent on fragmenting the country.\n  The reaction of the ruling SDA in Sarajevo was, sad to say, typical \nof people who learned their politics at the foot of the old Yugoslav \nleague of Communists.\n  Mr. Silajdzic has been harassed at every turn. Knowing of his broad \ninternational contacts, the authorities made it impossible for him to \nplace telephone calls abroad. For example, when I have wanted to talk \nwith him during the past few months, I have had to phone his home from \nWashington. And our conversations are routinely cut off in mid-\nsentence.\n  This is the treatment that President Izetbegovic's government accords \na former prime minister with a worldwide reputation for bravery and \nintegrity.\n  Moreover, Haris Silajdzic's multi-religious party for Bosnia and \nHerzegovina has been systematically denied a level playing field in the \ncampaign for national elections, which according to the Dayton accords \nmust take place by September 14.\n  They have found it excruciatingly difficult to get television time \nwith which to spread their message of tolerance and democracy. I have \nalready described how the SDA hoodlums broke up their campaign rally \nlast weekend.\n  Mr. President, I would submit that the Bosnian people have no better \nfriend in this Congress than this Senator. But let me be absolutely \nclear: The patience of even the strongest supporters of Bosnian \nindependence has limits.\n  President Izetbegovic and his party must understand that we have not \nsent young American fighting men and women at the head of an \ninternational force thousands of miles from home merely to make it safe \nfor a power-hungry, narrow-minded Bosnian Muslim clique to mimic the \nvicious, antidemocratic behavior of their Bosnian Serb oppressors.\n  The clock is ticking on the implementation of the Dayton accords. \nThere are still many fundamental problems to solve. Until now the \nrecord of the Bosnian Government, though far from perfect, has been \nbetter than that of Serbia and Croatia and their respective Bosnian \nproxies.\n  But this latest outrage against Haris Silajdzic is a terrible step in \nthe wrong direction. I call upon President Izetbegovic to take heed: \nEither get your party to clean up its act, or the United States of \nAmerica may have to reconsider its Bosnian policy.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by Senator Kyl from Arizona. I knew our distinguished colleague \nfrom Arizona when he was in the House, but I did not know him well. I \nhave come to have great respect for him as a legislator. He really is a \nlegislator who works\n\n[[Page S6425]]\n\non bills and does the nitty-gritty work that is so important. But I \nbelieve that an amendment to authorize the resumption of nuclear \ntesting is very ill-timed.\n  First of all, we have had over a thousand nuclear tests in the last \n50 years. We do not need additional nuclear tests. If we were trying to \nperfect some new nuclear weapon, then it makes sense. But that is not \nthe policy of this Government.\n  But more important than that, India and Pakistan are reluctant to \njoin in a comprehensive test ban. What we need now is for all nations \nwith nuclear power to come aboard. China, apparently, is coming aboard. \nBut India and Pakistan we do not know yet.\n  We should not do anything that is going to move a comprehensive test \nban further away. We need it as soon as possible. It is in the interest \nof the United States, and it is in the interest of the world.\n  I think this amendment, and I know the motivation is good on the part \nof our colleague from Arizona, but I think it is an ill-timed amendment \nthat is not in the national interest.\n  Mr. President, if no one else seeks the floor, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Air Force Nurse Corps: Chief and assistant chief; appointment; \n              grade.''.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment \nthat would put into law a designated position and grade for the chief \nnurses of the U.S. Army and the U.S. Air Force. To the credit of the \npast and present leadership of our Armed Services, they have appointed \na chief nurse in the rank of brigadier general since the 1970's. \nHowever, for the Army and the Air Force, this practice has never been \ncodified in law, although I am pleased to note that the Navy has \ndesignated their chief nurse as a rear admiral. Our military chief \nnurses have an awesome responsibility--a degree of responsibility that \nis absolutely deserving of flag officer rank.\n  You might be surprised at how big their scope of duties actually is. \nFor example, the chiefs are responsible for both peacetime and wartime \nhealth care doctrine, standards, and policy for all nursing personnel. \nIn fact, the chief\n\n[[Page S6426]]\n\nnurses are responsible for more than 80,000 Army and 26,000 Air Force \nnursing personnel. This includes officer and enlisted nursing \nspecialties in the active, reserve and guard components of the \nmilitary. If an executive officer in a large American corporation had \nthis much responsibility, he or she would undoubtedly have a position \ntitle and salary at least comparable to that of a brigadier general, \nand would certainly have a seat at the corporate table of policy and \ndecisionmaking.\n  You might wonder why it would be necessary to put these provisions in \nlaw since this practice is already occurring. Sadly, I am most \nconcerned that without this official designation, these positions are \nvulnerable to being downgraded or even eliminated. In recent years, \ndownsizing mandates and new ways of providing health care have led to \nmany reorganization efforts. Unfortunately, reorganization has become a \neuphemism for eliminating positions--and health care reorganization has \ntoo often become an excuse to eliminate nursing positions, particularly \nsenior and executive leadership positions.\n  There has been much discussion about the so-called glass ceilings \nthat unfairly impact the ability of women to achieve the same status as \ntheir male counterparts. While I do not want to make this a gender-\ndiscrimination issue, the reality is that military nurses hit two glass \nceilings: one as a nurse in a physician-dominated health care system \nand one as a woman in a male-dominated military system. The simple fact \nis that organizations are best served when the leadership is composed \nof a mix of specialty and gender groups--of equal rank--who bring their \nunique talents to the corporate table. For military nurses, the general \nofficer chief nurse position is the only way for nurses to get to the \ncorporate executive table.\n  Mr. President, I strongly believe that it is very important, and past \ntime, that we recognize the extensive scope and level of responsibility \nthe military chief nurses have and make sure that future military \nhealth care organizations will continue to benefit from their expertise \nand unique contributions.\n  Mr. President, as noted, the distinguished managers of the measure \nhave both agreed to its adoption.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4050) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we have been waiting here now a long \ntime to act on these amendments. Again, I want to tell the Senators, if \nthey have amendments, to come forward with them. I want to inform all \nSenators that I intend soon to ask unanimous consent that only \namendments that have been offered will be in order on this bill. So it \nis important for them to come forward and offer their amendments, \notherwise, they may not be considered. I urge all Senators who have \namendments to come to the floor and offer them now--I repeat--now, not \nlater.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator withhold? I would like to discuss the \npending amendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Certainly.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4049\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the pending amendment is the Kyl amendment, \ncosponsored by Senator Reid from Nevada. The distinguished chairman of \nthe committee spoke in support of this amendment last night when I \noffered it. Since then, there has been virtually no discussion of it. \nSeveral people have asked me questions, and I thought I would come to \nthe floor and try to answer those questions because, for the life of \nme, I cannot understand why this would be a controversial amendment. I \nam advised that at least one Senator is awaiting instructions from the \nWhite House.\n  I suggest that this body can take the action that it deems \nappropriate. Certainly the White House will have its say in anything \nthat we do on the Defense authorization bill. But this ought not to be \nthat controversial. So let me attempt to explain again what I am trying \nto do with this amendment. Again, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee for his support of the amendment.\n  Probably the best way I can do this, Mr. President, is to do it \ngraphically. Above this line we have the status quo, the current law \nwith respect to nuclear testing. Just to set the stage, we have not \nconducted nuclear tests for a long time. The tests that have been \nconducted in the last decade have been primarily to ensure safety and \nreliability of our nuclear stockpile. I might add that about a third of \nthe problems that have been discovered with the stockpile were found as \na result of safety testing.\n  I also make the point, in general, with respect to testing, that it \nhas always seemed odd to me that while we hear speeches that we should \nfly before we buy, we should be sure that we test the equipment that we \nare going to buy for our military uses, we should make sure that we \ncontinue to maintain our equipment, understand how it works, and \nwhether it might not work, and we want to make sure that all of the \nthings that we are going to have to rely upon will in fact work, that \nthe one thing that we do not want to test to see if it will continue to \nwork is the most sophisticated weapon we have in our inventory, namely, \nour nuclear weapon.\n  On that we are going to close our eyes and say, ``Well, we tested \nthese a long time ago. We maybe built these systems 20 years ago, but \nwe're just going to hope that they continue to work if we ever have to \nuse them.'' I submit that that is not an intelligent way for us to \nmaintain our nuclear stockpile. But that is essentially where we are \nright now. The administration does not want to test, is not testing. We \ncurrently have the authority to test, if the President decides to do \nso.\n\n  That is what is indicated here. We have a test moratorium in our \ncountry, but we could test for safety reasons or to determine the \nreliability of a system. So that if, for example, the Department of \nEnergy came to the President and said, ``Mr. President, we think we may \nhave a problem with one of these systems. It seems to be acting funny. \nWe obviously don't want to send it up in an airplane or put it on top \nof a missile if something might happen. Therefore, we need to conduct a \ntest to determine exactly what's wrong here or how to fix it,'' the \nPresident could do that today.\n  But that authority will expire on September 30 of this year under \nexisting law. The President will no longer have that capability.\n  That was done in order to anticipate the fact that a Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty, the so-called CTBT, would be entering into force. The \nproblem is, it has not been ratified by this country. It is obviously \nnot going to go into force for some time. Therefore, we are left with a \nhiatus, a period between September 30 of this year and whenever the \nCTBT comes into effect, if it comes into effect.\n  After the CTBT comes into effect, there are no tests except in a very \nextreme situation called supreme national interest which, in effect, \nwould only exist if there was some grave emergency that existed where \nthe country was threatened and there was some need to do so.\n  So what we are talking about is simply extending this September 30 \ndate until the CTBT goes into effect. It is not anti-test-ban treaty. \nAnyone who favors a test-ban treaty should not be concerned about this. \nIn fact, I would think they would be supportive because it would \nmaintain the status quo until the CTBT goes into effect.\n  What actually changes? Two things. No. 1, we continue to require the \nadministration to report to the Congress on the status of the \nstockpile. There is nothing wrong with that. I assume\n\n[[Page S6427]]\n\nthere is no objection to that. So the test moratorium would continue \nand the reporting requirements would continue. But the President could \nstill test for stockpile safety and reliability purposes beyond the \nSeptember 30 date until some date in the future if and when the CTBT \ngoes into force or when the U.S. Senate ratifies it.\n  The other difference is that under the test moratorium that will \nexist if we do not change the law, there is one circumstance under \nwhich the President can test. But it does not make any sense. The \nPresident could test if another country tests. We do not need to test \njust because China conducts a test or just because France conducts a \ntest or Russia conducts a test. That is no reason for the United States \nto conduct a test. We are not testing in retaliation for what another \nnation does. There is no rational reason to base our testing on whether \nanother nation tests.\n  Whether another nation tests will depend upon whether that nation \nbelieves it to be in that nation's interest to test. Likewise, whether \nthe United States tests prior to the implementation of the CTBT, ought \nto be based upon whether it is in our national interest to do so. Just \nbecause France tests should not mean that the President should call for \nthe United States to do so.\n  But by the same token, if the Department of Energy or the Department \nof Defense should discover a problem with one of our weapons, it is the \nheight of irrationality for us to close our eyes and say, ``But we \ncan't fix that weapon.''\n\n  Until this Nation has effective missile defenses and defenses against \nany other way in which a nuclear warhead would be delivered to the \nUnited States, we are relying upon our strategic retaliatory nuclear \ncapability. That is a fact. Therefore, it has to work and it has to be \nsafe. It makes no sense to say that we should not have the capability \nof ensuring that safety.\n  I doubt very seriously whether President Clinton would ever order a \ntest, but why tell him that he cannot do so? For those who believe, \nwell, maybe it will not be President Clinton next year, maybe it will \nbe President Dole, and he is going to be irresponsible in this regard, \nmy amendment also requires that the Congress not disapprove the \ndecision. So Congress has a check on the President's actions. The \nPresident cannot unilaterally call a test.\n  I do not know what could be more reasonable, Mr. President. All we \nare saying is that the deadline that is going to expire on September 30 \nbe continued--not the deadline--but that the ability to test be \ncontinued, the power of the President to call for a test. We are not \nsaying he has to do anything. This has no relationship to the CTBT. We \nare simply saying, until the CTBT comes into effect, the President \nwould have the ability to call for a test, but Congress would have to \nnot disapprove it.\n  Let me read some statements, perhaps, that will give people a little \nsense of security in supporting this if they think there is some hidden \nmeaning to it. There is not. The administration's testing policies, as \narticulated by the President himself, are totally consistent with what \nwe are doing.\n  On August 11, 1995, the President gave his statement regarding the \nCTBT. He acknowledged that the possibility of future underground tests \nmight be needed. In fact, there is a specific safeguard in his policy \nenumerated ``Safeguard F'' which reads as follows:\n\n       If the President of the United States is informed by the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Energy (DOE)--\n     advised by the Nuclear Weapons Council, the Director of DOE's \n     nuclear weapons laboratories and the Commander of the U.S. \n     Strategic Command--that a high level of confidence in the \n     safety or reliability of a nuclear weapon type which the two \n     Secretaries consider to be critical to our nuclear deterrent \n     could no longer be certified, the President, in consultation \n     with Congress, would be prepared to withdraw from the CTBT \n     under the standard ``supreme national interests'' clause in \n     order to conduct whatever testing might be required.\n  That is the end of Safeguard F.\n  Mr. President, what we are proposing here is something far short of \nthat. The President has made the point here that he needs a mechanism \nfor conducting an underground test if it is in the supreme national \ninterest to do so. We are simply saying until there is a CTBT, he \nshould have that same authority. A fortiori, once the CTBT goes into \neffect, the President is saying he should still have that authority in \nthe supreme national interest. I agree. It does not make any sense for \nthat authority to exist at that time after this CTBT has already gone \ninto effect, and not to have the authority before it goes into effect.\n  Following the President's own understanding of the potential need for \nan underground test to ensure safety and reliability of our weapons, we \nsimply gave him that authority beyond the deadline that it would \notherwise expire, and base it on what the President has said he would \nneed to base it on; namely, safety and reliability, rather than on \nwhether another nation tests. I cannot imagine anything more reasonable \nand more rational.\n  I will read a quotation from one of the President's top advisers in \nthis entire area, former staff member for the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, Bob Bell, in a speech at the \nNational Missile Defense University Foundation. On May 8 of this year, \nBob Bell, who is a member of the National Security Council, suggested \nthat a key element of the administration strategy to defend America is \ndeterrence, both conventional and nuclear deterrence. He said,\n\n       The second line of defense against weapons of mass \n     destruction is deterrence, both at the conventional and \n     nuclear level. Any rogue nation foolish enough to contemplate \n     using nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons against the \n     United States, its Armed Forces or our allies must not be \n     confused about how we would respond. As Secretary Perry \n     stated, it would be ``devastating'' and ``absolutely \n     overwhelming.''\n\n  Now, Mr. President, you cannot rely upon a nuclear deterrent that is \nnot safe or does not work. You have to know that it is safe and it will \nwork. That is why we have always maintained the ability, the right, to \ntest these weapons, to make sure they will work and that they are safe. \nThat is what the law provides today. That authority terminates on \nSeptember 30. For the life of me, I do not understand why anyone would \nobject to simply continuing the President's right to do what he said he \nneeded to have the ability to do. Not that he would ever do it. I am \nsure everyone would acknowledge this President's inclinations would not \nbe to do it, but as he himself said, if he were advised by the \nSecretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, the Nuclear Weapons \nCouncil, and the commander of the U.S. Strategic Command that they did \nnot have a high level of confidence in the safety or reliability of a \nweapon type that was deemed critical for nuclear deterrent, then he \nwould need that authority. If we are going to give him that authority \nafter a CTBT goes into effect, why should he not have that authority \nbefore it goes into effect?\n  Mr. President, all I can do is continue to repeat the point that I \nwish somebody would challenge it, would argue it, would debate it. This \namendment has been pending since last night. I said I am happy to \nexplain it, to debate it, but can we not have a discussion on it, and \nthen vote? I cannot imagine why anyone would oppose it.\n\n  Now, there have been two reasons suggested to me. One is that the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty negotiations are in a delicate stage now \nand we do not want to do anything that might upset them. How would this \nupset them? It has nothing to do with the CTBT. Surely, people who want \nus to enter into the CTBT want us to do so with weapons that are safe \nand reliable. Surely, they do not want us to deny ourselves the ability \nto enter into the treaty, knowing we have safe and reliable weapons. \nWhy would they want us to have a period of time where our weapons could \ndeteriorate or become unsafe and we could not do anything about it, and \nthen enter into a comprehensive test ban limitation? That would not \nmake any sense.\n  We want to enter into the comprehensive test ban knowing that our \nweapons are in good shape. I guarantee you, Mr. President, other \ncountries will make very sure that their weapons are in good shape \nbefore they enter into it. Look at the evidence. What did France do? \nFrance thumbed its nose at the international arms limitation community \nby saying, ``We are going to test until we are confident that our \nweapons are reliable and safe and they will do the job.'' They \nconducted their tests, notwithstanding opposition from\n\n[[Page S6428]]\n\npractically, it seemed like, everybody in the world. When they finally \nhad concluded they had done enough testing and they were confident of \ntheir weapons, they said, ``Fine. Now we will join up.''\n  China, likewise, has been conducting tests. They just concluded one. \nThey have said they are going to do another one. They have said, ``We \nthink we have to do one more to make sure that our system is reliable, \nsafe, and workable. After that, we will join up, or at least consider \njoining up.'' It may be that Russia has conducted tests. There have \nbeen reports of activity at their test site that may suggest that some \nkind of activity has occurred there. I submit that other nations will \ndo the same thing if they believe their weapons are deteriorating or \nthey need to do something to improve the safety or reliability. They \nwill test to make sure that can be done.\n  All we are saying is the President of the United States ought to have \nthe authority to do that, with Congress not overruling, to ensure that \nour nuclear deterrent, as Bob Bell said, is a meaningful deterrent. \nThat is to say that countries of the world will know that it is \nworkable, and that we, in fact, will employ it.\n  The argument that CTBT negotiations are underway does not suggest any \nreason why we should not proceed with this. Are those negotiations so \ntouchy that if anybody talks about nuclear testing or continues \nauthority that currently exists in law, that they somehow are going to \nfull apart? I cannot imagine that. If that is the case, there is \nsomething drastically wrong. Are those negotiations dependent upon an \nelimination of our authority to test after September 30? That would not \nbe good policy for the United States, and I cannot imagine that other \ncountries of the world have made that a precondition. I have not heard \nany evidence to that effect. Just because the CTBT negotiations are \ngoing on does not mean that we cannot extend the President's authority \nbeyond September 30. We are not telling him he has to test, he should \ntest or anything of that sort. We are saying if he thinks it is \nnecessary to test, as he himself pointed out, he should have the \nauthority to do that, subject to Congress not saying no.\n\n  Now, I do not know of any other reason, except one reason expressed \nto me by someone who said, ``Well, I have always been so much in favor \nof absolutely eliminating all nuclear weapons from the world that I \nwould not want to do anything even to extend the ability of the United \nStates to test until there is a CTBT. If we can stop it on September \n30, boy, that is great.''\n  Mr. President, if all of the other nations in the world were as \nidealistic as this particular individual, I would not have a problem \nwith that. As we have already seen, since the United States has stopped \ntesting, since our moratorium, other nations, both friendly and \nunfriendly, have decided it is in their best interests to go ahead. We \nare not going to stop them from doing what they think is necessary and \nin their national interests, and particularly where it relates to \nsafety, it seems to me, we ought to retain the ability to test. That \nshould have very little to do with the argument of whether or not all \nthe nations of the world will eventually agree to a comprehensive \nlimitation.\n  One final point I make, Mr. President. When I served in the House of \nRepresentatives, I was the ranking member of the Department of Energy's \nnuclear facilities panel, along with Representative Spratt from South \nCarolina. We had the jurisdiction, basically to deal with the \nDepartment of Energy programs, including the nuclear stockpile. During \nthat time, it came to light that a very new and sophisticated and \ntechnical way of utilizing very new and powerful computers could \nactually help us understand the dynamics of nuclear weapons much better \nthan we ever had before. This computer analysis seemed to suggest that \nthere might be some vulnerability to certain of our weapons that we \nshould look into.\n  Just to talk hypothetically, what we are talking about, if a nuclear \nweapon were to be dropped, for example, could that possibly trigger \nsome kind of emission of radioactive material? In the past we had done \na lot of telephoning and we said, ``No, we think it is very safe.'' \nThis new computer technology suggested that maybe there would be a bit \nof a problem. So we caused a commission to be created called the Drell \nCommission. The members of the commission were very prominent nuclear \nscientists who studied for over a year whether there were safety or \nreliability problems with our weapons--primarily safety problems. They \nmade recommendations to the Congress, which we have largely carried \nout, and which the military has largely carried out, that caused us to \nmake some changes in the way that we handle our nuclear weapons. Some \nweapons were removed from active alert status on strategic bombers. \nCertain changes were made in the way that weapons were handled in their \nloading and unloading.\n\n  Without getting into too much technicality, or classified material, \nthose recommendations demonstrated that we have to be constantly \nvigilant of the potential for accidents, because the last thing in the \nworld that we want is an accident with a nuclear weapon. We know that \nthere have been some, and we do not want that to ever happen and cause \nharm to anyone in the world. So safety has been a primary \nconsideration--at least in recent years--with respect to our nuclear \nstockpile.\n  For the life of me, Mr. President, I cannot imagine that people who \nare interested in consumer safety, who are interested in the health, \nsafety, and welfare of our citizens, who frequently support measures to \nprotect us from all sorts of things that might cause damage to us, who \nare interested in reducing smoking by teenagers and adolescents, and I \ncannot imagine why people who are interested in protecting the American \ncitizenry would say, however, when it comes to one of the most \npotentially devastating threats of all--not a threat that is likely to \noccur, but if it ever did occur, it would be very devastating--a \nrelease of radioactive material as a result of an accident with a \nnuclear weapon, and we are not going to do anything about that. We are \njust going to trust that weapons that are 20 or 30 years old, and that \nhave not been tested for years, are going to continue to work all \nright, behave all right, and not pose any safety threat. We are going \nto close our eyes to the possibility that there could ever be a problem \nthere, and we are going to legally prohibit the President from testing \nthose weapons to see that they are safe--not to develop a new weapon; \nwe are not talking about testing for new weapons. We are going to bind \nthe President and say that, after September 30, he cannot test to \ndetermine the safety of a nuclear weapon anymore. I just, for the life \nof me, cannot understand how people would make that argument.\n  Now, Mr. President, there are Senators on the floor now who would \nlike to enlighten me as to why this perfectly innocent amendment is not \nappropriate. I will conclude by simply reminding you of what it does. \nIt simply says the power that the President has to test, which will \nexpire on September 30, will continue until there is a CTBT. If the \nCongress does not approve a test, the President cannot do it.\n  I hope people who want to debate the issue will do that so I know \nwhat we are trying to respond to here because, right now, I cannot \nthink of any arguments against this amendment. I hope we can quickly \nget a time agreement so that, as the distinguished chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee said, we can get on with this bill. This is a \nminor amendment in the overall scheme of things with this very \nimportant defense authorization bill. The chairman is right that we \nhave to get on with it. I do not intend to take any time with this. If \nwe can reach a time agreement for 10 minutes, that is fine with me.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee for supporting my amendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to again compliment Senator Kyl \nfor his detailed explanation of his amendment. This is a sound \nprovision. It enhances the President's authority to ensure that the \nNation maintains the capability to maintain a ready and safe nuclear \nstockpile. I do not understand the other side's reluctance to debate \nthis amendment and agree to a time limit.\n  Again, I urge Members to come to the floor and let us go forward and \nmake progress on this bill.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n[[Page S6429]]\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. I ask unanimous consent that the pending committee \namendment be laid aside.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I inquire of \nthe Senator from Minnesota, about how much time does he wish? There has \nbeen some talk about moving ahead on this matter. I prefer to move \nahead on this matter, and I simply inquire, before I withdraw my right \nto object, about how much time the Senator from Minnesota feels he \nneeds, and on what subject, before we set aside the pending business of \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I expect to take 10 minutes, and it relates to the closure \nof Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  Mr. EXON. With that understanding, I withdraw my objection. Is the \nSenator intending to propose an amendment?\n  Mr. GRAMS. It is a sense of the Senate.\n  Mr. EXON. Then, Mr. President, I object on the grounds that I am \nprepared to move ahead on the amendment before us. Certainly, I would \nlike to accommodate the concerns of the Senator from Minnesota and his \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment. But I suggest that in order to try and \nmove ahead on this matter, it would probably be best at this time to \nproceed with debate on the amendment that is before us rather than \noffering another amendment at this juncture. With that caveat, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Minnesota \nhas the floor, unless he chooses to yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I ask the Chair, am I allowed to go ahead and offer my \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There must be approval to set aside the \npending amendment and that has been objected to.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I say to my friend from South Carolina, the \nchairman of the committee, which I have observed now for 18 years, and \nalso my colleague from Georgia, the ranking member of the committee, \nthat I understand the difficult position they find themselves in with \nregard to trying to move this bill along. I certainly am not here to \ncause any problems in that effort because, certainly, the defense \nauthorization bill, which I voted for as it came out of the Armed \nServices Committee, is an important piece of legislation, and I think \nthat we should move expeditiously ahead. Certainly, any Senator has a \nright under the rules of the Senate to offer any amendment.\n  But I would simply say that I intend to make some remarks at this \ntime in strong opposition to the Kyl amendment, and then would plead to \nthe managers of the bill--since the Kyl amendment nor nothing like it \nwas included in the authorization bill that came out of the committee--\nthat it would probably be best, in the interest of moving ahead with \nthis bill, that the Kyl amendment be withdrawn and probably and \npossibly considered at some later more appropriate date. Mr. President, \nthere could not possibly be a worse time, a more inopportune time, if \nyou will, to consider the amendment offered by the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Here we are, Mr. President, 9 days away from the self-imposed June 28 \ndeadline by the multination negotiators now delicately moving toward \nhopefully an agreement for a comprehensive test ban treaty. And the \ndeadline is June 28. That is 9 days from now. To be specific, that is a \nweek from this coming Friday.\n  These are extremely delicate negotiations. I have talked on numerous \noccasions to our Ambassador who is involved in those detailed \nnegotiations. I have been in close touch with the Secretary that has \nresponsibility in this area, the Secretary of Energy. I have been in \nclose touch with the White House, and the National Security Council. \nThey all agree with myself, Senator Mark Hatfield, and many others who \nwill speak in opposition to this amendment, that there could not \npossibly be a worse time for the U.S. Senate to begin meddling in \nmatters of this delicate nature 9 days ahead of the June 28 self-\nimposed date by the negotiators to try to come up with a comprehensive \ntest ban treaty that in the opinion of this Senator, and in the opinion \nof most people who understand the procedure, would be to the greatest \nbenefit of mankind for as far as we can see into the future.\n  What we are talking about here is whether or not we are going to have \nless reliance on nuclear weapons in the future. Since the end of the \ncold war we all have been working, and quite well, I might say, with \nRussia and the former states of the former Soviet Union to the point \nwhere we do not have nuclear warheads pointed at each other. Behind all \nof this is the attempted emergence of new nations to nuclear power.\n  If we can put in place and keep in place the nuclear test ban treaty \nthat is now being delicately renegotiated in Geneva it would be the \ngreatest boon to mankind and the safety of mankind that one could \nimagine. No. I suspect that none of us can see into future time when we \nwill have not have nuclear weapons. But certainly we should be able to \nrecognize and realize that the United States of America which is far \nahead on the ability to test, which is far ahead on the ability to make \ntests with computers, which is far ahead in inventory of any other part \nof the world, it would seem evident to me that it would be not only in \nthe national security interests of the United States of America but \nalso the right thing to do to recognize that we should continue to be a \nleader in trying to end for all time, if we can, nations testing \nnuclear devices.\n  So, Mr. President, I speak now not only for myself but other Members \nof the U.S. Senate on both sides of the aisle in strong opposition to \nthe Kyl-Reid amendment. It is being sold here just to give the \nPresident a little flexibility, and so forth and so on. If the U.S. \nSenate would pass the Kyl-Reid amendment, which I think it will not--I \nthink I have been here long enough to have a pretty good understanding \nof the Senate and its rules--I say to the managers of the amendment, \nand I say to the managers of the bill that there could be long and \ndelayed debate on this amendment. I think it has little chance of \nsurviving the opposition that we will mount against it. I want to \nunmask, if I can, Mr. President, the feeling that this is a harmless \namendment; that it is not going to hurt anything at all. I would simply \nsay that regardless of what the intentions of the authors of the \namendment are for the U.S. Senate to be even debating such a \nproposition 9 days ahead of the final deadline, whether we pass it or \nnot, only gives the opposition around the world, wherever it is and for \nwhatever reason, more chances of disrupting and eliminating any chance \nof a comprehensive test ban treaty based on negotiations--very delicate \nnegotiations, I might say, Mr. President--in Geneva today.\n\n  Why is it that 9 days ahead of the deadline we have some Senators \ncoming on the floor of the U.S. Senate trying to make changes in what \nwe are going to do in the future with regard to nuclear tests? No one \nknows at this juncture.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. EXON. I have not interrupted the Senator from Arizona. I will not \nyield. He will have ample time to make his points at a later time.\n  I simply say that this amendment is ill-timed. It is ill-advised. At \nleast the authors should recognize and realize, if they are so certain \nthat this amendment is all-important, that it would be more in line \nwith reality and reason to at least wait until follow-on bills after \nthe 28th day of June, a week from Friday, when we will know by that \ntime whether or not the hard work and the delicate balance to try to \nreach an international comprehensive test ban treaty is successful.\n  I do not know what their motives are. It may well be that the authors \nof this amendment are totally in support, as I hope they would be in \nbeing behind our negotiators and our administration who fully recognize \nand realize the dangers that we are working with here; that the authors \nof this amendment would simply say, yes, this is probably not the best \ntime and this amendment should not be offered.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, or something like it, was discussed by \nmembers of the Armed Services Committee before our markup and before\n\n[[Page S6430]]\n\nour hearings in the Armed Services Committee on the defense \nauthorization bill. It was agreed unanimously that this is a matter \nthat should not have been taken up at this time. And for that reason, \nand principally for that reason, there was no move inside the Armed \nServices Committee to make any such suggested changes. And I believe \nthat the chairman of the Armed Services Committee knows and understands \nthat full well. The chairman of the Armed Services Committee has every \nright to support this amendment, if he wants to, on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate. That was not the reasoning of his committee during those \ndeliberations.\n  Mr. President, later on today I will insert into the Record \nstatements by the White House, statements by the Secretary of Energy, \nand others in strong unqualified opposition to this amendment \nprincipally along the lines that I have outlined.\n  I cannot imagine anything I would oppose more than the Kyl-Reid \namendment authorizing the resumption of nuclear testing beginning on \nOctober 1 this year under certain conditions. While proponents of the \namendment contend that this change to the 1992 Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell \nlaw closes some sort of a loophole in the American nuclear testing \npolicy and should have no impact on the comprehensive test ban \nnegotiations now underway in Geneva, this simply is not--I emphasize, \nMr. President, is not--the case. The Kyl-Reid amendment is the \nproverbial wolf in sheep's clothing, an innocent appearance cloaking a \nmore sinister inner nature. Whether intended or not, passage of this \nmeddlesome amendment would send a chilling ripple around the world that \nthe Senate has pulled the rug out from under our Nation's treaty \nnegotiators on the very eve of finalizing a landmark treaty designed to \nhalt the global spread of nuclear weapons.\n  After decades of failed efforts and ineffectual agreements, the \nworld's nuclear powers have finally made some progress in not only \ncurbing the increase in the number of nuclear weapons States but also \nreducing the number of nuclear weapons systems targeted on population \ncenters around the world. The INF Treaty, START I Treaty, and now START \nII are historic mileposts in the history of arms control in that they \ncompel for the first time the destruction of nuclear delivery systems \nwhile still maintaining the geopolitical balance and the ability to \ndeter an attack by a potential aggressor.\n  Defense and foreign policy experts agree that the most significant \nsecurity challenge facing the United States and the rest of the world \nis curbing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, most \ndangerous of which is a nuclear warhead. Closing Pandora's box, as I \nhave referred to these nonproliferation efforts in the past, is a \nformidable undertaking, but I believe history will judge the leaders of \nour era in great measure on how successful we are in meeting this \nchallenge.\n  While the bipartisan Nunn-Lugar program has made remarkable progress \nin addressing the secure transportation, storage, and destruction of \nthousands of former Soviet nuclear weapons, another threat reduction \neffort designed to enhance our national security is close to agreement. \nThat is the agreement I talked about that is hopefully scheduled to be \nagreed to in 9 days.\n  What in the world, whatever are their intentions, is the \nreasonableness of Members of the Senate coming in 9 days ahead of that \nformidable undertaking with an amendment that could only cause great \nmischief and possibly lead to further division of the nations that are \nhaving enough trouble already in coming to agreement in Geneva on the \nnuclear test ban treaty a week from this Friday--9 days away. I cannot \nimagine any Member of the Senate, Mr. President, I cannot imagine any \nMember of the Senate believing it would be wise, if they understood the \npossible consequences, for any Member of the Senate to endorse this \namendment for the reasons that I have stated and very likely for other \nreasons as well.\n  For the past 3 years, the 37-member nation conference on disarmament \nhas been meeting in Geneva to negotiate a verifiable comprehensive test \nban or CTB Treaty. A CTB Treaty is an important linchpin in our efforts \nto prevent new nations from developing a nuclear weapons capability by \ndepriving them of the ability to test and verify the performance and \ncapability of the new weapons. In effect, the CTB Treaty, if realized, \nwould go a long way in cutting off membership to the nuclear weapons \nclub, depriving autocratic rulers and Third World rogue nations of the \nmeans to develop such weapons with confidence in the future.\n\n  After 40 years of effort, the world community is now 10 days away, \nhopefully, 10 days away, Mr. President, from its self-imposed \nnegotiating deadline of June 28--that is this June 28--to finalize a \nCTB agreement. Not only are we in the last hours of the negotiations \nend game in the context of the historical debate on the test ban \nconcept, we are in the final minute of this long and difficult \nendeavor. For this reason, it is no surprise that some opponents of the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty and advocates of continued nuclear \ntesting would look for ways to undermine an agreement.\n  I am not saying that the authors of this amendment necessarily fall \ninto that category. I hope they do not. It might well be that some \npeople pushing this amendment were not here in 1992 when Senator \nMitchell, Senator Exon and Senator Hatfield came about with a \nbipartisan agreement, stepped aside from political considerations and \nworked out an agreement that passed the Senate and has been the \nframework ever since and has been endorsed by the President of the \nUnited States and indirectly endorsed by other nations of the world and \nhas resulted in the ongoing negotiations at Geneva.\n  In large part, the bipartisan Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell law of 1992 jump \nstarted American interest in joining the world's other nuclear powers \nin pushing for a comprehensive test ban treaty. By requiring that \nfuture U.S. nuclear weapons testing be linked to the correction of \nprospective safety and reliability problems, the Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell \nprovision confirms what most scientists, military leaders, and \npolicymakers understood: The United States has the safest, the most \nreliable nuclear weapons arsenal in the world.\n  Furthermore, after conducting over 1,000 nuclear tests, with the data \nresulting therefrom, at our test facility in Nevada, we have developed \nmore advanced simulation technology than any other power in the world. \nThe time was ripe for phasing out our testing program over 3 years and \nstart seriously negotiating a comprehensive test ban agreement. \nBasically, Mitchell-Exon-Hatfield played a key role in that \ndevelopment. And I am astonished at this amendment because, however \nwell intended, it is ill-advised as I have outlined.\n  Now, 4 years later, when we are on the verge of possibly reaching a \ncomprehensive test ban agreement, a mere 9 days away from lowering the \nlid on the nuclear Pandora's box, it is in this context that the Kyl-\nReid amendment should be judged. The Kyl-Reid amendment would authorize \nthe President to seek authorization to resume nuclear testing after \nOctober 1 up until the time when a comprehensive test ban treaty is \nratified by the Senate. Unlike the existing requirements of Hatfield-\nExon-Mitchell, these tests could be for any reason, not necessarily to \ncorrect any safety or reliability problem. I should reiterate, there is \nno known safety or reliability problem with our nuclear weapons. It is \nworth noting that even if the President did seek to resume testing it \nwould take approximately 2 years--let me repeat that, Mr. President--\neven if suddenly, today, the President of the United States should find \nthat we have a serious problem with our nuclear deterrent, it would \ntake approximately 2 years to reready the nuclear test site to conduct \ntests to verify if there is a problem and to help identify what would \nbe necessary to correct it. If that should happen, I believe there is \nno question but the U.S. Senate would join in, would recognize and \nrealize the serious threat, and take action as the President has \noutlined.\n\n  But that is not the case, and we should not be using or relying on \nthat type of scare tactic to justify this ill-conceived and ill-timed \namendment here on this date, late in June 1996, 9 days away from the \nfinal deadline in Geneva. According to the Department of Energy's best \nestimate, we would\n\n[[Page S6431]]\n\nhave to take 2 years, if we needed it, to reready the test site in \nNevada. In that context, the amendment before us is meaningless.\n  This reality raises the question of what is the true value of the \nKyl-Reid amendment if it professes to give the President the means by \nwhich to resume testing up to a point of the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty ratifications? The President of the United States is firmly \nagainst this. He does not need any additional authority at this time. \nThe Secretary of Energy, who has prime responsibility under the \nPresident of the United States, and the National Security Council, are \nfirmly opposed to this amendment, primarily for the reasons I have \noutlined. Even if there was a reason to test, and there is not, we \nwould have to wait 2 years at least before detonation could take place \nand tests could be conducted even underground at the Nevada test site, \nfar more time than the anticipated delay between signing the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty and its subsequent ratification by the \nU.S. Senate.\n  In light of this, and the fact that there is no known safety or \nreliability reason to test, the question that needs to be asked is, Why \nis this amendment being proposed now, and what would the consequences \nbe if the amendment was agreed to?\n  As I have stated, I am very fearful that they would be devastating. \nThe prospects of a comprehensive test ban agreement by June 28 were \ngreatly enhanced just recently when China agreed to join the rest of \nthe world's declared nuclear weapons states in adhering to a testing \nmoratorium and forsaking the right to test, ending all testing once an \nagreement is reached, which might be in the immediate future.\n  For the first time in history, all five permanent members of the \nSecurity Council are in agreement to adhere to a true zero yield test \nban treaty. The Chinese decision clears the most difficult and \nsignificant hurdle in reaching agreement on a comprehensive test ban \ntreaty text. What is more, the world's nonnuclear states, the potential \nnew admissions to the nuclear club, are poised to sign on to a treaty \nrelinquishing their right to develop or obtain these highly lethal and \ndestabilizing weapons of mass destruction. If the United States were to \napprove the Kyl-Reid amendment on the eve of the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty agreement, changing U.S. policy so as to authorize tests for any \nreason--for any reason, I emphasize, Mr. President, up until the time \nof Senate treaty ratification--the effect on our Nation's \nnonproliferation efforts in Geneva I am afraid would be devastating.\n\n  I am afraid, Mr. President, that under those circumstances the United \nStates would become the pariah of the international arms control \ncommunity and the reactions of condemnation from around the world would \nundoubtedly be swift, not unlike what occurred following the French and \nthe Chinese weapons tests earlier this year.\n  My suggestion to Senator Kyl and Senator Reid is that this issue be \nwithdrawn and reconsidered at some later date this year or maybe next \nyear, or sometime after that when we will know whether or not the \ncomprehensive test-ban negotiations were successful. While we have \nlearned a great deal about all of these problems, with regard to \nreliability and safety of our nuclear weapons arsenal, and we have a \nlot to learn in the future, but there is no justifiable reason to \nresume testing now or in the foreseeable future. There is, however, a \ncompelling reason to push hard in the final days of the comprehensive \ntest-ban negotiations in Geneva, without having to bother with the \nuproar that is sure to follow if the Kyl-Reid amendment, regardless of \nhow well intended, would be passed by the U.S. Senate or even \nconsidered and defeated under the rules that we have at our disposal in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to stay the course and work in a \npositive way to halt the spread of nuclear weapons around the world. \nThe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will do just that. Mr. President, the \nKyl-Reid amendment regrettably would work to the contrary. Approval of \nthis amendment by the Senate would be self-defeating and could very \nwell snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, scuttling the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty at a time 9 days--9 days away from \npossible success. Such a happening would undermine our own collective \nsecurity and that of our allies by allowing nonnuclear states to \npotentially join what has been, up to now, an exclusive group of \nnations capable of killing millions with the push of a button. \nRejection or withdrawal of the Kyl amendment would give us a chance--\nand I underline the word chance--of success at Geneva. I fear history \nwill not judge this Senate kindly if our actions, whether intended or \nnot, are instrumental in killing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as \nit is prepared, hopefully, to be enacted and to join other landmark \narms control agreements which have brought greater peace to all \nAmericans and all people in the world, as we look not only just at \ntoday, but at tomorrow as well.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to reject the Kyl-Reid amendment. \nI will do everything that I can, within the powers that I and others \nhave in the U.S. Senate, to see that this amendment does not prevail. \nThere will be many other speakers who will follow me in opposition to \nthe Kyl-Reid amendment. I emphasize only, again, in closing that, while \nthis amendment may be well-intentioned, it is ill-conceived and the \ntiming could not be worse. Those are the essential elements that the \nWhite House and the Secretary of Energy joined me on and, in my \nconversations with them, asked me to relate along with their strong \nopposition to this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Bob Perret, \na congressional fellow in Senator Reid's office, be provided privilege \nof the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me simply respond to the argument of the \nSenator from Nebraska with three quick points. I hope the Senator from \nNebraska does not misunderstand what the amendment would do. He said \nthere is no justifiable reason to test now. There is nothing in this \namendment that calls for testing now. Nothing whatsoever. It merely \ncontinues the existing authority of the President to ask for a test. I \nhave no reason to believe that the President would do so. It has \nnothing to do with engaging in any tests now.\n  Second. the Senator from Nebraska said, ``Why bring it up now?'' The \nanswer is very simple: Because the distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee said if you have any amendments to the defense \nauthorization bill bring them to the floor now. I am following the \nrequest of the distinguished chairman. And on the assumption that the \nbill is going to be dealt with within the next few days, we need to \nbring the amendment up now, not later.\n  But I offer to my colleague from Nebraska this good-faith offer: If \nthe Senator from Nebraska would agree with me that we could vote on \nthis amendment on June 29, the day after the 28th, which is the big \ndate in the Senator's mind, I would be happy to enter into such a UC \nagreement. We have no reason to have a vote necessarily before or after \nthe 28th. We are simply proposing the amendment at the time it is \nsupposed to be proposed.\n  So if the Senator will agree to a unanimous-consent request to vote \non the 29th, I would be delighted to enter into such an agreement with \nhim.\n  The third point is that nowhere in the Senator's speech about how the \ntiming could not be worse because it comes only 9 days before the 28th \nof June, which is the self-imposed deadline for the parties negotiating \nthe CTBT to reach an agreement, nowhere in his discussion was any \nsuggestion as to why this would somehow disrupt the agreement, why \nanybody would consider this relevant in the least, why they would \nobject to it.\n  I understand that they have this self-imposed deadline to reach an \nagreement by the 28th. What we are doing here is absolutely irrelevant \nto that; it has no bearing on it. I cannot imagine somebody standing up \nand saying, ``Well, U.S. Negotiator, we can agree with you on the CTBT, \nbut the U.S. Senate just considered this amendment\n\n[[Page S6432]]\n\nthat allows the President to continue to test up to the time we have a \nCTBT.''\n  Every other country in the world has that right. I suspect the United \nStates would be the only country in the world that as of September 30 \nwill not have that right by law, because that is when the President's \nauthority expires. Other countries that we are negotiating with can \ntest right up to the time there is a CTBT. Why is that not disruptive?\n  There is no logic to the Senator's argument: ``We're going to have 9 \nmore days to negotiate, so your amendment shouldn't be voted on.'' What \nis the connection? Why should anybody object to our amendment being \nvoted on in these negotiations? Our amendment has absolutely nothing to \ndo with this CTBT. It, by definition, only deals with the period of \ntime up to the CTBT.\n\n  If we put the chart back up again, I will try to make it crystal \nclear. Graphic: The law allowing the President to test expires \nSeptember 30. Up until the time that there is a CTBT, he would not be \nable to test for stockpile safety and reliability. We simply extend his \nability to do so. That is all. How can anybody in the CTBT negotiations \nobject to that? All of the other states will already have that right.\n  So, Mr. President, I heard the Senator from Nebraska, but I do not \nunderstand the logic of the argument.\n  Two final quick points. We are going to have to change the law at \nsome time, because when we enter into a CTBT, if we do, we are going to \nhave to legislatively give the President the authority to test in the \nsupreme national interest, as the President said he would need the \nauthority to do, and I quoted the President's safeguard section (f) in \nthat regard.\n  So if this law expires on September 30, that is not the end of it. We \nare going to have to legislate.\n  Second, I note that the administration itself has said that until \nthree different countries--I think two of them were Pakistan and \nIndia--agreed to sign up that we are not going to be entering into a \nCTBT. I am just not at all sure this magic date of the 28th is all of \nthat magic. It may well be we are not able to reach an agreement by \nthat self-imposed deadline.\n  But it does not matter, because all my amendment does is to allow the \nPresident the authority he has today, subject to Congress saying, ``No, \nyou can't test,'' allow him to call for a test up until the time the \nCTBT goes into effect. It has no effect whatsoever on the CTBT. It does \nnot affect it in the least. Granted, the 28th date is out there, but I \ndo not know what relevance that is as to what we are doing here today.\n  I did want to clear those up since the Senator had raised the \nquestion of our motives in bringing it up at this time. I know Senator \nReid and I both want to make it crystal clear--that was the point in my \nseeking recognition a moment ago--to assure the Senator from my home \nState of Nebraska that our motive was to simply comply with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee to get any \namendment we had to this bill presented before the bill was taken from \nthe floor.\n  That is why we brought it up today. We could have easily brought it \nup tomorrow or the next day. I think we are happy to agree to any \nunanimous consent request that the Senator would be agreeable to enter \ninto to have a vote after the date of the 28th, if there is a concern \ndoing it before then would be disruptive in Geneva.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to my \ncolleague from the State of Arizona. I will simply say to him that \neverything that I had just said in my statement in this regard is \ntotally accurate, to the best of my knowledge.\n  With regard to his counterarguments that this is going to help the \nPresident of the United States, the President of the United States says \nhe does not need help. ``Thanks, but no thanks.''\n  The President of the United States is simply saying that the timing \nof this amendment is so outlandish, regardless of how well-intentioned \nit might be, that it has the chance of doing a great deal of harm and \nlittle, if any, enhanced possibilities of success at Geneva.\n\n  I will certainly say to my friend from Arizona that I am very willing \nto try and work with him in the future when the time might or might not \nbe right to do some of the things that he says his amendment is \ndesigned to do. But I must tell him that the White House, the \nnegotiators at Geneva, most if not all of the experts in this area that \nI know of and have worked with over the years, feel that his is an \nespecially ill-timed amendment, notwithstanding his intentions.\n  I, therefore, simply say to him that I am not in a position at this \ntime to agree to any time certain for a time limit or a time certain \nfor a vote on this matter on the defense authorization bill that is \nbefore us, and certainly it is not possible for me to make any \ncommitments at this time as to some date certain in the future as to \nwhen I might agree to allow that to happen, other than to say I think \nthe Senator from Arizona knows that this Senator is totally \napproachable, intends to be reasonable, and understands the other \nperson's point of view.\n\n  I try very hard to walk in another's shoes, see both sides of the \ndebate. I will not walk in the shoes of those that are trying to push \nahead on this amendment that this Senator feels, and other Senators \nlike me on both sides of the aisle feel, that this amendment at this \ntime is a disaster from the standpoint of trying to reach a \ncomprehensive test ban treaty at Geneva that I think is essential for \nthe future of mankind. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the current \namendment and the pending committee amendments be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4052\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the reopening of \n                          Pennsylvania Avenue)\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams], for himself and Mr. \n     Robb, proposes amendment numbered 4052.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1791, President George Washington commissioned \n     Pierre Charles L'Enfant to draft a blueprint for America's \n     new capital city; they envisioned Pennsylvania Avenue as a \n     bold, ceremonial boulevard physically linking the U.S. \n     Capitol building and the White House, and symbolically the \n     Legislative and Executive branches of government.\n       (2) An integral element of the District of Columbia, \n     Pennsylvania Avenue stood for 195 years as a vital, working, \n     unbroken roadway, elevating it into a place of national \n     importance as ``America's Main Street''.\n       (3) 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the White House, has become \n     America's most recognized address and a primary destination \n     of visitors to the Nation's Capital; ``the People's House'' \n     is host to 5,000 tourists daily, and 15,000,000 annually.\n       (4) As home to the President, and given its prominent \n     location on Pennsylvania Avenue and its proximity to the \n     People, the White House has become a powerful symbol of \n     freedom, openness, and an individual's access to their \n     government.\n       (5) On May 20, 1995, citing possible security risks from \n     vehicles transporting terrorist bombs, President Clinton \n     ordered the Secret Service, in conjunction with the \n     Department of the Treasury, to close Pennsylvania Avenue to \n     vehicular traffic for two blocks in front of the White House.\n       (6) While the security of the President and visitors to the \n     White House is of grave concern and is not to be taken \n     lightly, the need to assure the President's safety must be \n     balanced with the expectation of freedom inherent in a \n     democracy; the present situation is tilted too heavily toward \n     security at freedom's expense.\n       (7) By impeding access and imposing undue hardships upon \n     tourists, residents of the District, commuters, and local \n     business owners and their customers, the closure of \n     Pennsylvania Avenue, undertaken without the counsel of the \n     government of the District of Columbia, has replaced the \n     former openness\n\n[[Page S6433]]\n\n     of the area surrounding the White House with barricades, \n     additional security checkpoints, and an atmosphere of fear \n     and distrust.\n       (8) In the year following the closure of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue, the taxpayers have borne a significant burden for \n     additional security measures along the Avenue near the White \n     House.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the President should direct the Department of the \n     Treasury and the Secret Service to work with the Government \n     of the District of Columbia to develop a plan for the \n     permanent reopening to vehicular traffic of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue in front of the White House in order to restore the \n     Avenue to its original state and return it to the people.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the legislation we debate today sets out \nthe broad defense policy for the Nation. It affords us an opportunity \nto outline our defense priorities, and the opportunity to reflect on \nwhat role this Nation is to play in the defense of freedom worldwide.\n  What I have come to the floor to address today is the defense of \nfreedom within our own borders, indeed, right here in the heart of our \nNation's Capital. I rise, along with Senator Robb, my colleague from \nVirginia, to offer an amendment seeking the reopening of Pennsylvania \nAvenue in front of the White House. Mr. President, the two-block \nsection of Pennsylvania Avenue fronting the White House was closed to \nvehicular traffic on May 20, 1995, by order of the President.\n  I have been to the floor several times in the year since to voice my \nconcerns that the loss of this historic roadway--which travels across \none of the busiest sections of one of the busiest cities in the world--\nhas had a devastating impact on the District of Columbia. I have talked \nabout the damage the closing has done to Washington's business \ncommunity. There are well-founded concerns that it is scaring off new \njobs and prompting potential retail and commercial tenants to stay away \nfrom the downtown area. I have discussed the hardships caused by the \nclosing for District residents, and anyone whose paycheck depends on \naccess to the avenue, people like cab drivers and tour bus operators.\n\n  I have outlined the numerous problems the closing has created for the \nDistrict itself, which had one of its major crosstown arteries \nunilaterally severed by the Federal Government without any \nconsultation. At a time when this troubled city could least afford \nanother blow, this has hit especially hard. I have discussed the \ninconvenience for the 15 million tourists who come to Washington each \nyear, especially the elderly and disabled, many of whom are being \ndeprived of a close look at the White House.\n  And I have talked about the cost for the taxpayers, which has already \nreached into the millions of dollars, and, if the National Park Service \nprevails, could rise by at least $40 million more.\n  Mr. President, I have raised each of those aspects of the closing \nbecause each is important. But there is another side to this issue that \nis easy to overlook amid all the other more obvious problems: the \nquestion of what the closing of Pennsylvania Avenue says to the \nAmerican people, and what we give up as a free society when we give in \nto fear.\n  Generations of visitors to Washington would hardly recognize the \nstretch of Pennsylvania Avenue that has stood for nearly 200 years as \nAmerica's Main Street. Today, it is a vacant lot, empty of any traffic. \nGone is the thrill for visitors of driving by the White House for the \nfirst time--the concrete barricades have put an end to that.\n  Gone, too, is the sense of openness that inspired Americans to feel \nclose to the Presidency and close to their Government when they visited \nthe Executive Mansion. And 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue has become a \nFederal fortress, and the effect is unnerving.\n  In a city that boasts of such inspiring symbols of freedom as the \nmarble of the Lincoln Memorial, the columns and porticos of the White \nHouse, the massive stones that lift the Washington Monument into the \nsky, and the great dome of the U.S. Capitol itself, the gray, concrete \nbarricades of Pennsylvania Avenue are a national embarrassment.\n  How do we explain the blockades to our visitors, whose first glimpse \nof the home of their President is marred by the sight of a White House \nseemingly under siege? What do we say when those visitors are children, \nwho have been taught how this Nation has fought for freedom and values \nit above all else, and yet find a different message along the now-empty \nstretch of Pennsylvania Avenue?\n  Mr. President, I must make this clear: in each conversation I have \nhad about the future of Pennsylvania Avenue, everyone has been emphatic \nthat the safety of the President must be our primary concern. So it \nis--without question. And because the need to ensure the safety and \nsecurity of the President of the United States is paramount, there was \nlittle argument when Pennsylvania Avenue was closed in the weeks \nimmediately following the bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma \nCity. At the insistence of the Secret Service, temporary restrictions \non Pennsylvania Avenue seemed prudent, and because it was a temporary \nmove, people went along.\n  But months passed, and then a year, and now, the National Park \nService is moving ahead with plans to forever close ``America's Main \nStreet'' to traffic in front of the White House. Because they are \nthorough and efficient and utterly dedicated to protecting the \nPresident, the Secret Service can't be blamed for pushing for the \nclosing of Pennsylvania Avenue. They have been trying for 30 years to \nshut it down, beginning with the Kennedy administration and every \nPresident since. They have long seen Pennsylvania Avenue as a threat, \nand used Oklahoma City as the justification to move ahead with a plan \nthey have been eager to put in place for more than three decades. If \nthe Secret Service had its way, we would build a protective bubble \naround the President from which he'd never emerge. But that is not what \nbeing President is all about, especially when you are an outgoing, \ngregarious leader like President Clinton, who exposes himself to danger \na thousand times a day inside and outside Washington, because he \nthrives on the public contact that comes with being President. Keep \nthis President away from the people? Well, you would have better luck \nkeeping Cal Ripkin away from the ballpark. And that is the way it \nshould be. That is what people need their President to be. We cannot \neliminate every risk, Mr. President, because that is the nature of a \ndemocracy. When we resort to the temptation to try, we start down a \nslippery slope. Turning these two blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue into a \n$40 million park will not hide the fact that we're wrapping the White \nHouse in another layer of protection and further insulating our leaders \nfrom the public.\n\n  Mr. President, an entire year has come and gone since the closure of \nPennsylvania Avenue, and the circumstances have changed with time. A \ndecision that seemed prudent a year ago now demands to be reexamined, \nand the sense-of-the-Senate amendment I introduce today offers us that \nopportunity. It simply calls on the President to direct the Secret \nService--working alongside the Treasury Department and the District \ngovernment--to develop a plan for the permanent reopening of \nPennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House. It puts this Senate on \nrecord as saying we are not a nation that cowers to terrorists. My \namendment--based on Senate Resolution 254, which 46 of my Senate \ncolleagues agreed to cosponsor when I introduced it as stand-alone \nlegislation last month--enjoys widespread, bipartisan support here on \nCapitol Hill, throughout the District of Columbia, and among the \nAmerican people themselves. I am proud to have Senator Robb join me as \nan original cosponsor. Many of his constituents deal every day with the \nclosure of Pennsylvania Avenue. I am grateful our efforts have the \nadded support of Congressmen Davis and Moran and Congresswoman Norton \nin the House, along with Senator Leahy, as well, here in the Senate, \nand that we have been joined by Mayor Barry, the D.C. Council, and more \nthan two dozen of this city's most influential business, civic, and \nhistoric organizations.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this list of supporters, \nthe original cosponsors of Senate Resolution 254, and a resolution of \nsupport passed by the D.C. Council be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6434]]\n\n     We Support the Senate Resolution Calling for the Reopening of \n            Pennsylvania Avenue in Front of the White House\n\n       District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry.\n       DC Council Chairman David A.

The Council finds that:\n       (1) One year ago the United States Department of the \n     Treasury closed Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White \n     House, the national symbol of an open democracy.\n       (2) The National Park Service has submitted a proposal to \n     permanently close that portion of Pennsylvania Avenue, \n     leaving the downtown disfigured and dysfunctional.\n       (3) Pennsylvania Avenue is the major east-west artery in \n     the District of Columbia.\n       (4) The temporary closure of Pennsylvania Avenue has \n     seriously affected the ability of District residents to \n     navigate city streets and has greatly disrupted traffic \n     patterns, commerce, and tourism.\n       (5) The permanent closure of Pennsylvania Avenue will \n     exacerbate the serious financial and traffic problems that \n     have been created by the temporary closure.\n       (6) Pennsylvania Avenue is not a park.\n       (7) The concern for heightened security is understandable. \n     Nevertheless, with the technological capability of the United \n     States, another solution can be found to address security \n     interests without permanently damaging the District of \n     Columbia.\n       (8) In this time of fiscal austerity at the local and \n     national levels, it is neither desirable nor justifiable to \n     spend the amounts proposed to permanently alter Pennsylvania \n     Avenue.\n       (9) The proposal submitted by the National Park Service \n     does not address the impact the closure will have on the \n     residents and businesses of the District of Columbia.\n       (10) The future of Pennsylvania Avenue should be decided \n     with the cooperation and approved of the elected officials \n     and citizens of the District of Columbia.\n       Sec. 3. It is the sense of the Council that the United \n     States Congress enact legislation requiring the reopening of \n     Pennsylvania Avenue.\n       Sec. 4. The Secretary of the Council of the District of \n     Columbia shall transmit copies of this resolution upon its \n     adoption to the President of the United States, the Mayor of \n     the District of Columbia, the District of Columbia Delegate \n     to the United States Congress, the chairpersons of the \n     committees of the United States Congress with oversight and \n     budgetary jurisdiction over the District of Columbia, the \n     Chair of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility \n     and Management Assistance Authority, the Secretary of the \n     United States Department of the Treasury, the Secretary of \n     the United States General Services Administration, the \n     Secretary of the United States Department of Transportation, \n     the Secretary of the United States Department of the \n     Interior, the Chairman of the National Capital Planning \n     Commission, the City of Administrator, the Assistant City \n     Administrator for Economic Development, the Director of the \n     District of Columbia Department of Public Works, and the \n     Director of the District of Columbia Office of Planning.\n       Sec. 5. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, we have come together--Republicans and \nDemocrats, without regard to party affiliation and without any \npolitical agenda--to ask the President to reverse a decision that has \nhad widespread, unintended consequences. In the Capital City of a \nnation built ``of the people, by the people, and for the people,'' \nthere is no room for fear, roadblocks, or barricades.\n  The American people agree, and I am heartened by their support. By \nmail and through the Internet, hundreds of them have urged me to \ncontinue this campaign to restore Pennsylvania Avenue to its historic \nuse. I wish I could share each of their messages with you. I want to \ntell you, though, I have heard from military experts who tell me the \npresent closure would do nothing to blunt a terrorist attack, former--\neven current--White House employees who are ashamed of what \nPennsylvania Avenue has become, long-time residents and more recent \ntransplants to the District, and Americans from every corner of the \ncountry. They have said it many different ways, but their message is \nthe same and that is: give us back Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  This month, two former residents of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue joined \nin the national discussion by speaking out against the closing. \nPresident Gerald Ford said, quote, ``There ought to be a better \nsolution.'' President Jimmy Carter labeled it, quote, ``unnecessary and \na mistake.''\n  There is one letter I keep coming back to, a letter that sums up more \neloquently than any other the closing of Pennsylvania Avenue because it \nwas written by a man who lived alongside the fear of terrorism for 444 \ndays, yet still refuses to bow to it.\n  He urged me to continue my efforts, and sent me a copy of a letter he \nhad printed in the Washington Post just days after the avenue's \nclosure. It reads: ``By closing Pennsylvania Avenue, we have succumbed \nto the atmosphere of fear that terrorists--domestic and foreign--seek \nto foster among us.''\n  If there is any American who should fear the power of a terrorist, it \nis Minnesota native Bruce Laingen, the senior diplomat among the U.S. \nEmbassy employees held hostage in Tehran beginning in 1979. If Bruce \nLaingen is not willing to give in to terrorism, then neither should we.\n  Mr. President, through almost 200 years of this Nation's colorful \nhistory, Pennsylvania Avenue survived, through assassinations, civil \nand world wars, political unrest, and events that have often led us to \nquestion what it means to live in a free society where risks are an \ninescapable part of our everyday life.\n  The transformation of Pennsylvania Avenue from a national symbol of \nfreedom into a testament to terrorism is something average Americans \ntell me they cannot understand. It is time to reopen Pennsylvania \nAvenue, for our visitors, our business community, our commuters, our \nresidents--for every American who celebrates freedom and will defend it \nat all costs. Kings live in castles, protected by moats. Dictators hide \nthemselves away in the safety of bunkers. Presidents live alongside \nbusy streets like Pennsylvania Avenue, close to the people who give \nthem their strength.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Pennsylvania Avenue amendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to support the sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution offered by the distinguished Senator from Minnesota, \nSenator Grams. Judging from the number of cosponsors, this resolution \nhas broad bipartisan support.\n  I would also like to associate myself with the Senator's remarks, \nparticularly with his point that the White House has become a powerful \nsymbol of freedom, openness, and citizens' access to their Government. \nThis resolution informs the President that the Senate\n\n[[Page S6435]]\n\nbelieves the Department of the Treasury and the Secret Service should \ndevelop a plan to reopen Pennsylvania Avenue. I commend the Senator for \nhis leadership in this matter.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am tempted to move the question here \nbecause the Senator has presented his amendment, and he has presented \nhis argument. There is no one on the floor to either argue against the \nSenator's amendment, to speak for the Senator's amendment, or to offer \nan amendment to the bill that we are debating.\n  Here it is now 12:30 p.m., and we are in this typical nothing-\nhappens-during-daylight hours in the U.S. Senate. We have an important \nbill on the floor. We have amendments that we are aware of, but no one \nis here to offer those amendments.\n  I am not going to move for adoption of this amendment by voice vote \nyet, in deference to those that may want to speak against it or for the \nSenator's interest in getting a rollcall vote, but the bill before the \nSenate, the defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1997, is not \nbeing debated. The Senate is wasting a lot of time. Once again, we will \nfind ourselves here late into the evening doing work that we ought to \nbe doing during the day.\n  I urge colleagues who have an interest in this bill, who have \namendments that they wish to offer to this bill, to notify the managers \nof their interest so that we can structure some time for them to do \nthis. Without that, we are going to, at some point, come to the \nconclusion that no one is interested in amending the bill as it is \npresented, other than the amendment, the two amendments that are \ncurrently up, and we will have to move to some disposition.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment \nI offered earlier, amendment No. 4052.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could direct a question to Senator \nGrams, who offered the pending sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It is my \nunderstanding--and I have not been on the floor--that this would be a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution that would indicate that Pennsylvania \nAvenue should be reopened; is that true?\n  Mr. GRAMS. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I believe that we should proceed with \ncaution on something as serious as this. I know my friend from \nMinnesota has probably been inconvenienced, as has this Senator. I have \nhad to change one of my routes to my residence in Washington as a \nresult of the closure of Pennsylvania Avenue. It has been inconvenient \nfor me. I went to a meeting at the White House yesterday, however, and \npulled into Pennsylvania Avenue and the guards were there. I was very \nimpressed as to what was going on on Pennsylvania Avenue, the part of \nit that has been closed. Vehicular traffic is stopped, but foot traffic \nis heavier than ever. In fact, out in front of the White House on \nPennsylvania Avenue, they had a street hockey game going on--in fact, \nseveral of them.\n  Now, every one of us here on the Senate floor, Members of the Senate, \nhave access to what goes on in the Intelligence Committee. I think it \nwould be constructive for every Member of the Senate to have a briefing \non why Pennsylvania Avenue was closed. When I came here 14 years ago, \nall these entrances coming into the Capitol complex were open--those \nthat now have these big cement flower pillars there. They were open \nwhen I came here. You could come in and out at your leisure. There was \nno security of any consequence on those routes.\n  The first year that I was in the House of Representatives the Nevada \nState Society had a meeting over here in the Rayburn Room. And it ended \nsometime in the evening at 8 o'clock or so. Shortly after the Nevada \npeople left that room there was a huge explosion that took place that \ndid damage in here and did tremendous damage in the Rayburn Room, and \nall out through there.\n  The security slowly but surely has tightened up, and it has not been \ndone just as a whim of the Capitol Police. They are short handed like \neveryone else. They have had to beef up their security in an effort to \nmake the Capitol complex safer--safer for the Senators and Congressmen \nbut also for the millions of people who visit this building and the \noffice buildings surrounding the Capitol complex.\n  I think it would be bad policy for the U.S. Senate to start handling \nsecurity for the White House. I think it would be bad public policy for \nthe U.S. Senate to start handling security of the Capitol complex, \nespecially without congressional hearings.\n  Simply to walk in here and say, ``In 1791, George Washington \ncommissioned L'Enfant to draft a blueprint for America's new Capital \nCity; they envisioned Pennsylvania Avenue as a bold, ceremonial \nboulevard physically linking the U.S. Capitol Building and the White \nHouse, and symbolically the legislative and executive branches of \nGovernment.''\n  In over 200 years things have changed. There were no automobiles, of \ncourse, then.\n  The Senate resolution goes on to say:\n\n       An integral element of the District of Columbia, \n     Pennsylvania Avenue stood for 195 years as a vital, working, \n     unbroken roadway, elevating it into a place of national \n     importance as America's Main Street.\n\n  No one would dispute that.\n\n       1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the White House, has become \n     America's most recognized address and a primary destination \n     of visitors to the Nations Capital; the People's House is \n     host to 5,000 tourists daily, and 1,500,000 annually.\n\n  It would be more than that. As we all know, they are limited to a \nsmall facility to the numbers of people that can go there. Those people \nwe want to be safe also.\n\n       As home to the President, and given its prominent location \n     on Pennsylvania Avenue and its proximity to the people, the \n     White House has become a powerful symbol of freedom, \n     openness, and an individual's access to their Government.\n       On May 20, 1995, citing possible security risks from \n     vehicles transporting terrorists bombs, President Clinton \n     ordered the Secret Service, in conjunction with the \n     Department of the Treasury, to close Pennsylvania Avenue to \n     vehicular traffic for two blocks in front of the White House.\n       While the security of the President and visitors to the \n     White House is of grave concern and is not to be taken \n     lightly, the need to assure the President's safety must be \n     balanced with the expectation of freedom inherent in a \n     democracy; the present situation is tilted too heavily toward \n     security at freedom's expense.\n\n  Mr. President, I think that we are really lurching into an area here \nthat deserves a little caution. A year ago the Secretary of the \nTreasury, Robert Rubin, directed the Secret Service to close a segment \nof Pennsylvania Avenue--it is not all closed--to vehicular traffic \nfollowing the conclusion of the White House security review. The review \nof security to the White House is the most extensive ever conducted. \nPennsylvania Avenue remains accessible to visitors, and the area will \nbe converted to a pedestrian park, which I think people coming to visit \nWashington will certainly be well served by rather than the traffic \njams we have had there since I can remember.\n  This sense-of-the-Senate resolution says:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the President should \n     direct the Department of the Treasury and the Secret Service \n     to work with the Government of the District of Columbia to \n     develop a plan for the permanent reopening to vehicular \n     traffic of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House \n     in order to restore the Avenue to its original state and \n     return it to the people.\n\n  I say with as much respect as I can that this is not a good sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution. I think it should be defeated. I do not think it \nprudent national security policy that, absent hearings, we take this \nmeasure up on the floor of the Senate. This resolution\n\n[[Page S6436]]\n\nhas no business in the Defense authorization bill. There have been no \nhearings held on this. There are committees with jurisdiction to handle \nmatters dealing with intelligence.\n  I personally feel for my Government that it is better that it be \nclosed. I have not heard a single person from the State of Nevada--and \na lot of them come back here--complain because that area has been \nblocked off. I have heard people who complain it is harder to get home \nnow. There is no question that it is. The Secretary of the Treasury has \nthe legal authority to restrict vehicular traffic on Pennsylvania \nAvenue. As long as he, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the head of \nthe Secret Service continue to determine that as a factual matter--\ndoing so is necessary to protect the President--I am going to go along \nwith that.\n  Based on information from the Secret Service, the closure is \nnecessary to protect the President and all those who work at and visit \nthe White House every day. The Department of Treasury remains committed \nto that decision. This, Mr. President, is not a decision to protect \nPresident Clinton. It is a decision to protect the President of the \nUnited States and those thousands of people that work in, and have \ncontact with, the White House on a daily basis.\n  Closure was necessary because the White House security review was not \nable to identify any alternative to prohibiting vehicular traffic on \nPennsylvania Avenue that would ensure the protection of the President \nand others in the White House complex from explosive devices carried in \nvehicles near the perimeter.\n  Mr. President, an explosive device in the trunk of a car out on \nPennsylvania Avenue would do significant damage to the White House, its \nproperty, and the people in the White House.\n  The Secretary of Treasury's review recommended a number of things, \nand his recommendations were not done alone. They were not done by him \nalone. He made the final decision. But the review recommendations were \nfully endorsed by an independent, bipartisan advisory group which \nincluded former Secretary of Transportation William Coleman and the \nformer Director of the CIA and the FBI, Judge William Webster. The \nreview consulted with numerous experts on public access, architecture, \nand the history of the White House. He stated that a pedestrian park \nhad numerous advantages other than security.\n  Someone coming from the State of Nevada to look at the White House \nwould certainly be more impressed with an open park atmosphere rather \nthan honking cabs back-to-back with smoke puffing out of the cars. A \npedestrian mall concept is consistent with President Washington's \nvision for the White House similar in identity, and which Mrs. Kennedy \nendorsed more than a generation a ago.\n  At President Clinton's direction, the Department of Interior's \nNational Park Service has been working with a preexisting committee on \na comprehensive design plan for the White House; a design for a \npedestrian park.\n  On Wednesday, May 22 of this year, the Director of the National Park \nService was in the process of announcing the design plan for \nPennsylvania Avenue and, Mr. President, we are confident that when this \nplan is completed the area will be much more inviting than it was when \nthat area was not blocked off. It will be an important public space. We \nwould look back with derision to an amendment like this to create and \nmaintain a roadway for vehicular traffic through the front of the White \nHouse.\n  The Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration is \ncontinuing its work with the District of Columbia Department of Public \nWorks on short- and long-term traffic plans to alleviate traffic \nproblems for the area.\n  Although closing Pennsylvania Avenue has had an impact on traffic, it \nhas not had a negative impact on the public's access to the White \nHouse. People who were driving in front of the White House with rare \nexception were people who were not coming to see the White House. They \nwere there because they were doing business in and about that area.\n  It has not prevented public access to the White House. Tours have \ncontinued. They have continued uninterrupted. Visitors can now enjoy \nwalking, as I indicated, rollerblading, participating in street hockey, \nand other games out in front of the White House, and they are biking \ndown Pennsylvania Avenue without the noise and danger of passing \nmotorists. The White House, Mr. President, does remain the people's \nhouse.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we would not have to vote on this sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution. I think that we are really stepping out of \nwhere we are supposed to be by trying to micromanage security at the \nWhite House. With all the problems we have had in this country and \naround the world, with leaders being assassinated, bombs being placed \nin cars, I just think that this is the wrong way to go, and I certainly \nhope that this sense-of-the-Senate resolution would not have to be \nvoted on, and if we do I hope that we would not pass it. I think it \nshould be defeated.\n  Mr. President, I feel that there are a lot of things we should be \ntalking about on this defense bill but one of them is not how to \nmicromanage security at the White House. Should we pass a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution overriding what the Capitol Police do around the \nCapitol complex? Should we amend this sense-of-the-Senate resolution--I \nask in the form of a question to my friend from Minnesota, would the \nSenator be willing to modify his amendment to provide for the opening \nof all the streets around the Senate Office Buildings and the Capitol?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). Under the previous order, at \nthe hour of 1 p.m., the majority leader was to be recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I certainly cannot interfere with a unanimous-consent \nrequest that has previously been entered, but I hope that I would not \nlose the floor.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield at this time, we \ndid have a commitment to notify the Members of the progress that was \nbeing made at 1 o'clock and get a unanimous-consent agreement as to how \nwe would continue to proceed. And then, of course, we would go right \nback to where the Senator is, and we would have an opportunity to work \ntogether on that, so I will be very brief.\n  Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the Democratic \nleader and I have just concluded another meeting to further discuss the \npossibility of an agreement with regard to the minimum wage and the \nsmall business tax package. Both leaders will now be contacting various \nMembers to continue to clear the agreement, and I thank all Members at \nthis time for their cooperation. I hope to be able to resolve this \nmatter by the close of business today. We are being very careful \nbecause we want to make sure all Members know exactly what is involved, \nand before we agree to any further step we both go back to our Members \nto discuss it with them further. In the meantime, I urge Members who \nhave amendments to the DOD authorization bill to come to the floor and \nbe willing to accept reasonable time agreements with respect to their \namendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent now that no minimum wage amendment or \nlegislation be in order for the remainder of today's session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We want to certainly cooperate with the majority leader \nand our minority leader as well on the issue of the minimum wage and to \ntry to work out an adequate procedure by which the Senate will have an \nopportunity to address this issue. I had understood at a previous time \nthat that negotiation had been in process and that they in effect were \nin agreement with the exception of the notification on the particular \nlanguage that was going to be offered, one by the Republicans, one by \nthe Democrats, on the minimum wage, and then one by Republicans and \nDemocrats on the various tax provisions; and that there would be then a \nconclusion of the results on it and we would go to the conference.\n  That was I thought pretty well understood or announced on Sunday. I \nheard my friend and colleague from\n\n[[Page S6437]]\n\nMississippi talking on a national program about the desire to work that \nout. It is Wednesday now at 1 o'clock.\n  The way it had been initially outlined seemed to me to be a way that \nmade the most sense in proceeding, to try to do the defense \nauthorization and then to move off the dime.\n  Could the Senator give us some idea as to where these negotiations \nare, because I think I am one of many who believe that we have been \nback and forth on this issue of the minimum wage for some period of \ntime. It does not seem to be an enormously complicated question to try \nto work out and a process and procedure which should be satisfactory to \nthe majority and the minority. But I am wondering if he could give us \nsome idea about where we are at this time. We are all being asked about \nthis by the press. I think the public ought to have at least some \nunderstanding. I know that the leaders have to work these measures \nthrough in terms of a variety of considerations, but I should like to \ninquire as to where we are because we are giving up the opportunity to \naddress this. We are only in 1 more week prior to the Fourth of July \nrecess and, as the Senator knows, one of the factors of the Fourth of \nJuly was that was to be the time when the minimum wage was supposedly \nincreased. That was to be the triggering year for the increase of the \n40 cents. So it is of interest, I imagine, to millions of Americans who \nwonder whether we are going to do this before the Fourth and to try and \nget some action so that they might be able to participate in an \nincrease or whether they are not and what the circumstances are about \nit.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. To the comments of the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, I want to emphasize that this involves a lot more than \nthe minimum wage. It does involve a package of small business tax \namendments that could be very helpful to small businesses in America, \nwhere most of the jobs are created in America anyway, or the majority \nof them and particularly where most of the entry-level people are \nworking. And so that is a part of this package. The gas tax issue, \nwhereby there would be a repeal of the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax, has \nbeen involved in all of this. The issue of the taxpayer bill of rights \nis involved, as well as the TEAM issue which had been offered earlier, \nso that we could have cooperation between employees and employers.\n  As our colleagues know, this issue took on more and more issues as it \nlanguished for 1 month or 6 weeks and every time it came up there was \nanother angle to it. So that is point No. 1. Second, I think we were \nvery close to having an agreement between Senator Daschle and myself \nlast night, or late yesterday afternoon, one that was not universally \nappealing on our side of the aisle or on the other side of the aisle, \nbut then I believe Senator Daschle found there were some concerns on \nyour side of the aisle with what we were trying to get an agreement on.\n  We have met subsequently, and we have discussed other ways that maybe \nthat can be dealt with. But we are being extra careful because we want \nto develop a relationship that is one of trust and respect. We are \nmaking sure that when we talk about something, I understand what he is \nsaying and he understands what I am saying. We are trying to reduce it \nto writing with our staff working on both sides. We have just come \nthrough a meeting which I pointed out in which we came up with some \nsuggestions as to how amendments, for instance, on gas tax provisions, \nwould be allowed, how many, because there are some Senators on that \nside who want to have more than one and there are some Senators on our \nside who would like to have more than one on the small business tax \nprovision. I am sorry; I misspoke myself--on the small business portion \nof it. So, we are being extra careful to make sure that we understand \neach other and that colleagues on both sides can live with it. But what \nwe are trying to do is to deal with this matter in absolutely a fair \nway, an open way, so that we can deal with other business that is very \nimportant for our country--Department of Defense authorization, \ncampaign finance reform next Monday, we have the Federal Reserve Board \nnominees. We are going to vote on those Thursday.\n\n  So this Gordian knot that has been tied up here, we are trying to \ntake it one string at a time, and we are making progress. But we ask--I \nask our colleagues here, give us a little more time. We are working in \ngood faith and we are very close to something, I think, that would be \nfair, understandable, and we could all agree with. I think we are going \nto try very hard to have that done by the close of this session.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just further reserving the right to object, just to make \na brief comment, Mr. President, I am unpersuaded by the Senator's \nposition that this is a Gordian knot and that it has been languishing \nhere. The reason it has been languishing is those who for over a year \nand a half have denied this body the opportunity to vote when we have \nbeen able to demonstrate in previous votes a majority of the body will \nvote for an increase in the minimum wage.\n  I reject, also, the suggestion that it is our side of the aisle that \nhas somehow complicated these negotiations. I have privity to those, \nand when the Senator talked about what was going to happen or not \nhappen with regards to the TEAM Act on Sunday and said that was not \ngoing to be called up this year and then had a change of mind, trying \nto add other things to these negotiations which had been tentatively \nagreed to, it was not this side of the aisle that was complicating the \nnegotiations. It was his side of the aisle.\n  Now, the American people are enormously interested in these \nprovisions on small business. As I understand it, it is 12 or 13 \nbillion dollars' worth. They are interested, the taxpayers, in the gas \ntax; I am sure in the TEAM Act. But I think it is a very simple issue. \nWe are asking an up-or-down vote on minimum wage, which we have \nhistorically voted on seven different times at other times in our \nhistory. That is something we are being denied, even though the time \nhas been moving on and the triggering time for the increase in the \nminimum wage is July 4.\n  So, I must say to my friend and colleague, I will not object at this \ntime. But I, quite frankly, am enormously troubled by the failure to \nmake it very clear whether we are going to have the opportunity to vote \non this measure in a way the Members can know when it will be called up \nand to vote on it, and just have this continuously dragged through. We \nhave a right to offer this on different measures. The reason that we do \nis because we are denied the opportunity to vote on it as a separate \nbill. As long as the majority refuses to give us that opportunity to \nvote on a separate bill, then we are going to be required to use any \nparticular device.\n  I do not object at this time, but I certainly hope we would conclude \nthese negotiations through the afternoon and all Members will have a \nchance to look at what is actually going to be proposed on a unanimous \nconsent. Because otherwise this minimum wage is going to be right on \nthe defense authorization before this week ends.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I renew my request for the unanimous \nconsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could just claim some leader time, perhaps, to comment \nfurther on that. First of all, I might just say that in the proposal we \nhave, the Senator will have an opportunity to have a clear vote on his \namendment the way he wants to do it. So the opportunity is there. I \nthink it is only fair that we have an opportunity to have our version \nof that issue.\n  As far as the time that you have been delayed, you had 2 years when \nyou were in the majority when you did not offer a minimum wage \nincrease. To now say you are being blocked from that, I just wonder why \nyou did not offer it in those earlier 2 years. But having said that----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Do you want an answer?\n  Mr. LOTT. We are trying to find a way to get the job done, and I am \nworking at that diligently.\n  I want to say this. As far as the TEAM Act, saying I was not going to \ncall it up this year, I did not say that. I said we were trying to work \nup an agreement that would not have the TEAM Act in as a part of the \nminimum wage and small business tax relief.\n\n[[Page S6438]]\n\n That is the direction we are working in. But I did not mean to imply \nand I did not say we were not going to call it up this year. That is an \nissue a lot of people feel very strongly about. The American people, I \nthink, would agree with it. So I want to make that clear.\n  The other thing I must say, the problem is not on the Democratic side \nof the aisle alone. We have people over here who do not like this very \nmuch either. So there is an equal grumbling about it. But as leaders \nhere, we are trying to find a way to get everybody just unhappy enough \nthat they do not like it but they will not object to it. And we are \nabout to get there. So give us that latitude, and I think we will get \nan agreement that will work.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had the floor. I wanted----\n  Mr. KERRY. Does the Senator from Nevada yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. I wanted to ask my colleague how long he might be \nproceeding and whether he thinks there might be time, since Senator \nMcCain and Senator Smith are here, for a quick interlude to act on an \namendment that has been agreed upon and restore the floor to the \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. We should not be long. I have a few questions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4052\n\n  Mr. REID. The first question I ask my friend from Minnesota is: Would \nthe Senator think it would be appropriate to modify this sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution to provide for the opening of streets around the \nCapitol, the House office buildings and Senate office buildings and the \narteries in and out of the Capitol?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams].\n  Mr. GRAMS. I wanted to remind the Senator from Nevada, last year I \ndid make that recommendation, talking about removing barriers as well \naround the Senate office buildings that have been enclosed at the same \ntime as Pennsylvania Avenue, so I would have no objection to so move \nand make those modifications to this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. So the Senator from Minnesota feels that the proper way to \ndetermine security of the Capitol complex and the White House is on the \nfloor, without congressional hearings of any kind? Any kind of \nhearings?\n  Mr. KYL. We do have hearings that are planned for the Government \nAffairs Committee. The amendment has been cleared with Senator Stevens \nand also the chairman of the D.C. Subcommittee, Senator Cohen. Both \nhave assured me that this amendment complements their efforts regarding \nthe reopening of Pennsylvania Avenue, and they plan to hold hearings \nregarding this.\n  But I would also remind the Senator from Nevada that there were no \nhearings, there were no consultations with anybody, when Pennsylvania \nAvenue was closed because it was an imposed closure, only temporary, \nand then that has evolved into a permanent closure. Now the only option \nbeing offered is to keep it closed. We do not think that is correct \neither. So we have asked this. Again, I remind the Senator from Nevada, \nthis is only a sense of the Senate to move ahead with this.\n  Mr. REID. I hope the American public, on this interchange between the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from Nevada, would \nnot think this is how we do business all the time; that is, take \nlegislative action and then hold hearings later. It seems to me we \nshould reverse that order, hold the hearings and determine the \nlegislative action necessary.\n  I also hope there is no one of the opinion that, regarding the \nsecurity of the President and the visitors who come to the White House, \nthe people who work there, and this Capitol complex, any time the \nCapitol police or Secret Service want to make a decision, they would \nhave to have congressional approval to do so. Knowing how slowly we \nhave moved on most things around here, there would not be much action \ntaken, especially if it involved the security of the President or \npeople around the Capitol complex.\n  I ask my friend from Minnesota another question, through the Chair to \nthe distinguished Senator from Minnesota. Would the Senator consider an \namendment to the resolution that, after the word ``people,'' which is \nthe last word in the sense-of-the-Senate resolution, we add the words, \n``provided that the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secret Service \ncertify that such a plan protects the security of those who live in and \nwork in the White House''?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I have to apologize to the Senator from Nevada, I could \nnot hear him very well.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry. After the word ``people'' there would be a \ncomma or semicolon and we would say ``provided that the Secretary of \nthe Treasury and the Secret Service certify that such a plan protects \nthe security of those who live in and work in the White House.''\n  Mr. GRAMS. No, I would not accept that as a substitute for the \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator would not.\n  Mr. GRAMS. No.\n  Mr. REID. Can this Senator direct another question to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota and ask why?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Because, again, this is the same situation we are in now. \nThis decision was made arbitrarily by these individuals, and we feel \nthere should have been an open process.\n  In fact, there are laws on the books, I believe, that say before the \nFederal Government can permanently close any street in the District of \nColumbia, it has to have full consultation with the District and open \nhearings for the public. That was never done as well.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope that the decisions that were made for \nthe President's security, whether that President be a Democrat or \nRepublican, or people who work in the White House, people who visit the \nWhite House, people who are elected officials to serve in the Capitol \ncomplex, in the House and the Senate, people who work here and visit \nhere, I hope that when there is something involving security as a \nresult of terrorist threats that are picked up through intelligence \nefforts, that we certainly will not have to go through a congressional \nreview process as to whether or not they could close a road or walkway.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this vote be \ndelayed until the hour of 2:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The vote will be delayed until the hour of 2:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain].\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Massachusetts is on \nthe floor. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote on the Grams amendment has been \npostponed until 2:15, so the Senator may offer an amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4055\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the Secretary of Defense to make payment to \n  Vietnamese personnel who infiltrated into North Vietnam to perform \n       covert operations as part of OPLAN 34A or its predecessor)\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator McCain, Bob Kerrey, Bob Smith, Larry Pressler, Chuck \nRobb, Tom Daschle, and Pat Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], for himself, \n     Mr. McCain, Mr.\n\n[[Page S6439]]\n\n     Kerrey, Mr. Smith, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Robb, Mr. Daschle, and \n     Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 4055.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title VI add the following:\n\n     SEC. 643. PAYMENT TO VIETNAMESE COMMANDOS CAPTURED AND \n                   INTERNED BY NORTH VIETNAM.\n\n       (a) Payment Authorized.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall \n     make a payment to any person who demonstrates that he or she \n     was captured and incarcerated by the Democratic Republic of \n     Vietnam after having entered into the territory of the \n     Democratic Republic of Vietnam pursuant to operations \n     conducted under OPLAN 34A or its predecessor.\n       (2) No payment may be made under this Section to any \n     individual who the Secretary of Defense determines, based on \n     the available evidence, served in the Peoples Army of Vietnam \n     or who provided active assistance to the Government of the \n     Democratic Republic of Vietnam during the period 1958 through \n     1975.\n       (3) In the case of a decedent who would have been eligible \n     for a payment under this section if the decedent had lived, \n     the payment shall be made to survivors of the decedent in the \n     order in which the survivors are listed, as follows:\n       (A) To the surviving spouse.\n       (B) If there is no surviving spouse, to the surviving \n     children (including natural children and adopted children) of \n     the decedent, in equal shares.\n       (b) Amount Payable.--The amount payable to or with respect \n     to a person under this section is $40,000.\n       (c) Time Limitations.--(1) In order to be eligible for \n     payment under this section, the claimant must file his or her \n     claim with the Secretary of Defense within 18 months of the \n     effective date of the regulations implementing this Section.\n       (2) Not later than 18 months after the Secretary receives a \n     claim for payment under this section----\n       (A) the claimant's eligibility for payment of the claim \n     under subsection (a) shall be determined; and\n       (B) if the claimant is determined eligible, the claim shall \n     be paid.\n       (d) Determination and Payment of Claims.--(1) Submission \n     and Determination of Claims.

The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this is an amendment that seeks to address \nyet another painful chapter in the long legacy of painful chapters with \nrespect to Vietnam, and it specifically addresses what some might \ncharacterize as our own form of a bureaucratic Phoenix Program that \nsought to eliminate from existence a group of commandos who served \nfaithfully during the war under our organizational effort and command \neffort.\n  This amendment would reimburse this group of commandos for their \nyears of incarceration in North Vietnamese prisons while they served in \nthe mutual cause with us in the war in Vietnam.\n  What the amendment seeks to do is to authorize $20 million for \npayment to Vietnamese personnel who infiltrated into North Vietnam to \nperform covert operations during the Vietnam era and who were captured \nand incarcerated by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.\n  Under the amendment, a lump-sum payment of $40,000 would be provided \nto each claimant determined eligible by the Secretary of Defense, and I \nam pleased to say that the administration has worked very closely in \ndesigning this amendment and in signing off on it and now fully \nsupports it, as do, I believe, the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee and the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee.\n  Those of us who offer this amendment recognize that the United States \nworked with many Southeast Asian forces during the Vietnam war, but our \nintent here is to only single out for recognition the Vietnamese \ncommandos who participated in a specific program, in OPLAN 34A and its \npredecessor, and who sought under that program to infiltrate into North \nVietnam, who were captured and who were incarcerated in the process.\n  In designing guidelines for proof of eligibility for payments under \nthis amendment, the Secretary of Defense is to take into account that \nthese claimants, because of the war and the incarceration, may not have \ncomplete documentation proving eligibility. But it is our intent that \nthe standard of proof here be set low enough to do justice in this \nsituation.\n  Mr. President, 30 years ago, Vietnam presented us with a host of \nquestions and difficult contradictions, and now in this situation, we \nfind a new chapter that is a surprise for all of us. In many ways, this \nchapter is old because we have always known through the centuries that \nwar is cruel. On the other hand, it is new because, as Americans, none \nof us have ever expected that we would allow something to happen that \npurposefully or inadvertently attacks or diminishes our own sense of \nhonor.\n  The truth is that we sent heroic Vietnamese commandos into North \nVietnam to do our bidding, risking their lives and even their families' \nlives, and then we left them there, denied their existence, and walked \naway leaving them to be imprisoned, tortured or killed.\n  So we are here today simply to right a wrong, to pay for an injustice \nand to seek fairness and put this still another disturbing chapter \nabout Vietnam behind us.\n  These are the quick facts, and I will just run through them very, \nvery quickly.\n  In the early days of the war, the United States and South Vietnamese \nGovernments initiated a joint covert intelligence-gathering operation \nagainst North Vietnam, and recruited were commandos from among \nVietnamese civilians and the Armed Forces of the Army of the Republic \nof Vietnam.\n\n  The United States, through the CIA and later through the Defense \nDepartment, provided training and funding, including salaries, \nallowances, bonuses, and death benefits. Together, the United States \nand South Vietnamese officials determined where and when the commandos, \nwho were organized into teams, would be infiltrated into North Vietnam. \nMany were dropped by parachute, but some were inserted by land or sea. \nSome also conducted counterintelligence activities against North \nVietnam and against Laos.\n  ARES, the first team, was inserted in early 1961. By the early \n1970's, there were 52 teams comprising nearly 500 commandos who had \nbeen inserted behind enemy lines. Initially, the mission was confined \nto intelligence gathering, but subsequently it grew to include sabotage \nand psychological warfare.\n  From the very beginning, Mr. President, it was clear that this \noperation was a failure. Recently, declassified Defense Department \ndocuments show that the teams were killed or captured very shortly \nafter landing and that the CIA and the Defense Department, which took \nover the operation in early 1964, knew it at that time.\n  It is now apparent that the missions were compromised and that Hanoi \nran\n\n[[Page S6440]]\n\na counterespionage operation against us and our South Vietnamese ally \nby forcing our commandos to radio back the information that they, \nHanoi, wanted us to hear.\n  The preponderance of the evidence that has come to light in the last \nyear leaves little doubt that the United States Government at that time \ncontinued to insert Vietnamese commandos behind enemy lines, knowing \nfull well that it was sending them on near impossible missions with \nlittle chance of success.\n  The Defense Department then compounded this tragedy by writing off \nthe lost commandos as dead, apparently in order to avoid paying their \nmonthly salaries.\n  An example: A six-man team, called Attila, was dropped into Nghe An \nprovince on April 25, 1964. The team was immediately captured. Two \nmonths later on July 16, Radio Hanoi announced the names and addresses \nof the six team members, the dates they were captured, and the start of \ntheir trials.\n  Declassified Defense Department documents indicate that we knew the \nteam had been captured, but, nevertheless, by the beginning of 1965, \nonly months later, the Defense Department had declared the entire team \ndead and paid small death benefits to their next of kin. The process of \ndeclaring the commandos dead on paper was reaffirmed in 1969 by the \ncolonel in charge of the operations for MACSOG, the Military Assistance \nCommand Studies and Observations Group. He said:\n\n       We reduced the number of dead gradually by declaring so \n     many of them dead each month until we had written them all \n     off and removed them from the monthly payrolls.\n\n  So, Mr. President, after sending these men on these extraordinary \nmissions, after cutting off their pay, we then committed the most \negregious act of all. We made no effort to obtain their release, along \nwith the American POW's, during the peace negotiations in Paris. As a \nresult, many of these brave men, who fought alongside us for the same \ncause, spent years in prison, more than 20 years in some cases.\n  After their release from prison in the 1970's or 1980's, a number of \nthe commandos made their way to the United States. They are now seeking \nacknowledgement from our country for their service and payment from the \nU.S. Government for their period of incarceration.\n  In a lawsuit, they have asked for $2,000 a year for an average of 20 \nyears spent in captivity. We believe, those of us supporting this \namendment, that the United States owes these men a debt that can never \nbe repaid. We can at least give them the recognition that they deserve \nand the small amount of compensation that they were promised three \ndecades ago.\n  Speaking for myself, I am not here, nor do I think any of us are \nhere, to try to point fingers at people individually, nor even to find \nscapegoats or scalps. I do not think any purpose is served by that. But \nwe do want people to understand what happened 25, 30 years ago so that \nit will not happen again. We are here also to do the right thing. It is \nclearly important not to compound judgments that were wrong 25 and 30 \nyears ago with judgments that are wrong today. It would be wrong to \navoid executing our responsibility today.\n  So, Mr. President, we can honor their service and make it clear to \nthose who might join us again at any time, now or in the future, in the \nstruggle for freedom and democracy, that we are big enough in our \ncountry to admit mistakes when they are made and to move to rectify \nthem, and that while sometimes people may make mistakes, a great \ncountry will always honor and thank those who fight with us in a common \ncause.\n  Mr. President, I believe the amendment that we are offering today \nwill help to provide that recognition, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the amendment requires the Secretary of \nDefense to make payments to Vietnamese nationals who were trained and \ncommanded by the United States Government to fight behind enemy lines \nduring the war.\n  The amendment purposely creates a low standard of proof to be met by \nthe commandos, and it is our intention and hope that it be interpreted \nliberally. All that those men must prove in order to receive payment \nfor their services is that: First, they entered North Vietnam during \nthe war under an operation called OPLAN 34A or its predecessor; and \nsecond, they were captured and incarcerated by the Democratic Republic \nof Vietnam as a result.\n\n  For approximately 7 years, beginning in 1961, the United States \napparently contracted with South Vietnamese nationals to conduct covert \nmilitary operations in North Vietnam. At first under the authority of \nthe CIA and later under the authority of the Defense Department, \nhundreds of commandos were sent into North Vietnam, and more than 450 \nwere killed or captured.\n  Those captured were convicted of treason and remained in captivity \nuntil 1979, when they began to be released. At a minimum, each served \n15 years at hard labor. Many of them suffered through more than 20 \nyears of imprisonment.\n  A recently declassified study done in 1970 by the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, which oversaw the commando program, indicates that the commandos \nwere funded by DOD and that the majority of them were captured alive \nand taken prisoner by North Vietnam.\n  More recently, only weeks ago, 80 boxes of documents were discovered \nin the National Archives related to the employment of these brave men. \nThese documents, 240,000 in total, include DOD payroll rosters for the \ncommandos and records of death gratuities.\n  To address this injustice, the amendment provides the commandos with \n$20 million in back pay, approximately $40,000 each. As the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts pointed out, this amounts to about $2,000 for each \nyear each commando spent in prison. We have chosen as the number of \ncommandos the outside estimate of 500. The cost may ultimately be as \nlow as $11 million, but because the number of eligible Vietnamese \nveterans may increase as time goes by, we thought it important to give \nthe Secretary the spending authority to meet the contingency of more \nclaims.\n  The administration, until very recently, citing an 1875 Supreme Court \ncase, maintained that it had no obligation to these men because they \nwere employed under a secret contract. I am pleased to report, however, \nthe commandos now have the support of the administration. Senator Kerry \nand I and Senator Smith, Senator Robb, and other Senators have worked \nvery closely with the administration in formulating this amendment.\n  The CIA began the program, but later turned it over to the Department \nof Defense, at which time the numbers of teams and individuals sent \ninto North Vietnam approximately doubled. The late former CIA Director, \nWilliam Colby, who in 1961, as the chief of the Agency's Far Eastern \nDivision, was tasked with directing the commando program, indicated his \nsupport for the commandos' claims and specifically endorsed a \nlegislative solution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the current acting CIA Director, George Tenet, also \nsupporting a legislative solution to the problem, and in addition, a \nletter to me from John F. Sommer, Jr., Executive Director of the \nAmerican Legion, and a letter to me from Paul A. Spera, Commander in \nChief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Central Intelligence Agency,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 1996.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the Director, I welcome the \n     opportunity to provide our views with respect to an amendment \n     to provide relief to those who have come to be called the \n     ``Lost Commandos.''\n       This Administration supports an amendment recognizing the \n     hardships endured by those of the Lost Commandos who were \n     captured and incarcerated during the Vietnam War. Although \n     many of our Vietnamese allies suffered during and after the \n     war, the mission of these Commandos and the suffering they \n     have endured set them apart and make them uniquely deserving \n     of recognition. Whether or not the mission of these Commandos \n     was a mistake is not relevant to our moral obligations to \n     them now. The creed of the Central Intelligence Agency, then \n     as now, is to protect, defend, and compensate its assets for \n     the sometimes mortal risks they take on our behalf. That is \n     the\n\n[[Page S6441]]\n\n     only credible position for a secret intelligence service to \n     take if it is to win and hold the loyalty of its assets. We \n     strongly believe that, in the case of these commandos, the \n     United States Government has a similar, morally based \n     obligation.\n       Congress, not the courts, is the proper forum for the \n     recognition of such an obligation. I must note that the \n     United States Government is currently the defendant in a \n     lawsuit brought by 281 persons claiming to be among these \n     Lost Commandos. Our position is that their claims are not \n     justiciable and in fact are in the wrong forum. Accordingly, \n     the Government has filed a Motion to Dismiss. Our Motion is \n     based in major part upon the principle, first enunciated in \n     Totten v. United States, that an intelligence service cannot \n     exist if its secret assets--actual or imagined--can sue it \n     publicly for money or benefits. That principle was upheld in \n     1988 in Vu Duc Guong v. United States, an earlier suit by an \n     individual claiming to be a Lost Commando.\n       The Totten principle is vital to the ability of this Agency \n     to obtain secrets, run assets, and conduct operations without \n     the threat of blackmail of public exposure through lawsuits \n     for money. Underlying that principle is the necessity that \n     CIA administer its assets fairly and fulfill its obligations \n     meticulously. This we do. I would be pleased to provide any \n     appropriate level of detail on this point in closed session. \n     Underlying the Totten principle as well is the recognition \n     that Congress, not the courts, has oversight responsibility \n     for the conduct of our operations.\n       I regret that I am unable to provide factual information in \n     an open session to assist in the preparing of an amendment. \n     Doing so, I am advised, could jeopardize the Totten principle \n     and impede the transfer of this issue from the courts to the \n     Congress, where it belongs. Let me repeat, however, that I am \n     pleased to support legislative relief for these brave, \n     deserving men. That relief will be more than a measure of \n     their suffering: It will be a measure as well of our \n     commitment to our former allies.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  George J. Tenet,\n     Acting Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1996.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The American Legion most certainly \n     supports the amendment to provide payments to former South \n     Vietnamese Commandos or their survivors. America's obligation \n     to the commandos, who were written off by our government, \n     must be fulfilled to recognize their honorable service, their \n     commitment to the principles of freedom and their personal \n     sacrifices.\n       History has shown that the wages of war go on long after \n     the guns are silenced, the treaties are signed and the \n     parades are over. This issue warrants serious reexamination \n     of America's national policy on service personnel who are \n     prisoners-of-war and missing-in-action. If our government \n     places young men and woman in harms way, it has a moral and \n     ethical obligation for the repatriation of each and every one \n     of them. Equally as important is the fact the families of \n     these military personnel must be cared for by a grateful \n     Nation.\n       The American Legion applauds the purpose of this amendment, \n     as it reflects a good-faith effort to recognize the \n     sacrifices of our former allies. However, nothing can erase \n     this terrible chapter of the Vietnam War. We trust there are \n     lessons learned from this travesty of justice.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              John F. Sommer, Jr.,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                          Veterans of Foreign Wars\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1996.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I am writing in support of your \n     amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act seeking \n     back pay for Vietnamese commandos captured and interned by \n     the Vietnamese.\n       We believe, as you do, that these Vietnamese who performed \n     dangerous and covert operations as part of our secret war in \n     Indochina and who suffered as a consequence of these \n     operations should be recompensed for their service and \n     sacrifice.\n       For too long, these brave men, once declared dead by our \n     Government, lived in limbo, unrecognized for their \n     achievements and their hardships.\n       Now we find out that our own Government, knowing they were \n     in captivity, systematically wrote them off as dead in order \n     to avoid paying them their salaries. In good conscience, we \n     believe this was wrong and strongly support your amendment to \n     provide back pay to these brave men.\n       Please advise your colleagues in the Senate of our strong \n     support for the Kerry-McCain Amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Paul A. Spera,\n                                               Commander-in-Chief.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I point out, Mr. President, the amendment has the support \nof the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion.\n  All of the details and legalities aside, one thing is clear; these \nmen sacrificed for a cause, the same cause for which all veterans of \nthe Vietnam war sacrificed--a free Vietnam. And they suffered horribly \nfor their commitment. For many years United States immigration policy \nhas provided programs which ease the process for those Vietnamese \nassociated with the United States war effort. We do so because it is \nour obligation to our wartime allies. All that the cosponsors of this \namendment are asking is that we similarly honor the full extent of our \nobligations to the commandos and correct this gross injustice.\n  One of the commandos is quoted in Saturday's New York Times as \nsaying, ``They didn't want to remember us because we represent the \nfailure of the United States in Vietnam.'' I have always made the case \nthat as a nation, and as individuals, we must put the Vietnam war \nbehind us. To continue to deny the service of these men is not the way \nto do it.\n  I also strongly subscribe to the words of President Reagan who said \nit as succinctly and coherently as possible when he stated that: ``The \nVietnam veterans who served, served in a noble cause.'' I repeat, ``a \nnoble cause,'' as did these South Vietnamese commandos.\n  Mr. President, we send a bright signal by passing this legislation \ntoday: The United States of America lives up to its agreements with its \nfriends because it is a nation of honor and a nation of laws.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge the adoption of this amendment. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with my colleagues \nin cosponsoring this particular amendment. The case for support has \nbeen eloquently stated by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, \nthe distinguished Senator from Arizona, and could be made by others. I \nwill not repeat it.\n  I will simply say that what was done in the name of the United States \nin the instance of these particular commandos is appalling and \nunconscionable. This is clearly the right thing to do to atone for the \nactions that were taken some time ago and without the knowledge of \napparently very many people in the Government at that particular time. \nIn any event, I applaud my colleagues for taking this particular \naction.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4052\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, while I have the floor for just one moment, \nthe last amendment that was debated, and on which the yeas and nays \nhave been ordered, and which was temporarily set aside for a vote at \n2:15, I would like to just say--as I was prepared to say at that time, \nbut could not--that I am a cosponsor of that particular amendment. I \nreiterate for my colleagues, particularly on this side of the aisle who \nmay not have heard the arguments, this is simply a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution which is attempting to deal with a very difficult problem \nhere in the Nation's Capital.\n  It does not direct the President or the Secretary of the Treasury or \nthe Secret Service to do anything. It is a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that asks them, in effect, to work together to try to solve \nthe problem. I hope my colleagues will join in this case in opposing \nthe motion to table when we vote on it at 2:15.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would the Senator from Virginia yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, it is a sense of the \nSenate that the President should direct, and lists a number of people.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I respond to my friend that it is a sense of \nthe Senate. We are simply expressing the sense of the Senate that that \nis what we hope the President will do in that particular instance. It \nis not statutory. It does not require that particular action.\n  I might also say, Mr. President, when the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota initially drafted the particular piece of legislation and \nsent it to my\n\n[[Page S6442]]\n\noffice, there was some language I felt could easily be interpreted as \npartisan in nature. I did not think it was appropriate. I asked him if \nhe would be willing to make some concessions in that regard, which he \nwas kind enough to do, so we would approach it on a bipartisan basis \nand attempt to deal with the problem in a way that involved the various \nagencies of Government that have some responsibility for this \nparticular action.\n  Again, I agree wholeheartedly with my distinguished friend from \nNevada that the floor of the U.S. Senate is not the place to debate or \nmake a decision. This is simply a request to go through the kinds of \nprocedures that I think will lead to a proper decision.\n  More importantly, this is the best solution to this particular \nproblem. No one wants to place either the First Family of the United \nStates or others in particular jeopardy. I agree with the Senator from \nMinnesota that any inclusion of some of the additional street closings \nwould also be appropriate for study and consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter from the president of the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce be printed in the Record as part of that debate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1996.\n       Members of the U.S. Senate: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce--\n     the world's largest business federation, representing 215,000 \n     businesses, 3,000 state and local chambers of commerce, 1,200 \n     trade and professional associations, and 76 American chambers \n     of commerce abroad--urges your support for Senator Rod Grams' \n     resolution calling for the reopening of Pennsylvania Avenue, \n     which will appear as an amendment to the Defense \n     Appropriations Bill for FY97.\n       A little over a year ago, Pennsylvania Avenue was closed \n     between 15th and 17th Streets. The U.S. Secret Service \n     requested this action be taken following the bombing of the \n     Murah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. At the time, it was \n     said to be a temporary measure. Interestingly, two former \n     presidents--Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter--have said the \n     closure was requested during their presidencies as well, but \n     was rejected. The National Park Service has since released a \n     plan to turn the ``temporarily'' closed portion of \n     Pennsylvania Avenue into part of Lafayette Park at a cost of \n     $45 million. The U.S. Chamber does not feel this is an \n     expense that should be spent on a ``temporary solution.'' \n     Furthermore, an unfair burden of economic loss and traffic \n     congestion has been placed on the local residents of the park \n     and this city without appropriate consultation.\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been a resident of \n     historic Lafayette Park since 1924. Now with H Street a main \n     east/west thoroughfare, the northern boundary of the park has \n     been damaged. This boundary is represented by historic \n     buildings such as the Decatur House, St Johns Church, the \n     Madison House, and the Hay-Adams Hotel.\n       The closure of Pennsylvania Avenue has taken away one of \n     the main symbols of democracy and American freedom. While the \n     President's safety is of the utmost importance, according to \n     security experts the closure of Pennsylvania Avenue does not \n     make the White House complex significantly more secure. It \n     will, however, result in having one of our symbols of freedom \n     and democracy become more distant from the people. We have \n     allowed fear to dictate our actions. Returning Pennsylvania \n     Avenue to the people will restore the freedom for which it \n     stands.\n       Now, with the June 28th deadline approaching for public \n     comment on the proposed closure, we must work together to \n     give Pennsylvania Avenue back to the people. We urge you to \n     support this amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard L. Lesher.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4055\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, it is my understanding with respect to the \namendment before the Senate, there is no objection from either side. \nThe Senator from New Hampshire may wish to comment. If he does not, I \nask that the Senate proceed to take action on that amendment by voice \nvote at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. There is no objection on this side, and we have no \nobjection to voice voting. I do have a few remarks I will make. \nSubsequent to that, we can proceed to do that.\n  Prior to that, Mr. President, in regard to the previous unanimous \nconsent for a vote at 2:15, there are some Members who apparently are \ntied up at a White House meeting. I ask unanimous consent that the vote \nwhich was previously scheduled for 2:15 now occur at 2:30 today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry, the Senator from Nebraska, Senator \nKerrey, and the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, in offering this \namendment. It is an amendment that needs to be offered. It is one of \nthose very painful chapters in American history that occasionally we \nhave to deal with. It is a great tribute, I think, to America that when \nwe find a wrong, that we do have the capacity to admit that wrong and \nto right it.\n  Over 35 years ago, the United States Government asked the Republic of \nVietnam to provide some South Vietnamese military personnel for special \ncommando missions into North Vietnam. The best figures that we have, \nand there is some variation here, but approximately 350 of these \ncommandos were trained by U.S. Government agencies.\n  They were inserted into North Vietnam by our military forces, and, as \nhas already been said, they were captured by the Communist forces and \nforced to spend the next 20 to 30 years in reeducation camps. The term \n``reeducation camp'' does not really, Mr. President, accurately define \nwhat exactly these men went through. We know they were tortured. So \nreeducation is hardly the correct word.\n  For the record, Mr. President, it is clear that these commandos knew \nwhat they were doing. They knew they were taking great risks. Indeed, \nmany of their fellow comrades died during these very operations, and \nsome died after the missions while they were in North Vietnam. They \nalso knew what was at stake with the Communist aggression if we did not \ncontain the Communist aggression in Southeast Asia.\n  More importantly, the United States certainly was aware of the \ndangers involved with these missions. That is why I believe a solemn \ncommitment was made to these commandos and their families that they \nwould be compensated for the sacrifices they made.\n\n  It is interesting, these Vietnamese worked for the CIA and the United \nStates military in, basically, a doomed effort to infiltrate North \nVietnam between 1961 and 1969. They were dropped behind enemy lines by \nparachute. Some secretly swam ashore after being taken there in \nspeedboats, and then they were captured.\n  It is clear that as we stand here now, the United States has yet to \nlive up to that commitment that was made to these South Vietnamese \ncommandos in the 1960's. In point of fact, a cold and uncaring \nbureaucracy was allowed to write these men off, literally, as dead \nthree decades ago, even though there was convincing evidence that many \nhad been captured. To put it bluntly, their families were told they \nwere dead when, in fact, they were alive.\n  It is a documented historical fact that in 1969, in then secret \ntestimony before the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a DOD official stated: ``We \nreduced the number of commandos on the payroll gradually by declaring \nso many of them dead each month until we had written them all off and \nremoved them from the monthly payroll.''\n  It is really bizarre to think these kinds of things do happen in our \nGovernment, but, as I said earlier, the fact that we right these wrongs \nis perhaps a better comment about what America is like. The families \nwere paid a very small token of death gratuity, and that was it. \nKnowing these men were alive, the DOD official told the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff that we were writing them off as dead, and the widows and \nsurviving family members were paid a small stipend and then informed \nthat these people were dead when, in fact, we knew they were not.\n\n  The majority of those men had put their lives on the line for the \nUnited States' national interests. They were not Americans, but they \nput their lives on the line for America, and they were shackled in \nNorth Vietnamese prisons, and our Government knew it and our Government \nnever told the families.\n  The amendment that my colleagues are offering today, along with me, \nwill authorize back pay, very simply, for the men who participated in \nthese daring missions. It is a bit late, for sure, but it comes out to \nabout $2,000 per commando for each year spent in North Vietnamese \nprisons. It is the least we can do.\n  I note as a comparison that our distinguished colleague from Arizona \nand\n\n[[Page S6443]]\n\nmany others who were captured by the North Vietnamese and imprisoned \nand tortured, they received full pay, as they should have, during the \ntime they were in Communist activity. So there is certainly a well-\nestablished precedent for this amendment. There is nothing dramatic \nabout it. It is just the right thing to do.\n  Let me also point out after a year of fighting this case in U.S. \nclaims court, the administration has decided that granting this back \npay to these commandos is the right thing to do. I think we should give \ncredit to National Security Adviser Tony Lake, because he has been very \nsupportive and very helpful in getting this done.\n  I think that the tragedy which befell these commandos was only made \nworse by the initial attitude of the Justice Department and DOD and the \nCIA in the claims court. Again, we had to drag them kicking and \nscreaming in to right the wrong, but the wrong is righted. I commend, \nagain, Tony Lake for reversing this attitude and coming out in support \nof the amendment.\n  Finally, Mr. President, as we continue to seek answers about the fate \nof our own missing American servicemen from the Vietnam war, I think it \nis imperative for the administration to assure that each of these South \nVietnamese commandos has been interviewed for any information they \nmight possess on any missing American, dead or alive. This is very \nimportant. Some of these men have been in prison in North Vietnam for \n20 years. Who knows what they might know. They all should be debriefed \nthoroughly. This would include making arrangements to speak to all of \nthem who are reportedly still in Vietnam awaiting approval for \ndeparture to the United States.\n\n  Let me commend my colleagues, again, who served with me on the Senate \ncommittee in 1992, including the Senator from Virginia, who is here on \nthe floor, for working with me on this amendment. We were all concerned \nwhen we saw the news accounts, and we were all committed to doing \nsomething about it. We reacted quickly. I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I might say that there is no one on our side that I \nknow of who wishes to speak on the amendment. I yield to the Senator \nfrom Virginia to move the amendment.\n  Mr. ROBB. I know of no one else who has requested an opportunity to \nspeak on this amendment. I, therefore, urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4055) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROBB. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the order of business now before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Grams amendment \nhas been postponed until 2:30.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4052\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will give some general statements. We have \nbeen called upon to vote on a motion to table at 2:30 today. There \nbeing no other business here on the Senate floor, I will talk a little \nbit about that amendment and the motion to table that sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution.\n  Mr. President, it seems unusual to me that, with all the many \nproblems we have in America today--and there are significant problems--\nsuch as minimum wage, problems dealing with health care reform, \nsignificant problems dealing with the environment, we are here today \ntalking about a block of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  The loudest complaints we hear about Pennsylvania Avenue being \nblocked off for the security of the people that live in, work in, and \nvisit the White House, come from lobbyists. Most of the lobbyist \noffices are downtown, on the 18th Street corridor, down that way. It \nmakes it difficult for them to travel back and forth. It is very \ndifficult for many of them to maneuver their limousines through some of \nthe small, closely packed District of Columbia streets with the big pot \nholes. But that is not what we should be debating here.\n  We should be talking about whether or not, if someone has health \ninsurance and they leave a job, they can take it with them, or whether \nor not someone who has a son or a daughter with a preexisting \ncondition, when they graduate from college, can they still get \ninsurance someplace, or someone is injured on a job and, for whatever \nreason, loses that job and now wants to get insurance for them and \ntheir family. Under present conditions, most times they cannot do that \nbecause of preexisting condition restrictions that insurance companies \nplace on obtaining insurance. I have spoken to people in the insurance \nindustry. They are hoping that this is debated to a finality and that \nthere is a decision made.\n  So I hope the motion to table is agreed to. If it is not, there is \ngoing to be a series of amendments offered to improve the amendment \nthat is now before the body.\n  Mr. President, in the break that we have had, I went back to the \ncloakroom and received a call from the Secretary of the Treasury. The \nSecretary of the Treasury, who is head of the Secret Service, wanted me \nto inform the U.S. Senate--and these are his words, not mine--that ``It \nis imperative that that street remain blocked off.''\n  We cannot be sending a message to terrorists around the world, or to \nanyone else, that we are going to ease up on our security. I served for \nseveral terms as chairman of the Legislative Branch Appropriations \nCommittee, where we funded the Capitol Police force. We had hearings on \ntheir important duties and how they have changed as a result of \ninternational terrorism.\n  Mr. President, we all know how weaponry has changed. No one now needs \nto drive a tank next to the White House to blow it up, or on \nPennsylvania Avenue. You can have a vehicle loaded with plastic \nexplosives that would blow up the White House. This is an issue that we \nshould not be involved in.\n\n  It is difficult for me to understand, with all of the priorities we \nhave, how we can be debating for the people of Nevada whether or not a \nblock of Pennsylvania Avenue should be closed. What I would like to be \ntalking about is minimum wage, as an example. Minimum wage, as you \nknow, is not just for teenagers flipping hamburgers at McDonald's. The \nfact of the matter is that 60 percent of the people who draw minimum \nwage are women, and for 40 percent of those women, that is the only \nmoney they get for their families. That is one of the issues we should \nbe talking about.\n  There is talk that the Treasury Department decision to close \nPennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House was nothing more than a \nknee-jerk reaction to fear. Well, the fact is, it was done under very \nstrong consultation. And, also, Mr. President, what we have to \nappreciate is that the Treasury Department came to Capitol Hill and \nbriefed the leadership of both the Senate and the House, the Republican \nand Democratic leadership, and told them what they were going to do. \nThere was no objection from any of the leadership.\n  I also say that we have to understand that any Member of the U.S. \nSenate can have a briefing. If they had a briefing, I am sure they \nwould be enlightened as to how little it takes to do a lot of damage. \nFor us to stand on the Senate floor and say, well, this resolution \nreally is only a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, it does not mean \nanything, I respectfully suggest that it does mean something. The U.S. \nSenate is going on record and saying it is the sense of the Senate that \nthe President should direct the Secret Service to develop a plan for \nthe permanent reopening of vehicular traffic on Pennsylvania Avenue in \nfront of the White House. That is about as direct as you can get and \nabout as assertive as you can get. I think it is wrong that we would \neven consider doing something like that.\n  Mr. President, in fact, earlier this month, the directors of the U.S. \nSecret Service stated, the Secret Service ``remains steadfast in its \nbelief that the threat to the White House complex by explosive-laden \nvehicles is genuine, and that given an opportunity, an attack will \noccur.''\n\n[[Page S6444]]\n\n  That is about as direct as you can get, Mr. President. The Secret \nService ``remains steadfast in its belief that the threat to the White \nHouse complex by explosive-laden vehicles is genuine, and that given \nthe opportunity, an attack will occur.'' That is not some kind of \nbureaucratic jargon where you have to read between the lines. It is \ndirect and to the point.\n  The avenue in front of the White House should be closed to vehicular \ntraffic. The decision to close Pennsylvania Avenue was, in part, based \non the recommendation of the Advisory Committee of the White House \nSecurity and Review, a nonpartisan distinguished panel of experts. The \ncommittee was impaneled following several security incidents at the \nWhite House, most notable being the air crash on the south grounds.\n  Do not forget, also, colleagues and Mr. President, that the White \nHouse was sprayed with gunfire within the past year. Someone came to \nthe front of the White House and Pennsylvania Avenue and simply sprayed \nthe White House with gunfire. This was not a knee-jerk reaction. The \nrecommendation was based on a thorough technical analysis. Concerns \nabout the vulnerability of the White House were heightened by the truck \nbombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut--we all remember that--\nand confirmed by the bombings of the World Trade Center in New York and \nthe Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. It was only about 2 weeks \nafter the White House was closed and Pennsylvania Avenue was closed to \nvehicular traffic that the Federal building in Oklahoma City was \ndestroyed and 140 people were killed.\n\n  So we have heard it from the head of the Secret Service. We have \nheard it from the Secretary of the Treasury, and his words I repeat. \n``It is imperative that the area be closed.''\n  On this defense bill we are dealing with billions and billions of \ndollars of taxpayers' money that will be spent during this next year \nfor the security of this Nation, and hopefully the peace and security \nof the rest of the world--very important, weighty issues. I personally, \nrespectfully suggest that our talking about a block of Pennsylvania \nAvenue closed to vehicular traffic that has caused some inconvenience \nto lobbyists and some of the people trying to get home at night should \nnot be what we are spending our time about here. I believe we should be \ntalking about doing a better job of balancing the budget. I think we \nshould be talking about doing something about the delivery of health \ncare to the people across America. I think we should be talking about \ndoing something to make sure that we have clean air and clean water, \nand that our cities are areas where there is job growth rather than job \ndrought. We talk about the drought happening all across the United \nStates. We have had a drought of jobs. We need to get involved.\n  I do not think we should be worrying about Pennsylvania Avenue. I \nthink we should leave that to the experts. I do not believe we should \nbe micromanaging what the Secret Service says.\n  The general scheme of things, it seems to me, is that we should not \nbe concerned about a block of sidewalk when we should be talking about \nminimum wage, welfare reform, and health care reform. We could come on \nthe Senate floor and talk about some of the good things that are \nhappening. There are good things happening, too. It is not all bleak. \nIt will be the fourth year in a row where we have had declining \ndeficits--not declining enough in my mind and in the minds of others. \nBut for the fourth year in a row, we have had declining deficits.\n  For the first time since the Civil War years, we have had 4 years in \na row of declining deficits, and the lowest unemployment and the lowest \ninflation in some 40 years. Job creation: Over 9 million jobs, and 60 \npercent of them are high-wage jobs. We are doing some good things. We \nshould be talking about that rather than the sidewalk in front of the \nWhite House that is the travel route for the lobbyists in their \nlimousines.\n  If I thought in good faith that we are going to have a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution directing the President to open Pennsylvania Avenue \nto vehicular traffic, should we not at least say that we should be \nletting the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secret Service tell us \nthat it protects the people who live in the White House and who work in \nthe White House?\n  We have problems with welfare. If there is an issue that the people \nin Nevada would like to hear some conversation about here on the Senate \nfloor, it should be welfare reform. I cannot guarantee the viewing \naudience much, but I can guarantee that the viewing audience would \nrather we were talking about welfare reform than whether or not the \nstreet in front of the White House is closed.\n\n  What about Medicare? We know that Medicare is something that we \nshould be talking about here. And Medicaid we need to talk about.\n  So I hope that my colleagues will see this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution for what I respectfully suggest it is. It is something that \nwe should not be involved in. Whether or not the White House is secure \nor not cannot be decided here on the Senate floor.\n  I heard an astounding remark from the question I asked of my \ncolleague. ``Well, we are going to hold hearings later.'' Well, I have \nserved in legislative bodies for many years in my life. I believe we \nshould hold the hearings first and then do our voting later. There are \nways we can determine if, in fact, the vehicular traffic in front of \nthe White House should be cut out.\n  On this east front of the Capitol of the United States, when the \nPresiding Officer and I came to Washington, as you will remember, this \nwas a parking lot. Hundreds and hundreds of cars were parked out here. \nBecause of security threats, those cars were eliminated.\n  What are we going to do out here? We are going to build a beautiful \nmall. We are going to have a visitors center where people who come and \nwant to visit the Capitol do not have to do it in the blaring sun with \nthe humidity of the summertime in Washington or the terrible winters we \nhave here on occasion. But we will have a visitors center where people \ncan come in out of the elements and come in order into the Capitol, one \nof the most sought after places in America. That is the same thing they \nare basically going to do at the White House. As indicated, there are \ninstitutions which are now studying the best way to do that.\n  Mr. President, I hope when this matter is voted on at 2:30 that my \ncolleagues will support the motion to table. This should not be a \npartisan issue. The security of the White House and the Capitol complex \nshould not be a part of this issue. We should, on a bipartisan basis, \nvote to table this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, which I think is \nill-placed, ill-timed, and really something that we should not be \ndebating here. I believe this is something that should be done in the \nsecurity offices throughout this Government. I think the two \nintelligence committees of the House and Senate can give us all the \nvision as to why it is important that we have security.\n  I think on this defense bill we should get to the many issues that \nare now going to take up days of our time. The ranking member of the \nfull committee indicated in the meetings that we had yesterday that we \nare going to have a very hard time with the schedule that is now before \nus to complete this bill next week. I am paraphrasing what he said. But \nit is going to be almost impossible to finish this bill within the next \nday or two.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that we will join together, join hands and \ntable this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. If we do not, then the \nSenator from Nevada--and I am sure others--will offer amendments to, in \neffect, not let the U.S. Senate micromanage what the Secret Service and \nthe Capitol Police do, and put us back in the business we should be \nin--and that is legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I just want to take a couple minutes to \ntalk a little bit about the pending vote coming up and that is on the \nquestion of Pennsylvania Avenue. I know and I agree with my colleague \nfrom Nevada that there are many, many important issues before the \nSenate and that we could debate them if we had the opportunity. Many of \nthose issues have been brought to the floor, and we have never had the \nopportunity to debate those. But that does not take away from the \nquestion that we have at hand, or the issue that we are facing.\n\n[[Page S6445]]\n\n  I know there is a concern about whether there has been hearings held \nor whether we should wait for hearings. I should like to remind my \ncolleague from Nevada and others that the House has already held an \nentire day of hearings, having witnesses from all sides of this issue. \nAnd what came out of those hearings already was an overwhelming support \nfor this amendment, and that is just to ask the President to reopen \nPennsylvania Avenue.\n  Now, the committee chairman in the Senate has also said that he plans \non holding hearings, and he has told me that this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution is complementary to what he plans to do in holding these \nhearings. So this sense-of-the-Senate by no means is going to interfere \nwith gathering more information and being able to listen to the public \nand get an idea of their feelings.\n  By the way, we have a web page on the Worldwide Web asking the people \nfrom around the country. The Senator from Nevada says the people in \nNevada are not that concerned about this, but they should be. On our \nWorldwide Web, over 3,100 people have contacted our web page in just \nover 2 weeks, and the overwhelming number, nearly 85 percent--this is \npeople from around the country, not just the nearly 100 percent of the \nresidents in this area--want this street reopened but for many reasons. \nThe people around the country see the same concern, that you cannot put \na wall around freedom; you cannot give in to the terrorists by erecting \nwalls in front of the White House.\n  Now, the question was raised about whether we should or not. I do not \nthink alternatives have been fully explored. And we talk about closing \noff Pennsylvania Avenue, that it would eliminate some of the problems \nthat have already happened, such as snipers and a plane crashing into \nthe south lawn of the White House. Closing Pennsylvania Avenue would \nhave done nothing to prevent that type of activity.\n  When you talk about whose opinion is this, this is not only my \nopinion or the opinion of many others as well, but two former residents \nof the White House have come out in support of reopening Pennsylvania \nAvenue. Former President Jimmy Carter said closing the avenue was a \nmistake. Every President since John F. Kennedy has been given the same \nbriefings by the Secret Service with their same reasoning for closing \noff Pennsylvania Avenue, to provide more protection to the President, \nbut each one of those Presidents--John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, \nRichard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George Bush--\nhas said no, after hearing those same briefings from the same Secret \nService with those same reasons. They have all said not on my watch, we \nare not closing what Thomas Jefferson called America's Main Street.\n\n  Now, this is not Tiananmen Square. Is not Red Square. We cannot wait \nfor the Park Service to put in $40 million worth of mall before we make \nsome kind of a decision, or at least ask the President to reconsider. \nAre we going to spend $40 million, are we going to allow the Park \nService to railroad this through, to impose this edict as they have not \nonly on the District of Columbia but the entire country as well and we \nare going to stand back and say, well, go ahead, spend $40 million and \nmake a park out of this and then what, tear it up? There are a lot of \nthings that are done when you have a bureaucracy with a right hand that \ndoes not know what the left hand is doing.\n  I just think this is not out of order. I think this is complementary \nto the process that is going forward, that we should at least ask the \nPresident and the Secret Service and the Treasury to open hearings on \nthis to the public. Let the public voice their concerns. They have not \ndone that. The only comments they are taking now are, what kind of park \ndo you want? That is not a very good alternative.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Yes.\n  Mr. FORD. On the Worldwide Web the Senator is talking about, that you \ngot 1,300 responses, and so forth, did they respond to your explanation \nof Pennsylvania Avenue or were they responding to the Secret Service's \nexplanation of closing it?\n  Mr. GRAMS. We have posed the question of what has happened and what \ncan be done, and their response has been by 83.9 percent to reopen \nPennsylvania Avenue.\n  Mr. FORD. So, Mr. President it has been the response of what you put \non the web not what the Secret Service put on the web and therefore is \na political grandstand.\n  Mr. GRAMS. No, Mr. President, it is not. The only response that the \nPark Service is taking is something they believe is their grandstand, \nand that is to say, what kind of park do you want? They are not opening \ntheir web page. They are not opening their comment period to any \nindividual to voice their opinion, only to comment on the Park Service \nopinion.\n  Now, I do not think that is very democratic. I do not think that is \nan open process. In other words, I think the decision has been made on \ntheir part and they are going to drive it no matter what it takes. They \nare not asking people whether it should be opened or reopened. They are \njust saying, well, we are going to do this and what color do you want \nit.\n  I do not think that is fair either. All we are asking is to give this \nsome open air. Let the people decide. Have some public input. In fact, \nthat is the way the process should have worked. And the only reason \npeople allowed the street to be closed to begin with without raising an \nuproar is because it was posed to them as a temporary closure of \nPennsylvania Avenue in the wake of Oklahoma City, and then they were \ngoing to determine what would be the best course of action in the \nfuture.\n  Well, there have been no talks. There has been no discussion, no \npublic hearings or anything. So I am not trying to say that the Secret \nService is not well intended, and they are taking this job of theirs \nvery seriously. But again, they have used the same arguments for the \nlast 35 years and not one President in that period of time has taken \nthose arguments and said, yes, I need this additional security to \nprotect myself.\n\n  I think they provide adequate security for the President. I think \nthey have done a great job. I think right now this President decided \nthat he would listen to the arguments, and that is fine--on a temporary \nbasis. But we should have an opportunity, before it is permanently \nclosed and before this is done, for the people to have a chance to make \nthat decision. Again, the decision to close it a year ago might have \nbeen prudent, on a temporary basis, until we could stand back, look at \nit, look at the alternatives to see how we can, first and foremost, \nkeep the avenue open and then provide absolute security.\n  Closing Pennsylvania Avenue is not going to remove 100 percent of the \nrisks. This is a democracy. We have risks every day. And there are \nmany, many other opportunities. This is a President who likes to jog up \nand down The Mall. He wants to be near the public. I do not know why \nclosing Pennsylvania Avenue is the only alternative.\n  So I urge my colleagues when they come to the floor to at least \nconsider that. Give democracy a chance to work a little bit. Get some \ninput and have hearings. And I think if you listened to the hearings \nthat were held in the House just last week, all the comments that were \nmade, the vast, vast majority of the people who were there supported \nreopening Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  Now, you might say, well, it does not matter much here, and the \npeople in Nevada might not care, but I would pose it, in my city of \nMinneapolis-St. Paul, if we would close one of our major streets such \nas Hennepin Avenue, what would that do to the downtown. I think you \nwould have a lot of complaints. And in Las Vegas, if you closed off the \nstrip because of possible dangers to some of the people there, I do not \nthink you would be able to go for a couple minutes without hearing an \noutcry from the businesses and public in general.\n  So to impose this on a main street, America's main street, and a \nvital artery in one of the major cities in the world and to say it will \nhave no impact, I do not think is logical.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues when they come to the floor to take that \ninto consideration, and I hope they vote to override the motion to \ntable and give us a chance to have a vote on this.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S6446]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Las Vegas Strip, as important as it is, \nis not the center of Government of this country. The White House and \nthe Capitol complex is. I would also say to people within the sound of \nmy voice, in the statement of Director Bowron of the U.S. Secret \nService, about a week ago, June 7, in a House committee he testified:\n\n       The Secret Service also identified a need to quantify the \n     vulnerability of the complex to explosive detonations outside \n     the perimeter. Southwest Research Institute, one of the \n     oldest and largest independent, nonprofit research \n     organizations in the United States, was selected to conduct \n     this classified study. Their methodology involved obtaining \n     structural data on the White House and selecting likely \n     explosive detonation points on the streets surrounding the \n     complex.\n\n  The Director went on to explain how you can use fertilizer to blow up \nhuge buildings, like they did the building in Oklahoma City. He went on \nto say:\n\n       The Secret Service is committed to the use of technology in \n     furtherance of our protective and investigative missions. \n     Alternatives to closing Pennsylvania Avenue were examined \n     without success.\n\n  It is not that they walked in and said, ``We are going to close \nPennsylvania Avenue.'' The President did not want Pennsylvania Avenue \nclosed. He told me and told many others that. The advisory committee \nrequired full explanations of all the possible options and why the \noptions would not work before they concurred that the avenue should be \nclosed. The panel had concluded that the closing was justified, even \nbefore the bombing in Oklahoma City. Their decision was made before \nthat bombing. It was not a knee-jerk reaction to Oklahoma City. The \nbombing occurred after Pennsylvania Avenue was closed--I should say a \nportion of it. The Director went on to say:\n\n       Although specific intelligence information cannot be \n     discussed in an open forum, it is known that members of \n     certain foreign and domestic terrorist groups operate within \n     the United States. Those terrorist and extremist groups have \n     demonstrated a propensity for mounting their attacks to \n     coincide with symbolic dates or at symbolic targets. The \n     White House is one of the most symbolic targets in the United \n     States. There is every reason to believe that given the \n     opportunity, these groups will strike. This matter does not \n     only concern the protection of the President and other \n     government officials and a national landmark--it is a \n     tremendous public safety issue with respect to individuals in \n     and around the complex. Devices similar to those used at the \n     World Trade Center and in Oklahoma City can cause destruction \n     as much as five blocks away from the target. The fact of the \n     matter is--the people who would undertake that type of act \n     are present in this country. The means and ability to carry \n     out this type of act are available. The only thing that is \n     preventing the terrorist or extremist from mounting an attack \n     is the lack of access. If you open Pennsylvania Avenue--they \n     can, and at some point, they will destroy the White House.\n\n  If we have people around the country who are burning churches, do you \nthink there is not someone going to try to blow up the White House? \nThey have already tried to blow up the White House. We know that. We \ntalk about our Government being open and free. You still have access to \nthe White House. You just do not have the traffic jam in front of it, \nmostly taxicabs and lobbyists. That is all you eliminate. And you make \nit inconvenient because some of the other streets are a little more \ncrowded.\n  But this is going to make the White House, in the opinion of most, \nbetter. It is going to be a nice mall, park out there. The Park Service \nis working on it now. Just the same as we are going to do out here at \nthe east front of the Capitol. We are going to remove the asphalt. We \nare trying to raise the money. It is a private-public partnership.\n  I just have to say access to the White House is not harmed in any \nway. I spoke to Secretary Rubin within the past hour. These are his \nwords, not mine: ``It is an imperative that that short piece of \nPennsylvania Avenue be closed.'' What are we doing here today? We are \nbeing asked to vote to open Pennsylvania Avenue without a congressional \nhearing. Remember, the Secret Service, the Treasury Department came up \nhere and briefed us all, they briefed all the leadership, Republican \nand Democrat, House, Senate, said they were going to close it. There \nwas not a single objection.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this amendment bothers me and many of my \ncolleagues very much. As my friend from Nevada has said, we were \nbriefed. After that briefing, there was no objection whatsoever. Now we \nwant, without any other consideration--many of us not having had the \nopportunity to hear the briefing--to vote to open up Pennsylvania \nAvenue. I think it has been important that, in the years that I have \nbeen here and when we have had to make hard decisions, we err on the \nside of safety. I do not want any of those living or working in the \nWhite House to be exposed.\n  There are a lot of things the Secret Service has told us that cannot \nbe public. The Senator from Minnesota knows that. He will not reveal \nthat because he cannot. One of the reasons that Pennsylvania Avenue was \nclosed was because of that unavailable information.\n  If you want to take the blood on your hands and say, ``We want to \nopen up that 800 feet of pavement up there,'' and something occurs \nafter that, then you are not going to do it with my vote. I want the \nsafety of the First Family. I want the lives of those people who work \nthere day and night to be as safe as possible.\n  I do not understand what is going on here. I really do not understand \nit. Oh, I can go back in history. I can quote Henry Clay. I can do lots \nof things. But today is today, not history. Today we have the problems. \nToday we have terrorists operating in this country. They will tell you \nthat much. I have been there when we had to put out agents in many of \nthe ports, waterways, and airways to check on people departing other \nparts of the world.\n  To say we want to take an opportunity here this afternoon to possibly \neliminate the safety of the First Family? If President Bush had been \nreelected and he made this decision, the Senator from Minnesota would \nnot be standing. He would not be standing making this effort today. It \nis because another President is in the White House he is making this \ndecision. This is grandstanding.\n\n  I read the articles in Minnesota. They say he is more interested in \n800 feet of pavement in Washington, DC, than he is the big issues of \nMinnesota. That is in his papers. I just paraphrase it. But why do we \nwant to possibly jeopardize the lives of the people that are running \nthis country? That is No. 1. I suspect, if those people who had \nanswered him on the web had the ability to listen to the Secret Service \nand their briefing of the leadership of this Senate, they would change \ntheir minds. So I encourage my colleagues not to vote for this. Let us \nhave another briefing. Let us try to do the right thing. Let us not \nexpose people, particularly the President and his family and those who \nhave the responsibility of leading this country.\n  So, Mr. President, I am hopeful the Senator will be kind enough to \nwithdraw this amendment and let us sit down and try to understand the \nproblems that are there. You cannot tell the American people all the \nproblems that were given to us by the Secret Service. There are a lot \nof things you just do not do. And the decision was made based on that.\n  I am one who believes, after you weigh the facts, you err on the side \nof safety. So I believe the right vote here today is to table the \namendment of the Senator from Minnesota and let us have an opportunity, \nif there is a need for it, to have more scrutiny, more input, and do \nthe right thing.\n  I was there yesterday afternoon, along with leadership from both \nsides.\n  I did not see anybody protesting. I did not see anybody walking up \nand down Pennsylvania Avenue with signs saying, ``Open this street.'' I \nsaw people enjoying it, walking back and forth across the street, \nlooking at the White House, not being interfered with at all, did not \nhave to worry about the traffic, were enjoying the park. I thought it \nwas a right congenial group. There was no one there protesting the \nclosing of Pennsylvania Avenue, and they were there from all across \nthis great land of ours and foreign countries.\n  So, Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to table this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of 2:30 p.m. having arrived, by \nprevious agreement, the motion to table the Grams amendment is subject \nto a vote. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n\n[[Page S6447]]\n\n The question is on agreeing to the motion to lay on the table the \nGrams amendment. Those in favor of tabling the Grams amendment will \nvote ``aye; those opposed will vote ``no.'' The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The Grams amendment is still the pending \nbusiness before the Senate.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4056 to Amendment No. 4052\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4056 to amendment 4052.\n       At the end of the amendment add the following: ``Provided, \n     That the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secret Service \n     certify that the plan protects the security of the people who \n     live and work in the White House.''\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this amendment to the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution now pending would state simply that prior to opening the \nstreet to vehicular traffic, the Secretary of the Treasury and the \nSecret Service would certify that the plan protects the security of the \npeople who live and work in the White House.\n  It seems to me if we are not willing to adopt this amendment, then \nthis body will go on record saying that there should be vehicular \ntraffic on Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House, whether the \npeople who live and work there are safe or not. I do not think we \nshould go on record stating that.\n  As I indicated, Mr. President, the record is clear that the Secret \nService is very concerned about opening this avenue in front of the \nWhite House. The Secret Service has said closing the avenue was not a \nunilateral Secret Service decision, but rather was the recommendation \nof the Advisory Committee to the White House Security Review, a \nnonpartisan distinguished panel of experts. This committee included \nformer directors of both the FBI and the CIA, former chairmen of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, and others. The proposal to close the avenue was \nmade before the Oklahoma City bombing. The panel had concluded, prior \nto Oklahoma City, that closing of the avenue was, indeed, justified.\n  Historically, people focus on security features after significant \nevents. For example, ValuJet Airlines. Now we hear a lot about oxygen \ncanisters in cargo holds. It is better we do something before. That is, \nin effect, what we did at the White House. The Treasury Department \nsaid, as previously stated on the record here, that there are \nterrorists who simply are waiting around for an opportunity to blow up \nthe symbol of the American people.\n  Mr. President, during the last vote, some people told me, ``Well, \npeople can walk in and blow up the White House.'' Not true. We are told \nthat you need the trunk of a car to put the explosives in. You cannot \nput enough explosives on a bicycle or on the back of a skateboard or \nwhatever gets in there now. You need a vehicle. You need access to a \nlarge area to blow up the White House. But if you did have the trunk \nfull of explosives, and they simply pulled up in front on Pennsylvania \nAvenue, you would damage and destroy the White House.\n  What this amendment does is ask the Secret Service to certify that \nthe plan protects the security of the people who live in and work in \nthe White House. That does not seem like that is too outlandish. There \nhave been many alternatives considered and suggested, but the options \nhave simply been deemed unworkable. The panel required full explanation \nof all possible alternatives and why these would not work before \nconcurring to close the avenue. Closing the avenue was something that \nwas done as a last resort. In addition, physical barriers such as walls \nand berms were not viable for a number of obvious reasons.\n  Mr. President, in the last 4 years, studies have revealed that 45 \npercent of terrorist incidents have included the use of explosives. \nWhat greater symbol is there in the United States than the White House? \nI guess the second greatest symbol would be the Capitol complex here. \nFor terrorists, vengeance is a motive, and the White House is a \nsymbolic target.\n  The means are available to attack the White House if the avenue \nremains open. It does not have to be a sophisticated apparatus. An \nabundance of explosive materials is available to the public with an \nease of delivery and destruction of a target. You need a vehicle to do \nit. In fact, the World Trade Center conspirators were convicted of \nconspiracy to blow up symbolic targets. Not only the World Trade \nCenter, which they blew up, but the Holland Tunnel and the FBI office \nin New York.\n  To illustrate the effect of an incident to the American people, 33 \nyears after President Kennedy was assassinated, this country continues \nto deal with the ramifications from that incident. It is impossible to \nhave a public debate on the issues prior to the closure of the avenue. \nThis would have created a window of opportunity. Therefore, the \ninformation was held to a small group of people. In fact, since closure \nof Pennsylvania Avenue, more information is available than the Secret \nService would like with respect to the vulnerability of the White \nHouse.\n  In recent years, other official residences of heads of State have \nclosed off vehicular traffic in proximity to their facilities. We know \nthat canines remain the best source of explosive detection. We are not \ntalking about a perceived threat, Mr. President. The threat is a real \nthreat. I repeat again, the Secretary of the Treasury said within the \nlast hour and a half that it is imperative that area remain blocked \noff.\n  There are terrorists here in this country, and it is everyone's \nresponsibility to limit the opportunity for them to carry out their \nevil acts. The closing of Pennsylvania Avenue contains a real public \nsafety issue. If you provide access to the target, then you are \nendangering the public and both those who work in and around the White \nHouse.\n  Mr. President, I do not think we should consider this giving in to \nterrorists because we blocked off Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  I do not think we should consider it a victory for terrorists because \nwe have closed off Pennsylvania Avenue. Rolling up the White House \nwould be a victory for the terrorists, not limiting their access to it. \nIf this is perceived as giving in to terrorism, then what about people \nat night when they lock their doors before they go to sleep? Are they \ngiving into the unlawful elements of our society? When you leave your \nhome to go shopping or go to work and you lock your door, are you \ngiving in to the unlawful elements of your community?\n  I think, Mr. President, that we should not allow the sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution to be adopted, unless we put this simple amendment on \nit, saying let us at least have the Secret Service certify that it is \nsafe, whatever\n\n[[Page S6448]]\n\nplan we come up with, whether it is vehicular traffic or otherwise.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I want to back the statement of the Senator \nfrom Nevada. There has been no committee hearing on this. This bill is \npending before the Governmental Affairs Committee. We have not had the \nhearing, we have not had the Secret Service people up, and we have not \nhad testimony on what the danger is. Much of it, as I understand it, is \nclassified. So we can have closed hearings, and everybody would know \nthen what we are doing.\n  If we want to be this cavalier about how we are treating people at \nthe White House, let us take all the flower pots out that protect the \nCapitol here, which prevent vehicular traffic here; let us take them \nout. I was amazed to find out that L'Enfant and George Washington did \nnot somehow think it was nice to have a Capitol like this. But George \nWashington and L'Enfant did not have to deal with things like the \nOklahoma bombing, the Unabomber, and everything else.\n  We have not had the first hearing on this, and here we are voting to \ntake this off from in front of the White House after danger has been \nassessed, and it is done by a bipartisan group--Coleman and Webster \nwere both on that. We are so cavalier about the White House, why do we \nnot include this and have a second-degree amendment and take off all \nthe protection all over the Nation's Capital, including at the Capitol \nright here--if we are so brave about this. Let people pull their vans \nup beside the Russell Building, which is blocked off, and behind the \nHart Building, where my office happens to be.\n  We have very good reasons for thinking some of these protections are \nnecessary and so does the White House. I think this vote was \nridiculous. If we are going to take it off at the White House, take it \noff here and let us face the same danger together. Otherwise, let us \nagree with the people that have made this assessment, who were on this \nreview committee, and say, yes, we need to assess this very carefully. \nWe are about to do, with legislation, here what we should not be doing \nunless we have a very thorough hearing and understanding of the White \nHouse personnel.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the measure of the \nSenator from Nevada. I would like to put it in a certain context. The \nfirst thing to know, if we are talking about our original plans, is \nthat the L'Enfant plan connects what was termed the ``Congress' House'' \nwith the ``President's House,'' at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue. \nIt is the center of the plan. It is in a sense a diagram of the \nConstitution--the separation of powers in a unified Government.\n  Pennsylvania Avenue, in that original plan, comes to the Capitol \nGrounds, stops at the west end, and then resumes at the east end. That \nis the present arrangement on Capitol Hill. The identical arrangement \nwas to be found at the west end of the avenue. The avenue moved up to \nthe Presidential grounds, then stopped and resumed further west. That \nwas before the Treasury Building was built, and before any roads were \nbuilt. The city, at that point, was still very much a marshland, with \nthis magnificent plan still to be realized.\n  I have been working for 35 years on the redevelopment of Pennsylvania \nAvenue, from the time President Kennedy, in his inaugural parade, \nlooked to his left and to his right, south and north, at the avenue and \nfound it was being abandoned. The center of the city, as the center of \nmany cities, was just falling down. The city was moving out Wisconsin \nAvenue, out Connecticut Avenue. The Federal triangle was unfinished on \nthe south side, which had begun under Andrew Mellon and President \nHoover, following the McMillan plan of 1900, which gave us Union \nStation. It got the railroads off The Mall, for example. To the north, \nthe Avenue was all but abandoned--two- and three-story buildings were \nempty, except for the occasional storefront selling firecrackers.\n  President Kennedy proposed redevelopment of the avenue. A commission \nwas established. Nathaniel Owings was Chairman. Presidents Johnson, \nNixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, and now President Clinton, have \nworked on it with great care. We are just about completed. The Ronald \nReagan Building, now three-quarters completed, will finish the Federal \ntriangle. That site, sir, was cleared in 1928. So you cannot say we \nhave been in any great rush to do this. And now just as we finish the \nroute to the White House, we have this security problem.\n  I say to my friend from Nevada that President Clinton did a fine \nthing in establishing a committee headed by Roger Kennedy, who is the \nDirector of the Park Service, an architectural historian of great \ntalent. His works are incomparably intelligent. Orders From France, is \nbut one example.\n  The committee has come up with a plan, which would extend the park \nnorthward in the manner envisioned by L'Enfant. But it need not be a \nbarrier to the movement of people and vehicles along the avenue. An \nunderpass could be completed that would serve this purpose. It is just \nso important that we not define ourselves as a beleaguered, besieged \nnation. Suggestion has been made by the ranking member of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, the distinguished Senator from Ohio, \nthat we get rid of the pots and barriers around the Capitol. Fine. We \ncould extend the Capitol park down the western side of the Russell \nOffice Building, add to that whole park complex, do everything that is \ndesired, without putting up what look like emergency barriers.\n\n  That is not the message we want to send to ourselves and to the \nworld. We can also do what is necessary for security at the White House \nwithout declaring us to be a nation under siege. We are not, and we \nshould not say so. We are the most powerful nation on Earth. With \nequanimity and care we can take care of these difficulties. I hope we \ndo.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator leaves the floor, Mr. President, through \nyou to the distinguished Senator from New York, I want the Record to be \nspread with the fact that because of his diligent work--I do not know \nof anyone who is more responsible for driving down Pennsylvania Avenue \ntoday and seeing beautiful buildings and structures. The Pennsylvania \nAvenue Development Corporation in itself was a work of art.\n  One of the first things I did upon coming here on the Appropriations \nCommittee was sit in on occasion for the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia and conduct those hearings on the Pennsylvania \nAvenue Development Corporation and listen to the enthusiasm of the \npeople on that corporation and what they were going to do. Now you \ndrive down the street, and it has been done.\n  I further want the Record to be spread with the fact that I serve on \nthe Public Works Committee with the distinguished senior Senator from \nNew York. I can remember when we legislated a building on that ugly \nFederal triangle, a blank piece of dirt that was there. Now you drive \nby there and you see the thriving work that is there and that building \nwhich will add to the beauty of our Nation's Capital.\n  So I appreciate the Senator and what the Senator from New York said. \nBut I also want to make sure to say some things that the Senator could \nnot say for himself. But for him, we may still be where we were when \nPresident Kennedy had his inaugural parade. It is a beautiful parkway.\n  I also will read something that I think the Senator from New York \nwould agree with. This is from a tour magazine which people get when \nthey come to the Nation's Capital. L'Enfant had hoped that the grass \n``* * * would serve as an extension of the White House grounds.''\n  So the original vision of L'Enfant was to have that whole area as an \nadditional containment of the White House. Jefferson decided that was \nnot the thing to do at the time.\n  But I just want to make sure that the Senator from New York knows and \nappreciates that the people will know, when the history books are \nwritten, about the work which he has done to make this city beautiful \nas the Nation's Capital.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am very grateful to the Senator from \nNevada.\n\n[[Page S6449]]\n\n  Might I close with just one line? In President Kennedy's proposal for \nthe redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue, which we are talking about, \nhe said the avenue ``should be lively, friendly, and inviting, as well \nas dignified and impressive.''\n  I think we can achieve that in the immediate environs of the White \nHouse. It is just the next challenge. Let us go forward and do it in \ngood spirit and unity.\n  I thank again the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator from \nNevada has a second-degree amendment now pending. Is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I received word, I say to my friend, the ranking \nmember, from one of the managers of this bill. I understand from what \nthe note said that they will accept the amendment.\n  Mr. NUNN. I believe we are willing to accept the amendment on both \nsides who favor the original amendment. So I would suggest that the \nSenator might call the question on this amendment, and we can move on.\n  I hope on Senator Bingaman's amendment on ASAT, we can get a time \nagreement, if that is satisfactory to the Senator from South Carolina. \nThen it is my understanding that Senator Murray has an amendment on \nabortion in overseas hospitals. If we can get a time agreement on both \nof those, I believe we can move both of those along in the next couple \nof hours. I would like Senator Bingaman to be notified that we are \nprepared to take up his amendment on ASAT and also enter into a time \nagreement that is satisfactory to him.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, as the Senator from Georgia just indicated, \nthose of us who are cosponsoring the amendment are entirely prepared to \naccept the language proposed by the distinguished Senator from Nevada. \nIndeed, the language is entirely consistent with the intent of the \nsponsors of this particular amendment. At the conclusion of the \nconsideration of this amendment, I am going to propose a motion to \nchange one word in the amendment, and then I hope we will be able to \ntake up the matter on final passage. But the language that the Senator \nfrom Nevada has suggested is not only consistent but entirely \nappropriate. I fully support it. I believe the distinguished Senator \nfrom Minnesota shares that same opinion.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I wanted to concur with what the Senator \nfrom Virginia said. Without objection, we are willing to accept the \nsecond-degree amendment of the Senator from Nevada. We would like to go \nahead with a voice vote on that.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am willing to lend my encouragement \nto end this debate. But I do not want to close it without a brief \nstatement. I have an amendment that I was about to send to the desk \nthat said, if we think that we can expose the White House with the \ninfrastructure and the President of the United States and the people \nwho work in the facility to passersby, then I think we should do the \nsame thing out here on the Capitol Grounds. I think we ought to say \nthat no life here is worth more than a life there and nothing that goes \non here is more important than what goes on in the White House in the \nexecutive offices of this country. I am willing to forgo it. But, Mr. \nPresident, I want to make the point, before we close the debate as far \nas this Senator is concerned, that ``do unto others'' is not an \nadmonition that ought to pass by here. I think we ought to treat this \nfacility no differently than we treat the White House.\n  If we are going to open up that street, I assure you that I will be \nhere with an amendment that says open up the whole plaza here. Let of \nthe traffic come through. Let them park cars, vans, whatever they \nchoose. Let them park at the Hart, Dirksen and the Russell Buildings. I \nlove this picture that says for the American people we are going to \nprotect the Capitol, protect the Senators, and protect the Congressmen, \nbut the President, let him beware.\n  That is the conclusion of my remarks. Mr. President, I congratulate \nthe Senator from Nevada for his amendment to this proposition. Thank \nyou.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the second-degree amendment \nof the Senator from Nevada.\n  The amendment (No. 4056) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROBB. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n              Amendment No. 4052, As Amended, As Modified\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, the amendment was never designed to be \npartisan nor to attack, certainly, the President. I would never have \nbeen a part of it. It was designed to try to clarify something that has \nbeen very troubling to many of the people who are directly involved, \nboth for symbolic reasons as well as for practical reasons, in terms of \nthe traffic flow of the Nation's Capital. I have lived in and around \nthis area for 40 of my 57 years, or most of the last 40 of my 57 years. \nI am quite familiar with the traffic patterns and the inconvenience to \nthose who have to traffic the area every day. I am very conscious of \nthe symbolism of our Nation's Capital, and particularly the President's \nhouse.\n  I have discussed with the chief sponsor of the amendment the changing \nof one word that I think might make our intention even clearer. That \nwould be to substitute the word ``request'' for the word ``direct'' \nwhich is contained on page 3, line 18. It would then read that it is \nthe sense of the Senate that the President should request the \nDepartment of the Treasury and the Secret Service to work with the \ngovernment of the District of Columbia to develop, et cetera.\n  I think there have been connotations that this is attempting to \nmicromanage, or to take action that would be inappropriate. I fully \nrespect those who have spoken and those who have concerns. It ought to \nbe considered appropriately by the committees of jurisdiction. But we \nneed to have a resolution of this question.\n  I applaud the Senator from Minnesota for bringing the question to our \nattention.\n  I move, Mr. President, to strike the word ``direct'' and insert the \nword ``request'' on line 18, page 3.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to modifying the amendment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I shall \nnot object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I shall not object. I would like to make an observation. \nI would like to wait until other Senators have spoken.\n  What is the parliamentary situation at the moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A unanimous-consent request is pending to \nmodify the existing amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me just make a very brief remark reserving my right \nto object, if I might, which is this: I am going to support this \namendment. I am glad there is agreement. But I really wonder sometimes \nwhere I am around here, if this is the city council or if this is the \nSenate of the United States of America.\n  I think it is very important that we address the issue of security \nfor the President. We are in this amendment. And that we look at how we \ncan make Pennsylvania Avenue work. But I have to say, Mr. President, \nand the reason I reserve my right to object, it is awfully frustrating \nto someone who would like to see us raise the minimum wage and to \nsomeone who would like to see us get to the issue of health care that \nwe are on the defense bill and we are talking about Pennsylvania \nAvenue. With all due respect, I would not object at this time, but I do \nhope we can move forward and get on with this bill and others to make \nlife better for people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6450]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the modification is made.\n  The amendment, as amended, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1791, President George Washington commissioned \n     Pierre Charles L'Enfant to draft a blueprint for America's \n     new capital city; they envisioned Pennsylvania Avenue as a \n     bold, ceremonial boulevard physically linking the U.S. \n     Capitol building and the White House, and symbolically the \n     Legislative and Executive branches of government.\n       (2) An integral element of the District of Columbia, \n     Pennsylvania Avenue stood for 195 years as a vital, working, \n     unbroken roadway, elevating it into a place of national \n     importance as ``America's Main Street''.\n       (3) 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the White House, has become \n     America's most recognized address and a primary destination \n     of visitors to the Nation's Capital; ``the People's House'' \n     is host to 5,000 tourists daily, and 15,000,000 annually.\n       (4) As home to the President, and given its prominent \n     location on Pennsylvania Avenue and its proximity to the \n     People, the White House has become a powerful symbol of \n     freedom, openness, and an individual's access to their \n     government.\n       (5) On May 20, 1995, citing possible security risks from \n     vehicles transporting terrorist bombs, President Clinton \n     ordered the Secret Service, in conjunction with the \n     Department of the Treasury, to close Pennsylvania Avenue to \n     vehicular traffic for two blocks in front of the White House.\n       (6) While the security of the President and visitors to the \n     White House is of grave concern and is not to be taken \n     lightly, the need to assure the President's safety must be \n     balanced with the expectation of freedom inherent in a \n     democracy; the present situation is tilted too heavily toward \n     security at freedom's expense.\n       (7) By impeding access and imposing undue hardships upon \n     tourists, residents of the District, commuters, and local \n     business owners and their customers, the closure of \n     Pennsylvania Avenue, undertaken without the counsel of the \n     government of the District of Columbia, has replaced the \n     former openness of the area surrounding the White House with \n     barricades, additional security checkpoints, and an \n     atmosphere of fear and distrust.\n       (8) In the year following the closure of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue, the taxpayers have borne a significant burden for \n     additional security measures along the Avenue near the White \n     House.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the President should request the Department of the \n     Treasury and the Secret Service to work with the Government \n     of the District of Columbia to develop a plan for the \n     permanent reopening to vehicular traffic of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue in front of the White House in order to restore the \n     Avenue to its original state and return it to the people.\n       At the end of the amendment add the following: Provided, \n     That the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secret Service \n     certify that the plan protects the security of the people who \n     live and work in the White House.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is on agreeing to the \namendment of the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from Virginia.\n  The amendment (No. 4052), as amended, as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4057\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the United States-\n      Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement should be renegotiated)\n\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Kyl \namendment and the pending committee amendments be laid aside for the \npurpose of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig], for himself, Mr. \n     Bingaman, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Burns, Mr. Dorgan, \n     Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Levin, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \n     Murkowski, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Cohen, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4057.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle F of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING THE UNITED STATES-JAPAN \n                   SEMICONDUCTOR TRADE AGREEMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States and Japan share a long and important \n     bilateral relationship which serves as an anchor of peace and \n     stability in the Asia Pacific region, an alliance which was \n     reaffirmed at the recent summit meeting between President \n     Clinton and Prime Minister Hashimoto in Tokyo.\n       (2) The Japanese economy has experienced difficulty over \n     the past few years, demonstrating that it is no longer \n     possible for Japan, the world's second largest economy, to \n     use exports as the sole engine of economic growth, but that \n     the Government of Japan must promote deregulation of its \n     domestic economy in order to increase economic growth.\n       (3) Deregulation of the Japanese economy requires \n     government attention to the removal of barriers to imports of \n     manufactured goods.\n       (4) The United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement \n     has begun the process of deregulation in the semiconductor \n     sector and is opening the Japanese market to competitive \n     foreign products.\n       (5) The United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement \n     has put in place both government-to-government and industry-\n     to-industry mechanisms which have played a vital role in \n     allowing cooperation to replace conflict in this important \n     high technology sector.\n       (6) The mechanisms include joint calculation of foreign \n     market share, deterrence of dumping, and promotion of \n     industrial cooperation in the design of foreign semiconductor \n     devices.\n       (7) Because of these actions under the United States-Japan \n     Semiconductor Trade Agreement, the United States and Japan \n     today enjoy trade in semiconductors which is mutually \n     beneficial, harmonious, and free from the friction that once \n     characterized the semiconductor industry.\n       (8) Because of structural barriers in Japan, a gap still \n     remains between the share of the world market for \n     semiconductor products outside Japan that the United States \n     and other foreign semiconductor sources are able to capture \n     through competitiveness and the share of the Japanese \n     semiconductor market that the United States and those other \n     sources are able to capture through competitiveness, and that \n     gap is consistent across the full range of semiconductor \n     products as well as a full range of end-use applications.\n       (9) The competitiveness and health of the United States \n     semiconductor industry is of critical importance to the \n     overall economic well-being and high technology defense \n     capabilities of the United States.\n       (10) The economic interests of both the United States and \n     Japan are best served by well functioning, open markets, \n     deterrence of dumping, and continuing good cooperative \n     relationships in all sectors, including semiconductors.\n       (11) A strong and healthy and military and political \n     alliance between the United States and Japan requires \n     continuation of the industrial and economic cooperation \n     promoted by the United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade \n     Agreement.\n       (12) President Clinton has called on the Government of \n     Japan to agree to a continuation of a United States-Japan \n     Semiconductor Trade Agreement beyond the current agreement's \n     expiration on July 31, 1996.\n       (13) The Government of Japan has opposed any continuation \n     of a government-to-government agreement to promote \n     cooperation in United States-Japan semiconductor trade.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) it is regrettable that the Government of Japan has \n     refused to consider continuation of a government-to-\n     government agreement to ensure that cooperation continues in \n     the semiconductor sector beyond the expiration of the \n     Semiconductor Trade Agreement on July 31, 1996; and\n       (2) the President should take all necessary and appropriate \n     actions to ensure the continuation of a government-to-\n     government United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement \n     before the current agreement expires on that date.\n       (c) Definition.--As used in this section, the term ``United \n     States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement'' refers to the \n     agreement between the United States and Japan concerning \n     trade in semiconductor products, with arrangement, done by \n     exchange of letters at Washington on June 11, 1991.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will keep my remarks brief because it is \nmy understanding that the amendment I have just sent to the desk has, \nin fact, been cleared by both sides.\n  Mr. President, as we surf the Net, drive our car to work, or complete \na training mission in our F-16 fighter, we do not ask ``How is this \npossible?'' We simply go about the task at hand.\n  However, there is a common thread that drives technology in our \nlives, the everpresent semiconductor. Semiconductors are an \nincreasingly pervasive aspect of everyday life, enabling the creation \nof the information superhighway and the functioning of everything from \nautomobiles to advanced medical equipment.\n  Semiconductors are also the linchpin of our national defense \ncapabilities. For example, the current design of the F-16 fighter \nincludes 17,000 electronics components.\n\n[[Page S6451]]\n\n  Mr. President, that is why I am offering an amendment today, with \nSenator Bingaman and 11 of our colleagues, that express the sense of \nthe Senate that the United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement \nshould be renegotiated.\n  The United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement is due to \nexpire in July of this year. This trade agreement has a successful \ntrack record in opening Japanese markets and discouraging the dumping \nof semiconductor products by Japanese companies in the United States.\n  Mr. President, the United States and Japan have had a long history of \ndifficulty in this area of trade relations. In 1986, when the first \nUnited States-Japan Semiconductor Agreement was signed, foreign share \nin the Japanese semiconductor market averaged only 8.4 percent \nannually. In the mid-1980's, the International Trade Commission \ndetermined that Japanese companies had dumped DRAM's, a commodity \nmemory chip, into the United States market in an attempt to gain market \nshare through predatory pricing. As a result, 9 of 11 American DRAM \nmanufacturers were driven out of the market.\n  The United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement has made \nsignificant progress in countering these unfair trade practices. The \nagreement has opened the Japanese semiconductor market to foreign \nproducers, with foreign market share growing to 25 percent in 1995.\n  The agreement has also discouraged dumping practices by requiring \nJapanese firms to have appropriate data regarding costs available on a \nstandby basis. This allows the Department of Commerce to conduct a fast \ntrack investigation, so that there is a swift imposition of a remedy if \ndumping is found, or ends the possibility of litigation if there is no \nevidence of dumping.\n  Mr. President, the agreement has been very effective in easing the \nproblems associated with this area of United States-Japan trade \nrelations.\n  Earlier this week, the United States Trade Representative's office \nannounced that the foreign share of Japan's semiconductor market \nincreased during the first quarter of 1996 to a record high of 30.6 \npercent.\n  Acting USTR Charlene Barshefsky responded in a written statement, \nthat this improvement ``demonstrates the progress that can be achieved \nwhen the United States and Japan work together in a cooperative spirit \nand is a tribute to strenuous efforts that both sides have made to \nimprove market access and strengthen industry cooperation under the \nUnited States-Japan Semiconductor Agreement. It is essential that we \npreserve and continue this effort.''\n  Mr. President, this, and other recent developments are positive news. \nHowever, they provide added incentive to ensure that this important \ntrade agreement be renewed. Given the range of trade issues currently \nbeing addressed between the United States and Japan, it would not be in \nour interest for another area of contention in trade to develop.\n  There is some evidence that the worldwide semiconductor industry may \nnow be entering into a period when supply will exceed demand. Renewal \nof the United States-Japan Semiconductor Agreement has become even more \nimportant because of the recent drop in DRAM memory semiconductors. \nPrices, which have fallen by over 70 percent since the beginning of the \nyear, are now at levels which are below many producers' costs.\n  This kind of dumping has thrown the market into uncertainty and has \ninjured U.S. producers. This type of injury and uncertainty is what the \nagreement is designed to address, and has done so successfully for \nyears.\n  If current trends continue, the United States-Japan agreement becomes \neven more vital to our national interest, since the protection it \nprovides is doubly necessary to discourage dumping in a period of \noversupply.\n  American semiconductor manufacturers are among the most efficient in \nthe world, but they cannot be expected to compete against unfair trade \npractices.\n  More important, it is vital to our defense interests, because we \ncannot afford to lose this important industry as a result of predatory \ndumping, similar to what existed prior to the agreement.\n  In his speech at the Semiconductor Industry Association's annual \nawards dinner, Secretary of Defense William Perry noted the importance \nof this industry in meeting our defense and security needs.\n  In short, the competitiveness and health of the U.S. semiconductor \nindustry is of critical importance to the overall economic well-being \nand high technology defense capabilities of the United States.\n\n\n                 the case for renewal of the agreement\n\n  The purpose of both the 1986 and the 1991 United States-Japan \nSemiconductor Agreements is to allow foreign manufacturers equitable \naccess to the Japanese semiconductor market, and to discourage Japanese \ndumping in the United States market. In short, the goal of the \nagreement is to open the Japanese market to the point where sales \ngenerally occur without respect to the nationality of the supplier.\n  U.S. semiconductor manufacturers are extremely competitive in all \nopen markets across a wide range of applications and a wide range of \nproducts. However, there remains a sharp disparity, between the market \nshare United States manufacturers account for outside the United States \nand Japan, and the share they account for inside Japan.\n  In the world market, excluding the United States and Japan, American \nmanufacturers accounted for 40 percent of all semiconductor sales in \n1995. United States semiconductor makers accounted for only 18 percent \nof sales in the Japanese market that same year.\n  The significant disparity between United States sales outside Japan \nand sales inside Japan indicates that sales in that country are not \nalways made solely on the basis of market forces such as technology, \nprice, quality, service, and delivery.\n  It is important to note that the disparity is not explained by the \nargument that the United States industry does better in the United \nStates and the Japanese industry does better in Japan.\n  A comparison of the 40-percent share United States firms earn in \nworld markets outside both the United States and Japan with the 18-\npercent share United States firms have in Japan demonstrates that a \nsignificant gap remains. But there is only a small difference between \nthe 23-percent share Japanese firms have in the United States market \nand the 27-percent share they have in world markets outside both the \nUnited States and Japan.\n\n\n                   key points for a renewed agreement\n\n  Mr. President, as I already mentioned, the current semiconductor \nagreement expires July 31, 1996. It is essential that a new government-\nto-government agreement be negotiated with Japan before that time.\n  The Japanese electronic industry has proposed an industry-to-industry \nagreement with no government involvement as a replacement for the \ncurrent agreement. An industry-level agreement is completely \nunacceptable. It would not ensure continued progress in increasing \nforeign market access in Japan, nor would it provide the necessary \nguarantee against Japanese dumping in our market.\n  Important features of a new government-to-government semiconductor \nagreement are:\n  It should provide for joint United States-Japanese Government \ncalculation and publication of foreign market share in Japan;\n  And, it should provide for regular government-to-government \nconsultations to assess progress in increasing foreign market access. \nThese provisions regarding the governments' oversight roles are \ncritical to ensuring continued progress.\n  Market access in Japan is critical for the continued growth and \nstrength of the United States semiconductor industry. In 1995, the \nJapanese semiconductor market was $39.6 billion. It is expected to grow \nto $57.1 billion by 1999. Every percentage point increase in United \nStates market access in Japan is therefore worth hundreds of millions \nof dollars in increased United States exports, thousands of additional \njobs in the United States, and a stronger domestic industry to meet our \ngrowing national security and defense needs.\n\n\n                         status of negotiations\n\n  Mr. President, bilateral talks are expected to begin this week. There \nis reason to be cautiously optimistic about\n\n[[Page S6452]]\n\nthis development; however, it is imperative that the Japanese \nGovernment be prepared to discuss in good faith the role that \ngovernment must continue to play in deregulating the Japanese \nsemiconductor market and continuing the process of opening that market.\n  Mr. President, the deadline for the expiration of the United States-\nJapanese Semiconductor Agreement is fast approaching. No new progress \ntoward renegotiation of this important trade agreement has been made. \nMeetings have now occurred, which is certainly a step in the right \ndirection. However, Japanese and American officials just ended 12 days \nof unofficial semiconductor trade talks yesterday in Tokyo that yielded \nlittle progress. The next step will be a sub-Cabinet-level meeting held \nhere in Washington tomorrow and Friday between MITI Vice Minister of \nInternational Affairs Yashihiro Sakamoto and Ira Shapiro, Ambassador in \nCharge of Japan and Canada at the Office of the United States Trade \nRepresentative.\n  Mr. President, these current events emphasize the importance of the \nmessage being sent today by the Senate, and that is that the United \nStates-Japanese Semiconductor Agreement should be--and, most \nimportantly, must be--renegotiated. Given the range of trade issues \ncurrently being addressed between our two nations, it would not be in \neither of our interests for another area of contention in trade to \ndevelop. Therefore, it is essential that a new government-to-government \nagreement be negotiated with Japan before the current agreement expires \non July 31.\n  Mr. President, I have no further comments on this amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to add my support to the amendment \nregarding the United States-Japan Semiconductor Agreement.\n  The United States-Japan Semiconductor Agreement, first concluded in \n1986, and renewed in 1991, has led to tremendous progress in opening \nthe Japanese market. It has provided the framework for discussing trade \nissues before they became problematic and has been the catalyst for \nincreasing cooperation between United States semiconductor makers and \nJapanese semiconductor-consuming industries. It has also promoted fair \ntrade in the marketplace and, at least until recently, has helped to \navoid situations of injurious dumping.\n  The current agreement expires at the end of July. It must be renewed. \nMoreover, both governments must play a significant role in any renewed \nagreement. Government-to-government involvement provides essential \nsupport and encouragement to all industry efforts, and permits the \ncollection of relevant data regarding the calculation of market share. \nThe agreement will not work unless this data can form the basis of the \naccountability in product pricing that can avoid antidumping actions.\n  Renewal of the United States-Japan Semiconductor Agreement has become \neven more important because of the recent dramatic price declines for \nmemory chips. Average sales prices have fallen by over 70 percent in \nrecent months. These prices are so low, in fact, that the specter of \nsignificant injurious dumping is again a reality. Dumping throws \nmarkets into a panic. This type of uncertainty and disruption must not \ntake place again. I urge the President to use all the means at his \ndisposal to conclude a renewed agreement before the current one expires \non July 31.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an \namendment to express the sense of the Senate that the United States-\nJapan Semiconductor Trade Agreement be renegotiated. The current \nsemiconductor agreement expires July 31, and it is essential that a new \ngovernment-to-government agreement be negotiated with Japan prior to \nthe expiration date.\n  The importance of semiconductors should not be underestimated. They \nare an increasingly pervasive aspect of everyday life, enabling the \ncreation of the information superhighway and the functioning of \neverything from automobiles to advanced medical equipment. \nSemiconductors are also the fulcrum of our national defense \ncapabilities. U.S. semiconductor manufacturers employ 260,000 people \nnationwide. Their products are the driving force behind the nearly $400 \nbillion U.S. electronics industry, which provides employment for 2.5 \nmillion Americans. Our semiconductor industry is the world's largest \nand it has habitually been the market leader. U.S. sales, last year, \ntotaled $59 billion, representing almost 41 percent of the $144 billion \nglobal market.\n  It is anticipated that the world semiconductor market will double by \nthe year 2000, with projected sales of over $300 billion. Market access \nin Japan is critical for the continued growth and strength of the \nUnited States semiconductor industry. In 1995, the Japanese \nsemiconductor market was $39.6 billion. It is expected to grow to $57.1 \nbillion by 1999. It is well accepted that every percentage point \nincrease in United States market access in Japan is worth hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in increased United States exports and \napproximately thousands of additional jobs in the United States.\n  In 1986, President Reagan vigorously sought and concluded a 5-year \nagreement with the Government of Japan to grant foreign access to its \nsemiconductor market. The primary purpose of the 1991 United States-\nJapan semiconductor agreement, like the 1986 agreement which preceded \nit, is to allow foreign manufacturers equitable access to the Japanese \nsemiconductor market. The objective of the agreement is to level the \nplaying field and open the Japanese market to the point where sales \ngenerally occur without respect to the nationality or origin of the \nsupplier. The semiconductor agreement has led to tremendous progress in \nopening the Japanese market. Foreign share increased from 8.5 percent \nin 1985 to 25.4 percent in 1995. Of this 25.4 percent foreign share, \nthe U.S. industry has 18 percent market share.\n  It is quite apparent that U.S. semiconductor manufacturers are \nextremely competitive in all open markets across a wide range of \napplications and a wide range of products. There remains a sharp \ndisparity, however, between the share United States manufacturers \naccount for in the neutral world markets outside the United States and \nJapan and the share they account for inside Japan. In the world market, \nexcluding the United States and Japan, American manufacturers accounted \nfor 40 percent of all semiconductor sales in 1995. United States \nsemiconductor makers accounted for only 18 percent of sales in the \nJapanese market that same year. This huge difference in United States \nsales outside Japan and sales inside Japan is further evidence that \nsales in that country are, unfortunately, still not always made solely \non the basis of market forces such as technology, price, quality, \nservice, and delivery.\n  Statements that attempt to rationalize the inability of American \nmanufacturers to gain adequate access to the Japanese semiconductor \nmarket tend to focus on the belief that it is purely natural that the \nUnited States industry does better in the United States and the \nJapanese industry does better in Japan--this is simply not true. A \ncomparison of the 40 percent share United States firms earn in world \nmarkets outside both the United States and Japan with the 18 percent \nshare United States firms have in Japan demonstrates that significant \ngap remains. But there is only a small difference between the 23 \npercent share Japanese firms have in the United States market and the \n27 percent share they have in world markets outside both the United \nStates and Japan.\n  This week, acting-U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefshy is in \nTokyo to hold inform bilateral talks. Although, I am cautiously \noptimistic about this development, it is imperative that the Government \nof Japan understand and be prepared to discuss in good faith the role \nthat government must continue to play in deregulating the Japanese \nsemiconductor market and continuing the process of opening that market. \nThe Government of Japan must also resist efforts by its electronics \nindustry to install an industry-to-industry agreement with no \ngovernment involvement as a replacement for the current agreement. Such \nan industry-to-industry agreement would not ensure continued progress \nin increasing foreign market access in Japan and is totally \nunacceptable.\n  A government-to-government semiconductor agreement will provide for \njoint United States-Japan Government calculation and publication of \nforeign\n\n[[Page S6453]]\n\nmarket share in Japan and that it provide for regular government-to-\ngovernment consultations to assess progress in increasing foreign \nmarket access. These provisions regarding the governments' oversight \nroles are critical to ensuring continued progress and are totally \nwithin the true spirit of competition.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Craig-\nBingaman amendment, urging the renewal of our semiconductor agreement. \nThe agreement has reduced trade friction and promotes private sector \ncooperation. It is essential that a new government-to-government \nagreement is negotiated with Japan before the current agreement is \nallowed to expire on July 31.\n  The United States and Japan have a significant stake in trade harmony \nin this important economic sector. The current $100 billion world \nmarket for semiconductors is expected to grow to $300 billion by the \nyear 2000. The semiconductor industry is the basis of our electronics \nindustry and an increasingly pervasive part of our everyday life.\n  This agreement, first signed in 1986, creates a regular framework for \nbusiness and government leaders to meet and review trade issues and \nbusiness trends. This framework has helped build smooth, steady growth \nin the industry, defused potential disputes, and promoted trade \nharmony, rather than the hostility that has characterized other trade \nsectors.\n  As a replacement, the Japanese electronics industry proposes an \nindustry-to-industry agreement with no government involvement. This \nindustry agreement is unacceptable.\n  It would take no action to ensure continued progress to increase \nforeign market share in Japan. Without an agreement, in a market \ndownturn, United States producers could be cut out of segments of the \nJapanese market.\n  A strong government oversight role is fundamental to enforcing the \nintegrity of the semiconductor market under the agreement. The \ngovernment-to-government semiconductor agreement must be renewed in \norder to provide for the gathering and publication of market share data \nand provide for the regular meetings of industry leaders to review \nmarket and industry issues.\n  Market access in Japan is critical for the continued growth and \nstrength of the United States semiconductor industry. The $39 billion \nJapanese semiconductor market is expected to grow to $57.1 billion by \n1999. Each percentage point increase in United States market access in \nJapan represents hundreds of millions of dollars in increased sales and \nUnited States jobs.\n  Representatives of the United States semiconductor industry recently \nmet in Hawaii with their Japanese counterparts to try to reach \nagreement on future United States-Japan cooperation on semiconductor \nissues. During the meetings, the Japanese company executives submitted \na confidential proposal to continue cooperation in semiconductors, but \nrefused to discuss the role of the Government in ensuring the \nagreement.\n  At the same time, the Japanese Government insisted it could not \ndiscuss the agreement with the United States Government unless and \nuntil an industry level agreement is reached. This rigid insistence \nappears deliberately designed to deadlock discussions until the current \nagreement expires in July.\n  The United States industry--in close consultation with USTR--has \ndecided that it cannot and will not continue to meet with Japanese \ncompany leaders under these circumstances, but will respond to \nproposals put forth by the Japanese companies.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of the 1991 agreement, like the 1986 \nagreement which preceded it, is to allow foreign manufacturers \nequitable access to the Japanese semiconductor market. The agreement \nseeks to open the Japanese market to the point where sales generally \noccur without respect to the nationality of the supplier.\n  The semiconductor agreement has been a tremendous success and must be \ncontinued. Under the agreement, the foreign share of the Japanese \nincreased from 8.5 percent in 1985 to 25.4 percent in 1995. Of this 25-\npercent share, the U.S. firms have an 18-percent market share.\n  The United States semiconductor manufacturers, many of them based in \nmy State of California, make the best product in the world and are \nextremely competitive in all open markets across the full range of \napplications and products.\n  However, United States manufacturers have been less successful in the \nJapanese market than in the neutral world markets outside of the United \nStates and Japan.\n  In neutral markets, American manufacturers represent 40 percent of \nall semiconductor sales last year.\n  In Japan, United States semiconductor makers accounted for only 18 \npercent of 1995 sales, a gap consistent across the full range of \nsemiconductor products and applications.\n  By contrast, there is only a small difference between the 23-percent \nshare Japanese firms have in the United States market and the 27-\npercent share they have in neutral markets.\n  The disparity between United States sales outside and inside the \nJapanese market suggests semiconductor sales in that country are, \nunfortunately, still not always made solely on the basis of market \nforces such as technology, price, quality, service, and delivery. \nCurrent market conditions require the continuation of the United \nStates-Japan agreement.\n  Mr. President, the United States-Japan semiconductor agreement \nreduces trade friction and promotes private sector cooperation, rather \nthan Government enforcement. For both countries, the extension would \nrepresent an opportunity to continue the current, mutually beneficial \nrelationship and should not to be allowed to slip by.\n  The Clinton administration deserves credit for endorsing renewal and \nraising this issue during bilateral meetings. However, the Japanese \nGovernment should understand very clearly that the desire to extend the \nagreement is shared by Congress as well. I am pleased to support the \namendment.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, we favor the Craig amendment on this side, \nand I recommend it be accepted.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we favor the Craig amendment and \nrecommend it be accepted.\n  Mr. CRAIG.

SPACE CONTROL ARCHITECTURE STUDY.\n\n       (a) Required Consideration of Kinetic Energy Tactical \n     Antisatellite Program.--\n\n[[Page S6454]]\n\n     The Department of Defense Space Architect shall evaluate the \n     potential cost and effectiveness of the inclusion of the \n     kinetic energy tactical antisatellite program of the \n     Department of Defense as a specific element of the space \n     control architecture which the Space Architect is developing \n     for the Secretary of Defense.\n       (b) Congressional Notification of Any Determination of \n     Inappropriateness of Program for Architecture.--(1) If at any \n     point in the development of the space control architecture \n     the Space Architect determines that the kinetic energy \n     tactical antisatellite program is not appropriate for \n     incorporation into the space control architecture under \n     development, the Space Architect shall immediately notify the \n     congressional defense committees of such determination.\n       (2) Within 60 days after submitting a notification of a \n     determination under paragraph (1), the Space Architect shall \n     submit to the congressional defense committees a detailed \n     report setting forth the specific reasons for, and analytical \n     findings supporting, the determination.\n       (c) Report on Approved Architecture.--Not later than March \n     31, 1997, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the \n     congressional defense committees a report on the space \n     control architecture approved by the Secretary. The report \n     shall include the following:\n       (1) An assessment of the potential threats posed to \n     deployed United States military forces by the proliferation \n     of foreign military and commercial space assets.\n       (2) The Secretary's recommendations for development and \n     deployment of space control capabilities to counter such \n     threats.\n       (d) Funding.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall release to \n     the kinetic energy tactical antisatellite program manager the \n     funds appropriated in fiscal year 1996 for the kinetic energy \n     tactical antisatellite program.

Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It \nproposes to delete two provisions that have been included in the bill. \nThe effect of the provisions that are in the bill is that they would \nprejudge an ongoing study that the Pentagon is doing on space control \nand antisatellite weapons. These provisions that I am proposing to \ndelete would impose on the Pentagon a kinetic energy antisatellite \nweapon which is generally referred to as KE-ASAT, which may well be one \nof the least attractive options available to the Pentagon for space \ncontrol.\n  My amendment instead sets up a process whereby the Pentagon can \ncomplete its analysis of the ongoing space control architecture study \nand fund the KE-ASAT, the kinetic energy ASAT, only if the Secretary of \nDefense decides that it is a desirable option.\n  My amendment was defeated in the committee when I offered it by an \n11-to-10 vote. I hope that we can succeed on the floor because we \nsimply should not be imposing a technical solution to a complex problem \non the Pentagon before they have told us what their space control \narchitecture will be.\n  Mr. President, this is a fairly esoteric subject. There is no doubt \nthat our military forces deployed overseas will be made more vulnerable \nby the proliferation of foreign military commercial satellite imaging \ncapabilities in the coming years. I have been among several here in \nWashington and around the country pointing to that threat and urging \nthe administration to develop diplomatic and military options to deal \nwith the threat.\n  The Pentagon's own April 1996 report, ``Proliferation Threat and \nResponsibilities,'' pointed to the growing availability of satellite \nimaging and noted--and here is a quote from that report:\n\n       Iraq, for example, might have used such capability to \n     discover that coalition forces had shifted their positions \n     prior to ground operations in Operation Desert Storm. \n     Obviously, such a discovery by Iraq could have cost many \n     allied lives. A future General Schwarzkopf may not have \n     absolute dominance of the space above the battle area that \n     the real General Schwarzkopf enjoyed during Desert Storm as a \n     result of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.\n\n  To deal with this threat, a threat that the Pentagon does take \nseriously, the Pentagon has launched a space control architecture \ndevelopment effort under the Pentagon's space architect, Maj. Gen. \nRobert Dickman. The results of the study may be available as early as \nthis fall, according to the testimony that was received in the Armed \nServices Committee. Unfortunately, instead of waiting for this study, \nsection 212 of this bill, this defense authorization bill that we are \nconsidering today--section 212 of the bill takes all funding away from \nthe space architect unless the Secretary of Defense includes the \nkinetic energy ASAT in the space control architecture being developed. \nSection 221(c) denies all funding for technical analysis, that is $35 \nmillion, denies all that funding to the Under Secretary for Acquisition \nand Technology unless the kinetic energy ASAT Program is pursued.\n  Mr. President, this is, I believe, the first example I have seen of a \nsort of double mandate being put into law, where we are saying not only \nwill we deny all funds to the space architect in the Department of \nDefense if they do not come to the conclusion we want in this study, \nbut we will also deny this $35 million to the Under Secretary for \nAcquisition and Technology unless they decide to pursue this particular \noption.\n  In my view we should not be using such a mandate to influence the \noutcome of an ongoing Pentagon study. The real reason for this \nmandatory language, I am afraid, is that many are concerned that the \nkinetic energy ASAT option will prove to be a very poor alternative in \nthis ongoing study. Most previous studies of antisatellite capabilities \nhave pointed toward directed energy options as preferable to the \nkinetic energy ASAT mandated by the bill. For example, the Air Force \nScience Board, in its ``New World Vistas'' study in air and space power \nfor the 21st century earlier this year recommended both ground-based \nlasers and high-powered microwave systems over the kinetic energy ASAT \nsystems. Here is a quote from that ``New World Vistas'' study. It says:\n\n       Kinetic energy systems . . . are expensive. The vehicles \n     are complex, and tracking and guidance must be precise. Most \n     of the cost, however, is the result of maintaining readiness \n     to launch within an acceptable time.\n\n  Mr. President, I am not opposed to the Pentagon's developing \nantisatellite capabilities to deal with the proliferation of foreign \nhigh-resolution imaging satellites. But we have to understand that \nthese capabilities will be in the hands of a limited number of nations \nfor the next 10 to 15 years, nations such as France, Russia, Israel, \nChina, possibly India, and Japan. Would we really use a kill \ncapability--which is what the kinetic energy ASAT is? This kinetic \nenergy ASAT capability would collide with the satellite which it is \ndirected against at very high speed. Would we really use this ability \nagainst one of those nations which I just listed, simply because they \nwere making imagery available to a potential foe, such as Saddam \nHussein, during a regional confrontation? Would our national leadership \nnot prefer a capability that would disable or jam such a satellite when \nit was over our deployed forces but which would not permanently damage \nit?\n\n  The Air Force Science Board study to which I referred earlier points \nout that high power ``microwave systems could be attractive because \nthey have the potential to produce electronic upset without damaging \nthe structure of a threat satellite.'' Similarly, a mobile ground-based \nlaser system might be developed that can only damage a threat satellite \nif its shutters were open, not if it were in a shutdown mode. Such \nsystems would provide our military commanders a military option to \nensure the dominance of space by this country above the battle area, \nwhich General Schwarzkopf enjoyed during Desert Storm, without \nresulting in the escalation of a regional conflict.\n  The ideal space control capability is not one that destroys a foreign \nimaging satellite by colliding with it at high velocity and creating a \ndiplomatic crisis that broadens a conflict as well as a cloud of space \ndebris that will have adverse effects on peaceful space activities.\n  Mr. President, if there are more cost effective and more \ndiplomatically effective approaches to space control,\n\n[[Page S6455]]\n\nshould we not allow the Pentagon to pursue those? The amendment I am \noffering leaves the $75 million in the bill which is presently there \nfor tactical ASAT technology, without specifying what technologies we \nmight be using it for. It eliminates the mandate forcing the use of the \nkinetic energy ASAT by the Pentagon. The amendment instead directs that \nthe kinetic energy ASAT option be explicitly evaluated by General \nDickman for the space control architecture, but it leaves the choice of \nwhether to fund that option to the Pentagon. The Pentagon must also \ngive Congress the results of its space control study by March 31, 1997.\n  This is the way in which we normally proceed when the Pentagon \ndefines a threat, as they have in this case, and launches an effort to \ndeal with that threat. We do not impose our solution to a highly \ncomplex problem before we have heard the Pentagon's own recommended \nsolution.\n  Mr. President, the only testimony which the Senate received this year \non this whole issue was from Gil Decker, the Assistant Secretary of the \nArmy for Research and Acquisition, who told the Armed Services \nCommittee that this is not an Army priority. This funding did not \nappear on any service wish list. This is hardly the basis for imposing \nthis kinetic energy ASAT system on the Pentagon.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. That concludes my \nstatement in support of it and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator from New \nHampshire will be seeking some time to respond to the Senator from New \nMexico and will be available to speak shortly. Let me just state we \nappear, now, to be making some progress on the bill. Relevant \namendments are being debated and discussed and time limits are being \nsought. To the extent Members with amendments can notify us of their \namendments and we can work out a time agreement, that would be \npreferable to keep us working late into the night.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/19/senate-section/article/S6424-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--INTERNATIONAL NATURAL RUBBER \n             AGREEMENT OF 1995, TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 104-27\n\n  Mr. COATS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, the International Natural Rubber Agreement, 1995, done at \nGeneva on February 17, 1995. The Agreement was signed on behalf of the \nUnited States on April 23, 1996. The report of the Department of State \nsetting forth more fully the Administration's position is also \ntransmitted, for the information of the Senate.\n  As did its predecessors, the International Rubber Agreement, 1995 \n(INRA), seeks to stabilize natural rubber prices without distorting \nlong-term market trends and to assure adequate rubber supplies at \nreasonable prices. The U.S. participation in INRA, 1995, will also \nrespond to concerns expressed by U.S. rubber companies that a \ntransition period is needed to allow industry time to prepare for a \nfree market in natural rubber and to allow for the further development \nof alternative institutions to manage market risk. The new Agreement \nincorporates improvements sought by the United States to help ensure \nthat it fully reflects market trends and is operated in an effective \nand financially sound manner.\n  The Agreement is consistent with out broad foreign policy objectives. \nIt demonstrates our willingness to engage in a continuing dialogue with \ndeveloping countries on issues of mutual concern and embodies our \nbelief that long-run market forces are the appropriate determinants of \nprices and resource allocations. It will also strengthen our relations \nwith the ASEAN countries, since three of them--Malaysia, Indonesia, and \nThailand--account collectively for approximately 80 percent of world \nproduction of natural rubber.\n  Therefore, I urge the Senate to give this Agreement prompt \nconsideration and its advice and consent to ratification to enable the \nUnited States to deposit its instrument of ratification as soon as \npossible.\n                                                  William J.

I have a national interest in this. There is not \nanybody working on this in my State. It is not a jobs issue in my \nState. This is a national security matter, and year after year I stand \nup and engage in debate on this, and in committee, as the opponents \ncontinue to go after this program.\n  This amendment is designed to kill ASAT, to kill the kinetic energy \nprogram plain and simple. That is exactly what it is designed to do. \nThat is what they are trying to do. We have invested $245 million in \nthis program. We have 2 years left, at approximately $75 million a \nyear, to complete this program. This technology works. It has already \nbeen tested. It works. We are going to throw it down the tube, throw it \naway.\n  What is ironic to me is that some of the things that Senator Bingaman \nhas said on this issue are reasonable. In fact, I offered to work with \nthe Senator in committee to address his concerns over the section \ndealing with the space architect. But, we could not reach a compromise. \nThere was no interest in having a compromise. He wants the whole thing. \nHe wants to defeat it.\n  So here we are again, rather than simply addressing the concerns that \nhe has over the space architect issue, the Senator from New Mexico now \nis going after the entire program--all or nothing.\n  The truth is, this amendment circumvents the authorization and \nappropriations process totally. It allows the space architect to \nsinglehandedly decide if the Pentagon spends the money that has been \nauthorized and appropriated in both 1996 and 1997 for ASAT.\n\n[[Page S6456]]\n\n That is an assault on the jurisdiction of this committee, the Armed \nServices Committee, and the Appropriations Committee. There is a \nprocess in place, a correct process, to seek reprogramming or \nrescissions, and that works pretty well around here. But to say that \nthe space architect, whose identity I would venture to say very few of \nmy colleagues even know, can decide whether or not he wants to comply \nwith the law, this represents an enormous erosion of the Senate's \njurisdiction and particularly that of the Armed Services and \nAppropriations Committees.\n  We voted on this issue many times, both Republicans and Democrats, \nunder Democrat control, under Republican control. The Senate has always \ngone on record in support of this program, and yet the assaults \ncontinue. The Armed Forces have testified that they need this \ncapability. The Armed Forces have said they need this capability. The \ntaxpayers have invested millions in its development. Now, when we are \nso close to completing the program, why kill it? You should not kill it \non the money, because you have invested so much, but more important--\nmuch more important--you should not kill it because of the technology.\n  Let us talk a little bit about why it makes no sense to kill it and \nwhy it is a threat to our national security to do that.\n  The global spread of advanced satellite technology has made it \npossible for countries to obtain this high-definition imagery for \nsatellites in low orbit or to buy that information. This data is \ncrucial because in a future conflict, the United States has to be able \nto neutralize a hostile satellite. How are you going to do that? This \nis how you do it, with kinetic energy ASAT. But at present, we do not \nhave that capability. We simply do not have the capability.\n  If you think back, during the gulf war, the Iraqi Air Force was \ndestroyed or forced out of the air in the first few days of fighting, \nand Iraq had no reconnaissance capability. This lack of Iraqi overhead \nsurveillance made it possible for the allies to mass their forces and \nsweep across the desert to bring a swift conclusion to a war that could \nhave cost thousands--thousands --of American casualties.\n  Gen. Charles Horner, Desert Storm air commander, said that the \ndiplomacy that we used convinced France and Russia not to sell \nreconnaissance data to Iraq. Suppose they had it? We had no way to stop \nthem with that kind of reconnaissance. ASAT destroys those satellites, \nMr. President. Why would anyone want to stop that technology?\n  Satellites that can be placed up in the air, over the Earth in low \norbit with a capability to spy on the United States, spy on our forces, \ncollect data, transmit data, what does ASAT do? What does this \nsatellite do? It disables. It disables that satellite and keeps that \nenemy from collecting that information.\n  Why would anyone want to deny the United States of America the \ncapability to do that? It baffles me. I cannot understand it. Every \nyear, year after year, we have to take the same position--for 6 years I \nhave done it--defending this system, while those in this Congress and \nsome in the administration try to kill it, try to kill the capability \nof the United States to take out a satellite that could destroy \nAmerican forces.\n  Some say, ``Well, nobody out there has any capability for satellites. \nWhat do we need ASAT for?'' According to the U.S. Space Command, \nArgentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, \nFrance, Germany, Great Britain, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Italy, \nJapan, Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Norway, Pakistan, Portugal, \nRussia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, \nand Ukraine, to name 30. They do not have any capability? It is out \nthere, folks.\n  You say some of those are friendly countries. That is right, and they \nsell this technology and there are a lot of people out there buying it.\n  ``Why not just jam them?'' they say. We do not have the capability to \ndo that.\n  A U.S. antisatellite capability--and this is a very important point, \nI cannot emphasize this strongly enough to my colleagues--is a \ndisincentive for a potential adversary to spend their resources on \nmilitary satellites. A U.S. kinetic energy ASAT could help constrain \nthe proliferation of such systems. Why would somebody want to spend \nhundreds of millions of dollars to develop satellites to put in space \nto spy on us or to use to collect data against our forces if they know \nwe can disable them or disarm them? The chances are they will not. Yet, \nhere we are, here we are, saying, ``Let's kill the program.''\n  Russia leads the world in space launches of military satellites.\n  Ukraine is building a series of radar satellites.\n  China is launching military recon satellites and have been doing it \nfor 20 years. They are selling space launches and satellite technology \nall over the world.\n  United Arab Emirates reportedly has ordered a military reconnaissance \nsatellite from a consortium of Russian firms.\n  On and on and on, and yet we stand here on the floor today having to \ndefend attacks on us, those who support this system. I have had enough \nof it, Mr. President, to be very blunt about it. I have had enough of \nit. I am tired of it. I think it is outrageous that people come down on \nthis floor and put our forces at risk to try to kill the technology \nthat works, that protects us.\n  Let me repeat, had Saddam Hussein had the capability, had he had \nthese satellites, we would have lost thousands of Americans because we \ncould not have disabled them. We have the technology. It works. Why are \nwe not using it?\n  It does not make any sense, Mr. President, not to continue this \ntechnology. This technology was designed, developed, manufactured, and \nintegrated under the Kinetic Energy ASAT Demonstration Validation \nProgram from 1990 to 1993 and ground tested, and it works. Here we are \nhaving to defend it from these attacks.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. SMITH. The distinguished chairman, Senator Thurmond, has asked \nfor a little of my time, so I will just conclude by saying, if we lose \nthis vote and lose this technology and end this technology, ASAT, it, \nin my opinion, will be a direct threat to the thousands of American men \nand women all over the world who wear the uniforms of the Armed Forces \nof the United States.\n  It is an unprecedented erosion of our constitutional prerogative. \nWhen we take the oath to the Constitution, we take an oath to protect \nand defend America. This protects and defends America. I have been \nhearing a lot of this talk. I have heard some of it already, and we \nwill hear a lot more, about how we are going to do this stuff with \nlasers, disable all these satellites with laser technology, that that \nis the thing of the future. It might be, but it is not here yet. What \nare we going to do here in between?\n  For those who might not care about the military application--or maybe \nyou care about space junk--kinetic energy ASAT disables satellites. It \ndoes not break them up into hundreds of pieces and create space junk. \nIt disables them. It is a very important point.\n  I would think the Senate would want to think long and hard before \nending this technology because this amendment will do that. That is \nwhat it is designed to do.\n  There will be another amendment coming to cut the funding off just in \ncase this one does not work. We face that every year.\n  I want to conclude on this point, Mr. President. I have been on the \nArmed Services Committee here in the U.S. Senate under Democrat and \nRepublican leadership. We have fought this fight every year. And \nDemocrats, when they were in the majority, were some of the strongest \nsupporters on that committee of this program.\n  This is not a Republican-Democrat issue here. This is a national \nsecurity issue. It deserves to be supported. Why some in the \nadministration have taken the position that it ought not to be, and \nsome in the Senate, I do not know. But I know this is dangerous. This \nis a dangerous amendment. I do not say that about very many amendments \non this floor. This is a dangerous amendment. This could cost American \nlives,\n\n[[Page S6457]]\n\nand not too far in the distant future either. This could be very close \nin the immediate future. This could cost American lives.\n  We have the technology to disable satellites. We ought to use it. It \nis proven. We have expended roughly two-thirds of the money. It is in \nplace. The military supports it. And those policymakers who do not are \nill-advised. They are wrong. They are absolutely wrong. We have an \nobligation to stand up and be heard on this, when these kinds of things \nhappen.\n  So I am proud to say, Mr. President, that I support this program, not \nfor any parochial reasons, but for national security reasons. I am \nstanding here on the floor today because this system works. It is \nnecessary for the security of the United States of America. It protects \nAmerican lives. It ought to be funded fully. It ought not to be in any \nway diminished.\n  So I ask my colleagues, please, do not fall for this faulty line, \nthis false information, and to support kinetic energy ASAT.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 3 minutes, \n20 seconds.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, first, I want to commend the able \nSenator from New Hampshire for the excellent remarks he has made on \nthis subject. He has made a very emphatic case for our side. I am very \nproud that he has done that today.\n  Mr. President. I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the \nSenator from New Mexico. A similar variation of the amendment was \noffered in the committee during markup and it was not accepted.\n  The Congress has authorized and/or appropriated funds for the kinetic \nenergy antisatellite technology program since 1985. For the past 3 \nyears the administration has not complied with the law and obligated \nthe funds for the program. Every year, as a result, we have to take \nactions to force the Department to comply with legislation to compel \nthem to obligate the funds for this particular program.\n  Mr. President, the Under Secretary of Defense for Space, Bob Davis, \nhas stated on many occasions that there is a need to develop systems to \ncounter the space threat. The Congress has supported the kinetic energy \nantisatellite technologies for that purposes, as well as other \ntechnologies which are not ready for production or are years away from \ndeployment. The KE-ASAT program is the only near-term program to meet a \npotential enemy satellite threat.\n  The U.S military relies on space for surveillance, communications, \nnavigation, and attack warning. It is important for the United States \nto ensure its freedom to use space. If our adversaries achieve the \nability to control space and the United States does not have the \ncapability to turn this around, we will lose our military advantage.\n  Mr. President, I, again, oppose the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom New Mexico and I urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a memorandum for Robert \nT. Howard, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Budget by Jay M. \nGarner, Lieutenant General, USA, commanding, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the memorandum was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Department of the Army,\n\n\n                          Space and Strategic Defense Command,\n\n                                   Arlington, VA, January 3, 1996.\n     Memorandum for MG Robert T. Howard, Deputy Assistant \n         Secretary of the Army for Budget.\n     Subject: Kinetic Energy Anti-Satellite (ASAT) Technology \n         Funding Reduction.\n       1. USASSDC nonconcurs with action proposed by Program \n     Budget Decision 719, which rescinds $30M from the ASAT \n     program in support of the Bosnia Supplemental. USASSDC \n     believes kinetic energy technology will prove to be a vital \n     capability for the future. In addition, the kill vehicle \n     currently being tested may have applicability to other \n     programs.\n       2. The total KE ASAT technology program encompasses four \n     years (FY96-99) at a cost of $180M, which includes the $30M \n     currently being considered for rescission. The program is \n     structured to develop incremental technology improvements \n     (and possible insertion into other programs), necessary kill \n     vehicle and booster procurements, and testing. For example, \n     in FY96, weapon control system integration, software \n     upgrades, and kill vehicle refurbishment will be accomplished \n     in support of a planned hover test. This hover test, along \n     with kill vehicle qualification testing and hardware in the \n     loop simulation planned for FY97 will facilitate full up \n     flight tests during FY98. As in the past, we expect continued \n     Congressional funding and support of this program to not \n     affect Army's research and development account, or overall \n     total obligation authority (TOA). Based on this level of \n     funding a contingency deployment capability will be achieved \n     by FY99.\n       3. The current contract with Rockwell will terminate on \n     January 31, 1996. If allowed to do so, ASAT contingency \n     capability will be delayed by a minimum of one year depending \n     on when funding is made available.\n       4. Point of contact for this action is LTC Robert M. Shell \n     at (703) 607-1934.\n\n                                                Jay M. Garner,\n\n                                               Lieutenant General,\n                                                  USA, Commanding.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bingaman amendment \non ASAT programs. His amendment would simply remove two very onerous \nprovisions from the bill and permit the Department of Defense ``Space \nArchitect'' to complete a study we have required, and determine which \nanti-satellite technologies are most appropriate for the U.S. military.\n  His amendment would not kill the ASAT Program, as its opponents have \ncharged. In fact, his amendment would leave in place $75 million for \nU.S. ASAT programs, which was added by the committee majority, for the \nASAT Program. This is funding the administration did not request, but \nwhich was added by the majority.\n  I believe it would be appropriate to eliminate the funding as well as \nthe two provisions in the bill, because I do not believe there is a \nneed to fund this ASAT Program. But this amendment by Senator Bingaman \nis a compromise that would leave in place all the funding added by the \nCommittee majority, but strip out the two provisions that were in the \nbill. It would leave the Department of Defense the option of pursuing \nthe kinetic energy ASAT Program if it is considered appropriate \ntechnology. But the bill mandates that the Pentagon choose the KE ASAT, \nwithout even knowing the results of the current study being conducted \nby the ``Space Architect.''\n  So the amendment offered by Senator Bingaman is a very reasonable \ncompromise that leaves open all ASAT options while keeping $75 million \nthat was not even requested by the Administration. Although I do not \nbelieve that this funding is justified, I think the underlying \nprovisions in the bill are totally unjustified and should be rejected \nby the Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Bingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SMITH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. At this time, not to interrupt the debate, I would like, \nif the Senator from New Mexico is finished, to move the amendment, or \nat least ask for the yeas and nays. Let me just ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I did want to conclude my debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table is not in order at this \npoint.\n  Mr. SMITH. I will withhold.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico controls 10 \nminutes, 52 seconds.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4058, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, I am informed by the floor staff \nthat I need to send a modification to the desk. It is a technical \nmodification to make it clear as to which page and which line is being \nproposed for striking in this amendment. I send that modification to \nthe desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       Beginning on page 33, strike out line 3 and all that \n     follows through page 34, line 2, and insert in lieu thereof \n     the following:\n\n[[Page S6458]]\n\n     SEC. 212. SPACE CONTROL ARCHITECTURE STUDY.\n\n       (a) Required Consideration of Kinetic Energy Tactical \n     Antisatellite Program.--The Department of Defense Space \n     Architect shall evaluate the potential cost and effectiveness \n     of the inclusion of the kinetic energy tactical antisatellite \n     program of the Department of Defense as a specific element of \n     the space control architecture which the Space Architect is \n     developing for the Secretary of Defense.\n       (b) Congressional Notification of Any Determination of \n     Inappropriateness of Program for Architecture.--(1) If at any \n     point in the development of the space control architecture \n     the Space Architect determines that the kinetic energy \n     tactical antisatellite program is not appropriate for \n     incorporation into the space control architecture under \n     development, the Space Architect shall immediately notify the \n     congressional defense committees of such determination.\n       (2) Within 60 days after submitting a notification of a \n     determination under paragraph (1), the Space Architect shall \n     submit to the congressional defense committees a detailed \n     report setting forth the specific reasons for, and analytical \n     findings supporting, the determination.\n       (c) Report on Approved Architecture.--Not later than March \n     31, 1997, the Secretary, of Defense shall submit to the \n     congressional defense committees a report on the space \n     control architecture approved by the Secretary.

Mr. President, let me just respond briefly. I do not \nthink I will take the full 10 minutes. The Senator from New Hampshire \nsays that this amendment that I have offered is an effort to kill the \nASAT Program. That is clearly not true. There is nothing in the \namendment that I have offered which in any way tries to delete or \nreduce or diminish funding for an ASAT Program. I made it very clear \nthat I support that funding. The funding remains in the bill.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is saying that the Pentagon is trying \nto kill its own ASAT capability. I have real trouble understanding that \nlogic or believing that that is a credible line of argument.\n  The real question we are trying to pose here, Mr. President, is, \nshould we allow the Pentagon to come forward with their own \nrecommendation on what makes the most sense, what is the best option \nfor an ASAT capability, or should we prejudge that?\n  I remember a story that I heard when I was in school about how Henry \nFord used to say, ``You can have any color of Model-T Ford that you \nwant as long as it's black.'' What we are saying here in the existing \nbill to the Pentagon is, ``You can pursue any option you want to obtain \nASAT capability as long as you take the one we want you to take.'' That \nis not a smart way for us to proceed. We do not have the technical \ncapability here in the U.S. Senate to prejudge this study that the \nPentagon is engaged in.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire says that the military supports this \nkinetic energy ASAT capability; they want to go ahead and fund it. If \nthat is true, then why do we have to mandate in the bill that they have \nto fund it? Why do we have to mandate in the bill that they cannot \nspend any money for these other purposes unless they fund it, unless \nthey choose that option?\n  I think clearly what the majority in the committee is trying to do in \nthis bill is to take away the options of the Pentagon and say the \nPentagon has to fight the way we say or else we will impose sanctions \nupon them.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire says that anyone who would support \nthis amendment, the amendment I have offered, is trying to put our \nforces at risk. Why is it putting our forces at risk to let the \nPentagon decide what makes the most sense, what is the most effective \nfor protecting our forces? I have real difficulty understanding that \nkind of logic.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered is not an effort to \nkill the ASAT Program. It is not an effort to reduce funding for the \nASAT Program. There is nothing in the amendment that does either of \nthose things. What it says is, let us give them the money, let us give \nthem the ability to come back and recommend to us the proper use of \nthat money to gain the greatest capability for protecting our own \nforces. To me that is common sense. I have great difficulty seeing why \nwe even have to argue about it.\n\n  I am reminded, as I hear the debate raging around here, that when I \nwas practicing law, a more senior member of the bar early on in some of \nthe trial practice I engaged in said there is a simple rule in trying a \nlawsuit. When the facts are on your side, pound away at the facts; when \nthe law is on your side, pound away at the law; when neither are on \nyour side, pound away at the table. That is what is happening here. \nNeither the facts nor the law nor common sense are on the side of those \nwho put this provision in the bill.\n  We clearly should delete this provision. Let the Pentagon make its \nown recommendations as to what option is best for our troops. That is \nwhat I favor doing. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield the remainder of the time to the able Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, and I ask unanimous consent that 2 additional \nminutes be allowed the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have no objection to an additional 2 \nminutes, but I would like 2 minutes on my side.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized for up to 2 \nminutes and 58 seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH. I will respond to my friend from New Mexico. We worked \nvery closely together on the Acquisition and Technology Subcommittee. I \nwill not pound the table. I am not even going to raise my voice. The \ntruth of the matter--and the Senator knows this full well--the \nadministration did not request any funding in their budget for the ASAT \nProgram.\n  Unless I am missing something in the logic here--I do not believe I \nam; maybe the Senator would like me to miss it and would like others to \nmiss it--unless I misunderstand something, if the administration does \nnot request it and the policy folks do not want it, if we send it back \nto the space architect, who is a policy person, to study it, you can \npretty well conclude what the results will be. They will not fund it.\n  When I say this is a deliberate attempt to kill the Kinetic Energy \nASAT Program, I mean what I say. It is true. It will kill it. The other \nthing that we need to understand here, the Army supports the Kinetic \nEnergy ASAT Program. They objected to the rescission list. They \nobjected to this being listed as a rescission item. They did not win \nthe debate. The policy people won.\n  The Senator's amendment sends this back to the space architect. He \nwill study it diligently over the next few weeks, months, whatever it \ntakes, and then announce that we do not need it, and kill it. This is \nnot an objective decision here. This person was not objective. This \nperson made up his mind already. He does not want it. If he wanted it, \nhe would have funded the remainder of it, which has already been--as we \nsaid earlier, we have already expended $245 million on this program, \nand we have already proven that it works, and we already have the \ntechnology in place. All we are asking for is the completion. That is \nthe reason why this is a killer amendment.\n  We should not be cute about the process here. When somebody opposes \nsomething, you give it back to them to make the decision, you can \npretty well\n\n[[Page S6459]]\n\nguess what the decision is going to be. That is a little bit \ndisingenuous. They did not fund it. The administration does not want \nthis program. The administration is getting quite a reputation around \nhere for not expending moneys that we have appropriated and authorized. \nThey are getting pretty good at it, and they are doing it without \nlegislation. They are just doing it. They are just saying, ``We do not \nwant this, so even though you authorized it and appropriated it, we are \nnot going to spend it.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has 7 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, again I will not take the full 7 \nminutes, but let me conclude by saying that I think there is clearly a \nfailure to communicate here on this issue.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire says that the Army wants this \nprogram. Looking at the facts: The administration asked for a fairly \nhealthy defense budget; the Armed Services Committee, in the bill that \nis before the Senate here, added about over $12 billion to that--\nsomething in that range. In order to come up with that additional \nmoney, we went to each of the services and said, ``What is on your wish \nlist? Are there things you would like to have funded that we were not \nable to fund, or that the President did not request, or that the \nPentagon did not request, the Secretary of Defense did not request?'' \nThe Army gave us over $2 billion worth of those, more like $3 billion. \nI am not sure of the exact amount.\n  Again, there was nothing in there for this ASAT capability. The \nargument that the Army wants this, they just never want us to give them \nany money for it, is a hard one for me to understand. I think, clearly, \nthis is not a program I am trying to kill. We are not touching the \nmoney. The money has been added here, and we are saying, ``Fine, let's \ngo ahead and spend the money for whichever option the Pentagon wants to \npursue.'' But let the Pentagon make the judgment. Do not try to \nprejudge the right technology in order to develop this ASAT capability. \nThat is all we are saying.\n  The end of the amendment that I have offered, I think, makes it very \nclear that not later than April 1, 1997, the Secretary of Defense shall \nrelease to the kinetic energy antisatellite program manager any funds \nappropriated in 1997 for the Kinetic Energy Tactical Antisatellite \nProgram pursuant to section 221(a) unless the space architect has by \nsuch date submitted a notification; or a report submitted by the \nSecretary pursuant to subsection (c) includes a recommendation not to \npursue such a program.\n  What I am trying to do in my amendment is to protect the ability of \nthe Pentagon to use the money in the most effective way. We are not in \nfavor of mandating a result in an ongoing study where they are trying \nto make a judgment as to what is the best use of this money to protect \nour own forces.\n  I have confidence that the Pentagon will make a judgment based on \ntheir honest and expert opinion as to what makes sense for the country \nand for our own forces. I do not think we need to prejudge that. \nAccordingly, I hope very much that my amendment will be agreed to.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Senator Bumpers be added as a cosponsor to \nmy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have no additional debate.\n  Mr. THURMOND.

The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, can I inquire, has the Senator from \nWashington been recognized to offer her amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not at this point. There was an objection to \nthe unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. COATS. But that would not prevent the Senator from going ahead \nand offering her amendment; there would just not be a time constraint?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NUNN.

Mr. President, if the Senator from South Carolina propounds \nthe unanimous-consent request, I believe it will be agreed to now. I \nknow the Senator from Arkansas first would like to make his position \nclear, and perhaps if he is recognized at this point for that, he can \nmake his brief statement and then the Senator from South Carolina can \npropound the unanimous=consent request, and I believe it will be agreed \nto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking member of \nthe Armed Services Committee for allowing me to make a statement, and I \nwill say to my distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nmy statement will be about just one moment, and then we will allow \nSenator Murray to go forward with her amendment.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that I am going to offer, and it may not \nbe after the disposition of Senator Murray's amendment but it may be \nafter the disposition of a subsequent amendment, is the so-called GATT \nGlaxo amendment. I have been attempting all of this year, during the \nentirety of 1996, to bring this amendment to the floor, to have it \ndebated and have it voted on. I have asked for 1 hour of debate, 30 \nminutes on a side, and then let us vote up or down and dispose of this \nmatter to see if we are willing or not willing to correct a massive \nabuse that we created by mistake in the GATT treaty.\n  This is allowing one drug firm to prevent other generic firms from \ncoming in and competing fairly in the market. It is also allowing an \nextra $5 million each day--each day--of profits that we hesitate and \nfail to correct.\n  It should be a matter of honor that we correct this matter, and I am \ngoing on the Department of Defense bill to continue attempting to find \na slot where Senator Brown, Senator Chafee, and the Senator from \nArkansas, Senator Pryor, may offer this amendment and have the U.S. \nSenate go on record, once and for all, as to whether we are willing to \ncorrect this abusive flaw created by mistake.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to thank the able Senator from \nArkansas for taking the position he has. I will now proceed to make the \nrequest.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time on the Murray \namendment, relating to abortions at military hospitals, be limited to 2 \nhours, equally divided in the usual form, and that no amendments be in \norder; and that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote on, or in relation to, the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4059\n\n  (Purpose: To repeal the restriction on use of Department of Defense \n                       facilities for abortions)\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nlaid aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Robb, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Simon, and \n     Ms. Moseley-Braun, proposes an amendment numbered 4059.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n       At the end of title VII add the following:\n\n     SEC. 708. RESTORATION OF PREVIOUS POLICY REGARDING \n                   RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \n                   MEDICAL FACILITIES.\n\n       Section 1093 of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking out subsection (b); and\n       (2) in subsection (a), by striking out ``(a) Restriction on \n     Use of Funds.--''.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering to the \nfiscal year 1997 Department of Defense authorization bill--and I am \noffering it on behalf of myself, Senator Snowe, Senator Simon, Senator \nLautenberg, Senator Robb, Senator Moseley-Braun and Senator Kennedy--is \nvery simple. It strikes language adopted in last year's defense \nauthorization and appropriations bills that would prohibit privately \nfunded abortions from being performed at overseas military hospitals. \nThis ban places women stationed overseas in an unsafe and unfair \nsituation and blatantly restricts their constitutional right to choose.\n  Women in our armed services sacrifice each and every day to serve our \ncountry. They should receive our utmost respect, honor, and gratitude. \nThey certainly do not deserve to be told they must check their \nconstitutional rights at the door when they are stationed overseas. My \namendment protects their precious rights and ensures their safe access \nto quality medical services.\n  Mr. President, let me just say a few things about my amendment to \nclear away any confusion that may exist.\n  First, this amendment simply restores previous DOD policy. From 1973 \nto 1988, a woman stationed overseas was allowed to obtain an abortion \nif she paid with private, nondefense funds. Likewise, this was DOD \npolicy from 1993 till 1996. This is not some radical new idea. Quite \nthe contrary, in fact. This law was in place for almost two full terms \nof the Reagan White House.\n  We have had many debates on the floor of this Senate over the past 2 \nyears about abortion, about Federal funding, about Federal workers, \nabout Medicaid. Let me be very clear, this issue is different. My \namendment simply ensures the same rights for women in our armed \nservices enjoyed by every other woman in this country.\n  This amendment is merely an effort to return us to the policy of the \npast which protected women stationed in a foreign country from having \nto seek medical care from inexperienced or inadequately trained \npersonnel. It is dangerous and unnecessary and just plain wrong to put \nthese women, who are serving our country overseas, at risk.\n  Furthermore, my amendment does not force anyone to perform an \nabortion at a military facility.\n  Currently, all departments of the military function under a \nconscience clause which states that medical personnel do not have to \nparticipate in an abortion procedure if they have a religious, moral, \nor ethical objection.\n  This amendment preserves that important conscience clause. Most \nimportantly, Mr. President, it deals only with an individual's private \nfunds. The 104th Congress has spent almost 2 years trying to return \nflexibility and authority to States. But under the fiscal year 1996 DOD \nbill, we have a fundamental inconsistency. We have a problem telling \nour States how to spend their money, but women in our own military are \nnot afforded that privilege.\n\n[[Page S6461]]\n\n  Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that a woman stationed overseas \ndoes not always have the luxury of access to safe and quality medical \ncare other than at the military hospital on her base. It is dangerous \nto force her to seek medical care in the local area. We are sending our \nwomen in uniform to the foreign back alley. And that is wrong.\n  My amendment seeks to prevent our women in uniform from having to \nmake a very difficult and potentially dangerous, life-threatening \nchoice. My amendment seeks to restore our women in uniform, women \nstationed overseas, a right they have had for most of the last 23 \nyears. My amendment seeks to protect the constitutional rights of our \nwomen in uniform. They sacrifice every day for every single one of us, \nand we owe them that much. I urge my colleagues to vote for this \namendment. I withhold the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from Washington \nand the amendment that was just offered, it is true this is not some \nradical new idea. This is an issue that has been debated by this body \non a number of occasions over the past several years.\n  Since 1979, the Department of Defense has had a policy of prohibiting \nthe use of Federal funds to perform abortions except where the life of \nthe mother would be in danger if the fetus were carried to term. The \nbill before us today carries that ban, which was enacted in last year's \nauthorization bill, and it incorporates also the exceptions for rape \nand incest.\n  What the Congress has always debated are the two separate questions, \nboth of which are legitimate questions and both of which need to be \ndebated. The separate questions are, one, whether or not a legislative \nbody ought to intervene in the decisions made in Roe versus Wade by the \nSupreme Court and enact restrictions or a constitutional amendment on \nthe issue of abortion. The second issue, however, is a separate issue. \nThat is whether or not a taxpayer ought to be coerced into supporting \nsomething that goes against his or her moral conscience or moral \nbeliefs.\n  So in 1979, Congressman Hyde introduced the Hyde amendment, which \nessentially said that taxpayers' funds would not be used in support of \nabortion.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Washington attempts to \naddress the situation as it applies only to military personnel and \ntheir dependents, under the argument that many of these individuals are \ndeployed overseas and may find themselves in situations where \nperformance of an abortion is either banned by the laws of that country \nor there are situations which are not of the quality or safety that \nwomen would seek.\n\n  But it ignores the fact that the Department of Defense has had in \nplace a policy which allows women the opportunity to seek an abortion \nwith their own funds at essentially a hospital of their choice. The \nDepartment of Defense makes military transportation available to these \nwomen.\n  What we are really dealing with here is the question of whether or \nnot Federal funds should be used in the performance of abortions. It is \nalso important to note that during the time that the policy prohibiting \nthe use of Federal funds to perform abortions in military facilities, \nduring the time that that policy has been in effect, there has been no \ndifficulty in implementing the policy, there have been no formal \ncomplaints filed concerning the policy, there have been no legal \nchallenges instituted concerning this policy, and no members of the \nmilitary or their dependents have been denied access to an abortion as \na result of the policy.\n  So it is simply not accurate to say that the policy currently in \neffect places women in an unfair situation and, to quote the Senator \nfrom Washington, ``blatantly restricts their constitutional rights.'' \nThis does not restrict the constitutional rights of women at all. Let \nme repeat that. This policy currently in effect does not restrict the \nconstitutional rights of any woman in the service, or her dependents. \nThat woman has full access to an abortion, to a legal abortion under \nthe law. I do not condone that. I do not support that. But that is not \nthe issue we are arguing.\n  The issue that we will be voting on is not whether you are pro-choice \nor pro-life. It is not whether you think a woman ought to have the \nright to choose. Military women have the right to choose. No one is \ndenying their opportunity to have an abortion.\n  We are simply saying that the use of Federal facilities which are \npaid for, operated by the use of Federal funds, is violative of a \npolicy that the Congress has adopted on numerous occasions, described \nas the Hyde amendment, which says that essentially no Federal funds \nwill be used for the performance of abortions except in certain cases, \nlife of the mother, and more recently life of the mother if the fetus \nwere carried to term or in the cases of rape or incest.\n  There have been no recorded or official complaints, not only for \nwomen in uniform being denied access to an abortion, but their \ndependents being denied access to military transport for the purpose of \nprocuring an abortion.\n  This, I believe, was a sound and a fair policy. It worked. If it had \nnot worked, there would have been complaints filed, there would have \nbeen challenges issued concerning the policy, there would have been \nmilitary personnel or their dependents denied access. That was not the \ncase.\n  It remained in place until 1993 when President Clinton issued an \nExecutive order reversing it. Under the Clinton policy, defense \nfacilities were used for the first time in 14 years, not to defend \nlife, but to take life, and to do so with taxpayer funds.\n  Last year the House and the Senate reversed that policy when we voted \nto override the President and make permanent the ban on the use of \nDepartment of Defense medical facilities to perform abortions except in \nthe case of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother. So today we \nare faced again with this issue, because this amendment would strike \nthat ban and reinstate the former Clinton policy regarding military \nfacilities.\n\n  Supporters of the Murray amendment will argue that this policy does \nnot involve the use of taxpayer funds since women are required to pay \nfor these abortions. But to maintain that fiction is simply to \nmisunderstand the nature of military medicine. Unlike other medical \nfacilities, military clinics and hospitals receive 100 percent of their \nfunds from Federal taxpayers. Physicians in the military are Government \nemployees, paid entirely by tax revenues. All of the operational and \nadministrative expenses of military medicine are paid by taxpayers. All \nof the equipment used to perform the abortions are purchased at \ntaxpayer expense.\n  So that is the issue that is before us. Are we going to require the \ntaxpayers of America, whose fundamental religious beliefs or whose \nmoral beliefs or values are such that they do not approve of the use of \ntheir tax dollars for the Government providing an abortion, to fund \nabortions?\n  It is true that the payment for this abortion will be made by the \nperson seeking the abortion and not the taxpayer. But it is not true \nthat taxpayers' funds are, therefore, not used in the \nprocedure, because the procedure is being performed by employees whose \nentire salary is paid by the taxpayer, in a facility whose entire cost \nof construction is paid for by the taxpayer, whose entire operating \ncosts are paid by the taxpayer, and which equipment used in the \nprocedure is purchased at taxpayer expense.\n\n  It is therefore impossible to imagine that taxpayer money can be \npreserved from entanglement of abortion in military medicine. Any \nattempt to do so would present an accounting nightmare, according to \nthe Defense Department's own analysis. The only way to protect the \nintegrity of taxpayer funds is to keep the military out of the abortion \nbusiness. We must not take money from citizens and use it to vandalize \ntheir moral values.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the Murray amendment is a solution in search \nof a problem. No problem has been identified. When the prohibition was \nin place, no one was denied access to an abortion.\n  I repeat that for my colleagues to consider: When this policy was in \nplace banning the use of military facilities to provide abortions, no \none was denied access to an abortion. If safe, acceptable facilities \nfor elective abortion\n\n[[Page S6462]]\n\nwere not available to military women based on where they were stationed \nor living, these women were permitted to use military transport, for \nwhatever reason they chose, to go wherever they wanted to go to have \nthat abortion.\n  Supporters of the Murray amendment have argued that in the past, \nwomen in the military have been stripped of their rights, but not a \nsingle case has been filed challenging this policy. The bottom line is \nthat the need for the legislation or the President's policy has not \nbeen proven.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, to retain \nthe present policy as enacted last year in the House-Senate conference, \nand now as part of current law, to retain that policy, because that \npolicy makes imminent sense. To repeal that would violate what this \nCongress has adopted as policy many, many times over. That is, the \nintermingling of taxpayer funds for the provision of abortion.\n  I reserve the balance of my time. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want the Senate to support the \namendment offered by Senator Murray to ensure that women in the armed \nservices serving overseas can exercise their constitutional right to \nchoose safe abortion services. It does not require the Department of \nDefense to pay for abortions. But it repeals the current ban on \nprivately funded abortions at U.S. military facilities overseas. Our \nservicewomen should not lose their rights granted by the Constitution \nwhen they serve the country in foreign lands.\n  This is an issue of fairness to the women who make significant \nsacrifices to serve our nation. They go to military bases around the \nworld to protect our freedoms, but when they get there, they are denied \naccess to the kind of medical care available to all women in the United \nStates. Military women should be able to depend on their base hospitals \nfor all their medical services. This amendment gives them access to the \nsame range and quality of health care services that they could obtain \nin the United States.\n  In many countries where our forces serve, that quality of care is not \navailable. Without adequate care, an abortion can be a life-threatening \nor permanently disabling operation. In some countries, the blood supply \nmay pose an unacceptable health risk for military personnel.\n  We have a responsibility to provide safe options for U.S. \nservicewomen in these situations. Those who oppose this amendment are \nexposing servicewomen to substantial risks of infection, illness, \ninfertility, or even death. We can easily avoid such risks by making \nthe health facilities at overseas bases available, and it is \nirresponsible not to do so.\n  In addition to the health risks of the current policy, there is a \nsignificant financial penalty on servicewomen and their families. \nRound-trip travel costs for a woman stationed at our Air Base in Turkey \nto travel privately back to Washington for an abortion totals over \n$2,500 and that figure does not include the cost of the medical \nprocedure. For a young enlisted woman whose pretax monthly income is \nabout $1,400, that cost is a significant financial hardship that women \nserving in the United States do not have to bear.\n\n  If the enlisted woman does not have the financial means to travel \nprivately to the United States, she could face significant delays \nwaiting for space available military transportation. The health risks \nincrease with each week. If the delays are too long, the servicewoman \nmay well be forced to rely on questionable facilities in the country \nwhere she is stationed. For all practical purposes, she is being denied \nher right to choose.\n  The decision on abortion is very difficult and extremely personal. It \nis unfair and unreasonable to make this decision so dangerous for women \nwho serve our country overseas.\n  Every woman in America has a constitutional right to choose to \nterminate her pregnancy. It is time for Congress to stop denying this \nright to military women serving overseas and to stop treating them as \nsecond-class citizens. I urge the Senate to support the Murray \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I find it very difficult to follow the logic of those \nindividuals who oppose abortions at overseas Government-supported \nmedical facilities because tax payers' dollars are involved, and yet \nsomehow distinguish that from the Government-supported air \ntransportation required to fly individuals back to the United States to \nobtain abortion services. Who in the world pays for the air \ntransportation, the aircraft, and the personnel that fly the aircraft?\n  The issue ought to be what is the best in terms of the health care \nfor that individual. We insist on that for our military personnel. They \nare entitled to it--the very, very best. We are committed to make sure \nthey get the best.\n  Why should we be able to say we are going to provide quality health \ncare services with this one exception, with this one area, where a \nwoman is going to have to roll the dice and take her chances, based \nupon availability of flights, based upon the particular location where \nthe woman is stationed? Are we going to effectively wash our hands of \nany kind of responsibility? It makes no sense. It is cruel. It is \ninhumane. It is failing to meet the health care needs of military \npersonnel. We should not be able to say we will provide the best in \nhealth care with the exception of this one procedure.\n  I think the amendment is commendable. I congratulate the Senator from \nWashington for offering it. I hope the amendment is carried.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Maine how much \ntime she desires.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I would like 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby Senator Murray to repeal the ban on abortions in overseas military \nhospitals. I am very pleased to cosponsor this amendment as well.\n  In listening to the debate here this afternoon, I cannot help but \nthink ``here we go again'' on this issue, on a woman's personal right \nto choose. We have this debate year in and year out. Congress revisits \nthis issue of reproductive freedom by seeking to restrict, limit, and \neliminate a woman's right to choose.\n  This ban on abortion in overseas military facilities, reinstated last \nyear, represented just more of the same. I point out these efforts to \nturn back the clock on a woman's reproductive rights will never erase \nthe fact that the highest court in the land reaffirmed a woman's basic \nand fundamental right to a safe and legal abortion time after time, \nagain and again, in decision after decision.\n  Last year's successful effort to reinstate that ban was another \nfrontal assault on the principle of reproductive freedom and the \ndignity of women's lives. We all know that this ban denies the right to \nchoose for female military personnel and dependents. It denies those \nwomen who have voluntarily decided to serve our country in the Armed \nForces safe and legal medical care, simply because they were assigned \nto duty in other countries.\n  What kind of reward is that? Why does this Congress want to punish \nthose women who so bravely serve our country overseas by denying them \nthe rights that are guaranteed to all Americans under the Constitution?\n  It did not occur to me that women's constitutional rights were \nterritorial. It did not occur to me that when American women in our \nArmed Forces get visas and passports stamped when they go abroad, they \nare supposed to leave their fundamental constitutional rights at the \nproverbial door.\n  I think it is regrettable that in this debate we are talking about \ndenying women their rights because they are serving in our military in \noverseas facilities. We are denying them their option to have a safe \nand legal medical procedure because they happen to be working for this \ncountry overseas. The taxpayers are not required to pay for this \nprocedure. This procedure is paid for by the woman's personal fund. \nThat is the way it was, under the law, between 1979 and 1988. And as we \nknow, at that time, in 1988, the policy was reversed. It was reinstated \nto lift the ban in 1993.\n  I, frankly, cannot understand why we are suggesting that there should \nbe a two-tiered policy for women if they happen to serve in the \nmilitary overseas. We are saying, by virtue of that\n\n[[Page S6463]]\n\nfact, you will not have the same medical care in this legal procedure \nthat is recognized under the law in this country, and has been \nreaffirmed time and again by the highest court in the land.\n  Military personnel stationed overseas still vote, they pay taxes, \nthey are protected and, as well, are punished under U.S. law. Whether \nwe agree about the issue of abortion, or not, we do not have the right \nto deny them their right to have access to a legal and safe medical \nprocedure. What we are saying is that this ban, basically, forces women \nto put their health at risk. They will be forced to seek out unsafe \nmedical care in countries where the blood supply is not safe, in many \ninstances, where the procedures are antiquated, where their equipment \nmay not be sterile. I do not believe it is appropriate, nor right, to \nforce our military personnel to make additional sacrifices beyond the \nones they are already making in serving their country.\n  Now, we are not saying that we should force any medical personnel to \nperform this procedure. There is a conscience clause for all three \nservices in the Armed Forces. No one is required to perform this \nprocedure. If they have a moral, religious, or ethical objection to \nabortion, they do not have to participate in this procedure. I think we \nall think that is reasonable. But what is unreasonable is saying to \nwomen: Sorry, we are not going to allow you to have the same medical \nrights if you serve in the military because you happen to be overseas. \nI do not see anything reasonable about that standard. It is unfair, and \nit is dangerous.\n  Last year, the New York Times, I think, expressed the bottom line on \nthis ban when they said in an editorial: ``They can fight for their \ncountry, they can die for their country, but they cannot get access to \na full range of medical services when their country stations them \noverseas.''\n  I really think that this becomes an extreme policy. It puts women in \na crisis position, and we in this Chamber have to stand up and say \nenough is enough. Unfortunately, someday, it may be too late when we \nfinally do.\n  So I hope that the Members of this Senate will support the amendment \nthat has been offered by Senator Murray from Washington, because it is \nan appropriate, reasonable approach to a very difficult issue. I do not \nthink that we want to be in a position of requiring women who serve in \nour military to be subjected to or be victim to unsafe medical \nprocedures because we happen to differ with that procedure. This is \ntheir money, and it is their right to make this decision. It is a \nprocedure recognized by the law of this country and by the Supreme \nCourt. We owe it to them to have the right to make that decision and, \nobviously, they are going to pay for it. And now we are saying that we \nare sorry, we are going to deny them this option under very difficult \ncircumstances.\n  There are not many options available to a woman stationed overseas, \nwho has to make this very difficult and personal decision to terminate \na pregnancy. So I hope that we will consider this in the proper \ncontext. It is her right to make that decision under the law of this \nland. That should apply to them when they are serving this country \noverseas.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators \nMurray and Snowe in offering an amendment to repeal the restrictions \nbarring American women serving overseas from accessing abortion \nservices in military hospitals.\n  This amendment simply grants women who have volunteered to serve and \nprotect their country the same rights as every other American woman. \nThis amendment allows them to pay their own funds to access medical \ncare at a military hospital if they choose to terminate a pregnancy. \nThis amendment allows women serving this country to avoid increasing \nmilitary expenses by having to leave the host country to travel to the \nUnited States to seek medical care that is available in a nearby \nmilitary medical facility.\n  Women in the military are fighting to protect the constitution of the \nUnited States. We should not deny these women their constitutional \nrights, rights enjoyed in every State in the Union. The right to choose \nto have an abortion is protected by our Constitution.\n  It would be unconscionable to force women serving overseas to seek \nthe services of hospitals in host countries. We have no way of ensuring \nthat these hospitals have sufficiently trained employees, standards of \nsanitation comparable to those in America, or adequate facilities. Our \nmilitary hospitals maintain world class facilities.\n  Before 1974, hundreds of women died or suffered terribly because they \nhad abortions outside of proper medical facilities. Women serving this \ncountry should not face that prospect again.\n  One of the reasons we have military hospitals is to ensure that our \nmilitary personnel get the best medical treatment possible. Women \nserving overseas have already volunteered to risk their lives in order \nto protect this country. We cannot place an additional and senseless \nrisk upon them by turning them away from military medical care.\n  This ban also affects women who are not even in the military \nthemselves. Wives of military personnel also utilize military hospitals \noverseas. These women have sacrificed in order to move overseas to keep \ntheir families intact. Denying their access to quality care if they \nchoose to terminate a pregnancy is no way to thank them.\n  I would like to point out that this amendment in no way forces anyone \nto abrogate their religious or moral beliefs. All three branches of the \nmilitary have a ``conscience clause'' which will remain intact. The \nclause permits medical personnel who have any objection to abortion to \nnot participate in the procedure.\n  There was never any Congressional consultation when, in 1988, the \nDepartment of Defense issued an administrative order prohibiting women \nfrom obtaining abortion services in military facilities overseas. Prior \nto 1988, women could obtain abortions in military facilities with \nprivate funds. President Clinton lifted the ban by Executive Order on \nJanuary 20, 1993. This amendment merely upholds a policy that is \ncurrently in effect and was before 1988 as well.\n  We are here today to improve the safety of women serving in the \nmilitary overseas. We are here today to protect wives living overseas \nwith their military husbands. We are here today to uphold what has been \nconfirmed as a constitutional right time and time again since Roe \nversus Wade in 1974. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment \ntoday.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I support Senator Murray's amendment \nto repeal the provision of current law that prohibits a woman in the \narmed services from using her own funds to pay for an abortion in an \noverseas U.S. military facility. I support this amendment for several \nreasons.\n  First, the Supreme Court has clearly established a woman's right to \nchoose. That right is not suspended simply because a woman serves in \nthe U.S. military or is married to a U.S. servicemember.\n  Second, women based in the United States and using a U.S.-based \nmilitary facility are not prohibited from using their own funds to pay \nfor an abortion. Having a prohibition on the use of U.S. military \nfacilities overseas creates a double standard, and an undue hardship on \nwomen servicemembers stationed overseas.\n  Third, private facilities may not be readily available in other \ncountries. For example, abortion is illegal in the Philippines. A woman \nstationed in that country or the spouse of a servicemember would need \nto fly to the U.S. or to another country--at her own expense--to obtain \nan abortion. We don't pay our servicemembers enough to assume they can \nsimply jet off to Switzerland for medical treatment.\n  Fourth, if women do not have access to military facilities or to \nprivate facilities in the country they are stationed, they could \nendanger their own health by the delay involved in getting to a \nfacility or by being forced to seek an abortion by someone other than a \nlicensed physician.\n  We know from personal experience in this country that when abortion \nis illegal, desperate women are often forced into unsafe and life-\nthreatening situations in back alleys. If it were your wife, or your \ndaughter, would you want her in the hands of an untrained abortionist \non the back streets of Manila or Cordoba, Argentina? Or would you \nprefer that she have access to medical treatment by a trained physician \nin a U.S. military facility?\n  Not only would these women be risking their health and lives under \nnormal\n\n[[Page S6464]]\n\nconditions, but what if these women are facing complicated or life-\nthreatening pregnancies and are unaware of the seriousness of their \ncondition?\n  We are asking these women to risk their lives in the service of their \ncountry.\n  Current law does not force any military physician to perform an \nabortion against his or her will. All branches have a ``conscience \nclause'' that permits medical personnel to choose not to perform the \nprocedure. What we are talking about today is providing equal access to \nmilitary medical facilities, wherever they are located, for a legal \nprocedure paid for with one's own money.\n  Abortion is legal for American women. U.S. servicemembers would pay \nwith their own funds. To deny them access to medical treatment they can \ntrust is wrong. It's that simple. I urge my colleagues to vote for this \namendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Murray \namendment.\n  This amendment will repeal the bill's ban on privately funded \nabortions at military medical facilities overseas.\n  Let's be very clear what we're talking about here today. It is a very \nsimple question. Are women who are defending our Nation women who \nsacrifice every day in military service to our country going to be \ntreated as second class citizens when it comes to the health care they \nreceive?\n  The bill before us answers ``yes'' to that question. Mr. President, \nthat is simply unacceptable. Our military women are not second-class \ncitizens and we cannot treat them as if they were.\n  Mr. President, safe and legal access to abortion is the law of the \nland. It is a matter of simple fairness that our servicewomen, as well \nas the spouses and dependents of servicemen, be able to exercise that \nright when they are stationed overseas.\n  When people enlist in the Armed Services, they do not choose where \nthey are to be stationed. They go where our military decides they are \nneeded. They are often sent to remote locations where the only access \nto quality, safe medical care is in a military facility.\n  While they are sent all over the world to defend our freedoms, isn't \nthe very least we owe them the right to exercise the same freedoms they \nwould enjoy if they remained here at home?\n  By adopting this amendment we will enable military women to exercise \ntheir right to reproductive freedom. The amendment does not involve the \nuse of any taxpayer funding. What this amendment will ensure is the \nright of women to obtain a safe and legal abortion paid for with their \nown funds. And, of course, under this amendment the conscience clause \nfor military personnel who do not wish to perform abortions would be \nretained. So no military personnel would be compelled to perform \nabortions.\n  Adoption of this amendment will ensure that women in the Armed \nServices have access to safe medical care. Let's do the right thing. \nLet's not treat our servicewomen like second-class citizens. They give \nso much in service to our country. They deserve no less than to be \ntreated fairly by us.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \namendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the language in this bill is an \nunsupportable effort to take away a fundamental, legal right from women \nin uniform and female military dependents overseas--the right to use \ntheir own funds to obtain a legal abortion.\n  The amendment we are considering today is simply a return to previous \nDOD policy that stood for many, many years.\n  It is, quite simply, about treating these women fairly and equitably, \nand giving them the same rights that women in this country have.\n  These women are in service to their country--our country--overseas, \nprotecting our fundamental freedoms.\n  But this ban would deny them the same freedom that women in this \ncountry are granted--the right to safe, legal, and comprehensive \nreproductive services.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Murray-Snowe amendment, and \nstrike this offensive language from the bill. We have no right to ask \nthese women to sacrifice more than they already have in service to \ntheir country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield 3 or 4 minutes?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would just like to inquire of the \nSenator from Washington. If I understand the situation correctly, if a \nwoman were coming back to the United States, by and large she has to \nask for leave, does she not, to be able to come back to the United \nStates?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is my understanding that she would \nhave to ask for leave to come back to the United States in order to \nhave the medical procedure take place.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is my understanding that there may have to be reasons \nstated for the leave, in some circumstances, depending on the \nparticular situation. I would call that sort of a violation of privacy. \nBut in some areas, in some situations, as I understand it, they may \nvery well have to reveal the reasons for that leave. Or if they were to \nreturn to the United States and have the procedure and develop \ncomplications and needed more time, they would have to request \nadditional leave time and, more often than not, they would have to \nindicate their reasons for it.\n  Now, of course, if a woman made the decision here in the United \nStates and then ran into complications, they would have to justify why \nthey were not meeting military requirements, in any event. But it seems \nto me that while imposing the requirements for leave, you are also \nstating, more often than not, as I understand it, that they have to \ngive reasons or a justification, which is a privacy issue. If they run \ninto any complications, there are additional issues both in terms of \nleave and additional privacy issues. It seems to me that this is \nanother factor that might not make the greatest difference to some \nindividuals. But I would think that adding this kind of emotional \ntrauma that is being experienced through this whole kind of a procedure \nis particularly unfortunate, and I think probably unfair, certainly, to \nthe women as well. I was just interested in the Senator's understanding \nabout the situation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts is \nabsolutely correct. With the language as it is currently written in the \nDOD bill, without my amendment, this will force women in the military \noverseas--in Bosnia, in Turkey, or in many other places--to go to their \nsupervisor and request a leave. Most likely, they would be asked to \ntell them why, which would be a very difficult situation for many. They \nwould be subject to their supervisor's decision about whether or not \nthey would be granted leave. That would put women in a very awkward and \nunfair position.\n  I should add that, if the abortion is delayed, the woman's life \nbecomes more in danger. In many circumstances, that would be delayed if \nshe requested leave. It could be delayed if she traveled to this \ncountry. If she is granted leave and traveled to this country, as the \nSenator has stated, if the complications arise, as they can, she would \nthen be subject to having to go back to that supervisor again and ask \nfor additional leave.\n  This is an extremely unfair situation. It can be rectified very \neasily by this amendment that would allow a woman to use her own \nprivate money. We are not asking for taxpayer dollars. We are saying \nthat a woman can use her own money to go into the military facility \nwhere we have excellent personnel overseas to perform a safe medical \nprocedure.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Finally, the point was made here on the floor that the \nfacility will have been built with American taxpayers' money and the \ndoctors are going to be paid their salary with taxpayers' money. Does \nthe Senator not find the distinction between that and having space \navailable on a plane which is paid for by the taxpayers, piloted by the \ntaxpayers--does the Senator find that the logic is failing in those who \nare opposed to the amendment to say that on the one hand it looks like \nit is being tax supported and on the other hand it is not? I have been \nsingularly unconvinced about that part of the argument which we have \nheard time and time again this afternoon. I do not see how that logic \nholds up to the light of day.\n\n[[Page S6465]]\n\n  I do not know whether the Senator had some additional insight that \nmight be able to clarify that.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am really glad that the Senator asked about the \ntaxpayers' funds being used to build a military facility. Frankly, I \nfind those arguments very offensive because, as taxpayers in this \ncountry, we provide dollars for many facilities across this country. \nBut we have singled out women who are overseas serving us in countries \noverseas, and have told them that they cannot use their own private \ndollars to pay for a medical service in those facilities. We pay for \nmany other services in those facilities, but we will not provide an \nabortion for those women. Yet, the Senator is absolutely correct; she \nwill have to fly back to this country in a military plane paid for by \ntaxpayer dollars. She will eat meals on that plane paid for by taxpayer \ndollars. All of us use taxpayer dollars when we travel on the roads, \nwhen we use our public schools, when we go to our colleges, when we \nhave the police come to our house, or when we have a firetruck come to \nthe House.\n  Why are we singling out women who need a medical procedure and \nexpanding the use of taxpayers' funds in that terminology? I find that \nvery offensive.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Does the Senator find offensive as well the fact that a \nwoman who is in the service is paying taxpayer dollars and others who \nmight want to use those facilities for this purpose are contributors \nand paying taxes? The last time I checked on it, they were. So here \nthey are paying their fair share of the taxes into it. But in this \nparticular time of medical need there is this arbitrary policy which \nwould deny the best in terms of health care. It is being denied to \nthem.\n  I thank the Senator. I think she has made a very powerful case, and \nothers have added to it. I hope her position will be sustained.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I will add that \nnot only is that woman paying her taxes but she is serving our country \noverseas. She is serving every single one of us; making us safe here at \nhome. She deserves to have us take care of her when she has a medical \nneed.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Bingaman and \nSenator Inouye as cosponsors to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield for a question to the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Would the present description of the law place an undue burden on \nwomen serving in the military overseas? In 1992, the Supreme Court \ndecision about Planned Parenthood said that Government regulations may \nnot constitute an undue burden on the right to an abortion, and this \nban would be an undue burden by placing an obstacle in the path of the \nwoman seeking an abortion.\n  So would the Senator agree that this certainly would represent an \nobstacle in the path of a woman making this decision and having access \nto a safe medical procedure? Because certainly a combination of \nmilitary regulations and the practical world would mean that someone \nwho needs it, who made this decision, would face lengthy travel, \nserious delays, expenses, substandard medical options, restricted \ninformation, would have to fly home, and certainly in my opinion--I ask \nthe Senator if she would agree--this ban appears to be \nunconstitutionally burdening the right of a woman to make this decision \nbecause it places a number of obstacles in the way of her making that \ndecision and having access to the procedures that are available here in \nthe United States which are legal under the law of the land.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would agree with the Senator. This places many undue \nobstacles in front of the woman who is serving in the military overseas \nsuch as asking through her supervisor for permission to leave. This is \nnot something anyone here has to ask for who is serving here or who is \nnot serving here. It means that a woman would have to fly home--\nsometimes hours of travel, sometimes weeks of delay in getting a flight \nout of some of the countries which we are asking our young women to \nserve in. It means a delay in the medical procedure, and it puts an \nundue burden on these women which is not faced by any other woman in \nthis country.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator for answering that question. The \nbottom line is we are treating these people as second-class citizens if \nthey do not have access to the procedures guaranteed constitutionally \nunder the law of the United States simply because of the Supreme Court \nruling.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. They are not only making a sacrifice, but these are \nwomen who are serving our country who are every day working for every \nsingle one of us to make our lives safe here. They should not be \ntreated as second-class citizens. They should be treated as first-class \ncitizens and be given the same right that every woman in this country \nhas and the access to safe medical procedures that they deserve.\n  I thank the Senator from Maine.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield to me?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend for her leadership on this. I am so \npleased she has raised this issue for the Senate. As we know, this \nCongress is narrowing women's right to choose. But I think nothing \nwould be more disturbing than what we have before us. As the Senator \nfrom Maine pointed out through her questioning and our friend brought \nout through her answers, these are women who are risking their lives by \njoining the military; are they not?\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. They are risking their lives, just as the men do, to \nfight for their country, and indeed may die for this country. Why on \nEarth would this U.S. Senate put their health at risk? That is a major \nquestion.\n  I ask my friend. Is there any case that she knows of where a man is \ndenied a particular medical procedure?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I cannot think of any case where a man is denied a \nmedical procedure who is serving in the military overseas.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wonder what my friends of the male persuasion from both \nsides of aisle would be doing on this floor if suddenly it was the case \nthat men could not get help when they were stationed abroad. They would \nsay, ``Well, regardless of what it is, we need our men in the military \nto be there. That is why we are sending them there.'' Yet, they would \ntreat women in such a way.\n  I say to my friend, what happens if a woman cannot get on a plane and \nhas to go to a hospital in a country that she is stationed in? I will \nhalf answer that. When I went to visit the troops in Saudi Arabia \nduring the Persian Gulf war, I saw the incredible health facilities \nthat they had there for our men and women in uniform. But what if such \na woman was in pain, was in a situation where she really needed help, \nand she went to the facility and was told by a military doctor, ``You \nhave to go to a local hospital''? I ask my friend to talk about what \nthat experience might be like in a place like Saudi Arabia where women \ncannot even drive their cars.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from California brings up an excellent \npoint. The way the current bill is drafted, without my amendment, it \nsimply creates foreign back alleys for our women who are serving \noverseas--for those of us who were aware before Roe v. Wade, women got \nabortions in back alleys because they were not provided medical \nfacilities. We have friends who are not able to have babies because of \na procedure that was performed in a back alley. I cannot imagine this \nSenate and this Congress putting our women who serve in uniform \noverseas at risk as we did women many years ago in this country. It \nseems to me that is really disturbing--to create foreign back alleys as \nthis current bill does.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. I say that of all of the issues that \nwe face, where women's rights to choose have been narrowed \ndramatically--if she is a Federal employee, we know that right is \nnarrowed. She cannot use her insurance. But at least she is in America \nand she is here. So she will have to make a financial sacrifice, if she \nexercises that right to choose, which is a legal right.\n  I think we need to understand what is going on here in this U.S. \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S6466]]\n\n There are those who want a constitutional amendment to completely \noutlaw a woman's right to choose. They want to make it a crime. You \nknow they cannot do it because the people of America do not support \nthat. So what they are doing instead is attacking us--one group at a \ntime; Federal employee women over here one day, poor women over here \nthe next day, and women who live in D.C. the third day. And today it is \nwomen who serve in the military overseas. They are the ones who will be \nsubjected to, as my friend says, the foreign back alley. Let me tell \nyou, the back alleys of America were not friendly. I lived in those \ndays. I know those days. If there is anything I can do, and I know the \nSenator from Maine feels as strongly--this crosses party lines--we will \nmake sure that we never return to the days of the back alley.\n\n  I think this is just one more attempt to harm the women of this \ncountry, the women who are sacrificing for their country. By supporting \nSenator Murray's amendment, we will go a long way in telling those \nwomen we respect they should not have to answer to another set of laws \nto put their health in jeopardy any more than they are put in jeopardy \nin the fact they are willing on a daily basis to lay their lives on the \nline.\n  I thank my friend. I yield back my time to her.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague from California for a very eloquent \nstatement and for her support of this extremely important amendment \nthat sends a message to women who serve our country overseas that they \nwill be treated equal to any other woman who is a citizen in this \ncountry today.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 26\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. And how much time remains on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-eight.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President I ask my friend from Indiana if he intends \nto use any more of his time?\n  Mr. COATS. I would like to respond to the statements that have been \nmade, but I would tell the Senator from Washington that depending on \nwhether or not she has more speakers on her side, I would be prepared \nto yield back a substantial amount of time if we could come to \nagreement on both yielding back time.\n  I have been approached by some Members who have some conflicts this \nevening and are looking for a little bit of a window. One Senator on \nyour side asked if it would be possible to yield back some time. So I \nguess I would inquire of the Senator from Washington what her \nintentions are in this regard.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum to be \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I am sorry. \nThe Senator from South Carolina was asking me a question and I did not \nunderstand or hear what was propounded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request was for a quorum call, the time to \nbe equally divided.\n  Mr. COATS. That is fine. And then the Senator is going to check to \nsee what she has on her side and I will do the same, and if we can come \nto an agreement we will yield back our time. That is acceptable, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from \nWashington for giving me some portion of the time to support the \nMurray-Snowe amendment.\n  This amendment is so basic that it, frankly, kind of surprises me \nthat we say to people who we have recruited to serve in our military \nthat you leave your constitutional rights on the doorstep; that if you \nneed medical services you are willing to pay for, we are not going to \ngive them to you.\n  This amendment, as it is presented, will overturn the unreasonable, \nharsh Republican policy that prohibits servicewomen from obtaining \nabortion services in overseas military facilities, once again, even if \nthey are willing out of their own pockets to pay for these health \nservices.\n  Essentially, the current law that was passed by the Republican \nCongress forces servicewomen to leave their constitutional rights \nbehind, at the water's edge.\n  I am familiar, Mr. President, with the struggle to protect \nconstitutional rights of servicewomen. In 1991 and 1992, I led the \nfight to overturn this policy. I had an amendment pass the Senate twice \nto overturn this unfair restriction. Unfortunately, President Bush \nthreatened to veto the entire defense appropriations bill over this \nprovision and thus it was dropped in conference. But the 1992 election \nchanged all of this. On the second day of the Clinton administration, \nPresident Clinton restored servicewomen's constitutional rights by \nexecutive authority.\n  Tragically, the Republican Congress reversed the Clinton policy. But \nthey are not just reversing a Clinton policy. What they are saying to \nthose individuals, who have every right under the law to make a choice \nabout whether or not they continue a pregnancy, is that they will not \nbe able, practically, to do it; they will not be able to have an \nabortion if they choose.\n  I am not promoting abortion. I am saying every woman has a right \nunder our law to make that decision. What they are saying is if you \nhappen to be stationed in a country that prohibits abortion and you \nwant, nevertheless, to have quality service, you are restricted. You \ncan choose to go to a back alley someplace and take the terrible chance \nthat involves, or else you can sometimes be standby on a flight out of \nthat country to a friendlier place. The problem is these flights are \noften filled and you could wait for months--months that would, perhaps, \nput a pregnancy into a stage of development that no one would want to \nsee terminated.\n  So this is a terrible imposition, I think. We are asking people to \nserve. We are telling them they will be rewarded for their loyal \nservice. We tell them they may undergo danger, they may in fact lose \ntheir lives, but they do so on behalf of their country. I salute their \nbravery and their courage. But I think it would be terrible at the same \ntime to say, if you need a medical service that is available, that you \nare not going to be able to get it because you are in the military.\n  So I hope our colleagues in the Senate will look at this \nrealistically and say we are not encouraging any choice for anyone to \nmake that is not totally their own. But we are also saying if you \nenlist, if you raise your hand, take the oath, promise to serve your \ncountry faithfully under virtually any condition, that you do not lose \nyour rights as a woman to make a decision that is available to every \nother woman in this country.\n  I yield the floor and hope the Murray-Snowe amendment, a very \nthoughtful piece of legislation, will be agreed to and will amend what \nI think is an egregious violation of a right that belongs to every \nwoman in this country, particularly those who join the service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this amendment.\n  Last year, in both the National Defense Authorization Act and the \nDefense appropriations bill, the Congress spoke on this issue. Both of \nthese bills included a prohibition on performing abortions in military \nhospitals and clinics overseas except in cases of rape, incest, and \nwhere the life of the mother is at risk. The President signed both of \nthese bills.\n  Now, Senator Murray is proposing that we repeal the law enacted last \nyear. I would suggest that more debate on abortion within the Senate is \nnot going to change any Senator's vote. I\n\n[[Page S6467]]\n\nhope we can agree to limit the discussion and vote.\n  I just want to say this. There is a question here whether you are \ngoing to have abortions wide open for any purpose, any time, any place, \nor you are only going to have them in cases of rape, incest, and where \nthe life of the mother is at risk. That is the issue here. I think \nSenators ought to understand it.\n  If you want to preserve life except in cases of rape, incest, and \nwhere the life of the mother is at risk, then you oppose the amendment \nof the Senator from Washington. But if you favor wide open abortions, \nas I said, at any time, any place, for any purpose, then, of course, \nyou support her in this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington. I thank her for her leadership \non this particular amendment.\n  This is a matter that we have considered a number of times. We are \nall familiar with the arguments. I describe my position, not as pro-\nabortion, but as pro-choice. I believe that abortions ought to be safe, \nlegal, and rare. But I do not think, under any circumstances, that we \nought to deprive those people who happen to be stationed overseas from \nhaving the same legal and safe medical procedures that are available to \nthose of us here in the United States.\n  I respect the very significant differences of opinion for ethical, \nmoral, and religious reasons that many hold. This is not asking that \nthe Federal Government provide any funds. It simply is allowing those \nfolks who are stationed overseas to use the facilities.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS. I have been discussing with the Senator from Washington \nthe timing here. I have some responses I would like to make to \nstatements that have been made. I do not anticipate that will take more \nthan 10 minutes at the most, probably less. I know the Senator from \nWashington has indicated an interest in just taking a couple of minutes \nto wrap up the debate in support of her amendment, at which point, I \nbelieve, we would both be ready to go to a vote.\n  I say that to notify Members, who may be watching the debate who are \ninterested in when we will vote, it appears we will vote earlier than \nthe time originally projected, in terms of the 2-hour debate, maybe as \nearly as the next 10 or 15 minutes. I just say that to alert Members.\n  I would like to respond to some of the things that have been said \nrelative to the Murray amendment. I sit here somewhat baffled by the \nremarks that I have heard, because it sounds to me as if a crisis \nsituation exists that is in immediate search of solution, relative to \nfemale members of our armed services and their dependents obtaining the \nright to have an abortion if they so chose. But the problem described \nand the rhetoric used to describe the situation is totally at odds with \nthe facts of the situation.\n  The picture that has been painted is a false picture. We are left \nwith the perception, as presented by supporters of the Murray \namendment, that we are placing women who serve in our military in \nextraordinarily dangerous situations; that the policy currently in \neffect is forcing them into foreign back alleys, that their health and \nperhaps even their life is in jeopardy if we do not immediately repeal \na policy which has been in place for a very substantial period of time \nand has caused no problems.\n\n  There have been no complaints registered by women in the military. \nThere have been no incidents of problems relative to women being unable \nto have an abortion. There has been no denial of constitutional rights. \nYet we keep hearing about these terrible health risks that are being \nforced on women who serve in our military overseas. Terms were used: \nThe cruel, indecent, inhumane policies; women have been victimized; it \nis extreme policy. I just wrote down some of the things that were \nsaid. ``Placing huge obstacles in front of women.''\n\n  That just simply is not the case, Mr. President. Those are not the \nfacts. If those were the facts of the situation, there might be a basis \nfor at least debating, in seriousness, the Murray amendment.\n  I would like to quote from a response to a letter that I sent to the \nAssistant Secretary of Defense to try to ascertain the facts of the \ncase. I asked him several questions. I said:\n\n       Has the Department of Defense had any difficulty in \n     implementing the current policy?\n\n  That is the policy in effect that basically said military facilities \nwill not be used to perform abortions on the basis of an elective \nabortion, not an abortion in terms of a need for abortion, but an \nabortion which is simply elective, a woman wanting an abortion.\n\n       Has the Department had any difficulty in implementing the \n     current policy?\n\n  Answer: No.\n\n       Have any formal complaints been filed concerning this \n     policy, to the best of your knowledge and information?\n\n  The answer: No; no formal complaints have been filed.\n\n       Have any legal challenges been instituted concerning this \n     policy?\n\n  The answer: No.\n\n       Have any members or their dependents been denied access to \n     an abortion as a result of this policy?\n\n  I think that is a very important point here. I am not sure our \ncolleagues are listening. But the question I posed to the Secretary of \nDefense is, have any members or their dependents been denied access to \nan abortion as a result of the policy that the Senator from Washington \nis seeking to overturn? And the answer was no.\n  I do not understand what the problem is. There has not been a denial \nof constitutional rights for women. There has not been a denial of \naccess to abortion for women. The policy has been to enforce a policy \nthat was adopted not just by Republicans but also by Democrats, I will \nstate to my friend from New Jersey, that taxpayers' funds in the \nperformance of abortions should not be used. That is a policy that has \nbeen upheld by the Supreme Court, which said simply because someone has \na constitutional right to something does not mean the taxpayer has to \nfund that right.\n  That case is Harris versus McCray, which basically upheld the Hyde \nlanguage.\n  What we are seeking to do here is uphold the Hyde language which has \nbeen adopted on numerous occasions by Republicans and Democrats, in \nboth the House and in the Senate, as it applies to use of military \nfacilities which are constructed, operated, paid for, doctors are paid \nfor, equipment is purchased, all with taxpayer money.\n  Now, if it was a valid argument that we were forcing women into \nforeign back alleys, I think that is a legitimate question for us to \naddress, because these women are serving in the interest of their \ncountry and they are being deployed to places that would not \nnecessarily be a place of their choosing.\n  But that is not the case, because the Department of Defense will \nprovide transportation back to whatever place that woman wants to go \nto, and I do not know of anybody who has to wait weeks for that \ntransportation, because I asked that question also of the Assistant \nSecretary of Defense:\n\n       Have any members or their dependents been denied access to \n     military transport for the purpose of procuring an abortion?\n\n  The answer is no, none. Nobody has filed a complaint saying they have \nbeen denied access. Nobody has raised a question saying they have had \nto wait weeks. No one has said, ``I have been forced into a back \nalley.'' They have had the opportunity to seek legal, safe abortions \nwithout risk to their health.\n  If there is a risk to their health in such a way that it endangers \ntheir life or potentially endangers their life, or the abortion is as a \nresult of a rape or incest, then that woman can obtain an abortion from \na military facility. We do not want to deny them that opportunity in \nthat situation. That is an abortion that is needed.\n  But an abortion that is just simply wanted, for whatever reason, we \nare simply saying we do not believe the taxpayers should have to fund \nan abortion simply because a woman wants an abortion. Now, if that \nwoman wants an\n\n[[Page S6468]]\n\nabortion and she has the right to get that abortion under the law, we \nare not denying her that right.\n  It is just difficult for me to understand the rhetoric that is used \nby people who say we are taking away the constitutional rights of \nwomen.\n  (Mr. GORTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. COATS. I will be happy to yield for questions from the Senator \nfrom California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, I thank you for yielding.\n  The issue here is equal treatment under the law, basically. You have \na man who has to have a procedure performed that is a legal procedure. \nNo one tells him he has to get on a plane. No one asks him all the \ndetails. No one puts him on a plane, takes him out of his duty station, \nflies him back. I tell you, if you did that to any one of these \nSenators here who might have been in the military, you would antagonize \nevery man on this Senate floor.\n  You are not treating a woman who wants to get a medical procedure in \nthe same fashion. You may not like it, my colleague, and I respect your \nview and others on the Senate floor who I see here who want to take \naway a woman's right to choose, who want to take women back to the old \ndays, but the point is: How do you justify treating a woman who wants a \nlegal medical procedure different than a man who wants a legal medical \nprocedure?\n  I see my friend from Pennsylvania smiling about this. He may find it \nvery amusing, but I might just say to my friend----\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from California what her \nquestion is.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I ask my friend, how does he justify treating a \nwoman who wants to get a legal procedure in a different fashion from a \nman who wants to get a legal medical procedure?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, in answer to the question of the Senator \nfrom California, I state to the Senator from California that there is a \nwhole list of elective procedures that is not covered in military \nhospitals, not covered by military medicine, depending on the size of \nthe facility, depending on the location of the facility, and, frankly, \nthere are a series of things that are not covered, so men are denied \nelective procedures in a number of instances.\n\n  So it is not a question here of equal treatment under the law, that \nthis is the only medical procedure not allowed to people who serve in \nthe military. We are simply saying, and I think the Senator has not \naddressed the point, we are simply saying that in the question of the \nutilization--Mr. President, is the Senator interested in my answer?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, very seriously, if you look a woman \nin the eye who decides to exercise her legal right to choose, that she \nhas a certain frame of time in which to make that painful, difficult, \npersonal decision with her God, with her doctor, with her family, you \ndo not put her on a plane. That is not an elective procedure.\n  My friend can view it a different way, but I seriously question the \nfact that this is an elective procedure when a woman finds herself in \nthis circumstance.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the Senator from California and I, \nobviously, have a difference of opinion on this. Let me see if I can \nrefocus the debate.\n  The question here is not over a woman's right to choose. The question \nis not over whether a woman has the right to an abortion. While the \nSenator from California and I disagree on the current legal status of \nthat question, the Supreme Court has granted a woman the right to an \nabortion. That is not the issue that we are debating. That is not what \nthis amendment is about.\n  This amendment is focused on a fairly narrow question, and that is \nwhether or not taxpayers' dollars ought to be used to provide abortion \nfor women who serve in the military. There would be a problem here in \ndenying a woman's access to abortion and perhaps impeding her \nconstitutional rights if there were not alternatives available to that \nparticular woman.\n  But there are alternatives available. And the Department of Defense \nhas made sure those alternatives are available. There is no recorded \ncase in the Department of Defense where there was ever a complaint \nraised. That is why I said this seems to be a solution in search of a \nproblem. If we had a documented series of a list of problems--\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Indiana yield for a \nquestion? It is only to ask about time.\n  Mr. COATS. I do not wish to use a whole lot of time. But I was asked \na fairly provocative question, and I thought I would give the answer.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. We want to give our Members a time agreement. How much \nmore time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. COATS. I am hoping to wrap up very shortly.\n  But I hope when Members come over here we can separate fact from \nfiction. I hope Members will look at the facts of the case and make a \ndecision on that basis, rather than look at the fiction that has been \nprovided to us today by proponents of the amendment, because this is \nnot a question of a woman's right to choose. That is a separate \nquestion. We can debate that. We are not debating that today, at least \nI did not think we were debating that today.\n  The issue here is simply whether or not a woman in the military \nshould use a military facility for an elective abortion, paid for by \nher funds for the cost of the procedure, but impossible to separate \nfrom the use of taxpayer funds in constructing, operating, hiring \ndoctors, purchasing equipment, and the other associated costs with \ntaxpayer funds provided in military hospitals.\n  The military has no recorded evidence of anybody being denied access, \ndenied transportation, denied the opportunity to get the abortion that \nthey seek. We can deal with the other issue at another time. But to \ncharacterize this policy as cruel, indecent, inhumane, the denial of \nwomen's rights, dangerous, back-alley foreign abortions simply, I \nthink, does not characterize and should not characterize this debate \nbecause that is not what this issue is about.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COATS. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. What happens if the woman wants to have the procedure \ndone--the Senator has agreed that under present law she can request \nthat--in a country that has a prohibition within their population? That \neliminates medical service there.\n  The Senator further says that you cannot use the military medical \nfacility because of the fungibility of funds. Would the Senator be \nwilling to say to the military, that you must guarantee that a flight \nbe made available within a 3-day period, a 5-day period, to a U.S. \nmilitary medical facility that will accommodate her need and to make \nsure that that trip can be arranged within a 5-day period?\n  Would the Senator be willing to guarantee, since the Senator says he \nhas no interest in stopping the procedure--his concern is about the \nfungibility of the funds--that we would guarantee that this individual \nwould have access to an abortion, respecting the rights, by the way, of \nany conscientious objection by a physician who might not want to do it \nor medical personnel?\n  Mr. COATS. If that was a problem, it is something that we might want \nto consider. But according to the Department of Defense, it is not a \nproblem, never been a problem. Again, it is a solution, a mandate, that \nis not necessary because there has never been a problem with that.\n\n  If a woman in the military is in a country that does not provide \nabortions by law, obviously that woman is free to travel to another \ncountry or back to the United States. In the case of--I am not even \nsure of what Italy allows, but if you are stationed in Italy, you \nusually travel to Germany to get an abortion or a neighboring country. \nIt is just not a problem. I do not think we need to legislate something \nthat is not a problem.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield to anyone else that seeks time. \nBut I think we are just replowing old ground here. If the Senator from \nWashington wants to wrap up, we can notify our colleagues that within a \nvery short time we expect a vote. I am going to move to table as soon \nas the Senator from Washington is finished.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if the Senator from Indiana is willing to \nyield back time, I will use 30 seconds.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am more than willing to do that. I will \nyield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has yielded back his\n\n[[Page S6469]]\n\ntime. The Senator from Washington is recognized for 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Once again, I urge my colleagues to vote for this very simple \namendment. It will allow our women who serve in our military overseas \nto use their own private funds to get a safe, legal abortion in our \nmilitary facilities overseas.\n  We have talked a lot about the women in our military, but this also \naffects the wives and the daughters of our servicemen who serve \noverseas. They, too, should have the ability to have a safe, legal \nprocedure.\n  I have heard that no complaints have been filed. But I tell my \ncolleagues that this puts a woman in a very serious position, if she \ndoes complain, and she is in the military. It could have career \nimplications. And it could have personal implications. It does not \nsurprise me that the Senator from Indiana has not heard of any \ncomplaints. But I assure you, this does put women's lives in jeopardy. \nIt puts obstacles in front of them that clearly violate their equal \nprotection under the law. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment, and I yield back my additional time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I move to table the pending amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the amendment by the Senator from Washington. The yeas \nand nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato] \nand the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams] are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] and \nthe Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nArkansas [Mr. Bumpers] would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4059) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4060\n\n   (Purpose: To reduce the amount authorized to be appropriated for \n     military construction in order to eliminate authorizations of \nappropriations for certain military construction projects not included \n in the Administration request for such projects for fiscal year 1997)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Glenn, proposes an amendment numbered 4060.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of title XXVII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2706. REDUCTION IN AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR \n                   CERTAIN MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS NOT \n                   REQUESTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, the \n     total amount authorized to be appropriated by this division \n     is hereby decreased by $598,764,000.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. First of all, I would like to say that I am perfectly \nagreeable to a time agreement to be entered into immediately. I hope \nthat the other side understands. There is an objection on the other \nside. But I do not believe this amendment should take too long. I would \nbe glad to enter into a time agreement at any time during this \ndiscussion.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield without losing his right to the \nfloor?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to so yield to the Senator from \nVermont without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do not have a particular position on this \none. I would be delighted with whatever time agreement we might enter \ninto. But I see the deputy Republican leader on the floor. I am just \nwondering with time agreements and all if we might have some idea. What \nis the schedule tonight? For those of us who have faint glimmers of \nfamily-friendly situations, I just wonder. I am perfectly willing to \ncontinue to vote for the rest of the evening, or stack votes. I am not \nthe one to make that choice. I wonder if someone could give us an idea.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to yield to the Senator from \nOklahoma for purposes of answering.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, there has been no formal agreement. I \nwill tell my colleagues that we are trying to complete this bill. We \nhave a lot of amendments. I understand the request of the Senator from \nVermont. I think it is the intention of the majority leader to press on \ntonight, probably until--this time has not been announced but I will \nguess until about 9 o'clock and then probably continue later to stack \nvotes for a later time. It is vitally important that we move forward.\n  I will consult with the majority leader and will report back very \nsoon.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my friend from Arizona for making it possible to \nmake that inquiry of the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield to the \nSenator from Illinois for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, if I may suggest to the new leadership over \nthere, as one who is not going to be around here too long, I think we \nought to accommodate families as much as possible. So in the evenings \nwhen you can stack the votes I think it is desirable to do so. I just \npass that along and suggest it to the new whip. I congratulate him \npublicly on that. I see that Senator Craig is here. I think to the \nextent that you can accommodate family life here it improves the United \nStates Senate.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague \nfrom Illinois. I might mention the Senator from Arizona asked for a \ntime limit on his amendment. If Senators\n\n[[Page S6470]]\n\nand opponents of amendments are willing to enter into time agreements, \nit makes it a lot easier to stack votes. So for us to be cooperative, I \nshare the concerns to be more family friendly, and if it is possible \nfor us to stack votes for this evening so there might be time for \npeople to have dinner with their families, or something, but to do that \nit is really essential to have time agreements and have a couple of \nother amendments in order. So if we have maybe some more help \nin reaching those time agreements and ordering the next amendment, that \nwould certainly be of help.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if I might additionally comment, we are \nreaching the point in the process we go through where it is about time \nwe got hold of all of the amendments and start trying to negotiate time \nagreements on them. Obviously, the gestation period is a couple of \ndays. We need to move forward with that part of this process of getting \nthis bill through the body.\n  Mr. President, I would like to say again to my friends on the other \nside of the aisle that I would be glad to enter into a time agreement \non this amendment at any time during the discussion of this amendment. \nAs far as I know, the Senator from Ohio is the only other speaker I \nhave on this amendment; at least who is in favor of it. We would be \nglad to enter into a reasonable time agreement at any time.\n  Mr. President, I would like to describe the amendment and make a few \ncomments on it.\n  The amendment would cut nearly $600 million which was included in the \nbill for unrequested military construction and family housing projects. \nI am somewhat gratified to learn that the close scrutiny focused on \nmilitary construction pork has at least forced a degree of control on \nthe process. Most of the projects in this additional add-on of $600 \nmillion meets four of our five criteria stated in the sense-of-the-\nSenate language.\n  These criteria are that the mission is essential for, in 11 \ninstances, quality of life not inconsistent with the BRAC process in \nthe future years defense plans except when only designed money is \nauthorized and executed in fiscal year 1997. Twenty-five of the added \nprojects do not meet some other criteria. However, 10 of these are \nquality of life improvements, and the balance received only planning \nand design funding. But, Mr. President, none of the projects that were \nadded in this bill meet the fifth criteria; that is, there is an offset \nby a reduction in some other defense account.\n  These are simply $600 million add-ons. I appreciate the fact that \nevery effort was made to adhere to some credible criteria in selecting \nthe projects for these add-ons. But my objection in principle to adding \nfunds for unrequested military construction projects remains the same. \nDuring the markup of this legislation in the Armed Services Committee \nthe Readiness Subcommittee recommended a plus of $100 million for high \npriority housing projects that the Secretary of Defense had come over \nand sought additional funding for. But the subcommittee allowed the \nDepartment of Defense to determine the allocation of these projects by \nmilitary priority, not by location in any particular Senator's State.\n  Senator Glenn and I both voted against the addition of this $600 \nmillion in unrequested military construction when the amendment was \noffered in our markup. Not surprisingly we lost that vote.\n  Mr. President, this is a very disturbing, unpleasant, and in some \nways alarming situation that has been going on for some time. Since \n1990, the Congress has added more than $6 billion to the military \nconstruction accounts. I want to repeat--$6 billion to military \nconstruction accounts. This bill adds another $600 million for \nunrequested projects. At the same time the overall defense budget has \ndeclined by more than 40 percent despite our recent efforts to increase \nfunding.\n\n  Mr. President, let me explain that again. While we have increased \nover the request of the Defense Department some $6 billion in \nunrequested military construction projects--some of them the most \noutrageous, including, for example, a foundry at a base that is being \nclosed; construction of a health care facility at a base where down the \nstreet is another health care facility where they could have put \nlifetime memberships for every member of that military base; to the \naddition of a runway at a base where not far away is a very large, one \nof the largest airfields in the world. The list goes on and on. We have \nadded $6 billion to the military construction accounts while the \ndefense budget overall has decreased by some 40 percent.\n  Mr. President, we cannot do that for a whole variety of reasons, \nincluding maintaining credibility with the American people as to the \nneed for their tax dollars which are earmarked for defense, to be spent \non defense.\n  Let us look at the priority of these added projects in the overall \nbudget of the military construction. Of the total of 115 added projects \n72 of them were planned for the year 2000, or later. In fact, 14 of \nthese projects were not anywhere in the future year defense plan; \nnowhere. Nowhere could 14 of these projects be found. Of the $600 \nmillion added for the unrequested projects, almost $350 million for \nthese 72 projects was planned for the next century--were planned for \nthe next century, not this century. Surely projects planned for the \nyear 2000, 2001, 2002, or later are not as vital to the services as \nthose that are planned to be included in next year's defense budget. \nWhy did we not focus on fiscal year 1998 projects, if we are going to \nadd these military construction projects? I will tell you, Mr. \nPresident, the answer is simple. Because some of these 1998 projects \nwere not in the State or district of powerful members. It is that \nsimple. There can be no other reason. Instead, we are reaching 4 years \nout in the future years' defense plan, into the next century, to find \n29 projects that are planned in the States of members of the Armed \nServices Committee.\n\n  Let me repeat. I will be very frank. We are reaching 4 years ahead in \nthe future years' defense plan, into the next century, to fund 29 \nprojects that are planned in States of members of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  Let us be realistic. This bill is $1.7 billion above the defense \nbudget target set in the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution. That means \nwe will have to cut out some of the programs added in this bill when we \nget to conference with the House.\n  Will military construction be part of those cuts when we reach our \nnegotiations with the other body? I do not think so. Instead, we will \nprobably end up cutting some of the high-priority adds for much needed \nmodernization equipment that will enable our troops to fight and win in \nfuture conflicts.\n  With the authorizers and appropriators adding $900 million to the \nmilitary construction request, I predict the outcome of our conference \nwill be an agreement to fund most of what is in either bill, or more \nthan $1 billion in unrequested projects. After all, that is the only \nway to keep everybody happy.\n  Mr. President, I am tired of seeing us acquiesce to a practice which \nonly feeds on itself. Until we instill some discipline in our own \nmarkup process by resisting the temptation to add money simply because \nit serves our constituents, we cannot expect the Department of Defense \nto exercise discipline in resisting efforts to spend defense dollars on \nunnecessary nondefense projects.\n  Mr. President, we have made progress in reducing the total amount of \npork-barreling in the defense budget. Last year, about $4 billion of \nthe total $7 billion that was added to the defense budget was wasted on \npork-barrel projects like new attack submarines, research project \nearmarks, medical education programs, and, of course, military \nconstruction add-ons. This year, we are only wasting $2 billion. But $2 \nbillion is a lot of taxpayers' dollars to waste.\n  How do we explain to the American people why we need to spend $11 \nbillion more for defense this year when we are spending $2 billion for \nprojects that do little or nothing to contribute to our Nation's \nsecurity?\n  For the sake of ensuring public support for adequate defense spending \nnow and in the future, let us stop this practice now. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote to cut out the $600 million in unnecessary military \nconstruction spending.\n  Thanks to organizations such as the Citizens Against Government \nWaste,\n\n[[Page S6471]]\n\nCitizens for a Sound Economy, the National Taxpayers Union, and talk \nshow hosts all over America, the American people are becoming \nincreasingly aware of what kind of a process we are in. We might have \nhad some rationale back in the 1980's when we continually increased the \ndefense budget, when money for defense was quite readily available, but \nwhat we have experienced in the last 7 or 8 years is a dramatic cut in \ndefense spending, and yet the spending on unnecessary and unwanted \nprojects goes up. At some point, this is going to have to stop. I hope \nit is now. It probably will not be.\n  There are enough projects in here that there will be more than enough \nvotes to defeat this amendment. But it is not fair. It is not \nappropriate.\n  Let me point out that we still have problems with our equipment. We \ndo not have sufficient airlift and sealift and amphibious capability. \nAccording to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we are \nunderfunded as far as force modernization is concerned by some $21 \nbillion this year, and yet we are going to spend billions of dollars on \nthese unwanted projects.\n  I do not expect to win on this amendment, but I want to inform my \ncolleagues that I will not quit on this issue. I have an obligation to \nthe men and women in the military and the taxpayers of America to \ncontinue to ventilate this issue.\n  I am also pleased that we passed the line-item veto this year, which \nwill go into next year, and next year, in partnership with my colleague \nfrom Ohio, we are going to at least send a list over to the President \nof the United States for his consideration so we can cut out this \npractice which clearly the Congress of the United States does not have \nthe courage to do.\n  With that, Mr. President, at this point I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, Senator McCain and I usually are on the \nsame side, but in this particular case we are on opposite sides.\n  I rise to oppose Senator McCain's amendment to strike the funding for \n$598 million for military construction projects added to the defense \nauthorization bill during the Armed Services Committee markup. Senator \nMcCain has been persistent trying to eliminate defense spending that he \nbelieves is unnecessary and I applaud him for his persistence.\n   Mr. President, we have screened the projects that Senator McCain is \nattempting to strike with the Department of Defense. They all meet the \ncriteria that both Senator McCain and Senator Glenn worked so \ndiligently to set up. For the benefit of all Members that criteria are \nas follows: Is the project in the future year defense plan? Can \nconstruction on the project begin in fiscal year 1997? Is the project \nmission essential or a quality of life issue? And, is the project \nconsistent with base closure action?\n  The committee received requests from 62 members for construction \nprojects totaling more than $1.6 billion. Of the projects requested, \n$730 million met the committee's criteria. However, because of the \nfunding priorities, the committee agreed to fund only the highest \npriorities and those that would contribute to readiness and to the \nquality of life of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines.\n   Mr. President, I want to point out that more than $200 million of \nthe $700 million is dedicated to quality of life improvement projects \nsuch as barracks and family housing. Another $170 million is dedicated \nto training and readiness facilities. These are projects that the \nadministration could not fund because it chose to reduce the military \nconstruction budget by almost $1.5 billion below the amount requested \nin fiscal year 1996.\n  Finally, I want to address the comment in the statement of \nadministration policy regarding this bill. The administration states \nthat projects for $95 million are not in the services long-range plans. \nIt included such facilities as the troop barracks in Germany and the \nfamily housing construction in England. These projects that amount to \nmore than $25 million were among the highest priorities on the list of \nunfunded projects submitted by services. The remaining projects were \nequally justified.\n   Mr. President, the $700 million added by the committee are justified \nand are in the best interest of our national security. I urge the \nSenate to support the committee and vote against the McCain amendment.\n   Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, there is not a single Senator here who \ndoes not go back home and talk all the time about how we want a \nbalanced budget. We want a balanced budget very badly. We have the \nPresident's plan we put forward in 1993, we have the Democratic plan, \nRepublican plan, and we all take great pride in how we want to balance \nthe budget. Yet, when it comes down to actually doing something \npractical, if it impinges just a little bit in our area, or if we are \nnot able to bring home some of the pork we would like to bring home, \npump up the way people look at us back home, then our talk about budget \nbalancing gets pretty thin around here. That is what we are talking \nabout and that is what Senator McCain has been addressing.\n  This amendment would cut nearly $600 million which was included in \nthe bill for unrequested military construction. These are things the \nPentagon did not say they needed. These were things the administration \ndid not say we needed. We did not have to have this money in there. \nThese are add-ons, strictly add-ons.\n  Granted, many of these are going to family housing projects and \nthings like that. But these were not the priorities that the \nadministration established or the Defense Department established or the \nArmy, Navy and Marine Corps established as what they would rather have \nif the $600 million was available to be spent for whatever. These are \nthings that Members of Congress just decided in their own wisdom to put \nin. As the Senator from Arizona has indicated, too many times it \nappears that these efforts to put good things in just happen to be in \nthe home district or just happen to be in the home State. They just \nhappen to be add-ons that all total up to $600 million. So when we talk \nabout balancing the budget down here, are we going to walk the walk as \nwell as talk the talk? That is basically what we are talking about.\n  Some years ago here, I think it was 3 or maybe 4 years ago, this idea \nof the pork creeping into every defense authorization bill had become \nso rampant, had become so out of control, that the Senator from Arizona \nand I started a policy. We got this through as sort of sense-of-the-\nSenate language that any add-ons would have to meet some criteria. We \nwould use these as a benchmark. That does not mean they should go in if \nthey met these five criteria; it just means we had to make a compromise \nand stop some of the runaway pork that was put into this legislation \nevery year.\n  So what did we do? We put in several criteria. It had to be mission-\nessential for the long term, the future; No. 2, it could not be \ninconsistent with BRAC, the base closure procedure; it had to be in the \n5-year defense plan; it had to be executed in the next fiscal year or \nat least start the contract then; and, No. 5, it had to be offset by a \nreduction in some other defense account if you are going to make an \nadd-on.\n  That does not mean if it met these five criteria automatically you \nshould try to put it in and goody-grab in the budget or authorization \nbill if it meets those five criteria. We set these criteria because \nthat stopped some of the even more rampant requests, things that were \nput in the budget back then that were even worse than the things we see \nright now.\n  What happened when we take this sense-of-the-Senate criteria and \napply it this year? Madam President, 25 added projects do not meet some \nof the criteria. It does not mean they do not meet some of them; they \ndo. Are any of them offset by our defense accounts? No, they are not. \nThey do not meet that criteria at all. But the basic objection is just \nin principle, adding funds for unrequested military construction \nprojects. Our objection to it remains the same.\n\n  During the Senate Armed Services Committee markup, as an example, our \nsubcommittee, which Chairman McCain chairs and which I am the ranking \nminority on, we recommended some additions in the subcommittee to be \npassed by the full committee. They were substantial increases in areas \nwe\n\n[[Page S6472]]\n\nhad discussed with the Pentagon. They thought they could use some more \nmoney in these areas so we recommended in the subcommittee some \nadditions of about $100 million, additions for high priority housing \nprojects--we agreed on that. But the subcommittee allowed the \nDepartment of Defense to determine the allocation of those projects. We \ndid not look around the room and say, ``What Senator is here we can \nplease? What Senator can we help get reelected? What Senator can we do \na favor for?''\n  No, we put that money in because the Defense Department indicated \nthey could use it, and they could make the choice, they could make the \nchoice on where the greatest need was. That was our basic criteria in \nmarkup this year, and I think it was a very sound one. Let DOD decide \nwhere their greatest need is, not try to come back and do a favor for \none or more of our Members.\n  Senator McCain and I both voted against additions of the $600 million \nin unrequested MilCon when it was offered in our markup. But we lost \nthat vote, obviously. What is the cumulative effect of all this? Since \n1990, it has added up to real money, as some would say here. This is \nnot just peanuts anymore. Since 1990, we have added more than $6 \nbillion--$6 billion--to MilCon accounts. Now we are going to add \nanother $600 million in unrequested projects with what we are doing \nhere.\n  Our overall defense budget has gone down meanwhile, so, when we make \nadd-ons like this, they assume a more important role than they would \nhave even normally, because they become a greater percentage of what \nour total military expenditures are. The defense budget has gone down \nabout 40 percent, yet we are going ahead with these things that benefit \nprimarily our Members.\n  The priority of these added projects? Do we need them now? It is my \nunderstanding that, of the 115 added projects, 72 were planned for the \nyear 2000 or later. That does not make them very necessary right now. \nIn the unrequested projects, almost $350 million out of the $600 \nmillion was added for these projects that are planned for after the \nturn of the century. No wonder the Defense Department did not request \nthings like this. No wonder there were higher priorities in the defense \nbudget.\n  So, why do we put these in? Although we objected, they are put in \nmainly because particular Members want to do something in their States. \nThey want to bring home the bacon. We must be realistic. This bill is \n$1.7 billion above the defense budget target set in the fiscal 1997 \nbudget resolution now. That means we have to cut out some of the \nprograms added, and when we get to conference with the House, how are \nwe going to do that? What is going to be cut? Will these be out of the \nprocurement accounts? Is that what we are going to do? Will MilCon be \ncut when Members just succeeded in getting something in for \ntheir States or their home districts?\n\n  MilCon is probably going to be the last thing that gets cut. So we \nwill wind up, instead of spending some of this $600 million for much-\nneeded modernization equipment that we will really need if we get into \nany future conflict, we are going to spend it for these other things \nthat were add-ons that people wanted for their particular area.\n  As I understand it, the House has already passed their bill. They \nadded, in their bill, some $900 million to the MilCon request, almost \n$1 billion. You know what is going to come out of the conference. What \nusually comes out of the conference--not cutting back on those MilCon \nprojects, because that would offend some members of the committee who \nwere just successful in getting these projects in for their home State.\n  So we are looking forward to a conference committee which usually \nwill not cut these accounts. So if we are going to cut them, it is \ngoing to have to be here, and it will have to be done with the proposal \nof the Senator from Arizona, his proposal that I support very, very \nstrongly. It is not easy to be out on point, trying to do something \nlike this. I will say that. He and I have both received a lot of flak \nover the past 3 or 4 years as we have tried to cut back some of these \nthings. We have had Members come back to us and criticize us, criticize \nus for being unfair and all sorts of things. I do not have any problem \nat all standing for some of these cuts. We have been proud to make this \neffort.\n  I will say this: I think we have been somewhat successful with this \nin reducing the total amount, the total amount through the years that \npeople have requested. I will not say we have scared people off, but \nlet us say we have made some of them think twice, anyway, about some of \nthese things. So the requests have been going down, and we can probably \npoint to where, compared with last year, we probably have gone from \nabout $4 billion you can point to as questionable down to only about $2 \nbillion this year. Is that good? No, it is not very good. But it is \nbetter than we thought we might do last year, I will say that. So maybe \nwe are having an impact. Maybe we are heading, really, in the right \ndirection.\n  But what it comes down to is, are we going to talk about budgets and \ntalk and talk about budgets and act as though we are doing something \naround here all the time and worry about little tiny amounts, \ncomparatively speaking, in the budget? Or are we going to really do \nsomething about it?\n  Here is what we do when it comes to trying to get something for our \nown States, or Members of the House of Representatives trying to get \nsomething for their districts so they can point with great pride, make \na headline when they are up for reelection: I brought back the park on \nthis. I got that road intersection, or I got something in there that is \npart of this $600 million.\n  Are we doing this for campaign purposes or are we doing it because \nthe Pentagon really needs this as a priority item to really fulfill our \ndefense needs?\n  Most of these things, by that criteria, do not even deserve to be \ntalked about as far as being necessary. Most of them are add-ons that \nare favors to particular Members, and we know it, and anybody who works \non this legislation knows it also.\n  So I say, let us just keep after this. I know Senator McCain is \ncommitted to keeping after it. I am, too. I believe he wants to call \nfor a rollcall vote on this, and I certainly support that.\n  For all the reasons I have stated above, I support this. I urge our \ncolleagues to put the budget ahead of their own parochial interests, \nperhaps. He and I have not added things in for our own State on this. I \nhave not added a thing. There are things in here for Ohio, but not that \nI asked for. I think he is in the same status, as far as Arizona goes.\n  So we are walking the walk on this ourselves. We are not just talking \nabout this and talking against someone else and goody grabbing \nourselves. This is something we feel strongly about. We feel this $600 \nmillion was not requested, and we think when you look at it that we can \ndo without these things and, hopefully, get the Pentagon to prioritize \nwhat they want and support their budget, not what we can add on over \nhere.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I certainly would never question the good \nintentions of my friend from Ohio or the Senator from the State of \nArizona, but I think it is important to know that the chairman of this \nsubcommittee, the junior Senator from the State of Montana, is not \nknown for being a big spender. He came to the U.S. Senate with \nexperience in the State of Montana working at the county level. There \nhe was known for his frugality. He has acted the same way as chairman \nof this subcommittee.\n  Everyone should recognize that the amount that we are going to have \nmarked up in our bill tomorrow is $200 million less than what the House \nhas, and I do not think the House is known for spending lots of money. \nOur subcommittee is coming with less money than has been requested and \nauthorized and appropriated by the House.\n  All of our colleagues should understand that the money that is the \nso-called add-ons meet the so-called McCain criteria. The distinguished \nSenator from Arizona said that if there are going to be add-ons, they \nshould meet certain criteria. If there is going to be money \nappropriated, they should meet certain criteria.\n\n[[Page S6473]]\n\n  We have met every one of the criteria in every one of the matters \nbeing questioned.\n  What are those criteria? That there be a 5-year plan. Everything in \nour bill meets that plan. Every element in these so-called add-ons are \nwithin the 5-year plan.\n  Second is that they be the top priority of the base commander. We \nhave met that criteria.\n  That the add-ons be mission essential. We met that criteria.\n  That the site has been selected for the construction. That criteria \nhas been met.\n  Finally, it can be executed in this fiscal year. That criteria has \nbeen met.\n  We have met the McCain criteria, not in some instances but in every \ninstance.\n  The examples cited by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, about \nthe health club and all that, I respectfully say I do not know what he \nis talking about, but they would not meet the 5-year plan or the \ncriteria generally. Everything we are talking about meets the McCain \ncriteria.\n  We should also recognize that the bill we are talking about this year \nis 10 percent below last year's level; $1.3 billion below last year's \nlevel. We are, of course, going to be within our 602(b) allocation.\n  If you look at what has happened, the moneys that we have been given \nby the administration suggested the grand sum for the Army National \nGuard of $7 million for military construction all over the country. The \nArmy National Guard would go out of business.\n  I stand in strong opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Arizona and the Senator from Ohio. I suggest that the Senator from \nNevada and the Senator from Montana are proud of what we are doing for \nthe military. We are proud of what we are doing for the Guard and \nReserve.\n  The amendment would not allow for authorization of construction \nprojects that are of immediate need to those who continue to serve us \nso well. I urge my colleagues not to support this amendment for these \nand other reasons.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee used stringent criteria to ensure \nthat all projects authorized were determined to have met these \ncriteria. These criteria are known, as I indicated, to the members of \nthe committee as the McCain criteria.\n  We, as members of the Military Construction Appropriations \nSubcommittee, chaired by the Senator from Montana, funded all the \nprojects that had previously met these criteria and were recommended by \nthe authorizing committee, of which the Chair serves as a member of \nthat committee. The projects that have been authorized are necessary to \nmaintain the stability of our National Guard and Reserve and to \ncontinue to enhance the quality of life for our soldiers, sailors, and \nour airmen and women.\n  Of the $600 million talked about in construction projects that this \namendment would eliminate, $368 million, about 60 percent of this \namount, is designated for construction of National Guard and Reserve \nprojects. Remember, the administration requested the sum of $7 million \nfor the Army National Guard and military construction.\n  In addition to the $368 million, about 60 percent, as I have \nindicated, for National Guard and Reserve, we have requested an \nadditional $189 million which is directly designated to build military \nfamily housing. Why? To improve the quality of life of our service \nmembers.\n  Nearly all of this $600 million reduction directly attacks the \nprojects that the administration always neglects. They do not put \nanything in there, knowing that we have an obligation to the Guard and \nReserve.\n  We have a National Guard and Reserve Caucus in this Senate. We have \n62 Members. Why? Because administrations in years gone by have \nneglected the Guard and Reserve. We need to become more dependent on \nthe Guard and Reserve rather than less dependent, as a result of the \nbuilddown of our military forces.\n  It is our specific task to look independently at all the military \nconstruction needs of this country. Should we be a rubberstamp of the \nadministration and say we are not going to ask for anything other than \nwhat they request for the Guard and Reserve and from the States of \nOhio, Arizona, Montana, Texas, Nevada, California, Virginia? The answer \nis no, we have to look beyond what the administration suggests and \nrecommends.\n  It is our specific task to do just that: to look independently at all \nthe military construction needs of this country, not just what the \nPresident sends us.\n  We are not appropriating moneys for programs that have not been \nauthorized. We are not appropriating moneys for programs that have not \nmet the criteria of the McCain criteria. The list that we receive \nannually from the administration continues to overlook projects we are \nknown to support and compelled to include in our bill in order to \nmaintain the strength of our fighting force. The administration does \nnot have the exclusive wisdom to determine the finality of this list. A \nrubber stamp by our committee would take away the legitimacy of its \nobligation, its oversight responsibility and obligation.\n\n  Without the $600 million included in this bill, the Guard and Reserve \nwill again be shortchanged. All over this country quality of life for \nour service members will be greatly deterred and the committee's need \nwould be repudiated. We could just eliminate the subcommittee. We could \njust eliminate the armed services work that they have done.\n  I encourage my colleagues to strongly oppose this amendment. I \nrepeat, the chairman of this subcommittee has worked very hard, along \nwith the members of the subcommittee, to come up with something that is \nfair. There is talk about if these add-ons were added on--people used \nthe term ``pork.'' Maybe, Madam President, what we need to do is talk \nabout some of these so-called pork projects, projects that allow our \nGuard and Reserve to survive and allow the quality of life for our \narmed service members to be enhanced. If that is pork, then we have \n$600 million of pork, because the $600 million will allow our Guard and \nReserve to survive and will enhance and improve the quality of life of \nthe men and women who serve us in the military.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I \nguess whenever we start talking about appropriating and budgeting for \ncertain needs of our military, we always hear the argument that there \nare things unrequested by the Pentagon or unrequested by the President. \nI am wondering if we as individuals in this body and the House do not \nhave the same responsibility of taking a look and making up our own \nminds on the needs of our men and women in uniform.\n  In this bill that has been authorized, the greatest share goes to \nquality of life. Quality of life leads to retention, the retention of \nthe good people who are now serving in our respective services.\n  The Senator from Nevada and I have worked--and I do not know of \nanybody who is easier or better to work with when we start going down \nthrough the priority list on military construction than Senator Reid \nfrom Nevada. He understands what has to be done, understands that, no, \nthe administration never sends any request down for projects or any \nsupport for the National Guard or sometimes even our Reserve units. In \nfact, if we would look at the backlog of construction for our Reserve \nunits, it is in the billions of dollars, because it has been put away.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that this bill, this authorizing bill, \nand the appropriations that we are going to mark up tomorrow is cut \n$1.3 billion from a year ago. So if the Senator from Ohio and my friend \nfrom Arizona say they are having an effect, they are having an effect. \nWe are spending less money than we did a year ago in military \nconstruction.\n  But quality of life and readiness, because we have changed that since \nthe cold war is over--in other words, money goes to the base closing \nand realignment, environmental cleanup of those bases; but for the \nretention of the people that we need, the biggest share of our thrust \nhas been in the quality of life.\n  I will tell you that I have been in some barracks that were not very \ngood. I would not ask my employees to live\n\n[[Page S6474]]\n\nthere. Those projects have to be done if we are going to retain the \npeople in our military. And as to the morale, it adds to everything.\n  But keep in mind that, yes, we are $1.3 billion under a year ago. \nThen you have to sit down, like Senator Reid and I did and our staffs, \nand set some priorities. But the Pentagon should not be the only one \nthat has any kind of judgment on the needs of some of our military \npeople, nor the administration. We have an obligation to our military \npeople, too, just like anybody else.\n  So I think this is a pretty frugal bill when it comes to military \nconstruction. There is not very much in here that is not needed and \nrequested by the military. With that, I say to my colleagues that this \namendment should be defeated, and I ask for its defeat. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, as co-chair for the National Guard Caucus \nI rise to object to this amendment.\n  The Senate, in the past years, has voted to appropriate necessary \nmilitary construction funds to offset the neglect of administrations in \norder to make sure that the defense infrastructure would be adequately \nfunded.\n  As we have discussed on the floor before, the National Guard has \ntraditionally been the neglected stepchild of the executive branch and \nthe Department of Defense. They neglect the Guard because they know we \nwill take care of it. We must. Who do we look to for every disaster? \nWho receives the call in every domestic emergency? And who continues to \nserve and implement military and foreign policy the world over? The \nNational Guard. The military construction bill funds these mission \nessential and housing projects which were designated as critical by \neach State's adjutant general. I ask Senators to support the men and \nwomen of the Guard and support the Guard's ability to carry out its \nmissions and vote against this amendment.\n  Active Forces infrastructure has traditionally been adequately funded \nwith the Guard forces traditionally underfunded. Why has it been this \nway, many have asked. And the answer which is whispered through the \nHalls of this building is that the Congressmen and Senators will take \ncare of it. And we have and we do and we will because we care about the \nwelfare and readiness of the National Guard and Air National Guard.\n  The administration this year funded the Army Guard to the tune of $7 \nmillion; $7 million for the entire Army Guard infrastructure. For all \n50 States and Puerto Rico; $7 million for the entire Army Guard force. \nIf the Senators here respect our citizen soldiers, then they must \nrectify this shoddy treatment of those who protect us. My colleagues on \nthe committee have done just that and they have done it with strict \nadherence to a rigorous set of standards for these necessary quality of \nlife and readiness projects.\n  The committee considered each of the programs added to this year's \nmilitary construction bill for its executability in fiscal year 1997, \nits being of the highest priority for the base commanders and National \nGuard tags, its inclusion in the FYDP, and its overall criticality to \nquality of life and readiness.\n  To vote for this amendment is to turn your back on your National \nGuard personnel. Currently, this is the only venue we have to maintain \ninfrastructure readiness and quality of life. We are trying to get the \nadministration to acknowledge the Guard's requirements, but let us not \nhamstring our Guard for the administration's shortsightedness. Do not \nlet this amendment pass.\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, I stand in strong opposition to the \nAmendment offered by the Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain]. This \namendment would not allow for the authorization of construction \nprojects that are of immediate need to those who continue to serve us \nso well. I urge my colleagues not to support this amendment for these \nreasons.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee used stringent criteria to ensure \nthat all projects authorized were determined to have met these \ncriteria. These criteria are known to the members of the committee as \nthe McCain Criteria. We, the members of the Military Construction \nAppropriations Subcommittee funded all of the projects that had \npreviously met these criteria and were recommended by the Authorization \nCommittee.\n  The projects that have been authorized are necessary to maintain the \nstability of our National Guard and Reserve and to continue to enhance \nthe quality of life for our soldiers, sailors, and airmen. Of the $600 \nmillion in construction projects that this amendment would eliminate, \n$368 million or over 60 percent of this amount is designated for the \nconstruction of National Guard and Reserve projects; and additional \n$189 million is directly designated to build military family housing, \nto improve the quality of life of our service members. Nearly all of \nthis $600 million reduction directly attacks the projects that the \nadministration annually neglects.\n  It is our specific task to look independently at all the Military \nConstruction needs of the country. The list that we receive annually \nfrom the administration continues to overlook projects that we are \nknown to support, and compelled to include in our bill, in order to \nmaintain the strength of our fighting force. The administration does \nnot have exclusive wisdom to determine the finality of this list. A \nrubber stamp by our committees would take away the legitimacy of its \noversight.\n  Without the $600 million included in this bill, the Guard and Reserve \nwill again be shortchanged, quality of life for our service members \nwould be greatly deterred, and the committee's need would be \nrepudiated. I encourage my colleagues to strongly oppose this \namendment.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I do not want to cut off debate. I will move to table when \neveryone has completed talking.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, subject to the concurrence of my \ndistinguished colleague from Georgia, it is the intention of Chairman \nThurmond to have this matter voted on, but allowing sufficient \nnotification to Senators of the time that that vote would commence.\n  I understand that the distinguished Senator from Georgia will address \nthis issue for a period. If the distinguished Senator from Nevada \nwishes to move to table, of course, that is his prerogative. Then if it \nis agreeable to the Senator from Arizona, we would lay aside the \namendment and delay the voting for a stipulated period of time and \nallow maybe other business to come in the intervening period. That \nwould be the desire of this manager. I presume the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia concurs in that.\n  Mr. NUNN. That is fine.\n  Mr. WARNER. He has indicated his assent.\n  Is the Senator from Arizona agreeable?\n  Mr. McCAIN.  I say to my friend from Virginia, I am agreeable, but I \nthink it should be made clear. Will we have further votes tonight? This \nissue will be voted on at some time tonight?\n  Mr. WARNER. Oh, yes. Let us say, hypothetically, if the Senator from \nGeorgia would use 10 minutes, we would have the vote commence at 8:15. \nIn the interim period, the Senator from Georgia and I would endeavor to \nget more business done.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, I request 3 additional \nminutes for comments before we close out.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Senator from Virginia \nwhether he anticipates other rollcall votes tonight beyond this one?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am advised by Chairman Thurmond that is \nthe desire of the majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not sure anything is pending, but that is the best I \nknow at this time.\n  Mr. NUNN. The only suggestion I would make, unless we can get an \namendment up that is one that is going to be debated as a rollcall \nvote, I would suggest--I could take no more than 30 seconds for my \ncomments, and we could perhaps move that timeframe up a bit. That gives \nus a better chance of either one of two things: If we are not going to \nhave other rollcalls, it would allow Members to be able to go back to \ntheir families earlier; if there are, we can get started on that \ndebate. I do not know what other amendments are\n\n[[Page S6475]]\n\ngoing to come up requiring rollcalls tonight.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, I am informed \nthat the majority leader is agreeable to having this vote on the McCain \namendment at the hour of 8 o'clock tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I will take just about 1 minute. It is my \nunderstanding from all the information that I have been provided that \nevery project here that is the subject of this amendment and the \ncritique that has been laid down by our colleagues from Ohio and \nArizona, each one of these projects is in the 5-year defense plan of \nthe Department of Defense. Each project also can begin construction in \nfiscal year 1997. Each project is mission essential or quality-of-life \nrelated. And each project is consistent with BRAC actions.\n  I would like to see if there are any of these projects that are on \nclosed military bases or ones being closed. I am informed that none of \nthem is. That has been carefully screened. If they are, I certainly \nwould like to have someone show me which one is on a closing military \nbase, because that is contrary to all the information that we have.\n  A breakdown of the requested projects that have been added to the \nbudget:\n  There has been $206 million added for quality of life improvements--\nbarracks, family housing, fitness centers, child care centers, dining \nfacilities, family support centers, education centers, et cetera: $169 \nmillion for training and readiness-related projects; $81 million for \nmaintenance shops and facilities; $51 million for general \ninfrastructure improvement projects; $50 million for new mission-\nrelated projects; and $41 million for health/safety/environment-related \nprojects.\n  Mr. President, it is true that these projects were not requested by \nthe Department of Defense. It is also true that there is $12 billion in \nthe bill that was not requested by the Department of Defense.\n  I have a very hard time understanding the distinction between the \nother $11.5 billion that has been added and this $500 million that has \nbeen added. The Department of Defense and the administration's official \nposition is not in favor of any of the add-ons. The question is whether \nwe are going to provide family housing, whether we are going to provide \nday care centers, whether we are going to provide fitness centers and \nother quality-of-life improvements, and training for our troops, or \nwhether we are going to basically neglect them and simply add on weapon \nsystems.\n  The argument about these projects not being requested, made by my \ngood friends from Arizona and Ohio, is absolutely right. You can say \nthat about the other $11.5 billion in this bill that has been added on. \nThat is the reason the President says he may veto the bill. The \nquestion is, What are we going to add in terms of our judgment, because \nthere is no request for this $11 to $12 billion that has been added on.\n  It has been added on because the Senate and the budget committees in \nthe Senate and the House decided that defense was a priority and that \ndefense was underfunded. That was a decision we made on the budget \nresolution. When we made that decision, by its very nature, it meant \nthat the Congress was going to decide to add on the money, because the \nadministration has not indicated that they favor that add-on.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment or to vote to \ntable it if the tabling motion is made.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, with the greatest respect to my colleague \nfrom the State of Georgia, I just state the add-ons were not asked for.\n  Let me point out, in the future years' defense plan, specifically, \nPohakuloa training area for $1.5 million, is not in the future years' \ndefense plan; the Lansing CSMS, not in the future years' defense plan; \nthe Camp Ashland training site flood control, not in the future years' \ndefense plan; the Nellis Air Force Base FHP-111, 100 units, not in the \nfuture years' defense plan; the Air National Guard in Ontario, OR, not \nin the future years' defense plan; the Dallas Armory, not in the future \nyears' defense plan; the Eastover-Leesburg Multipurpose Simulator \nCenter, not in the future years' defense plan, and so forth; the \nWyoming Air National Guard, Camp Guernsey, not in the future years' \ndefense plan.\n  I do not know where the Senator from Georgia gets his information, \nbut I hope he corrects the Congressional Record, because they are not \nin the future years' defense plan.\n  I am glad to hear a response from the Senator.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I am informed that what we have tried to \napply here is the McCain-Glenn criteria, which is for construction \nprojects. All the projects that were listed by the Senator from Arizona \nwere planning and design money, which is not part of the McCain-Glenn \ncriteria. We have followed those criteria, but there is no 5-year \ndefense plan for planning and design money. That is lump-sum money.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to point out again, first of all, the criteria \nis they had to be in the future years' defense plan for any funding; \nbut, second of all, there are also projects that are more than just \nplanning and design.\n  We also asked the Department of Defense which of these projects were \nnondefense essential. They gave us a list of over 20 of these which \nwere deemed by the Department of Defense as nondefense essential. That \nis their judgment. It is hard for me to understand how that judgment \ncould be overruled, but I also understand what we are talking about \nhere.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this list printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Projects That Do Not Meet Senate Criteria\n\n\n                 fourteen projects that are not in fydp\n\n       1.

Wyoming, Camp Guernsey, Army Guard, combined \n     maintenance facility, $935,000.\n\n\n               eleven projects not ``mission essential''\n\n       1. California, Travis AFB, two dormitories, $7 million.\n       2. Delaware Dover AFB, visiting officers quarters, $13.1 \n     million.\n       3. Kansas, McConner AFB, dormitory, $7.7 million.\n       4. Maryland, Andrews AFB, family support center, $2.3 \n     million.\n       5.

Nevada, Faron Naval Air Station, bachelor enlisted \n     quarters, $16.1 million.\n       9. Nevada, Mevis AFB, family housing, $150,000.\n       10. Ohio, Wright-Paterson AFB, family housing improvements, \n     $6.3 million.\n       11. South Dakota, Ellsworth AFB, CDC addition, $4.5 \n     million.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I believe that the States in which these military \nconstruction projects are located, when correlated with membership on \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee, \nwill give a better explanation of the point Senator Glenn and I are \ntrying to make here.\n  I do not believe Senator Glenn or I are unappreciative of the need \nfor quality of life and the absolute importance that we maintain \nqualified men and women in the military. My question is, do we have to \nmaintain the quality of life in the States of members of the committee, \nor do we have to maintain\n\n[[Page S6476]]\n\nthe quality of life in all 50 States in America?\n  Clearly, the Record indicates--and I will be submitting for the \nRecord in the future--that there has been a dramatic, dramatic \nimbalance in the funding for military construction projects, which, \nvery frankly, do not serve the men and women well who are stationed in \nStates where there is not that membership. I do not think the men and \nwomen in the military deserve that kind of preferential treatment.\n  I have no illusions as to whether this amendment will succeed or not. \nI tell you what it does do. It makes me feel a lot better about the 10 \nyears that I spent trying to get the line-item veto passed. It gives me \nenormous, enormous gratification to know that next year the President \nof the United States, no matter who he is, is going to take a list like \nthis, and he is going to line-item veto it, and we will spend money on \nprojects we need.\n  I want to point out again, we are short of sealift capability, Mr. \nPresident. We are short of airlift capability. We are short of \namphibious capability. We do not have sufficient tactical aircraft to \nman our carrier decks and bases all over this Nation, including Nevada. \nWe do not have the kind of modernization of our force that is necessary \nfor us to fight and win battles in the next century, and our \nmodernization force has dropped to practically zero.\n  There are other reasons besides military construction why that has \nbeen the case. We have had to spend such an enormous amount of money on \noperations, maintenance, and training in order to keep our present \nforces ready.\n  When we waste billions of dollars, as the Senator from Ohio points \nout--$6 billion since 1990--on military construction projects, I do not \nthink it is fair for us to ask young men and women to fight and die in \nequipment that is not the very best.\n  I will never forget the former Commandant of the Marine Corps who \ntestified before the Readiness Committee, General Mundy. He said, ``It \nis very, very, very important that our Marines have decent housing, but \nI don't want a Marine widow to be living in a wonderful house when she \nis notified by the CO of the base and the base chaplain that her \nhusband was killed in combat because he didn't have the proper \nequipment with which to defend himself.''\n  Mr. President, those are not my words. Those are not my words. Those \nare the words of the former Commandant of the Marine Corps, General \nMundy.\n  If we were funding modernization of our forces and keeping up with \nthe technological requirements that gave us the kind of technological \nedge that won the Persian Gulf war, I would not be nearly as vociferous \nin my opposition to the add-ons. The reality is--and you can talk to \nany objective military expert --that we simply do not have the money. \nThis is not the highest priority, although it is certainly very nice to \nhave things for the men and women who happen to reside in the right \nStates.\n\n  I will not inflame this debate any longer, except to say I realize it \nwill lose. I do believe this is the last year for it because I believe \nthe next President of the United States will exercise the line-item \nveto, and I will be one of the first, along with my friend and partner \nfrom Ohio, who will urge him to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Solely for the purposes of trying to clarify the \nparliamentary situation and to inform Senators, it is still the desire \nof the manager to have a vote occur on the McCain amendment, on or \nrelated to the pending order relating to the McCain amendment, at 8 \no'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator that the order \nwas to have a vote at 8 p.m. If you want to change that, it takes a \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. NUNN. I ask unanimous consent that we vote on the McCain \namendment or on a motion related to the McCain amendment at 8 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, further--I add this to the unanimous-\nconsent request--that at the conclusion of this debate, I ask that the \nKyl amendment and McCain amendment be laid aside so that the managers \ncan proceed with other business. Could the Senator from Ohio tell me \nhow much longer he wishes to debate?\n  Mr. GLENN. Not long.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let us say that at the hour of 7:50, debate on the \npending McCain amendment will conclude, at which time the Senator from \nVirginia asks that the McCain amendment be laid aside for voting, as \nstipulated in the prior order, at 8 o'clock. If it is required to lay \naside the Kyl amendment, I ask unanimous consent that the Kyl amendment \nbe laid aside, and at the hour of 7:50, the Senator from Virginia be \nrecognized for the purposes of sending to the desk an amendment, which \nwould require immediate consideration, and that the Senator from Texas \nbe recognized for such secondary amendments that she wishes to offer, \nand that there be no time agreement on the Warner-Hutchison amendment.\n  Mr. NUNN. Reserving the right to object, and I hope we will not have \nto object. We have not seen any of those amendments. I am not sure what \nthe unanimous-consent request is.\n  Mr. WARNER. Merely a chance to get them in and get them up.\n  Mr. NUNN. Maybe we need to talk a moment.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I have a few words I would \nlike to say after the Senator from Arizona has spoken and the Senator \nfrom Ohio.\n  Mr. NUNN. It sounds to me like the time between now and 8 o'clock \nwill be used thoroughly.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to be recognized for 2 \nminutes prior to the hour of 8 o'clock. Let us say at the hour of 7:56, \nwe could have recognition, once again, of the managers.\n  Mr. NUNN. I do not have any objection.\n  Mr. President, I add one other thing to the unanimous-consent \nrequest--that is, with the understanding that there be no second-degree \namendments to the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I have some short remarks--not a rebuttal \nbut a discussion regarding some of the comments that have been made.\n  Much has been made of this five-point criteria. Let me comment on \nthat. Back some years ago, before we established the five-point \ncriteria, the pork barreling that went on in the defense authorization \nbill was far worse than it is even now. The five-point criteria was \nnever intended--and I think Senator McCain would back this up--to be \nthe final goal, and that anything that fit those five criteria could \nsomehow automatically be approved and be OK, whether the Pentagon or \nthe President's budget asked for them or not. It was not supposed to be \nan end-all and be-all itself. It was supposed to be a way station to \nget toward having a budget put together by the Pentagon and sent here, \nwhich really meant what it said and it did not need us to add on \neverything else under the Sun. Nobody questions for a moment the fact \nthat some of these housing projects are needed. But are they as \nimportant as some other things that are needed if the Pentagon had the \nchoice to make that decision.\n\n  So these five criteria, whether in the 5-year plan or future year \nplan, or whether mission-essential, or whether inconsistent with BRAC, \nwhen the contracts can be started or whether they are offset in some \nother defense account, all of these are things that were meant to \ntighten this up toward a way station toward getting control and \nbudgeting the way we ought to. Whether the criteria apply or not does \nnot mean to me they are automatically OK and that we should \nautomatically approve them if they come in with a 5-year plan, which \nmeans we are stepping out of what the Pentagon might want to use the \nmoney for and projecting the money out to a 5-year future. So making so \nmuch out of this criteria was not meant to be the end-all or the final \ngoal of this at all.\n  Now, another thing was mentioned in debate--that the Guard and \nReserve are only getting $7 million. We go through an annual ritual \nevery spring on the Guard and Reserve. It does not make any difference \nwhat administration is in the White House. We have an annual ritual \nwhere they underfund,\n\n[[Page S6477]]\n\nthrough the Pentagon, the Guard and Reserve. I think it is done \nintentionally. It is done by Republican administrations and Democratic \nadministrations. Why? Because they know good and well that we will put \nit in over here so the Members can take this coup back to benefit their \nlocal areas in the local armory, money to run the local armory, money \nto milk on it, money to rebuild the local armory, and these are things \npeople were bringing back home, waving the flag that we did this for \nyou in Washington.\n  Every administration knows that the Guard and Reserve have a big \nenough constituency out there that that will happen. It happens every \nsingle year. I think it is time we put a stop to it. That is the reason \nI think we should have honesty in budgeting. This should not be an \nannual budget that lets people just bring home the bacon to the local \narmories as a way of funding this year in and year out. It should be \ndone on a basis of what the Guard's and Reserve's needs are. That \nshould be established by the Guard Bureau, working closely with the \nPentagon in determining what the budget will be.\n  So if we want to appropriate $600 million, if we went back to the \nPentagon and said, we know you need some things in MilCon, in housing; \nyou need a lot of things, but we will put this in and let the Pentagon \ndecide, let you prioritize where the greatest needs in the services \nare, then this might make even a little bit more sense. But it does not \nto me.\n  Let me comment on what the Senator from Georgia said a little while \nago about the add-on of $11.5 billion. I agree 100 percent with him on \nthat. That is the reason I voted against this bill when it came out, \nand I will still do that if that $11.5 billion add-on stays in. I have \nnot voted against authorization and appropriations bills for the \nDefense Department--except for beginning last year--in all the 21-plus \nyears that I have been here now. I agree with him on that. I do not \nthink that add-on was needed. I disagreed with the purpose for which it \nwas added on. Some of those have been addressed in amendments here \ntoday. We have had a chance to vote on them.\n  I think that what we are trying to do is get honesty in budgeting. \nThat is the purpose of this. The five-point criteria was never meant to \nbe the final goal of all of this. If anything came up and qualified \nunder that criteria, we would say, that is all right, it is approved. \nThat was meant to be a means of trying to get some control over \nbudgeting, which we did have some years ago, in the amount of add-ons \nwe would make, it seemed. This was a way station toward getting to more \nmeaningful budgeting.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, you cannot have it both ways. We have been \nasked to follow the McCain criteria. We do that with painstaking \nefforts. We meet every criteria that has been established. Every one of \nthese add-ons meet that criteria.\n  Now we are being told, well, the McCain criteria really is not that \nimportant. There are other things. You cannot have it every way, both \nways, or any way. I suggest that we have to stop and find out where we \nare. First of all, this bill is less than what the House has \nappropriated. Second, we are within our 602(b) allocation. Also, we are \n$1.3 billion less than we appropriated last year. We are 10 percent \nbelow last year's level.\n  Now, there is talk here about the States, where there is somebody on \nthe Armed Services Committee or on the Appropriations Committee, and \nthey are the only ones that get anything. That is absolutely \nridiculous. I have not had an opportunity to study who got what, but I \ncan name a few States that I looked at quickly while the debate has \nbeen going on. Delaware. There is no one in Delaware that is in Armed \nServices or Appropriations. Indiana, the same. Kansas, South Dakota, \nand North Dakota are just a few where there are add-ons. There are add-\nons because they meet the criteria set by Senator McCain, and every one \nof them meet that criteria.\n  Mr. President, let us stop and understand what happens when the \nPentagon makes a recommendation. The active military is prejudiced \nagainst the Guard and Reserve. Everybody who has been in the military \nknows that. They do not favor them. They want all the money to go to \nthem, the active military. And so in the recommendations that come to \nus every year they neglect the Guard and Reserve. We are the ones that \nsave the Guard and Reserve. That is our obligation. It may not be the \nright way to do things, but it is the only way to protect the Guard and \nReserve. We work very hard to make sure they survive. Programs funded \nunder this budget are programs that are essential to the survival of \nthe Guard and Reserve.\n  If the Guard and Reserve had to depend on the active military to give \nthem what they wanted, they would all be out of business. The active \nmilitary, frankly, mostly do not want the Guard and Reserve to be even \nin existence because there is competition for their dollars. That is \nwhy we are where we are.\n  This is not a budget breaker. We are within all the budget \nconstraints. We are not going outside of what has been authorized. We \nare only going not only with what is authorized but what is authorized \nunder the very strict criteria set by the Senator from Arizona, Senator \nMcCain. These are in the 5-year plan. They are the top priority of the \nbase commander. They are mission essential. The site has been selected, \nand we can execute within fiscal year 1997, the money that is being \nappropriated.\n  What more can we do? All Senators should recognize that this is not a \nbudget buster. I repeat, it is within all the budget constraints set by \nthe Budget Committee. We are not going outside of the money, above what \nhas been authorized.\n  I repeat, we are going one step further and following what has been \nset by the very strict McCain criteria. Mr. President, we believe that, \nif we step back and take a look at this, we find that the Armed \nServices Committee used very stringent criteria to ensure that all \nprojects authorized were determined to have met the criteria that we \nhave outlined.\n  The projects which have been authorized are necessary to maintain the \nstability of our National Guard and Reserve and to continue to enhance \nthe quality of life of our soldiers, sailors, and airmen. Almost 60 \npercent of this amount that is attempted to be stripped from this bill \nis designated for construction of Guard and Reserve projects.\n  I say with all respect to the senior Senator from Arizona, these are \nnot projects that are going to get any headlines because you strike \nthem from the bill. These are projects that help the men and women who \ndefend our country. The Pentagon simply did not put them in their \nrequest, knowing we would step forward and try to help them.\n  These projects help the Guard and Reserve from the State of Ohio. The \nSenator from Ohio did not ask for this money, but we felt it was \nimportant. We have two add-ons for the State of Ohio because the Ohio \nGuard and Reserve believe they are essential to their mission. We knew \nwhen we did this bill that the Senator from Ohio would be here with our \nfriend from the State of Arizona complaining about these add-ons. But \nwe felt it was important to the people of Ohio to have the Guard and \nReserve strong there, as it should be all over the country.\n  With the downsizing of our military, we are going to have to become \neven more aware of the importance of the Guard and Reserve. Stories \nhave been written and will continue to be written about how important \nthe Guard and Reserve was in Desert Storm, how effective and important \nthey have been in our situation in the Balkans.\n  So there is no apology for what we have done in the Military \nConstruction Subcommittee. We have done what is really important, and \nwe appreciate the direction and guidance given by the Armed Services \nCommittee under the leadership of the senior Senator from South \nCarolina and the Senator from the State of Kentucky.\n  I move to table the McCain amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to withhold that until the Senator from Arizona \nspeaks.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada and the \nSenator from Montana. I think they have done a dedicated job. We have a \ndisagreement, but I know for a fact that\n\n[[Page S6478]]\n\nthe Senator from Montana and the Senator from Nevada are dedicated to \nimproving the quality of life for the men and women in the military. We \nhave an honest difference of opinion. But I appreciate very much their \nefforts. I appreciate the cooperative spirit in which we have worked \nover many years, along with the Senator from Ohio. I disagree, \nobviously, as I have pointed out, with this add-on, but that in no way \ndiminishes the dedication and effort on the part of the Senator from \nMontana and the Senator from Nevada to try to provide a decent quality \nof life for men and women in the military.\n  I also want to point out again the reason I began with. The Senator \nfrom Nevada pointed out a very legitimate aspect of this whole process. \nThe Guard and Reserve have now become dependent on the Congress to \nprovide the funding that they need--the Senator from Nevada is exactly \nright--because they know that the Pentagon knows that, if they do not \nrequest it, it will be added on in the process that we go through here.\n  Mr. President, it is a stated reality, but it is wrong. It is wrong, \nand we have to fix this. We have to force the Office of the Secretary \nof Defense in the Department of Defense to come over here with \nlegitimate needs and requirements that the Guard and Reserve have.\n  I look forward to working with the Senator from Montana and the \nSenator from Nevada in trying to fix this gross inequity which has \nbecome part of the system that we have today.\n  Mr. President, I understand my time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. May the Chair advise the Senate that under a \nprevious order we have 2 minutes remaining for the managers to wrap up?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are still 2 minutes for each manager.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield back such time as is reserved for \nthe purpose of the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, if I could ask the Chair, would the proper \nmotion be that we proceed immediately to a rollcall vote? As I \nunderstand it, we do not have any more time on this. We basically have \nan order for an 8 o'clock vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. We have an order for 2 minutes in behalf of the Senator \nfrom Virginia, which I yielded back.\n  Mr. REID. I move to table, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  Mr. NUNN. I believe we object to moving up of the time. I think we \nneed to delay the clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I renew my motion to table, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Nevada to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Arizona. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato] \nand the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams] are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] and \nthe Senator from Illinois [Ms. Moseley-Braun] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nmotion was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we want to continue to move forward on this \nlegislation. We have not made a lot of good progress, but the chairman \nand the ranking member are working on that, trying to get a list of \namendments that can be agreed to.\n  I hope a block of those can be done tonight. After consultation with \nthe Democratic leader, it is our intent at this time for the committee \nto take up another amendment and complete all debate on that, see what \nother issues can be agreed to and done tonight, and the first vote then \nbe rolled over and occur in the morning at 9:15.\n  Mr. INOUYE. 9:15?\n  Mr. LOTT. 9:15 in the morning.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know we have had the opportunity to \ndiscuss what will happen after the Federal Reserve debate is completed \nand the votes are taken at 2:15. We have been in consultation, and it \nis my understanding the Senator from Arkansas has been able to work out \nan agreement with the Senator from Utah with regard to his amendment. I \nthink they have also agreed to a time limit within which that amendment \ncan be taken up.\n  Is the majority leader at this time ready to enter into an agreement \non that, or do we need to continue some consultation?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to have an opportunity to check with the \nSenators who have an interest in it from a committee jurisdiction \nstandpoint and other interests.\n  I am under the impression that probably can be worked out, but if the \nSenator will allow me to check on it, because I would like to get \nthings lined up to go forward. If it is going to be offered, let us get \nan arrangement to get it done and move forward. I would like to talk \nwith two of the Senators I know who have a special interest in it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We will work with the majority leader to see if that can \nbe accommodated, and we can lock that in perhaps tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. PRYOR. If the distinguished leader will yield for a comment.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will yield.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I have consulted two times in an hour and a half with \nSenator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He has an \nintense interest in the issue. He has agreed to a time limit and hopes, \nlike I do, that perhaps tomorrow after the Federal Reserve issues are \ndecided, that we could then possibly go to this amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. That sounds like what we all would like to do. Give me a \nchance to check with the Senator from Utah and one other, and I believe \nwe can work that out.\n\n[[Page S6479]]\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Marc \nThomas, through the Congressional Fellowship Program, who has been \nassigned to my office for sometime now, be granted privilege of the \nfloor during the discussion of the defense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to laying aside the pending \nKyl amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson], for himself and Mr. \n     Thomas, proposes an amendment numbered 4061.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In section 2601(1)(A), strike out ``$79,628,000'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``$83,728,000''.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment----\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, does the Senator have a copy of his \namendment at the desk? We need a copy.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. The amendment can be read. That will save you trouble. \nIt is one line.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       In section 2601(1)(A), strike out ``$79,628,000'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``$83,728,000''.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield just for a moment? I just would \nlike to clarify with the majority leader that there will be no more \nvotes tonight; is that correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator from Wyoming will yield for 1 \nsecond more, I would like to clarify there will be no more rollcall \nvotes tonight. I felt that was clear when we said we would roll over to \n9:15. I want to make it official.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Thursday, \nJune 20, following the votes on the confirmation of the nominees to the \nFederal Reserve, when the Senate resumes consideration of the DOD \nauthorization bill, the committee amendments be laid aside and Senator \nPryor be recognized to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4061\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to the \nDefense Authorization Act for myself and my friend, Senator Thomas. \nThis is a minor amendment in the greater scheme of legislative matters \nwhich we wrestle with in this body, but nevertheless, it is quite a \nvery important matter for the Wyoming Army Guard and all Guard soldiers \nwho train in Wyoming, and we train a good many soldiers in Wyoming from \naround the United States.\n  The amendment would authorize $4.1 million in funding for the first \nphase of construction of a combined support maintenance shop at Camp \nGuernsey, WY. The existing critical facility is a 47-year-old, 26,000-\nsquare-foot multipurpose repair building where all of the Wyoming Army \nNational Guard wheeled and tracked vehicles and equipment, light \ntrucks, the self-propelled howitzers are repaired and overhauled.\n  The primary problem with the existing facility is inherent electrical \nand ventilation deficiencies that have not been able to be adequately \ncorrected, despite some $270,000 in retrofits and repairs over the last \n11 years.\n  Additionally, the National Guard Bureau and industrial hygiene team \nconducted an evaluation of this facility in March of 1995 and concluded \nthat numerous hazards exist. Of seven discrepancies and hazards that \nexist, four have been assigned a Risk Assessment Code, or RAC, of 1, \nand the other three have been rated RAC 2.\n  These ratings reflect the severity of the conditions of the facility. \nRAC 1 indicates always a critical problem and has the possibility of \ncausing permanent, severe, disabling, irreversible illness or even \ndeath. RAC 2 reflects a serious condition also.\n  Mr. President, the National Guard Association of the United States \nstrongly supports this project. In a letter dated June 6, the executive \ndirector of the National Guard Association wrote:\n\n       Since 13 March 1990, the soldiers working in this shop have \n     seen every day a warning on the front door that reads in \n     part--\n\n  And here is what the warning says:\n\n       Unsafe or unhealthy working condition. Carbon monoxide \n     level exceeds the OSHA ceiling limit.\n\n  The only solution to protect the health and life of National Guard \nsoldiers in Wyoming is to replace this building. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        National Guard Association\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 1996.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thurmond: The National Guard Association of \n     the United States (NGAUS) is respectfully submitting this \n     endorsement of a MILCON authorization request from the \n     Wyoming Army National Guard.\n       During the accelerated budget process this year, a critical \n     military construction request was initially left off the \n     MILCON project list. The request is for a Combined Support \n     Maintenance Shop (CSMS) at Camp Guernsey, Wyoming.\n       According to information provided by the state, this 47-\n     year old facility contains serious, inherent health and \n     safety hazards. An industrial hygiene team from the National \n     Guard Bureau has determined that the building has seven \n     serious Risk Assessment Code (RAC) discrepancies. Four of the \n     discrepancies are coded RAC 1: ``a critical problem exists \n     that has the possibility of causing permanent, severe, \n     disabling, irreversible illness or death.'' The CSMS facility \n     has inherent ventilation and electrical deficiencies that the \n     Wyoming National Guard has not been able to adequately \n     correct despite $268,000 in retrofits and repairs over the \n     last 11 years. Since 13 March 1990, the soldiers working in \n     this shop have seen every day a warning on the front door \n     that reads in part: ``UNSAFE or UNHEALTHY WORKING CONDITION \n     (DO NOT REMOVE NOTICE UNTIL CONDITION IS ABATED). Carbon \n     monoxide level exceeds both the OSHA 8 hour PEL . . . and \n     OSHA ceiling limit . . .''\n       The only solution, to protect the health and lives of \n     National Guard soldiers in Wyoming, is to replace the \n     building.\n       The Wyoming Army National Guard, through its Adjutant \n     General, Maj. Gen. Ed Boenisch, is requesting phased funding \n     to alleviate this health and safety discrepancy. The phase 1 \n     request for the current appropriations year (FY 97) is $4.1 \n     million. Phase 2 (FY 98) would be for $4.0 million.\n       NGAUS respectfully urges favorable support of your \n     Committee for a floor amendment to the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 (S. 1745) to include \n     this MILCON authorization request from the Wyoming Army \n     National Guard.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Edward J. Philbin,\n\n                                      Major General, ANGUS (Ret.),\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, the secondary problem with the existing \nfacility is the wholly inadequate amount of space, as I said. They need \n70,000 square feet instead of the current 26,000. Clearly, this is a \nquality equipment repair facility and is critical to the function of \nthe combined support maintenance shop that directly impacts the Wyoming \nGuard's top goal of military readiness and those who train there, and \nthere are thousands from across the United States.\n  Finally, the number of specialized jobs in the combined maintenance \nshop, such as welding and fabrication operations, painting operations, \nbrake shop, brake shoe rebuilding, small arms repair, and electrical \nand mechanical repairs, cannot be performed. \n\n[[Page S6480]]\n\nThese other operational attitudes cannot be performed at smaller \noutlying maintenance facilities.\n\n  But, more importantly, you have health and safety as more of a \nconcern. Since repeated efforts to repair the facility and correct the \ninefficiencies have been unsuccessful, closing the facility may be the \nonly alternative. It is used, as I say, by thousands of people in the \nGuard units from all the surrounding States.\n  The Wyoming Guard have compromised and curtailed their request for \nmilitary construction funding to include only this critical program. It \nis an urging I make to support this amendment for $4.1 million in \nfunding for phase 1 of the project, and $4 million in funding for the \nnext fiscal year.\n  I also cite to my colleagues, on May 6, 1996, in a letter from \nWilliam A. Navas, Major General, U.S. Army, Director, the Army National \nGuard, in a letter to the chairman, it stated, ``Thirty-three urgently \nrequired projects were inadvertently omitted from that list,'' which \nwas received before the committee on March 21, 1996. ``A listing of \nthose projects is enclosed.'' One of those is the project for which we \nseek the funds this evening.\n  I yield to my friend from Wyoming.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Did the Senator from Wyoming yield to the \nSenator from Wyoming?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Yes, I did.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will take a moment. I appreciate very \nmuch this opportunity. My senior Senator has described the issue. I \njust simply want to tell you that this Camp Guernsey is a very \nimportant part of the National Guard, not only for Wyoming, but it is \nalso the training facility for a good many of the units surrounding \nWyoming. It is an artillery unit with a range there.\n  So, as the Senator said, this was inadvertently left out of the \naccelerated budget process. It combines the support and maintenance \nshop. This is a very compelling need here.\n  Three tenants have occupied the same building since 1948. The \nbuilding is environmentally in noncompliance, with problems of \nventilation and electrical systems.\n  The National Guard Bureau has identified seven serious risk \nassessment discrepancies, as the Senator has pointed out. We have, as \nwas mentioned, the letter from the National Guard Association, the \nletter from the Director of the Army National Guard, written in support \nof this funding.\n  The original funding actually was $12 million. Now it is less than \nthat.\n  Mr. President, as we downsize, of course, we call on the Guard and \nthe Reserve to carry more of the load. Someone mentioned earlier in the \ndebate that the Congress pretty much is responsible--the Senate--for \nsupporting the Guard funds. This, I think, is part of that.\n  So, Mr. President, I will not take any more time. But I certainly ask \nfor support from our colleagues for this important National Guard \naddition. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Second of all, Mr. President, it is a minor item, but \nwhen the Senator from Wyoming yielded the floor, he yielded the floor. \nHe could not yield to the other Senator from Wyoming for him to receive \nnext recognition. But it is not important.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Chair notes the \nmistake.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me just say that right now, and for \nthose few who may be listening or watching, if this amendment passes, \nthen I encourage all of my colleagues who have a military construction \nproject in their district or State, that they may want to come over and \nhave an amendment, and we will have a vote--because this meets none of \nthe criteria.\n  This has nothing to do with any priority. This is a violation, clear \nviolation of the sense-of-the-Senate resolution, which I will read into \nthe Record again. So if this passes, I want all of my colleagues to \ncome over, and whatever military construction project you want in your \nState, put it up, and we will have a vote on it, because you should \nwin. You should win because there is no reason why you should not, \nbecause if we pass this project, then everything meets the criteria, \nincluding the fact that there will be no requirement for any offsets.\n  So I hope my colleagues, after the vote tomorrow, if this amendment \npasses, will have lots of projects ready to vote for, because, as far \nas I am concerned, it is open season on the military construction \nsituation.\n  This project does not meet the criteria established for the Senate's \nauthorization of unrequested military construction projects. Mr. \nPresident, this project is not included in the services' future years \ndefense program. In other words, the Guard does not plan to build this \nproject until after the year 2000.\n\n  If the safety hazards at that location are as serious as stated \ntoday, then the National Guard Bureau should request emergency \nconstruction authority.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee was asked to review this project \nduring our markup of the bill. The committee did not include the \nproject because it did not meet the established criteria.\n  The fact remains that the scarcity of defense resources requires that \nthe Guard Bureau, the services, and the Department of Defense all make \ntough choices among priority projects. This project did not meet the \ntest of urgency when considered against all other priorities for the \nGuard, and it was not included in the initial priority list submitted \nby the Guard.\n  I think it is improper and counterproductive for the Congress to \napprove this. I hope my colleagues will not vote for the addition of \nseveral million dollars for another unrequested, low-priority project. \nHowever, let me emphasize, if this $4.1 million project is approved, \nthen I would strongly urge my colleagues to come over here with every \nproject that they have, because they deserve equal consideration. I \nhave no idea how many more hundreds of millions or even billions of \ndollars we could add on in military construction projects if this one \nis agreed to.\n  So, Mr. President, I guess we will find out tomorrow. But I hope all \nmy colleagues will be ready with their own projects. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Let me reflect again, so the Record is clear, that I \nwill have entered into the Record a letter from General William A. \nNavas, Jr., that this project was inadvertently omitted from the list. \nI restate that and ask unanimous consent that that letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Departments of the Army and the Air Force National Guard \n           Bureau, Army Pentagon,\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Re Installation, Logistics, and Environment Directorate.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I have spent little time in my 18 years \nin the Senate wandering in here to talk about any project. In fact, I \nbelieve that this would be perhaps the first time because these things \nhave usually been very well considered.\n  This is something that did not get considered properly. That is why \nwe are here, to seek an authorization to place it before the Senate on \na priority. I believe that I am told that there are not more than four \nor five amendments that are out here that have to do with adding money \nor add-ons.\n  So if the invitation is to come to the floor to bring in your \nfavorite dog or cat, there have not been many people doing that. There \nare about five. That will not cause some breach in the diet that will \ncreate an onslaught on this measure. So I want that clear, if we can. \nAnd we have inserted the letter in the Record. I suggest to our \ncolleagues that this is very necessary for one of the few Guard units \nin the United States that trains the rest of them from the rest of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. The Senator from Wyoming, Senator Simpson, is exactly \ncorrect on this matter. We have the letter in from William A. Navas, \nJr., Major General, U.S. Army, Director, Army National Guard. The \nSenator from Wyoming has already read the letter. He basically says \nthat 33 urgently required projects were inadvertently omitted from the \nlist that was submitted.\n  The reason this project was not included to begin with was because it \ndid not meet the criteria because it was not in the 5-year defense \nplan. This letter says that was an error. So I just want to make it \nclear that what the Senator has said, from my perspective and the \nperspective from this side of the aisle, is exactly right. This would \nhave been part of the list had it been listed as is now listed by \nGeneral Navas, Major General, U.S. Army, Director, Army National Guard.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I just want to reiterate again, so others will understand \nthoroughly. When the Senator from Arizona said, come over, bring \nanything you have in mind, this is not in that category. The letter is \nhere. It is entered. It was sent to the committee. And it was \ninadvertently left off the list. I think it is unfair to make that kind \nof a characterization.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, I think we have completed \ndebate on this amendment. The vote is set for 9:15 tomorrow. I think we \ncan move off of it and on to whatever business the Senator from Nevada \nwishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There has been no unanimous consent for a time \nset for the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest there is no further debate on \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, in line with the Senator from Arizona, \nperhaps just a unanimous-consent request could be made that debate be \nconcluded and the majority and minority leader set the time for the \nvote on the amendment tomorrow at a time certain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is in order.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I move that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NUNN. Reserving the right to object, I think the leader said \n9:15; does the Senator from Wyoming say 9:30?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I leave it to the discretion of the leader.\n  Mr. NUNN. Perhaps a unanimous-consent request would reflect that.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I incorporate that within it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request is agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. I add to that unanimous-consent request that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object to no second-degree amendments being in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair hears the objection.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I object to the unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4062\n\n(Purpose: To strike the authorization for the military construction \n     project of the National Security Agency at Fort Meade, \n     Maryland; to authorize $1,400,000 for the construction of \n     a ramp addition for C-130 aircraft at Reno International \n     Airport, Nevada; and to authorize $5,800,000 for the \n     construction of a jet engine test facility/aircraft test \n     enclosure at Fallon Naval Air Station, Nevada)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have an amendment I hope we can resolve in \njust a few minutes this evening, and I send that amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendments are laid aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself and Mr. \n     Bryan, proposes an amendment numbered 4062.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the table in section 2201(a), in the amount column for \n     the item relating to Fallon Naval Air Station, Nevada, strike \n     out ``$14,800,000'' and insert in lieu thereof \n     ``$20,600,000''.\n       Strike out the amount set forth as the total amount at the \n     end of the table in section 2201(a) and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``$512,852,000''.\n       In section 2205(a), in the matter preceding paragraph (1), \n     strike out ``$2,040,093,000'' and insert in lieu thereof \n     ``$2,045,893,000''.\n       In section 2205(a)(1), strike out ``$507,052,000'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``$512,852,000''.\n       In the table in section 2401(a), strike out the item \n     relating to the National Security Agency, Fort Meade, \n     Maryland.\n       Strike out the amount set forth as the total amount at the \n     end of the table in section 2401(a) and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``$502,390,000''.\n       In section 2406(a), in the matter preceding paragraph (1), \n     strike out ``$3,421,366,000'' and insert in lieu thereof \n     ``$3,396,166,000''.\n       In section 2406(a)(1), strike out ``$364,487,000'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``$339,287,000''.\n       In section 2601(3)(A), strike out ``$208,484,000'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``$209,884,000''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this amendment encompasses two projects and \nis offered on my behalf and Senator Bryan. These two projects are for \nthe State of Nevada. The reason they were not included in the matter we \nvoted on last is the fact that Top Gun just moved to Nevada. It is a \nvery important project for the Navy. Fallon Naval Air Station is the \npremier naval air fighting station in the whole world. Top Gun has \nmoved there.\n  This amendment meets all the McCain criteria of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. This project we are talking about is for testing of \nNavy jet engine acoustics at Fallon Naval Air Station. This authorizes \nappropriation of $5.8 million to move and complete a badly needed jet \nengine test facility at the Naval Air Station Alameda, which is due to \nclose this fiscal year, to Fallon Naval Air Station, saving millions of \ndollars. If we wait to do\n\n[[Page S6482]]\n\nthis, we will have to spend millions of additional moneys. This is an \neffort to save money.\n  We would still be within our 302(b) allocation. It is not a budget \nbuster. If we cannot do this, we would be required to construct a new \nand a smaller test facility. This is extremely important for Top Gun \nand other projects.\n  Now, the other project, Mr. President. Fallon Naval Air Station, I \nhave indicated, is rapidly becoming the Navy's premier pilot training \nsite, including Top Gun, Top Dome, and training of the navy's elite \npilots. If you want to have a Ph.D. as a naval fighter in airplanes, \nyou have to go to Fallon and train. This project meets all the criteria \nI have mentioned.\n  Mr. President, the other is a $1.4 million project that will add \nbadly needed space to the aircraft parking are at the Reno Air National \nGuard for C-130's. This is a new mission they have. One thing I did not \nmention, Mr. President, for both of these projects, the money is \noffset. Both projects in the amendment are fully offset in moneys and \nfor a project that is simply not usable anymore. It meets all the \ncriteria. I do not need to dwell on it. I ask this amendment be \napproved.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge support of the Reid amendment when we \ndo get to a vote on it. This meets the committee's criteria that \ncorrects potential problems currently in the Air National Guard.\n  Mr. REID. If I could say, the distinguished Senator from Arizona is \ngoing to object to this, but I think he would accept it on a voice \nvote. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand the argument of the Senator \nfrom Nevada. There is not an offset in it. I understand it meets with \nall the other criteria. I oppose the amendment. I will not request a \nrecorded vote.\n  Let me also say I will try and have the second-degree amendment to \nthe amendment from the Senator from Wyoming very soon. As I understand \nthe majority leader would have liked to have had a time certain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Nevada.\n  The amendment (No. 4062) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                         starstreak evaluation\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to engage Senators Warner, \nSmith, and Kennedy, who are my colleagues on the Armed Services \nCommittee, in a colloquy for the purposes of clarifying and correcting \nprovisions in the committee's report with respect to the committee's \nfunding of the air-to-air Starstreak missile evaluation, to be \nconducted by the Army.\n  Senator Kennedy and I, along with other members of the committee, \nhave supported continued evaluation of the Starstreak missile in an \nair-to-air role, to provide self-protection capability for the Apache \nhelicopter. I understand that it has been the committee's intent to \nprovide $15 million in fiscal year 1997 for the completion of the air-\nto-air Starstreak live fire phase test, to be carried out by the Army's \napplied aviation technology directorate. This test phase is to be \ncompleted prior to conducting a side-by-side evaluation with the air-\nto-air Stinger missile. It is also my understanding that to achieve the \ncommittee's intent, these funds should be placed in program element \n63003A, an account used in prior years for this program.\n  However, the committee report placed it in a different line item--PE \nNo. 23801A--and contains language that suggests an alternate use of \nthese funds. I would like to correct the record in this matter.\n  Mr. WARNER. Senator, you are correct on both accounts. As the \nchairman of the Air-Land Forces Subcommittee, I can attest that the \ncommittee's intent is to authorize $15 million in program element \n63003A explicitly for the continuation air-to-air Starstreak \nevaluation. The committee's report inadvertently implies that \nStarstreak would be evaluated alongside Stinger and placed the funds in \nthe incorrect funding line. This was not the committee's intent and \nwill be corrected during conference with the House.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I share the concerns of the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma, and thank the Air-Land Subcommittee chairman for his support. \nThese actions would be inconsistent with the authorization conference \nreport for fiscal year 1996 and with actions taken last year by the \nArmy to move Starstreak funds into this line for the continuation of \nthe air-to-air Starstreak evaluation. The Army has indicated a clear \nneed for helicopter self-defense, and is completing necessary \ndocumentation of that requirement. To best meet this requirement, there \nmust be a fair shoot-off competition between Starstreak and Stinger. \nProviding this funding is necessary to fully evaluate the Starstreak \nmissile prior to any shootoff, to ensure a level playing field.\n  Mr. SMITH. I concur with Senator Warner's earlier statement, that the \n$15 million for the Starstreak evaluation should be placed in PE 63003A \nand be provided for the purpose of continuing the Starstreak \nevaluation. As chairman of the Acquisition and Technology Subcommittee, \nI am pleased to join my colleagues in working to bring this development \nprogram to a successful conclusion. The position and legislative intent \nof the committee as articulated in this colloquy will supersede that \nexpressed in the committee report. Appropriate corrections will be made \nduring conference on this bill with the House of Representatives, and \nthe Army will be notified of our position on this issue.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank my colleagues for their assistance in clarifying \nthis important matter.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4049\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I oppose strongly the amendment on nuclear \ntesting offered by the Senators from Arizona and Nevada, Mr. Kyl and \nMr. Reid. The United States is currently in the forefront of nations \nseeking a comprehensive ban on nuclear explosions. Members of the \nadministration have worked assiduously to remove obstacles to such a \nban both in the United States and among the other nuclear powers. \nCurrently, we are in the final stages of an effort that could culminate \nan agreement on the text by June 28, with the opening of the text for \nsignatures occurring this coming September.\n  Getting us to this point, at which a comprehensive treaty ban is \nalmost in hand, has been both slow and tortuous. I recall well that \nPresident John F. Kennedy hoped to bring about a complete ban on \nnuclear testing. By building upon the positive aspects on both sides, \nhe was able to bring about the breakthrough that produced the Limited \nTest Ban Treaty of 1963, which limited nuclear testing to the \nunderground environment and spared the world further exposure to \nradiation and fallout from the tests by the three signatories, the \nUnited States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union.\n\n  In 1974, President Nixon achieved the Threshold Test Ban Treaty, and \nPresident Ford accomplished the Peaceful Nuclear Explosives Treaty in \n1976. In 1990, while I was chairman of the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, the committee and the Senate approved ratification of those \ntwo treaties. The complete ban has been an oft-stated goal of the \nUnited States for more than three decades and it has been pursued with \nvarying degrees of enthusiasm. In recent years, as some questions of \nsafety and reliability of nuclear weapons have been resolved and as our \nscientific community has, with methods of ensuring the safety and \nreliability of the stockpile without resort to nuclear testing, it has \nbecome increasing clear that nuclear testing is no longer an imperative \nand that national interests of the United States would be served by an \nend to nuclear testing.\n  When the administration succeeded last year in securing the \nunconditioned and permanent extension of the nonproliferation treaty, \nwe were successful largely because many nations who have foresworn \nnuclear weapons trusted us and the other nuclear powers to move \nexpeditiously to a complete end of nuclear testing. That goal appears \nnow to be within both reach and grasp.\n  As a result of legislation sponsored by Senators Hatfield, Exon, and \nMitchell in 1992, the United States has been operating under a \nmoratorium on nuclear testing that will extend through this September. \nAccording to\n\n[[Page S6483]]\n\nthat legislation, the United States can only resume nuclear testing if \nanother nation does so. Russia has not tested since 1992 and indicates \nit does not intend to resume nuclear testing. Earlier this year, France \nfinished its latest and controversial series of nuclear tests in the \nPacific and declared its commitment to achievement of a comprehensive \nban. That leaves only China, which has indicated that it will conduct \nonly one more test before September and then will join the other \nnuclear powers in stopping testing.\n  The Kyl-Reid amendment would revoke the Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell \nlanguage, under which the United States has been engaged in the \nmoratorium and moving toward a complete ban. It is correct that the \namendment does not require testing, but it does open the way to renewed \ntesting and send a completely wrong signal at this final stage of the \nnegotiation on a complete ban. It would serve to undermine U.S. \ncommitment to success in the negotiation. It could serve to disrupt the \nnegotiation completely, and it could precipitate an end to prospects \nfor a complete ban for years to come.\n  Mr. President, in January, John Holum, the director of the U.S. Arms \nControl and Disarmament Agency, delivered a message from the President \nto the delegates negotiating the test ban at the conference on \ndisarmament in Geneva. The President made the point: ``A Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty is vital to constrain both the spread and further \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons. And it will help fulfill our mutual \npledges to renounce the nuclear arms race and move toward our ultimate \ngoal of a world free of nuclear arms.''\n  The President concluded: ``I pledge the full and energetic support of \nthe United States to conclude promptly a treaty so long sought and so \nlong denied. Let us, now, take this historic step together.''\n  The last several weeks in Geneva have been marked by heated \nnegotiations as delegates attempt to remove final roadblocks. The next \nfew days will be similarly hectic as delegates try to meet the June 28 \ndeadline for success. John Holum told us today, ``We are close to \nachieving our goal in Geneva. This window of opportunity is the best, \nand perhaps the last, chance to achieve this goal.''\n  Mr. President, the Senate has had the wisdom to agree to the SALT I \ninterim agreement, the 1972 Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty, START I and \nthe START II Treaty. These treaties first capped the arms race, and \nensured the viability of strategic deterrence. Through the START I \nTreaty which is now in force and the START II Treaty which awaits \nRussian ratification, the world's two superpowers will have reduced \ntheir nuclear arsenals by approximately two-thirds. If we are wise and \nprudent we will move beyond that level still further to substantially \nlower levels of nuclear armament. A complete ban on nuclear testing \nwill help to reinforce and invigorate that process.\n  I hope very much that the Senate will decide today to keep the United \nStates on the course it so wisely chose in 1992 in deciding to initiate \na moratorium on nuclear testing.\n\n\n               House Provision on Antipersonnel Landmines\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last year an amendment to the Fiscal Year \n1996 Defense Authorization bill which I sponsored with 49 other \nsenators, both Democrats and Republicans, to impose a 1-year moratorium \non the use of anti-personnel landmines, except along international \nborders and in demilitarized zones, passed the Senate on August 4 of \nlast year by a vote of 67 to 27. It was signed into law by President \nClinton on February 12 of this year. Support for the moratorium has \nbroadened in the Congress since then, due to the extraordinary media \nattention this issue has received and the experience of our troops in \nBosnia.\n  Recently, it came to my attention that the House National Security \nCommittee included a provision in its version of the fiscal year 1996 \nDefense authorization bill, which would effectively nullify my \namendment. This provision is identical to a provision the House \nincluded last year, but which was deleted in the conference.\n  While I do not question the motives of the authors of that provision, \nI have communicated my concerns about it to Chairman Thurmond, as well \nas Senators Warner and Nunn. I have made clear that not only does this \nprovision undermine the position of two-thirds of the Senate, it is \ntotally unnecessary and premature since the moratorium would not take \neffect until February 1999. It also contradicts the Pentagon's \nconsidered judgment that it can manage with the Leahy moratorium, and \nignores the administration's own position that it will not seek to \nmodify or repeal the amendment.\n  Mr. President, on May 16, President Clinton announced the \nadministration's long-awaited policy on landmines. While I was \ndisappointed that the administration did not use this opportunity to \nrenounce the use of an indiscriminate weapon that is responsible for \nhorrendous suffering of civilians, the President did commit to \nvigorously negotiate an international agreement to ban antipersonnel \nmines. Over the next 2 years, we will have ample opportunity to judge \nthe seriousness of the administration's efforts. With 41 nations \nalready on record in support of an immediate, total ban, including many \nof our NATO allies, it is crucial that we preserve the Leahy amendment \nintact in order to reinforce our support for strong U.S. leadership in \nthis global effort.\n  I am very pleased and appreciative that Chairman Thurmond has, like \nlast year, answered my concerns by reaffirming his intention to defend \nthe Senate position in conference. He was successful in doing so last \nyear, and nothing has changed since then to weaken the Senate position. \nIn fact, the official opinion of the Pentagon that it can live with the \nLeahy moratorium, the administration's policy to vigorously negotiate \nan international ban as soon as possible, and the growing number of \ncountries that support a ban, should significantly strengthen it.\n  I hope the House will reconsider its position on this. There is no \nreason for an issue that has such broad public support, from veterans \norganizations to the Catholic Bishops to the American Red Cross, to \nbecome an issue of contention between us. If necessary, there is more \nthan enough time to revisit this when the effective date of the \nmoratorium approaches.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that excerpts from a May 16 \nPentagon press briefing describing the Pentagon's opinion of my \namendment, and my correspondence with Chairman Thurmond, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             News Briefing\n\n\n      Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense--Public Affairs\n\n       Senior Defense Official #2: The President signed it into \n     law. I mean, we have not been happy with it with regard to \n     its provisions compared to this broader policy. The President \n     did accept it. And we believe we can live with it, but we \n     don't think it's an adequate--I didn't say we didn't support \n     it--I mean, we don't think it's an adequate answer to the \n     problem.

Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Strom: It has come to my attention that the House \n     National Security Committee has included in its FY 1997 \n     Defense Authorization bill the same certification provision \n     concerning my anti-personnel landmine moratorium amendment \n     that was deleted last year.\n       Not only is this provision unnecessary since the moratorium \n     does not take effect until February 1999, it also would \n     nullify the effect of the amendment which was supported by \n     over two-thirds of the Senate in a bipartisan vote.\n       If necessary, I will take whatever measures are necessary \n     to prevent this attempt by the House to undermine the \n     Senate's position on my amendment. However, your help was \n     instrumental in getting this same provision deleted from the \n     bill last year. Before I make any decision on this, I would \n     appreciate knowing whether I can count on you to prevent this \n     provision from being included in the final version of the FY \n     1997 Defense Authorization bill.\n       I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n           With best regards.\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n[[Page S6484]]\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 18, 1995.\n     Sen.

If the current version of the FY 96 Defense \n     Authorization bill is signed into law, I will do everything \n     in my power to ensure that section 1402(b) is reversed in the \n     next Defense Authorization bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 1996.\n     Sen. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Pat: Thank you for your recent correspondence \n     regarding the anti-personnel landmine moratorium. I \n     appreciate your bringing to my attention the provision in the \n     House defense bill regarding a requirement for a \n     certification prior to the imposition of a moratorium.\n       As the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I \n     will support the Senate position on any issue that comes \n     before the conference on the defense authorization bill. \n     However, as you know, it is impossible for me, or any other \n     member of the Senate, to predict or guarantee the outcome of \n     any particular provision during the conference of a bill. As \n     always, I would support the Senate position with the House in \n     the conference on the defense authorization bill.\n       As I recall our agreement last year it was that I would not \n     offer any language to the fiscal year 1997 defense bill that \n     would undermine your provision, and you would not offer \n     language regarding the anti-personnel landmine moratorium to \n     the fiscal year 1997 defense authorization bill. I have kept \n     that agreement--there is no language in the fiscal year 1997 \n     Senate defense authorization bill regarding the anti-\n     personnel landmine moratorium.\n       With kindest regards and best wishes,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Strom Thurmond,\n                                                         Chairman.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, there are a few issues which I think must \nbe considered during what I expect will be complicated and \ncontroversial deliberations on the 1997 Defense authorization bill. \nFirst and foremost, this bill defines national security--the \nGovernment's primary obligation to its citizens.\n  The United States military is the greatest military power in the \nworld. In a time of rapidly evolving technology, sufficient yet \njudicious funding authority is absolutely essential to maintain the \nstatus quo. The committee budget is $12.9 billion higher than fiscal \nyear 1996 levels. However, adjusting this figure for inflation, the \nDepartment of Defense will actually see spending levels reduced by $5.5 \nbillion from last year.\n  The administration in 1994 and 1995 promised outyear funding would \nincrease to recover the shortfalls driven by deep cuts in earlier \nbudgets. Yet, for the second straight year, the Presidential budget is \nless than projected in previous years. I am confident that DOD will \nmeet its assigned mission, but I am concerned at what cost.\n  If we are to continue sending our soldiers into harm's way, this \nNation has a responsibility to provide them with the highest level of \ntechnology. I often overhear comments that since the fall of the Iron \nCurtain, America has no significant enemy. However, since 1989, America \nhas deployed more forces than at any time since 1964. Yes, the Soviet \nUnion is no more, but renegade factions continue to threaten our \nNation's security and vital economic interests. While we are the only \nremaining super power, our armed forces shouldn't be used in the role \nof the world's police force.\n  In the past 7 years, American forces have deployed to Panama, \nGrenada, and Saudi Arabia to protect our National interests. \nAdditionally, peacekeeping operations have sent our troops to Haiti, \nSomalia, and most recently Bosnia. This Nation has a responsibility to \nscrutinize each mission carefully and send American Forces only when \nabsolutely necessary. The threat is still there, but its face has \nchanged. America will continue to send her young soldiers and sailors \nto foreign shores to protect our peace, but we must be judicious in \nthose assignments.\n  As we examine the 1997 authorization, we must consider that the \nDefense budget has decreased to the lowest spending levels in 40 years. \nAs we debate these issues, we must strive to produce a budget which \ndefines national security and guarantees the Department of Defense has \nthe necessary funding to complete all assigned, carefully chosen \nmissions, obtain all training vital to success, and secure the best \ntechnology available. When this is finished, our military forces will \ncontinue to be the most influential military in the world and this \nNation's security unquestioned.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the pending \namendments would have to be set aside by unanimous consent before \nconsidering this block of amendments that have been consented to on \nboth sides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be set aside for \nthe purpose of taking up these amendments. I believe there are 19 \namendments that we will be presenting, which have been agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4063\n\n      (Purpose: To specify funding and requirements for research, \n development, test, and evaluation of advanced submarine technologies)\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Cohen, I offer an \namendment that would include a provision in the Senate bill that would \nprovide for explicit guidance on the intended use of funds that are \nauthorized for submarine technology. I believe this amendment has been \ncleared by the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne], for Mr. Cohen, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4063.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title II add the following:\n\n     SEC. 223: ADVANCED SUBMARINE TECHNOLOGIES.\n\n       (a) Amounts Authorized From Navy RDT Account.--Of the \n     amount authorized to be appropriated by section 201(2)--\n       (1) $489,443,000 is available for the design of the \n     submarine previously designated by the Navy as the New Attack \n     Submarine; and\n       (2) $100,000,000 is available to address the inclusion on \n     future nuclear attack submarines of core advanced \n     technologies, category I advanced technologies, and category \n     II advanced technologies, as such advanced technologies are \n     identified by the Secretary of Defense in Appendix C of the \n     report of the Secretary entitled ``Report on Nuclear Attack \n     Submarine Procurement and Submarine Technology'', submitted \n     to Congress on March 26, 1996.\n       (b) Certain Technologies To Be Emphasized.--In using funds \n     made available in accordance with subsection (a)(2), the \n     Secretary of the Navy shall emphasize research, development, \n     test, and evaluation of the technologies identified by the \n     Submarine Technology Assessment Panel (in the final report of \n     the panel to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for \n     Research, Development, and Acquisition, dated March 15, 1996) \n     as having the highest priority for initial investment.\n       (c) Shipyards Involved in Technology Development.--To \n     further implement the recommendations of the Submarine \n     Technology Assessment Panel, the Secretary of the Navy shall \n     ensure that the shipyards involved in the construction of \n     nuclear attack submarines are also principal participants in \n     the process of developing advanced submarine technologies and \n     including the technologies in future submarine designs. The \n     Secretary shall ensure that those shipyards have access for \n     such purpose (under procedures prescribed by the Secretary) \n     to the\n\n[[Page S6485]]\n\n     Navy laboratories and the Office of Naval Intelligence and \n     (in accordance with arrangements to be made by the Secreatry) \n     to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\n       (d) Funding for Contracts Under 1996 Agreement Among the \n     Navy and Shipyards.--In addition to the purposes of which the \n     amount authorized to be appropriated by section 201(2) are \n     available under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a), the \n     amounts avilable under such paragraphs are also available for \n     contracts with Electric Boat Division and Newport News \n     Shipbuilding to carry out the provisions of the ``Memorandum \n     of Agreement Among the Department of the Navy, Electric Boat \n     Corporation (EB), and Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock \n     Company (NNS) Concerning the New Attack Submarine'', dated \n     April 5, 1996, for reseach and development activities under \n     that memorandum of agreement.\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, this amendment would add a provision to \ntitle II of the Senate bill that reflects the markup position on \nadvanced submarine technology that is now reflected in report language \nand the funding tables that accompany the bill. This position was \ndeveloped as a result of testimony provided at a hearing on submarine \nprocurement and development and on the Secretary of Defense Report on \nNuclear Attack Submarine Procurement and Submarine Technology that was \nsubmitted to Congress on March 26, 1996 in compliance with section 131 \nof last year's defense authorization bill.\n  The hearing and report both indicate that the approach used by the \nNavy to invest in submarine technology should be revised to accommodate \nthe low rate of future production for attack submarines relative to \ncold war levels and the much higher rate of technology turnover that is \noccurring in the civilian sector. The previous focus on incorporating \nnew technologies into new designs that occurred with much greater \nfrequency than can be expected in the future and then reducing \ntechnology funding to subsistence funding until time for a new design \nwill no longer suffice to maintain the technological edge that our \nsubmarine force enjoyed during the cold war. A more promising model \nwould be the creation of a single, stable research and development \nprogram under a single product manager and funded at a steady state \nlevel that supports, matures, and incorporates new technology on a \ncontinuing basis. In other words a process of continuous rather than \ncyclical evolution. A far greater emphasis would be placed on \ninvolvement of civilian industry, particularly the shipyards involved \nin submarine construction, than has occurred in the past. The Report \naccompanying the Senate bill provides guidance that the Secretary of \nthe Navy is to use these funds to carry out high priority research on \nadvanced submarine technology that is identified in the Secretary of \nDefense's report.\n  The House also concluded that additional funding for submarine \ntechnology was needed. However, consistent with the fascination with \nsubmarine technology reflected in last year's conference negotiations, \nthe House bill would make over $200 million available for it in fiscal \nyear 1997 and pursue initiatives such as the development of six \ndifferent design alternatives at a cost of at least $500 million before \nsettling on a design for series production no earlier than fiscal year \n2003. The House provision also makes very detailed allocations on how \nsubmarine technology funds would be spent by the Navy without providing \nany objective analysis or documented justification to support this \nallocation.\n  It is clear that the House and Senate have developed divergent views \non how the course of future research and development for advanced \nsubmarine technology should proceed. It appears prudent, based on the \nmagnitude of funding increases in the House bill and its \nmicromanagement of them, to establish in the Senate bill a provision in \nlaw that articulates, with more force than can be achieved with report \nlanguage, the Senate's view on how the Navy should proceed with a \nprogram to develop submarine technology. This provision will provide \nstronger guidance to our conferees when they negotiate a final outcome \nin the fiscal year 1997 defense authorization bill. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me in voting in favor of this amendment.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, again, I point out there is no \nobjection from the other side.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge support of this amendment. It would \nclarify the Senate's intention on how the Navy should spend funds and \nimplement recommendations of the DOD's report on nuclear attack \nsubmarine procurement and technology. This is an important effort to \nbegin to address inefficiencies that have been identified in previous \nattack submarine R programs.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4063) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4064\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure that the annual report from the Reserve Forces \nPolicy Board is submitted as a report that is separate from the annual \n   report of the Secretary of Defense on the expenditures, work, and \n             accomplishments of the Department of Defense)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Byrd, I offer an \namendment that would make technical corrections to the references to \nthe annual report required to be submitted by the Reserve Forces Policy \nBoard and establish that the annual report be a separate report \nsubmitted in conjunction with the annual report of the Secretary of \nDefense.

PROVISION OF UNIFORM BENEFIT BY DESIGNATED \n                   PROVIDERS.\n\n       (a) Uniform Benefit Required.--A designated provider shall \n     offer to enrollees the health benefit option prescribed and \n     implemented by the Secretary under section 731 of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 \n     (Public Law 103-160; 10 U.S.C. 1073 note), including \n     accompanying cost-sharing requirements.\n       (b) Time for Implementation of Benefit.--A designated \n     provider shall offer the health benefit option described in \n     subsection (a) to enrollees upon the later of the following:\n       (1) The date on which health care services within the \n     health care delivery system of the uniformed services are \n     rendered through the TRICARE program in the region in which \n     the designated provider operates.\n       (2) October 1, 1996.\n       (c) Adjustments.--The Secretary may establish a later date \n     under subsection (b)(2) or prescribe reduced cost-sharing \n     requirements for enrollees.\n\n     SEC. 724. ENROLLMENT OF COVERED BENEFICIARIES.\n\n       (a) Fiscal Year 1997 Limitation.--(1) During fiscal year \n     1997, the number of covered beneficiaries who are enrolled in \n     managed care plans offered by designated providers may not \n     exceed the number of such enrollees as of October 1, 1995.\n       (2) The Secretary may waive the limitation under paragraph \n     (1) if the Secretary determines that additional enrollment \n     authority for a designated provider is required to \n     accommodate covered beneficiaries who are dependents of \n     members of the uniformed services entitled to health care \n     under section 1074(a) of title 10, United States Code.\n       (b) Permanent Limitation.--For each fiscal year after \n     fiscal year 1997, the number of enrollees in managed care \n     plans offered by designated providers may not exceed 110 \n     percent of the number of such enrollees as of the first day \n     of the immediately preceding fiscal year. The Secretary may \n     waive this limitation as provided in subsection (a)(2).\n       (c) Retention of Current Enrollees.--An enrollee in the \n     managed care program of a designated provider as of September \n     30, 1997, or such earlier date as the designated provider and \n     the Secretary may agree upon, shall continue receiving \n     services from the designated provider pursuant to the \n     agreement entered into under section 722 unless the enrollee \n     disenrolls from the designated provider. Except as provided \n     in subsection (e), the administering Secretaries may not \n     disenroll such an enrollee unless the disenrollment is agreed \n     to by the Secretary and the designated provider.\n       (d) Additional Enrollment Authority.--Other covered \n     beneficiaries may also receive health care services from a \n     designated provider, except that the designated provider may \n     market such services to, and enroll, only those covered \n     beneficiaries who--\n       (1) do not have other primary health insurance coverage \n     (other than medicare coverage) covering basic primary care \n     and inpatient and outpatient services; or\n       (2) are enrolled in the direct care system under the \n     TRICARE program, regardless of whether the covered \n     beneficiaries were users of the health care delivery system \n     of the uniformed services in prior years.\n       (e) Special Rule for Medicare-Eligible Beneficiaries.--If a \n     covered beneficiary who desires to enroll in the managed care \n     program of a designated provider is also entitled to hospital \n     insurance benefits under part A of title XVIII of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395c et seq.), the covered \n     beneficiary shall elect whether to receive health care \n     services as an enrollee or under part A of title XVIII of the \n     Social Security Act. The Secretary may disenroll an enrollee \n     who subsequently violates the election made under this \n     subsection and receives benefits under part A of title XVIII \n     of the Social Security Act.\n       (f) Information Regarding Eligible Covered Beneficiaries.--\n     The Secretary shall provide, in a timely manner, a designated \n     provider with an accurate list of covered beneficiaries \n     within the marketing area of the designated provider to whom \n     the designated provider may offer enrollment.\n\n     SEC. 725. APPLICATION OF CHAMPUS PAYMENT RULES.\n\n       (a) Application of Payment Rules.--Subject to subsection \n     (b), the Secretary shall require a private facility or health \n     care provider that is a health care provider under the \n     Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services \n     to apply the payment rules described in section 1074(c) of \n     title 10, United States Code, in imposing charges for health \n     care that the private facility or provider provides to \n     enrollees of a designated provider.\n       (b) Authorized Adjustments.--The payment rules imposed \n     under subsection (a) shall be subject to such modifications \n     as the Secretary considers appropriate. The Secretary may \n     authorize a lower rate than the maximum rate that would \n     otherwise apply under subsection (a) if the lower rate is \n     agreed to by the designated provider and the private facility \n     or health care provider.\n       (c) Regulations.--The Secretary shall prescribe regulations \n     to implement this section\n\n[[Page S6487]]\n\n     after consultation with the other administering Secretaries.\n       (d) Conforming Amendment.--Section 1074 of title 10, United \n     States Code, is amended by striking out subsection (d).\n\n     SEC. 726. PAYMENTS FOR SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Form of Payment.--Unless otherwise agreed to by the \n     Secretary and a designated provider, the form of payment for \n     services provided by a designated provider shall be full risk \n     capitation. The capitation payments shall be negotiated and \n     agreed upon by the Secretary and the designated provider. In \n     addition to such other factors as the parties may agree to \n     apply, the capitation payments shall be based on the \n     utilization experience of enrollees and competitive market \n     rates for equivalent health care services for a comparable \n     population to such enrollees in the area in which the \n     designated provider is located.\n       (b) Limitation on Total Payments.--Total capitation \n     payments to a designated provider shall not exceed an amount \n     equal to the cost that would have been incurred by the \n     Government if the enrollees had received their care through a \n     military treatment facility, the TRICARE program, or the \n     medicare program, as the case may be.\n       (c) Establishment of Payment Rates on Annual Basis.--The \n     Secretary and a designated provider shall establish \n     capitation payments on an annual basis, subject to periodic \n     review for actuarial soundness and to adjustment for any \n     adverse or favorable selection reasonably anticipated to \n     result from the design of the program.\n       (d) Alternative Basis for Calculating Payments.--After \n     September 30, 1999, the Secretary and a designated provider \n     may mutually agree upon a new basis for calculating \n     capitation payments.\n\n     SEC. 727. REPEAL OF SUPERSEDED AUTHORITIES.\n\n       (a) Repeals.--The following provisions of law are repealed:\n       (1) Section 911 of the Military Construction Authorization \n     Act, 1982 (42 U.S.C. 248c).\n       (2) Section 1252 of the Department of Defense Authorization \n     Act, 1984 (42 U.S.C. 248d).\n       (3) Section 718(c) of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal year 1991 (Public Law 101-510; 42 U.S.C. 248c \n     note).\n       (4) Section 726 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1996 (Public Law 104-106; 42 U.S.C. 248c \n     note).\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect on October 1, 1997.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment which \ndefines the future for Uniformed Services Treatment Facilities [USTFs] \nin order to ensure that these hospitals and clinics can continue to \nprovide high-quality care to thousands of military beneficiaries \nthroughout the country. Senators Sarbanes, Moynihan, and Murray have \njoined me as cosponsors of this amendment. I appreciate the \naccommodation of the Committee leadership for clearing my amendment for \ninclusion in the Senate version of the National Defense Authorization \nAct for fiscal year 1997.\n   USTFs are former Public Health Service hospitals that were \ntransferred to private, not-for-profit ownership during the Reagan \nadministration. The late Senator from Washington State, Scoop Jackson, \nsponsored legislation in 1981 that completed this transition by deeming \nthese hospitals and clinics facilities of the Uniformed Services and \nauthorizing them to provide health care to military beneficiaries, \nincluding retirees and family members of active-duty personnel and \nretirees. I was proud to join as a cosponsor of that amendment during \nmy first year in the Senate.\n  USTFs have performed well over the past 15 years as providers of \ncost-effective and quality military health care. There are currently 9 \nUSTFs operated by 7 organizations serving about 120,000 military \nbeneficiaries in nine States: Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New \nHampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Texas, and Washington. These \nfacilities have a loyal base of beneficiaries who have come to rely on \nthem as their primary care providers.\n  USTFs have also pioneered new innovations in military health care, \nincluding full at-risk managed care. I sponsored an amendment in 1992 \nthat required the Department of Defense [DOD] to enter into agreements \nwith USTFs to carry out a managed care delivery program. The USTFs \nmanaged care program, called the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan, \nI am told, has further reduced costs and has consistently received a \nfavorable beneficiary rating in excess of 90 percent.\n  The USTFs are now at a crossroads. With their current participation \nagreements expiring next year, USTFs and DOD entered into negotiations \nlate last year aimed at integrating the USTFs program into the overall \nmilitary health care system. The negotiations resulted in a set of \n``guiding principles'' which both DOD and USTFs accepted. My amendment \nimplements these ``guiding principles'' by clarifying how the USTF \nprogram will be integrated into the TRICARE program. With one exception \nconcerning the date for the application of TRICARE enrollment fees and \nincreased co-payments, my amendment is identical to the provisions of \nthe House-passed National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year \n1997.\n  My amendment reflects a careful compromise reached between the USTFs \nand DOD to protect the interests of the military beneficiary and the \ntaxpayer. In addition to integrating the USTFs into TRICARE, my \namendment limits the growth of the USTF program and implements a \nrecommendation of a new GAO report by disenrolling USTF beneficiaries \nwho receive benefits under Medicare. A more detailed section-by-section \nsummary of my amendment will follow this statement.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is a true compromise which serves the \ninterest of American servicemen and women. It not only has the support \nof the Health Affairs Office at the Defense Department, but except for \nthe one difference already mentioned, the entirety of my amendment has \nbeen included in the House-passed bill. I thank the Committee \nleadership for agreeing to include this amendment in the Senate bill as \nwell.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the summary I mentioned be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Section-by-Section Summary of the Gorton Amendment\n\n       The amendment adds a new subtitle B to title VII dealing \n     with the Uniformed Services Treatment Facilities.\n       Section 721 defines nine terms in subtitle B.\n       Section 722 reauthorized the USTFs as ``designated \n     providers'' of health care to military beneficiaries. DOD is \n     directed to negotiate and enter into new agreements with each \n     USTF on a sole source basis. Although the competitive \n     requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) \n     would not apply, the FAR would apply to USTF agreements as \n     ``acquisitions of commercial items.'' The new USTF agreements \n     would be required by the later of October 1, 1997 (when the \n     current agreements expire) or when TRICARE is implemented in \n     the region served by the USTF. The Seattle USTF, however, \n     could begin their agreement sooner than October 1, 1997. \n     USTFs which will not have TRICARE in their regions until \n     after 1997 will automatically have their current \n     participation agreement extended. The USTFs shall comply with \n     ``necessary and appropriate'' administrative requirements \n     established by DOD for other health care providers. USTFs \n     would be exempt from state health maintenance organization \n     licensure requirements. A USTF could not contract out more \n     than 5% of its primary care enrollment without DOD's \n     approval, except for contracts in effect on the date of \n     enactment.\n       Section 723 established the process for applying the \n     uniform benefit to the USTFs. The USTFs would be required to \n     apply the TRICARE Prime enrollment fees and increased co-\n     payments the later of October 1, 1996 or when TRICARE is \n     implemented in their region. DOD has the discretion to \n     prescribe a later date or reduce the cost shares.\n       Section 724 establishes two enrollee caps to limit the \n     growth of the USTFs. For FY-1997, the enrollee cap consists \n     of the total number of those enrolled in the program (even \n     those for which no funding was provided) as of October 1, \n     1995 plus new active-duty dependents that DOD could waive \n     into the program. For FY-1998 and beyond, the program \n     enrollee cap is 10% higher than the previous year. This \n     section also requires that all existing enrollees continue to \n     receive care under the new agreements unless the beneficiary \n     disenrolls. The USTF can also enroll additional \n     beneficiaries, but can only market to those who do not have \n     other non-governmental primary health insurance coverage or \n     are participating in the TRICARE program. This section also \n     authorized DOD to automatically disenroll any beneficiary \n     over 65 who unlawfully receives benefits under Medicare. This \n     provision reflects the recommendations of a new GAO report \n     and should prevent double payments.\n       Section 725 applies the CHAMPUS payment rules to the USTFs. \n     DOD could modify the payment rules as appropriate and could \n     authorize a lower rate than the maximum rate if agreed to by \n     the USTF and the primary health care provider facility.\n       Section 726 states that the form of payments for the USTFs \n     will be full-risk capitation negotiated and agreed upon by \n     DOD and the USTFs. The capitation payments must be based on \n     utilization experience of enrollees and ``competitive market \n     rates'' for equivalent health care services for a comparable \n     population in the area served by the\n\n[[Page S6488]]\n\n     USTF. The total capitation cannot exceed the amount incurred \n     had the beneficiary received care from a military hospital or \n     under TRICARE. The capitation payments will be established on \n     an annual basis and subject to periodic review to reflect \n     actuarial soundness and adverse selection. The USTFs and DOD \n     may mutually agree upon a new basis for calculating \n     capitation payments after September 30, 1999.\n       Section 727 repeals much of the existing, now superseded \n     USTF provisions, including the statutory status, the \n     authority for managed care agreements, and the application of \n     the FAR and the TRICARE cost shares. The repeals take effect \n     on October 1, 1997.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been \ncleared.\n  Mr. NUNN. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4065) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4066\n\n(Purpose: To authorize the Secretaries of the military departments and \n  the Secretary of Transportation to carry out a food donation pilot \n                   program at the service academies)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Sarbanes, I offer an \namendment which would authorize the Secretaries of the military \ndepartments and the Secretary of Transportation to carry out a food \ndonation program at the service academies, under their respective \njurisdiction. I believe this amendment has been cleared on the other \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], for Mr. Sarbanes, for \n     himself and Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4066.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle F of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1072. FOOD DONATION PILOT PROGRAM AT THE SERVICE \n                   ACADEMIES.\n\n       (a) Program Authorized.--The Secretaries of the military \n     departments and the Secretary of Transportation may each \n     carry out a food donation pilot program at the service \n     academy under the jurisdiction of the Secretary.\n       (b) Donations and Collections of Food and Grocery \n     Products.--Under the pilot program, the Secretary concerned \n     may donate to, and permit others to collect for, a nonprofit \n     organization any food or grocery product that--\n       (1) is--\n       (A) an apparently wholesome food;\n       (B) an apparently fit grocery product; or\n       (C) a food or grocery product that is donated in accordance \n     with section 402(e) of the National and Community Service Act \n     of 1990 (42 U.S.C.A 12672(e));\n       (2) is owned by the United States;\n       (3) is located at a service academy under the jurisdiction \n     of the Secretary; and\n       (4) is excess to the requirements of the academy.\n       (c) Program Commencement.--The Secretary concerned shall \n     commence carrying out the pilot program, if at all, during \n     fiscal year 1997.\n       (d) Applicability of Good Samaritan Food Donation Act.--\n     Section 402 of the National and Community Service Act of 1990 \n     (42 U.S.C. 12672) shall apply to donations and collections of \n     food and grocery products under the pilot program without \n     regard to section 403 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 12673).\n       (e) Reports.--(1) Each Secretary that carries out a pilot \n     program at a service academy under this section shall submit \n     to Congress an interim report and a final report on the pilot \n     program.\n       (2) The Secretary concerned shall submit the interim report \n     not later than one year after the date on which the Secretary \n     commences the pilot program at a service academy.\n       (3) The Secretary concerned shall submit the final report \n     not later than 90 days after the Secretary completes the \n     pilot program at a service academy.\n       (4) Each report shall include the following:\n       (A) A description of the conduct of the pilot program.\n       (B) A discussion of the experience under the pilot program.\n       (C) An evaluation of the extent to which section 402 of the \n     National and Community Service Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12672) \n     has been effective in protecting the United States and others \n     from liabilities associated with actions taken under the \n     pilot program.\n       (D) Any recommendations for legislation to facilitate \n     donations or collections of excess food and grocery products \n     of the United States or others for nonprofit organizations.\n       (f) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``service academy'' means each of the \n     following:\n       (A) The United States Military Academy.\n       (B) the United States Naval Academy.\n       (C) The United States Air Force Academy.\n       (D) The United States Coast Guard Academy.\n       (2) The term ``Secretary concerned'' means the following\n       (A) The Secretary of the Army, with respect to the United \n     States Military Academy.\n       (B) The Secretary of the Navy, with respect to the United \n     States Naval Academy.\n       (C) The Secretary of the Air Force, with respect to the \n     United States Air Force Academy.\n       (D) The Secretary of Transportation, with respect to the \n     United States Coast Guard Academy.\n       (3) The terms ``apparently fit grocery product'', \n     ``apparently wholesome food'', ``donate'', ``food'', and \n     ``grocery product'' have the meanings given those terms in \n     section 402(b) of the National and Community Service Act of \n     1990 (42 U.S.C. 12672(b)).\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment \nwhich would establish a voluntary food donation pilot program at the \nservice academies. The amendment would provide the academies with the \nnecessary authority to donate surplus foods to nonprofit organizations \nfor hunger relief efforts in their local communities.\n  With the need for food assistance escalating, especially among our \nworking poor, this additional source of food which might otherwise go \nto waste, could help to alleviate hunger in these surrounding \ncommunities. I look forward to the academies' voluntary participation \nin and the overall success of this program.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. This amendment has been cleared on our side.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4066) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4067\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the designation of a memorial as the National \n                            D-Day Memorial)\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Warner, I offer \nan amendment that would designate a memorial to be constructed in \nBedford, VA, to be known as the ``National D-Day Memorial.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne], for Mr. Warner, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4067.\n       At the appropriate place in title X, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . DESIGNATION OF MEMORIAL AS NATIONAL D-DAY MEMORIAL.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The memorial to be constructed by the \n     National D-Day Memorial Foundation in Bedford, Virginia, is \n     hereby designated as a national memorial to be known as the \n     ``National D-Day Memorial''. The memorial shall serve to \n     honor the members of the Armed Forces of the United States \n     who served in the invasion of Normandy, France, in June 1944.\n       (b) Public Proclamation.--The President is requested and \n     urged to issue a public proclamation acknowledging the \n     designation of the memorial to be constructed by the National \n     D-Day Memorial Foundation in Bedford, Virginia, as the \n     National D-Day Memorial.\n       (c) Maintenance of Memorial.--All expenses for maintenance \n     and care of the memorial shall be paid for with non-Federal \n     funds, including funds provided by the National D-Day \n     Memorial Foundation. The United States shall not be liable \n     for any expense incurred for the maintenance and care of the \n     memorial.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the designation of the memorial to be constructed in Bedford, \nVirginia as the National D-Day Memorial.\n  The Normandy Invasion of June 6, 1944--more commonly known as D-Day--\nwas the largest air, land, and sea invasion ever undertaken. The sheer \nmagnitude of the invasion, which included 4,870 ships, 7,200 planes and \n250,000 soldiers was unprecedented. By the battle's end, causalities \nfor the Allied forces numbered 9,758, including 6,603 Americans. As the \nturning point in World War II, D-Day will forever be remembered as the \ndecisive battle that spelled the beginning of the end for Hitler's \ndream of Nazi domination of the world.\n  Remarkably, there is no memorial in the United States commemorating \nthis\n\n[[Page S6489]]\n\nimportant battle. My amendment would rectify this oversight by \ndesignating the memorial to be constructed in Bedford, Virginia as the \nNational D-Day Memorial.\n  Bedford is the ideal location for a National D-Day Memorial for \nseveral reasons. Most important, Bedford, VA--home base for Company A \nof the 116th Infantry Regiment--sustained the highest per-capita loss \nof any single community as a result of the D-Day invasion. In addition, \nthe 88-acre scenic site is easily accessible via the interstate highway \nsystem and overlooks the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains.\n  It is important to realize that this designation is not exclusively \ngranted to the memorial in Bedford, and obligates no federal funds for \nconstruction or operation of the memorial now or in the future.\n  When completed, this memorial will serve as a lasting tribute to all \nwho took part in D-Day, as a reminder of the price paid for freedom and \npeace, and as a resource to educate future generations about the \nsignificance and sacrifice of D-Day.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, this has been cleared by the other \nside.\n  Mr. NUNN. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

MODIFIED END STRENGTH AUTHORIZATION FOR MILITARY \n                   TECHNICIANS FOR THE AIR NATIONAL GUARD FOR \n                   FISCAL YEAR 1997.\n\n       Section 513(b)(3) of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1996 (Public Law 104-106; 110 Stat. 305; 10 \n     U.S.C. 115 note) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(3) Air National Guard:\n       ``(A) For fiscal year 1996, 22,906.\n       ``(B) For fiscal year 1997, 22,956.''.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this amendment which I am offering on behalf \nof myself and Senators Ford and Feinstein enables Air National Guard \nunits in North Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia, Kentucky, and \nCalifornia to maintain their full complement of 12 C-130's. Without \n$6.7 million in operations and maintenance funds and $2.0 million in \npersonnel funds, these units would be forced, prematurely and perhaps \nunnecessarily, to reduce their airlift capacity to 10 aircraft per \nunit.\n  The President's budget for Fiscal Year 1997 reduces the Air National \nGuard inventory of C-130's in these five states from 12 aircraft per \nunit to 10 in accordance with earlier Air Force program decisions. \nHowever, subsequent to the FY 1997 budget submission, the Air Force \ninitiated an airlift analysis which, together with congressionally-\ndirected C-130 Master Stationing Plan, would provide the Air Force with \na comprehensive look at long-term airlift requirements. Therefore, it \nis premature to reduce the number of aircraft in these units until the \ntotal force requirements analysis is completed. If these aircraft and \npersonnel are eliminated from the force, it would be difficult to \nreplace them, should the ongoing study demonstrate an ongoing \nrequirement for them.\n  Mr. President, airlift has long been the ugly duckling of aircraft \nprograms, drab and utilitarian next to the swans that are fighter and \nbomber aircraft. But airlift is essential to every military operation, \ndelivering the supplies that keep our military going. Air National \nGuard units are critical to maintaining the supply pipeline, and I am \nconfident that the Air Force study will recognize the value of \nretaining the maximum number of C-130's in the inventory.\n  Mr. FORD. This amendment is very simple, and as I understand, is \nacceptable to both sides. During the 1997 Fiscal Year budget \ndeliberations at the Pentagon, a decision was made to reduce the Air \nNational Guard C-130 fleet by ten aircraft. Two aircraft would be taken \nfrom each of the five units in the States of Kentucky, West Virginia, \nCalifornia, North Carolina and Tennessee. However, the Air Force has \ninitiated an Inter-theater Lift Analysis to determine the impact of the \nC-17 on the C-130 requirements. Furthermore, the Air Force has not yet \ncompleted its C-130 Master Stationing Plan.\n  My colleagues and I believe it is premature to reduce the Air \nNational Guard C-130 fleet below current levels until both of the \nstudies have been completed and the comprehensive Total Force airlift \nrequirements have been approved by Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  \na letter from the Adjutant General of Kentucky, Gen. John R. Groves, \nJr. General of the Kentucky National Guard immediately following my \nremarks.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         Commonwealth of Kentucky,\n\n\n                               Department of Military Affairs,\n\n                                    Frankfort, KY, April 18, 1996.\n     The Adjutant General\n     100 Minuteman Parkway\n     Frankfort, KY.\n\n     Hon. Wendell H. Ford,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ford: The upcoming congressional action \n     concerning Defense Authorization Bills is one of great \n     importance to the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the Nation. We \n     in Kentucky ask for you and your colleagues' support of the \n     following facts as they relate to the Air National Guard's \n     role in National Defense.\n       The Kentucky Air National Guard has proven to be one of the \n     most cost-effective means of maintaining the Nation's Total \n     Air Force capability within the constraints of a shrinking \n     defense budget. This has never been more evident than with \n     our Air National Guard C-130H aircraft and unit personnel \n     constantly being involved in worldwide contingencies.\n       Our Kentucky Air National Guard units as well as those of \n     other C-130 states like; West Virginia, North Carolina, \n     Tennessee and California are more involved today than ever \n     before. Recently, I watched Kentucky C-130's fly out of \n     Louisville International Airport for destination like \n     Honduras and Germany in support of Operation Joint Endeavor. \n     The men and women of the Kentucky Air National Guard perform \n     these and many other missions in support of national policy \n     with a high degree of experience and an even higher degree of \n     professionalism.\n       For years the Congress has provided funding to maintain \n     several Air National Guard C-130 units at 12 primary \n     authorized aircraft (PAA). Secretary Perry has indicated the \n     Air National Guard's participation in airlift will continue \n     to increase, as I am sure is based on the great record of \n     Total Force support by Air National Guard C-130 units like \n     Kentucky. If the Air National Guard's support of national \n     defense initiatives continues, then so should the funding of \n     twelve primary authorized aircraft and its associated \n     personnel package. Reduced funds in the FY 97 Defense budget \n     and further reductions in the out years of defense budgets \n     will impact the Air National Guard's ability to step up to \n     increased operations tempo.\n       We in Kentucky feel strongly that the Air National Guard \n     force structure should remain constant until a new National \n     Security Review is completed and that the C-130 airlift units \n     in the five states mentioned above\n\n[[Page S6490]]\n\n     should retain their current primary authorized aircraft of \n     twelve. This would most assuredly be more cost effective than \n     any reduction of authorized aircraft necessary to meet near \n     term total Air Force requirements.\n       The stabilization of these five states C-130 units at 12 \n     (PAA) would require Congressional restoration of $8.7 million \n     in Air National Guard accounts for operations, maintenance \n     and military personnel. Additionally, authorized manpower \n     increases of 25 AGR's 310 drill, and 50 military technician \n     positions are necessary to support maintaining these units.\n       If my office can be of any assistance to you in this \n     concern of great importance to the Commonwealth, please call \n     me at (502) 564-8558. Thank you.\n                                     John R. Groves, Jr. BG, KyNG,\n                                             The Adjutant General.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4068) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4069\n\n (Purpose: To modify the specification of the source authorization of \n        appropriations for certain submarine program contracts)\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Cohen, I offer an \namendment that would properly identify the appropriation that will be \nused to fund the transfer of design information for the next nuclear \nattack submarine from the lead design shipyard to the second building \nshipyard, under the terms of an agreement that has been negotiated \nbetween the Navy and the two building yards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In section 123(a), strike out paragraph (2), and insert in \n     lieu thereof the following:\n       (2) In addition to the purposes for which the amount \n     authorized to be appropriated by section 102(a)(3) is \n     available under subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (1), \n     the amounts available under such subparagraphs are also \n     available for contracts with Electric Boat Division and \n     Newport News Shipbuilding to carry out the provisions of the \n     ``Memorandum of Agreement Among the Department of the Navy, \n     Electric Boat Corporation (EB) and Newport News Shipbuilding \n     and Drydock Company (NNS) Concerning the New Attack \n     Submarine'', dated April 5, 1996, relating to design data \n     transfer, design improvements, integrated process teams, and \n     updated design base.\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, this amendment is intended to properly \nidentify the resources that will be used to carry of the transfer of \ndesign information for the fiscal year 1998 nuclear attack submarine \nfrom the lead design shipyard, Electric Boat, to Newport News \nShipbuilding and Drydock, the shipyard that will build the fiscal year \n1999 submarine. In its present form section 123 would direct that \ndesign transfer be funded from the Navy's Research and Development \naccount. Subsequent to markup and referral of the bill, I have been \ninformed by the Navy that the correct account to fund this activity \nshould be the Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy appropriation.\n  This amendment will require no change in funding levels in the bill \nthat is under consideration. Sufficient resources have been proposed in \nthe bill to carry out design transfer activities for the fiscal year \n1999 submarine. The amendment is simply a bookkeeping change that will \nproperly align funding sources with intended activity.\n  I encourage the other members to join me in voting in favor of this \namendment.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. This amendment has been cleared.\n  Mr. NUNN. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Simon, I offer an \namendment which would revise the National Security Education Program by \nrevising the service requirement for award recipients and making other \nimprovements in the program. I believe this amendment has also been \ncleared by the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the National Security Education Program has \nbeen temporarily suspended. The consequence is that an estimated 324 \nU.S. graduate and undergraduate student finalists are anxiously waiting \nto hear whether they will be able to study and conduct research in \ncritical national security areas of the world. These students are \nwaiting because a change in the service obligation was attached to the \nFY 1996 Defense Appropriations Bill to require NSEP award recipients to \n``be employed by the Department of Defense or in the Intelligence \nCommunity.'' Previously, students could fulfill this requirement by \nworking in any branch of the federal government or higher education.\n  The current service obligation is unworkable. However, I agree that \nthere should be a return of investment to the Department of Defense for \nits support of the National Security Education Program. To this end I \nam offering an amendment that will improve this program by better \ntargeting the service obligation to meet national security needs and to \nincrease program accountability. The continuation of the National \nSecurity Education Program is vital to fill the existing gap in America \nfor linguists and country specialists in critical areas of national \nsecurity.\n  I would like to call the attention of my colleagues to a letter that \nI received from the Honorable Walter Mondale, Ambassador of the United \nStates to Japan, about the importance of the National Security \nEducation Program.\n  As Ambassador Mondale's letter points out, we have only 1,700 \nAmerican students studying in Japan, compared with 45,000 Japanese \nstudents in the U.S. The National Security Education Program has made \nthe largest number of awards to American undergraduate and graduate \nstudents to learn the language and culture of Japan. This is only one \nexample of over 100 countries in which NSEP recipients have studied. \nThe continuation of this program makes sense because it is in America's \nlong-term national security and economic interests to educate our \nstudents in foreign languages and cultures.\n  I urge my colleagues to read Ambassador Mondale's letter and to work \nwith me to support improvements to the NSEP and the continuation of \nother federal programs that support international educational and \ncultural exchange.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Ambassador Mondale's letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was order to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 Ambassador of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                              Tokyo, May 30, 1996.\n     Hon. Paul Simon,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington DC.\n       Dear Paul: I wanted to write you about a matter that has \n     come up to give you my perspective. I am worried by the \n     present threat to the future of the National Security \n     Education Program (NSEP). This has been a great success over \n     here. The new service requirements that mandate future \n     service in the Defense Department of ``the intelligence \n     community'' will, I fear, dry up the pool of applicants, \n     alienate the American scholarly community, and undermine the \n     ability of awardees to operate comfortably in foreign \n     countries.\n       U.S. Japanese language students have been the largest \n     single group of NSEP grantees. Therefore, the impact here of \n     these new provisions will be particularly severe. Is there \n     any chance that the existing provisions could be retained?\n       Increasing the numbers of American students learning about \n     Japan must be a major of our efforts here. The goal of having \n     more Americans learning about this very different society is \n     in our long-term national security, as well as economic, \n     interests. Currently, we have only about 1,700 American \n     students in Japan, compared to 45,000 Japanese students in \n     the U.S.\n       Since it started a couple of years ago, the NSEP program \n     has been a welcome contributor to the in-depth training of \n     Americans. Thanks to NSEP scholarships, 100 undergraduates \n     have already studied in Japan, and some 36 more are slated to \n     come this year.\n       I write you personally because I believe the NSEP program \n     has been very helpful and I hope we can keep it going as \n     presently constituted.

Mr. President, this amendment would restore the planning \ndate for serial production of the next class of nuclear attack \nsubmarine to the fiscal year 2000, the date reflected in last year's \nSenate defense authorization bill. The amendment is intended to resolve \na flaw in congressional direction regarding serial production of the \nnext class of nuclear attack submarine that, if left standing, could \nhave a devastating impact on the Nation's submarine industrial base. \nThis flawed direction, contained in the section 131 of the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, mandates a delay in \ndesign competition for the next class of nuclear attack submarine until \nfiscal year 2003. It was identified in the Secretary of Defense Report \non Nuclear Attack Submarine Procurement and Submarine Technology that \nwas submitted to Congress on March 26, 1996 in compliance with section \n131 of last year's defense authorization bill.\n  Under the assumption that no suitable design could be available until \nthe first decade of the next century, section 131 directed the \nSecretary of Defense to plan to commence serial production of the next \nclass of nuclear attack submarine no earlier than fiscal year 2003. Let \nme emphasize that the Senate conferees did not share this view, but \naccepted this proviso in section 131, and others with which they \ndisagreed, in order to reach conclusion of a conference that had lasted \nfar too long.\n  The Secretary of Defense's report makes clear the Department of \nDefense's disagreement with the premise that the design being developed \nfor the next nuclear attack submarine, now called the New Attack \nSubmarine, that is to be first authorized in fiscal year 1998 will be \ninadequate for the requirements set for it by the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. This view is strongly supported by an independent Submarine \nTechnology Assessment Panel that was commissioned by the Secretary of \nthe Navy to assist in preparation of the Secretary of Defense's report.\n  The approach recommended by the report and the panel is to: utilize \nthe New Attack Submarine design as the basis for serial production; \nfund a continuing level of effort for submarine research and \ndevelopment; and incorporate new technologies that emerge from this \nresearch effort into the base design as they mature. These findings are \nconsistent with the position of the Senate during last year's \nconference.\n  This year's House version of the defense authorization bill provides \nextensive direction of how it would pursue development of the next \nclass of submarine. included is direction to the Navy to develop six \nindependent designs that would be completed in fiscal year 2003. The \nwinning design would then become the basis for serial production of the \nnext class of nuclear attack submarine. Aside from the cost \nimplications of pursuing six independent designs, the consequences of \ndelaying a design competition until fiscal year 2003 and the ensuing \ndelay of up to two years before actual authorization of the first \nsubmarine would be a gap of four to five years between submarine \ncontract awards no matter which shipyard, Newport News or Electric \nBoat, wins the competition for serial production. Such a lengthy \nproduction break could not be tolerated by either shipyard. The \nSecretary of Defense's Report points out the disruptive effect of such \na lengthy delay and notes the need for additional authorizations in \norder to maintain a viable construction base for nuclear attack \nsubmarines.\n  By accepting the Secretary of Defense's proposal for incorporating \nnew technology into future nuclear attack submarine and setting fiscal \nyear 2000 as the year in which serial production can begin, the future \nof the submarine industrial base can be preserved. The Senate bill, as \nmodified by this amendment would accomplish that objective. I strongly \nencourage my colleagues in the Senate to join me in supporting the \namendment.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to know what the amendment \nis. I would like an explanation of the amendment.\n  Mr. NUNN. I believe the Senator from Idaho has the explanation.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, this amendment would restore the \nplanning date for serial production of the next class of nuclear \nsubmarines to fiscal year 2000, the date reflected in last year's \nSenate defense authorization bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4071) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4072 to Amendment No. 4061\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, with the indulgence of the managers, I \nhave worked out an agreement with Senator Simpson. I would propose a \nsecond-degree amendment to the Simpson amendment. I believe we can \ndispose of it by voice vote. Mr. President, I have a second degree \namendment at the desk, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4072 to amendment 4061.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, none of \n     the funds authorized for construction, Phase I, of a combined \n     support maintenance shop at Camp Gunnson, Wyoming may be \n     obligated until the Secretary of Defense certifies to \n     Congress that the project is in the Future Years Defense \n     Plan.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have discussed this amendment with \nSenator Simpson. I have explained to him and to Senator Thomas that the \nreason this amendment was in violation of the sense of the Senate \ncriteria for MILCON, for military construction projects, was that it \nwas not in the future year defense plan. Both Senator Thomas and \nSenator Simpson pointed out that it was an inadvertent absence from the \nmilitary future year defense plan. If it was inadvertent, then clearly \nthe Secretary of Defense can come over with a letter and say this is in \nthe future year defense plan. And I believe that Senator Simpson and \nSenator Thomas are confident that will happen especially since they \nwere assured that there is a safety and health problem here which they \nare very cognizant of, and that this is a very important project.\n  I believe that it is sensible to ask for the funds to be not \nauthorized until the Secretary of Defense comes over with a letter \nsaying that it is included in the future year defense plan which I \nthink could happen in a matter of days.\n  Before I yield, I am fully aware that this is the last period of time \nhere in the Senate for my dear friend from Wyoming, Senator Simpson. I \nam equally appreciative of his continuing commitment to the people of \nWyoming, and to the Guard in his State. He has never--as he and I have \ndiscussed--come over for an additional project in the 10 years that I \nhave here--an unauthorized project. He has never pork barreled. He has \nnever sought special favors for his State. I do not believe he is doing \nso now.\n  I am grateful that he accepts this second-degree amendment so that we \ncan get it done in the future year defense plan and get the much needed \nproject for the State of Wyoming and for the men and women who serve \nthere.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arizona for \nhelping us to resolve this issue. I appreciate his good faith \nassistance. It was important to resolving it.\n  I am going to say that I am going to miss my friend from Arizona \nbecause we do communicate at the most earthy levels of discussion. Both \nof us have\n\n[[Page S6493]]\n\nbeen trained in different fields. But there is no one I respect more \nand admire more. And I have said that. Sometimes this is but a sparrow \ngas in the midst of a typhoon compared to what the Senator from Arizona \nand I have been into in years past, especially with regard to senior \ncitizens. But we will not go into that.\n  So I thank him. I very much appreciate it. I thank Senator Nunn and \nSenator Kempthorne. This is a good resolution of an issue which was \nvery tough for us on behalf of my colleagues. But I thank the Senator \nfrom Arizona very much.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, has the second-degree amendment been \naccepted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. It has not.\n  The question is on agreeing to the second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Smith and \nSantorum I offer an amendment that would reaffirm in law the authority \nof the Secretary of the Navy to acquire ships that are needed to \nimprove the capability of the Marine Corps Maritime Prepositions Force.\n  I believe this amendment has been cleared by the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne], for Mr. Smith, for \n     himself and Mr. Santorum, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4073.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of subtitle C of title I add the following:\n\n     SEC. 125. MARITIME PREPOSITIONING SHIP PROGRAM ENHANCEMENT.\n\n       Section 2218(f) of title 10, United States Code, shall not \n     apply in the case of the purchase of three ships for the \n     purpose of enhancing Marine Corps prepositioning ship \n     squadrons.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, since fiscal year 1995 the Senate has \nannually sponsored in its defense authorization bill a program for \nenhancement of the Marine Corps maritime prepositioning force by the \npurchase and conversion of three ships from the world market. An \nadditional ship for each of the three Marine Corps prepositioned \nsquadrons will allow them to carry extra materiel, including an \nexpeditionary airfield, a fleet hospital, a Navy mobile construction \nbattalion equipment set, Marine Corps command element equipment, and \nadditional sustainment supplies. The lessons learned from the Marine \nCorps' experience in Desert Storm demonstrate that having this \nadditional equipment afloat on a continuing basis will provide our \nwarfighting commanders with much greater flexibility when they choose \nto employ Marine Corps units.\n  For 3 years the Senate Armed Services Committee has intensively \nstudied various options for providing MPF enhancement for the Marine \nCorps. The objective has been an affordable program that will deliver \nan adequate capability at the lowest cost to the taxpayer. The \ncommittee has consistently concluded that a program for purchase and \nmodest conversion of existing ships represents the best means to \nachieve this goal. However, the committee has avoided any temptation to \nforeclose possible alternatives. Consequently, section 345 of the \nSenate bill, which would authorize additional funds for the MPF \nEnhancement program, leaves open the option to satisfy its requirements \nby construction of new ships, if this option can compete based on cost \nand timeliness. The Senate approach is supported by the Marine Corps, \nthe Navy, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and by the vast majority of \nUnited States shipyards.\n\n  Although the House supported the Senate program for MPF Enhancement \nin both the fiscal year 1995 and 1996 defense authorization bills, it \nhas now included a provision in its version of the defense \nauthorization bill that would exclude the purchase and conversion of \nexisting ships for the MPF Enhancement program. This action is yet \nanother in a series of exclusionary provisions proposed by the House \nthat seek to limit competition, no matter what the cost to the taxpayer \nand the ship construction and repair industry as a whole.\n  My amendment would reaffirm in law an authorization for the purchase \nand conversion of the ships needed to provide MPF Enhancement for the \nMarine Corps by the most cost effective means. It will also provide a \nstrong Senate position for use by our conferees that stands in stark \ncontrast to the exclusionary one contained in the House bill. I \nstrongly encourage my fellow Senators to join Senator Santorum and \nmyself in supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4073) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4074\n\n  (Purpose: To revise and improve the authority for research projects \n  under transactions other than contracts and grants and for certain \n            cooperative research and development agreements)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Bingaman, for himself \nand Senator Smith, I offer an amendment which would revise the \nlegislation governing the use of cooperative agreements and innovative \ntransaction authorities under section 2371 of title X, United States \nCode.\n  The revisions are supported by the Department of Defense. And I \nbelieve this amendment has also been cleared by the Republican side of \nthe aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment which I have offered on \nbehalf of myself and the Senator from New Hampshire makes a series of \nchanges in section 2371 of title 10, United States Code, that are \ndesigned to make this authority more useful to the military services \nand defense agencies.\n  Earlier this year, the General Accounting Office submitted a report \nto the Armed Services Committee entitled ``DOD Research: Acquiring \nResearch by Nontraditional Means.'' I was very encouraged by the \nfindings of this very constructive report. The report concluded that \ncooperative agreements and other transactions carried out under the \nauthority of section 2371 of title 10, United States Code, have \nprovided DOD a tool to leverage the private sector's technological \nknow-how and financial investment and have attracted firms that \ntraditionally did not perform research for DOD to carrying out such \nresearch.\n  Mr. President, in light of the significant declines projected in \ndefense research spending and the continued rapid growth of private-\nsector research investments, Senator Smith and I believe that it is \ngoing to become even more important for DOD to leverage commercial \nresearch investments and attract commercial firms to working on service \nrequirements. Innovative military leaders such as the Marine Corps \nCommandant, General Krulak, and the former Vice Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs, Admiral Owens, fully recognize this and are taking steps to \ninsure the services leverage, and don't duplicate private sector \nefforts.\n  However, the report also points out that DARPA has been the primary \nutilizer of this innovative transaction authority thus far and that \nthere has been some confusion on the use of this instrument among the \nservices. Since DOD is preparing new guidance on this matter, the Armed \nServices Committee in its report on the pending legislation sought to \nclarify several points. First, the committee intended in creating other \ntransactions authority to maximize flexibility on intellectual property \nnegotiations with private sector entities. In particular, the committee \ndid not intend that such transactions be subject to the provisions of \nPublic Law 96-517, as amended. The GAO report points out that this \nadditional flexibility has been important in attracting commercial \nfirms to carry out cost-shared research with the Pentagon. Second, the \ncommittee intended that the sunk cost of prior research efforts not \ncount as cost-share on the part of the private sector firms. Only the \nadditional resources provided by the private sector needed to carry out \nthe specific project should be counted. Finally in the committee's \nhearings DOD officials testified that the reluctance of the services to \nuse other transactions authority derived in part from the requirement \nthat standard contract, grant or cooperative agreement first be found \nnot feasible or appropriate for carrying out any given project. The \ncommittee did not intend that this requirement unduly restrict use of \nthe other transactions instrument. DARPA has properly interpreted \nCongress' intent that if the goal of a research project is to leverage \nthe capabilities of firms who will not accept a standard grant, \ncontract or cooperative agreement to conduct defense research, then it \nis not feasible or appropriate to use such instruments and the use of \nother transactions authority is warranted. The committee intended that \nprogram managers in DARPA and the services be given the discretion to \nmake these judgments within a framework provided by overall defense \nguidance. The committee urged that these issues be clarified by the \nOffice of the Secretary of Defense as soon as possible so that the \nservices can gain the benefits which the GAO report demonstrates DARPA \nhas received from use of other transactions.\n\n  Mr. President, since the committee's markup, Dr. Kaminski, the Under \nSecretary for Acquisition and Technology, has provided additional \ninformation to the committee about the changes which the Pentagon would \nlike to see in the other transactions authority in order to spur its \nuse by the military services. I ask unanimous consent that has written \nresponse to a question posed at our March hearing be printed at the end \nof my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Our amendment makes the changes requested by Dr. \nKaminski with one exception. We have preserved an annual report on the \nuse of other transactions authority, but we have changed the entire \ntone of that reporting requirement. The reporting requirement in our \namendment would essentially ask DOD to continue to update the GAO \nreport on an annual basis so that we can judge how the services are \ndoing in making use of this flexible authority to leverage the \ncommercial sector to meet DOD's needs for dual-use technologies.\n  Mr. President, I believe that it is important to give the Pentagon \nthe authorities it needs to make the best use of its limited R \nresources. One of the great achievements of the past two Congresses and \nSecretary Perry's Pentagon is that we have really changed the \nPentagon's acquisition system for the better. We have done this on a \nbipartisan basis, and I am glad to continue to work with the Chairman \nof the Acquisition and Technology Subcommittee, Senator Smith, to bring \nabout needed reforms in that system. Our amendment is a modest step in \nhelping the Pentagon to leverage the private sector's $100 billion \nannual R investment and to broaden the industrial base that supports \nthe Pentagon to include truly commercial firms. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n\n[[Page S6495]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n   Excerpt From Senate Committee on Armed Services, Subcommittee on \n  Acquisition and Technology Hearing on DOD Technology Base Programs, \n                       Wednesday, March 20, 1996\n\n\n            flexible instruments for science and technology\n\n       First, I would like to mention that we are taking actions \n     to encourage increased use of flexible instruments, which \n     include cooperative agreements and ``transactions other than \n     contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements'' (commonly \n     known as ``other transactions'' or OTs). Cooperative \n     agreements, like OTs, can have provisions designed to involve \n     commercial organizations that haven't traditionally received \n     Government awards, thereby helping to increase DoD access to \n     the portion of the U.S. technology and industrial base that \n     serves the needs of the commercial marketplace. Both \n     cooperative agreements and OTs therefore can be responsive to \n     the policy intent of 10 U.S.C. 2371. To encourage increased \n     use of flexible instruments, we are:\n       Preparing to advise the Military Departments that the \n     authority to use OTs should be delegated to at least the \n     level of the major commands that have responsibility for \n     making awards under DoD Science and Technology programs. In \n     conjunction with that action, I have asked the Director of \n     Defense Research and Engineering to issue updated guidance on \n     when it is appropriate to use flexible instruments. Feedback \n     that we've received indicates that improved guidance will \n     help to increase comfort levels with the use of the \n     instruments.\n       Seeking to remove factors that may unnecessarily discourage \n     potential users of the instruments from using them. For \n     example, there is a requirement to report to Congress each \n     OT, as well as any cooperative agreement that uses the funds-\n     recovery authority in 10 U.S.C. 2371. It was suggested that \n     this reporting requirement is a potential disincentive to use \n     the instruments. Therefore, section 805 of the \n     Administration-proposed, national defense authorization bill \n     would repeal the requirement, and I ask that you give the \n     proposal favorable consideration.\n       It should be noted that use of flexible instruments already \n     is increasing. In Fiscal Year 1994, the first year in which \n     they used the instruments, the Military Departments entered \n     into 19 cooperative agreements with provisions designed to \n     involve commercial firms that hadn't traditionally received \n     Government awards. The number of those flexible agreements \n     increased to 41 in Fiscal Year 1995. With that experience as \n     a foundation, I think that we can expect a continued increase \n     in the use of such instruments in the future, because I \n     don't believe that we've exhausted the areas of \n     opportunity for flexible instruments to help us meet our \n     objectives.\n       Second, I want to provide an answer to the question about \n     the provision in 10 U.S.C. 2371 that requires a judgment \n     before using an ``other transaction,'' that standard grants, \n     cooperative agreements, and contracts are not feasible or \n     appropriate. 10 U.S.C. 2371 is a very powerful authority, but \n     it should not be totally open-ended. Creative people in the \n     DoD will continue to use the authority to invent different \n     and improved types of agreements; we can't predict today what \n     those innovations might be. In the context, this provision \n     helps to provide assurance that the powerful authority will \n     continue to be used in a disciplined manner.\n       However, there are some indications that the provision may \n     be impeding use of OTs, in situations where they are \n     appropriate. The problem appears to be that some people have \n     the impression that the provision sets a standard so high \n     that it is almost unattainable. I think that one could revise \n     the provision slightly to change its tone in a way that \n     alleviates this problem, while retaining the benefits the \n     clause provides. The provision currently says that the \n     Secretary of Defense shall ensure that an OT is used for a \n     research project only when the use of a standard contract, \n     grant, or cooperative agreement for such project is not \n     feasible or appropriate. With minor restructuring of the \n     subsection that contains the provision, one could restate the \n     condition without the severe term ``only.'' I think that \n     would require thoughtful analysis before using an OT, but \n     remove the impression of an unattainable standard. Paragraph \n     (e) of 10 U.S.C. 2371 then would read as follows:\n       ``(e) Conditions.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall \n     ensure that--\n       ``(A) to the maximum extent practicable, no cooperative \n     agreement containing a clause under subsection (d) and no \n     transaction entered into under subsection (a) provides for \n     research that duplicates research being conducted under \n     existing programs carried out by the Department of Defense; \n     and\n       ``(B) to the extent that the Secretary determines \n     practicable, the funds provided by the Government under a \n     cooperative agreement containing a clause under subsection \n     (d) or a transaction entered into under subsection (a) do not \n     exceed the total amount provided by other parties to the \n     cooperative agreement or other transaction.\n       ``(2) A cooperative agreement containing a clause under \n     subsection (d) or a transaction entered into under subsection \n     (a) may be used for a research project when the use of a \n     standard contract, grant, or cooperative agreement for such \n     project is not feasible or appropriate.''\n       Third, I'd like to respond to your suggestion that Congress \n     might amend section 2371 of title 10 of the U.S. Code, to \n     clarify that the intent was to exempt agreements under that \n     authority from the Bayh-Dole requirements (chapter 18 of 35 \n     U.S.C.). There is no need to amend the law; the Bayh-Dole \n     statutory requirements, by the terms of the statute, do not \n     include OTs.\n       Finally, I would like to mention one point about the need \n     for maintaining good stewardship. The development and use of \n     flexible instruments to involve firms that have not \n     traditionally performed research for the Government has \n     tremendous potential benefits, but it is not without risk. \n     the goal is to find the right tradeoff or balance--one must \n     develop approaches with sufficient oversight to ensure the \n     appropriate use of federal funds but without excessively \n     intrusive requirements that drive commercial firms away and \n     deny DoD access to some of the best and most affordable \n     technology. That is both the opportunity and the challenge.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared on \nthis side. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the agreement is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4074) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4075\n\n(Purpose: To make reimbursement of Government contractors for costs of \nexcessive amounts of compensation for contractor personnel unallowable \n                      under Government contracts)\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Grassley, Boxer \nand Harkin, I offer an amendment which would place a limitation of \n$200,000 on the amount of annual individual compensation that may be \nreimbursable under contracts with the Department of Defense.\n  I believe this amendment has been cleared with the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne], for Mr. Grassley, \n     for himself, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Harkin, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4075.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page   , between lines    and   , insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor this amendment \nwith my friend from California, Senator Boxer.\n  Over the years, she has helped me watchdog the Pentagon.\n  That is not an easy thing to do.\n  Whether Republicans or Democrats are running the place, it's always \ntough to tangle with the Pentagon.\n  It is an unpopular thing to do.\n  She has always been a reliable defense reform ally.\n  In today's political environment, dependable defense reform allies \nare hard to come by.\n  They may be an endangered species.\n  So I am happy to team up with her on this measure.\n  It is another effort to chip away at the Pentagon culture.\n\n[[Page S6496]]\n\n  This is a culture that is literally blind to waste.\n  It tolerates waste and sometimes even encourages waste.\n  What we want to do is change that culture.\n  In trying to change that culture, we hope to strengthen our military \ncapabilities.\n  When we add $12 billion for defense--like in this bill, we want to \nmake sure we buy more capability.\n  We want to make sure that we are not buying more waste and more cost.\n  Our amendment would place a permanent cap on individual executive \ncompensation allowable under Government contracts.\n  It would set the cap at $200,000 per year.\n  The cap would apply to salaries, bonuses, and other incentives.\n  It would be a permanent cap.\n  There is a temporary, short-term cap in effect today.\n  The temporary, short-term cap was imposed by the DOD Appropriations \nAct for fiscal year 1996.\n  It applies only to fiscal year 1996 contracts.\n  I will discuss the existing cap in greater detail later in the \ndebate.\n   Mr. President, I would like to make one point crystal clear right \noff the bat.\n  This is not an attempt to tell private companies how much they should \npay their top executives.\n  Instead, it would restrict what Government bureaucrats are allowed to \npay top executives in industry.\n   Mr. President, executive salaries in private industry should be \ndetermined in the marketplace.\n  And not by a bunch of bureaucrats in the Pentagon.\n  But that is what is going on.\n  Right now, bureaucrats decide what is fair and reasonable and pay it.\n  Our amendment would put a lid on Government payments only.\n  I underscore Government payments only.\n  That is the driving force behind this measure.\n  The Grassley-Boxer amendment would not limit the amount of money a \ndefense contractor could pay its executives.\n  If, for example, a defense company wants to pay one of its top \nexecutives working on military contracts $6,332,000.00 a year--as one \ndid, then so be it.\n  Under Grassley-Boxer, the company could continue to do it--no \nquestions asked.\n   Mr. President, Loral Corporation's top executive, Mr. Bernard L. \nSchwartz, received a pay and bonus package in 1995 that totaled \n$6,332,000.00\n  But that's not the whole enchilada.\n  Mr. Schwartz will also receive a $36 million bonus for agreeing to \nsell his company's defense business. The buyer is the Lockheed Martin \nCorp.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to place a recent newspaper \narticle about Mr. Schwartz's pay in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 16, 1996]\n\n    Loral Chairman to Give $18 Million of Merger Fee to 40 Employees\n\n                            (By John Mintz)\n\n       Loral Corp. Chairman Bernard L. Schwartz will receive a $36 \n     million bonus for agreeing to sell his company's defense \n     business to Lockheed Martin Corp., but will give $18 million \n     of it to a group of Loral employees, according to documents \n     filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n       The money Schwartz is giving up will reward 40 people in \n     Loral's Manhattan headquarters who may lose their jobs or be \n     demoted in the merger, according to the documents. The \n     employees, including some secretaries and mid-level \n     executives, could receive money equivalent to as much as \n     twice their annual salary and bonus.\n       Loral's New York headquarters likely will close and be \n     folded into Lockheed Martin's Bethesda offices, industry \n     officials said.\n       ``Their lives could be affected by the merger, and I \n     decided it would be appropriate to recognize their efforts,'' \n     Schwartz said yesterday. ``There are some smiling faces here \n     today. . . . If I'd had enough resources, I would have spread \n     it among all 38,000 Loral employees.''\n       Giving such a gift to employees is extremely rare in \n     mergers, investment bankers said. Schwartz, the only liberal \n     Democrat among chief executives of large defense firms, has \n     often expounded on his views of corporate empowerment, and \n     for years has offered generous stock options to Loral \n     employees to make them what he calls ``stakeholders'' in his \n     company.\n       The $18 million bonus Schwartz will collect from Loral is \n     in addition to approximately $27 million he has made on paper \n     in the value of his Loral stock due to the proposed merger. \n     He owns about 3.6 million shares, and each has increased in \n     value by approximately $7.50 following the announcement last \n     week.\n       Schwartz's regular annual compensation and bonus from the \n     company in 1995 totaled $6,332,000.\n       The proposed merger with Lockheed Martin was announced last \n     week. If Loral pulls out of the transaction, it must pay \n     Lockheed Martin a termination fee of $175 million, according \n     to the SEC filings.\n       Meanwhile, the Pentagon has largely sided with Lockheed \n     Martin and against a group of critics in a bitter controversy \n     involving a previous merger that created Lockheed Martin from \n     Lockheed Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp. in March last year.\n       In a report, a Defense Department accounting office called \n     the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) did not support \n     allegations by Rep. Bernard Sanders (I-VT.), some \n     congressional colleagues and the newspaper Newsday that \n     Lockheed Martin was improperly seeking a Pentagon payment of \n     $31 million in connection with the merger. The critics called \n     it a taxpayer rip-off.\n       The DCAA recommendations, which still must be reviewed by \n     the Pentagon, were first reported in the industry publication \n     Defense Week.\n       The company has asserted for months that its foes are \n     confusing two sums of money. One is a $61 million payment to \n     460 former Martin Marietta executives because of the merger. \n     The military won't reimburse firms for such payments, and \n     Locheed Martin is not asking for that.\n       But the firm is asking the military to reimburse it $31 \n     million that it has already paid those 460 executives. These \n     sums had nothing to do with the merger, the company has said.\n       The military pays contracts on a ``cost-plus'' basis, \n     meaning the companies tell the Pentagon about their expenses, \n     including overhead, cost of labor and materials, and \n     executive compensation. The military decides which requests \n     are ``reasonable,'' computes the profit and pays the \n     appropriate amounts.\n       The company has said the $31 million was part of its long-\n     standing executive compensation package and not, as Sanders \n     asserted, a cozy Pentagon pay-off to high-ranking executives \n     for arranging the merger.\n       Now the Pentagon's DCAA has concluded that $16 million of \n     the firm's $31 million in reimbursement requests was proper, \n     has deferred consideration on $9 million and raised questions \n     about $6 million of the requested amount. The questions, \n     however, focused on complex government accounting issues and \n     did not directly track with Sanders' objections.\n       Congressional offices were closed for the holiday. Calls to \n     Sanders' office seeking comment were not answered.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, that is a big bundle of money going to \nMr. Schwartz.\n  But I am not questioning whether he earned or deserved it.\n  Under Grassley-Boxer, he would get it.\n  I owe it to my colleague to point out that Mr. Schwartz is at the \nhigh end of the defense executive wage scale.\n  The others' salary and bonus packages are not quite so generous.\n  They ranged from about $1 million up to $2,500,000 in 1995.\n  Some are slightly lower.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to place the latest data on \ndefense executive compensation in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Reasonableness Test for Executive Compensation\n\n       Made in accordance with FAR 31-205-6, compensation for \n     personal services.\n       Considers same relevant factors, i.e., We check for \n     conformity with firms of: same size/industry/geographic area \n     and gov't/non-gov't business.\n       Includes all remuneration paid although elements also \n     individually assessed.\n       In sync with fact that FAR places burden of proof on \n     company (i.e., upon challenge, company must demonstrate \n     reasonableness).\n       On balance, experience has shown process to be generally \n     fair/not arbitrary.\n\n\n               basic audit steps for reasonableness test\n\n       1.

Mr. President, Grassley-Boxer would not restructure or \nreinvent the defense executive wage scale.\n  This is what Grassley-Boxer would do: it would change the way the \nmoney is dished out.\n  It would come out of a different pocket.\n  Instead of coming right off the top of a defense contract, most of it \nwould have to be taken out of profits.\n  Instead of being taken directly out of the pockets of hard-working \nAmerican taxpayers, most of the money would come from the company's \nearnings.\n  The source of the money would change.\n  Under Grassley-Boxer, most of Mr. Schwartz's pay, for example, would \nhave to be taken out of profits.\n  In Mr. Schwartz's case, $6,132,000 would come out of profits.\n  The balance, $200,000, could be charged to Uncle Sam.\n  Mr. President, Pentagon bureaucrats should not be put in the position \nof having to decide how much to pay industry executives.\n  The Government should get out of that business entirely.\n  Those decisions should be made in the marketplace.\n  This amendment will start us down the road in the right direction.\n  With a cap in place, we can reexamine the issue next year and decide \nhow to proceed.\n  Mr. President, I feel sure that some of my Republican colleagues will \nhowl about this amendment.\n  They will complain that Grassley-Boxer will eat into corporate \nprofits and slash corporate benefits.\n  We will undermine initiative and morale.\n  In response, I say to my colleagues: Our defense industry is health.\n  That is what the latest report on corporate earnings shows.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to place a report on corporate \nprofits in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n

Poor's Compustat, a division of the McGraw-Hill      \n  Companies.                                                            \n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. This report appears in the March 4, 1996 issue of \nBusiness Week.\n  Profits are reported as follows: Boeing: $393 million; General \nElectric: $6.6 billion; General Dynamics $247 million; Lockheed Martin: \n$682 million; Northrop Grumman: $252 million, and United Technologies: \n$750 million.\n  They are doing OK, and that's good.\n  In my mind, executive pay should be tied directly to company \nperformance and to profits.\n  If the company had a great year, earned big profits and enjoyed other \nsuccesses, then the chief executive should enjoy the fruits of his \nlabor.\n  A big year should equal a big pay check.\n  A bad year might mean a pay cut.\n  The profit figures cited above are for calendar year 1995.\n  During that period, only McDonnell Douglas suffered a loss.\n  The company took a loss of $416 million. But guess what?\n  That loss did not keep the company's top executive from drawing a \nbigger paycheck.\n  The top boss' base pay went from $1.6 million in 1994 to $1.9 million \nin 1995, including a bonus of $1,042,400.\n  But that is not all.\n  McDonnell Douglas' chief executive, Mr. Harry C. Stonecipher, \nreceived a very generous share of company stock.\n  Mr. Stonecipher got cash and stock valued at a staggering $34 \nmillion--in 1995 alone.\n  The other top executives at McDonnell Douglas also received handsome \nbonuses. These generous pay packages came at a time when the company \nwas downsizing in the face of declining sales.\n  Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na report on Mr. Stonecipher's pay package from the Journal of Commerce.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Journal of Commerce, Mar. 24, 1995]\n\n     McDonnell Chief's Compensation Takes On Superstar Proportions\n\n       St. Louis.--The compensation package McDonnell Douglas \n     Corp. assembled to attract Harry C. Stonecipher, chief \n     executive, last year was worthy of basketball's Michael \n     Jordan.\n       McDonnell's nearly seven-year deal with Mr. Stonecipher, \n     the first non-family member to run the company, could bring \n     him more than $34 million in cash and stock.\n       ``We paid the market rate for a person of his caliber,'' \n     said James Reed, vice president for communications. ``We're \n     very convinced of that, and the board of directors is very \n     convinced of that.''\n       The Chicago Bulls also paid the market rate when they \n     signed Jordan, the National Basketball Association's top \n     player, to an eight-year, $28 million deal in April of 1988.\n       Although the $825,000 base salary and $575,000 annual bonus \n     target McDonnell set for Mr. Stonecipher are unremarkable for \n     a Fortune 500 company, the stock incentives McDonnell offered \n     are notable.\n       The aerospace giant used the promise of what is now $17.7 \n     million in stock profits to persuade Mr. Stonecipher to leave \n     his job as chairman and chief executive of Sundstrand Corp.\n       McDonnell awarded Mr. Stonecipher 180,000 shares of \n     restricted stock, with a current market value of $10.1 \n     million. The first 42,000 of those shares vest next Friday; \n     the rest vest in 1996, 1997 and 2002.\n       McDonnell also gave Mr. Stonecipher the option to buy \n     450,000 shares later in the decade for $36.96 each, the \n     market price when he joined the company on Sept. 24.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Now, why would the big boss at McDonnell Douglas get a \nhuge bonus when the company sustained a $416 million loss?\n  Could it be because the company has a direct tap on the DOD money \npipe?\n  When Uncle Sugar is picking up the tab, you can afford to give big \npay raises--even when you are losing money.\n  In private business, it is not supposed to work that way.\n  I would like to clarify one point as we proceed with the debate:\n  These defense companies are not totally dependent on the Pentagon; \nmost do 50 to 70 percent of their business with the Government the \nPentagon primarily; they are really semi-private.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe top 10 defense contractors.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6498]]\n\n\n\n LIST OF TOP 10 CONTRACTORS IN 1993 WITH AT LEAST ONE-THIRD DOD BUSINESS\n                          [Dollars in billions]

This information is drawn from a recent GAO report \nentitled ``Defense Contractors: Pay, Benefits, and Restructuring During \nDefense Downsizing.''\n  Mr. President, the Government should not be in the business of \ndeciding how much to pay corporate executives in the defense industry.\n  Grassley-Boxer will not get the Government out of that business \nentirely, but it is a step in the right direction.\n  Mr. President, earlier in the debate, I said that we need to get \nGovernment bureaucrats out of the business of deciding how much to pay \ndefense executives.\n  Grassley-Boxer wouldn't get us out of that business entirely, but it \nwould be a step in the right direction.\n  Grassley-Boxer would put a governor on executive pay flowing through \nthe DOD money pipe.\n  The Grassley-Boxer amendment would limit the size of executive \nsalaries that could be charged directly to the Government under a \nspecific contract.\n  Under existing rules, the sky is the limit.\n  For the bills coming due today, DOD pay what is fair and reasonable.\n  Reasonableness is defined in Federal regulation, FAR 31-205-6.\n  The rule is broad and general, as I suspected.\n  It gives the bureaucrats wide latitude for maneuver.\n  The guidance on how to make the determination is spelled out in \ndefense contract audit agency [DCAA] documents.\n  DCAA bureaucrats make the final decision.\n  The main guide is a market consensus survey to see what everybody \nelse is getting paid.\n  Above all, the DCAA documents say: ``Be fair--not arbitrary.''\n  At the Pentagon, being fair and reasonable usually means the \ntaxpayers get shafted.\n  Pentagon bureaucrats like to bend over backward to keep the defense \ncontractors happy.\n  And shoveling money at corporate executives is a great way to do it.\n  The Pentagon has proven over and over again that it is incapable of \nkeeping lid on executive pay dished out on contracts.\n  The pay package coming out of the recent Martin Marietta-Lockeed \nmerger is a prime example of what I'm talking about.\n  Some 460 executives and directors are slated to receive a total of \n$92.2 million: $8.2 million in cash and stock options is supposed to go \nto Mr. Norman Augustine, chairman of the Martin Marietta Corp. before \nthe merger.\n  Now this very generous plan is in the process of being blessed by the \nPentagon bureaucrats.\n\n[[Page S6499]]\n\n  The deal isn't final, yet.\n  Since this pay package is based on longstanding contractual \ncommitments, some dating back to the early 1980's, United Same has to \npay.\n  The old rules apply.\n  The sky is the limit.\n  This is what the DCAA bureaucrats have to do to make it happen.\n  They take the salary of each corporate executive and break it down \ninto many parts and spread it around on thousands of contracts.\n  They use a mathematical formula to determine how much to put on each \ncontract.\n  Mr. President, this is what we must not forget. This is the key \npoint:\n  There is no ceiling on what DOD can pay the Lockheed-Martin \nexecutives.\n  But from what I am hearing, industry's demand for money is being \nscaled back, somewhat.\n  But exactly how much will each executive get under the merger deal?\n  I don't think the Pentagon wants us to kown how much the taxpayers \nare paying Mr. Augustine.\n  They don't want us to know how much is about to be taken out of the \npockets of hard-working American taxpayers to bankroll these outrageous \npayments.\n  These top industry executives are on the Government payroll, and we \ncan't even find out how much they make.\n  DCAA says that's sensitive proprietary information.\n  If they are on the public payroll, the people have a right to know \nhow much each one gets.\n  Over a year ago, Senator Boxer and I asked the DOD Inspector General, \nMs. Eleanor Hill, for this information.\n  That was on April 28, 1995.\n  We received her response on May 26, 1995.\n  But it was unsatisfactory, and we went back to her on June 20 for \nmore specific answers to our questions.\n  When no satisfactory response was given, the request was renewed \nagain on February 16, 1996.\n  On June 17, 1996, she finally provided a partial answer to the \nquestion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to place our correspondence \nwith the DOD IG in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 28, 1995.\n     Ms. Eleanor Hill,\n     Inspector General, Department of Defense, Army Navy Drive, \n         Arlington, VA.\n       Dear Ms. Hill: We are writing to ask you to examine the \n     merger of the Lockheed and Martin Marietta Corporations and \n     to determine its cost to the taxpayers.\n       We think this merger needs scrutiny by your office.\n       The ``payout benefit plan'' being given to executives and \n     managers at Martin is truly beyond comprehension for most \n     ordinary American citizens. Martin Marietta Chairman Norman \n     Augustine, for example, will receive $8.2 million in cash and \n     stock options as a result of the merger. Other top executives \n     are set to receive huge sums. A total of $92.2 million will \n     be dished out to about 460 managers and executives under \n     various plans. We understand that some of this money will be \n     taken out of the pockets of hard working American taxpayers.\n       Since mid-1992, there have been at least nine or ten major \n     mergers or acquisitions in the U.S. defense industry. Under \n     current policy, the amounts charged to current or future \n     defense contracts to cover the ``restructuring'' or merger \n     costs could be building up to unacceptable levels. What are \n     the government's total potential liabilities from all recent \n     mergers? What is the rationale for giving defense companies \n     tax money to cover the costs of their mergers? To us, mergers \n     mean less competition, and less competition usually means \n     higher prices.\n       Furthermore, we understand that there is a lack of clear \n     guidance in regulation and law governing mergers as to what \n     is allowable and what is not allowable. This situation could \n     leave the door wide open for waste, abuse and excessive cash \n     payments to industry executives.\n       In line with our more general concerns, we have eleven more \n     specific questions on the Martin/Lockheed merger:\n       Is there any evidence--based on recent experience--to \n     suggest that the merger will generate real savings to the \n     taxpayers?\n       If so, what are the total expected savings to the taxpayers \n     from the merger?\n       What is the total projected cost of the merger to the \n     taxpayers, including potential reimbursements for closing \n     unneeded facilities?\n       How exactly would tax dollars be used to compensate the two \n     firms for the cost of the merger?\n       To what extent are tax dollars being used to support the \n     executive compensation plan resulting from the merger--\n     particularly the one contained in a joint proxy statement for \n     the meeting held on March 15, 1995?\n       If tax money is used to finance the executive ``payout'' \n     operation, please provide the name of each person receiving \n     tax money and the total amount each person is to receive.\n       What is the legal basis for using tax money to make such \n     payments?\n       Will projected costs and savings be subjected to adequate \n     audit verification?\n       Does the merger plan comply with Section 818 of Public Law \n     103-337 and Section 8117 of Public Law 103-335?\n       Does the April 15, 1995 deadline specified in Section 8117 \n     mean that the Martin/Lockheed merger is not covered by this \n     provision?\n       Have anti-trust issues been adequately addressed?\n       Ms. Hill, as far as we are concerned, the salaries paid to \n     top executives in industry should be determined in the market \n     place--not by some obscure act of Congress. But if money is \n     taken out of the pockets of hard working American taxpayers \n     to pay defense industry executive outrageous and unreasonable \n     salaries and bonuses, then we feel like we have an obligation \n     to ask questions.\n       We look forward to your independent assessment of the \n     facts.\n       Your continued support is always appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles E. Grassley.\n     Barbara Boxer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                Inspector General,\n\n\n                                        Department of Defense,\n\n                                      Arlington, VA, May 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: This is in reply to a letter of \n     April 28, 1995, signed jointly by you and Senator Barbara \n     Boxer, that requested our assessment of the facts surrounding \n     the merger of the Lockheed and Martin Marietta Corporations. \n     Our response to each of your concerns and questions is \n     presented in the enclosure.\n       Under Section 818, Public Law 337, and implementing \n     regulations, restructuring costs associated with a business \n     combination of defense contractors may not be paid, absent a \n     review of projected costs and savings resulting for the \n     Department from that business combination. We understand that \n     Lockheed Martin Corporation plans to submit a proposal \n     containing such information by late June 1995. That proposal \n     will be audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the \n     results assessed by the Defense Contract Management Command \n     to determine the amount of restructuring costs that properly \n     may be reimbursed by the Government. In the interim, those \n     agencies will review the companies' requests for payments to \n     assure that the Government is not being improperly billed.\n       Because the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the General \n     Accounting Officer will be examining the costs associated \n     with the business combination, we do not plan to initiate a \n     review of the matter. We will, however, closely monitor the \n     audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency and actions by the \n     Defense Contract Management Command. Let me assure you that I \n     share your concern that the Lockheed and Martin Marietta \n     business combination not result in the payment of unallowable \n     or excessive costs by the Government.\n       A similar reply is being provided to Senator Boxer. If we \n     may be of further assistance, please contact me or Mr. John \n     R. Crane, Office of Congressional Liaison, at 604-8324.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Eleanor Hill,\n     Inspector General.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\nResponse to Comments and Questions Regarding the Merger of Lockheed and \n                      Martin Marietta Corportions\n\n       General Comments: A total of $92.2 million will be dished \n     out to about 460 managers and executives under various plans.\n       Of the $92.2 million, the Lockheed Martin Corporation \n     believes that $31 million are allowable costs that can be \n     charged to Government contracts. The Defense Contract Audit \n     Agency is currently auditing the $31 million. The audit is \n     scheduled to be completed by June 30, 1995.\n       What are the Government's total potential liabilities from \n     all recent mergers?\n       The Department of Defense (DoD) may pay allowable and \n     allocable restructuring costs resulting from a business \n     combination provided under that audited proposals indicate \n     that overall savings to the Government will result. As only a \n     few contractors have presented restructuring proposals, the \n     total potential costs and overall savings to the Government \n     cannot be predicted at this time.\n       What is the rationale for giving defense companies tax \n     money to cover the costs of their mergers? To us, merger \n     means less competition, and less competition means higher \n     prices.\n       The DoD may pay restructuring costs, i.e., the cost to \n     streamline operations, including the elimination of unneeded \n     or redundant facilities and reductions in the work force \n     subsequent to a merger or acquisition, provided they are \n     offset by related savings. We share your concern, however, \n     that competition is being reduced and may lead to higher \n     prices.\n       We understand that there is a lack of clear guidelines in \n     regulation and law governing mergers as to what is allowable \n     and what is not allowable.\n\n[[Page S6500]]\n\n       Clearly, those costs, such as reorganization costs, that \n     were previously unallowable are still not allowable. A July \n     1993 policy memorandum on restructuring costs by the Under \n     Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology \n     specifically makes that point. What is unclear is the law and \n     regulations addressing the allowability of restructuring \n     costs that result in increased costs on contracts novated \n     from the selling company to the buyer.\n       Under the provisions in the present Federal Acquisition \n     Regulation (FAR), the DoD is under no obligation to pay \n     increased costs of novated contracts even if they are offset \n     by decreases. The July 1993 memorandum was intended to \n     clarify that DoD contracting officers have the latitude to \n     recognize cost increases on novated contracts due to \n     restructuring provided they are offset with related \n     savings.\n       The problem we see is that the Congress initially believed \n     that restructuring costs actually represented merger and \n     acquisition costs. Section 818 of Public Law 103-337, \n     therefore, addresses restructuring costs in general rather \n     than those situations specifically related to increased costs \n     on novated contracts.\n       Restructuring costs are generally allowable since \n     contractors must have the ability to change and improve their \n     operations. However, the interim regulations written by the \n     DoD in response to the broad requirements of Section 818, \n     require contractors to demonstrate that all restructuring \n     costs, whether related to a merger or acquisition or not, are \n     offset by savings. It is possible that the law and new \n     regulations will make previously allowable costs unallowable. \n     The net effect is that few contractors have come forward with \n     restructuring proposals. We believe, therefore, that the law \n     and the DoD interim regulations should be clarified to \n     address restructuring related to novated contracts only.\n       Specific Concerns: Is there any evidence--based on recent \n     experience--to suggest that the merge will generate real \n     savings to the taxpayers?\n       Yes. In those very few cases where companies involved in \n     business combination have submitted restructuring proposals, \n     cost reductions are forecast. However, we cannot predict \n     whether anticipated savings are offset by diminished \n     competition.\n       If so, what are the total expected savings to the taxpayer \n     from the merger?\n       The company has not submitted a proposal of forecasted \n     savings.\n       What is the total projected cost of the merger to the \n     taxpayer, including potential reimbursements for closing \n     unneeded facilities?\n       Again, that information is not yet available because the \n     company has not submitted a proposal of forecasted savings.\n       How exactly would tax dollars be used to compensate the two \n     firms for the cost of the merger?\n       As previously stated, the costs of the merger are not \n     compensated. Restructuring costs are reimbursed once the \n     contractor satisfactorily demonstrates to the Contracting \n     Officer at the Defense Contract Management Command and \n     auditor at the Defense Contract Audit Agency that there \n     will be overall savings to the Government. An advance \n     agreement will then be executed specifying the type and \n     limits for restructuring costs that can be charged to \n     contracts each year. That agreement is forwarded to a \n     senior DoD official who certifies that savings will be \n     achieved. The costs are then allocated among all the \n     contractor's business and the Government pays its share.\n       To what extent are tax dollars being used to support the \n     executive compensation plan resulting from the merger \n     particularly the one contained in a joint proxy statement for \n     the meeting held on March 15, 1995?\n       Tax money, in the form of contract payments, will be used \n     to pay some of the executive compensation costs. The Lockheed \n     Martin Corporation has indicated that the costs will be \n     claimed on its Government contracts based on its past \n     practices and would not exceed the amount DoD would have paid \n     had the merger not occurred. Each of the elements of \n     compensation included in the proxy statement resulting from \n     the merger are being reviewed by the Defense Contract Audit \n     Agency to determine the reasonableness of the compensation \n     paid and to ensure the long-term compensation plans are in \n     accordance with the procurement regulations. The DoD and \n     other Federal agencies pay the allowable portion of executive \n     compensation based on their share of the contractor's \n     business.\n       If tax money is used to finance the executive ``payout'' \n     operation, please provide the name of each person receiving \n     tax money and the amount each person is to receive.\n       Although the proxy statement does identify some individuals \n     and amounts paid, it does not identify the amount that will \n     be claimed on Government contracts. We will not know all the \n     names of the people receiving the money or the final amount \n     being claimed on Government contracts until the audit by the \n     Defense Contract Audit Agency is complete. The audit is \n     scheduled to be completed by June 30, 1995.\n       What is the legal basis for using tax money to make such \n     payments?\n       The FAR provides for a fair share of contractor costs, \n     including executive compensation, to be charged to Government \n     contracts. The regulation prohibits paying costs such as \n     ``golden parachutes.'' The audit by the Defense Contract \n     Audit Agency will determine if the amounts claimed by the \n     Lockheed Martin Corporation are allowable.\n       Will projected costs and savings be subjected to adequate \n     audit verification?\n       The Public Law and procurement regulations require audit \n     verification by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. We plan to \n     monitor the audit.\n       Does the merger plan comply with Section 818 of Public Law \n     103-337 and Section 8117 of Public Law 103-335?\n       We will not know whether the plan complies with either law \n     until the restructuring proposal is submitted and examined by \n     the contracting officer and auditor.\n       Does the April 15, 1995 deadline specified in Section 8117 \n     mean that the Martin/Lockheed merger is not covered by this \n     provision?\n       The April 15, 1995 deadline applies to payments from funds \n     appropriated in fiscal year 1995 for contracts awarded after \n     April 15, 1995. Section 8117 will limit, to some extent, the \n     DoD reimbursement to the Lockheed Martin Corporation after \n     April 15, 1995. The audit by the Defense Contract Audit \n     Agency will evaluate the compensation costs proposed to be \n     claimed after April 15, 1995, to determine compliance with \n     the public law.\n       Have anti-trust issues been adequately addressed?\n       Compliance with antitrust laws is the responsibility of the \n     Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. We \n     are not aware of any problems in that area.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                Inspector General,\n\n\n                                        Department of Defense,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, June 14, 1996.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: This is in further response to a \n     letter of April 28, 1995, signed jointly by you and Senator \n     Barbara Boxer that requested information regarding long-term \n     incentive compensation payouts to Martin Marietta executives. \n     These payouts have been claimed for government reimbursement \n     by Lockheed Martin Corporation as a result of the merger of \n     Lockheed and Martin Marietta Corporations.\n       Enclosed are aggregate totals of the long-term incentive \n     compensation for four categories of Lockheed Martin \n     executives that are allocable to Government contracts through \n     indirect expense pools, excluding commercial and foreign \n     military sales. It should be noted the long-term incentive \n     compensation was earned over a period of years and paid in \n     1995 after the merger. The categories of former Martin \n     Marietta executives include the top five executives, other \n     top executives, all other executives and the outside Board of \n     Directors.\n       The Lockheed Martin Corporation has agreed, on an exception \n     basis, to a release of the aggregate totals without a company \n     proprietary stamp. Lockheed Martin Corporation considers \n     individual names and associated financial information to be \n     confidential proprietary and management sensitive data and \n     has not made an exception as to that information.\n       We agree that such information is proprietary and is exempt \n     from release under the Freedom of Information Act, Sections \n     552(b)(4) and 552(b)(6), Title 5, United States Code. It has \n     been designated ``For Official Use Only'' (FOUO), and can be \n     released pursuant to a request from a chairman of a committee \n     or subcommittee with jurisdiction over the subject matter.\n       We hope that the above information is helpful to you.

Martin Marietta's top executives are getting paid \n$16,272,000 under the deal.\n  This isn't salary. It's a retirement package for the senior \nexecutives.\n  Some call it a ``golden parachute.''\n  By any definition, it's a very generous deal.\n  DOD pays the top five executives, including Mr. Augustine, \n$3,552,909.\n  Now, this isn't Mr. Augustine's salary, for example.\n  These are just retirement benefits.\n  He gets a lot more, but it comes out of another DOD pool of money.\n  How many pools of money does DOD have for corporate pay.\n  Mr. President, this tells me we need a cap.\n\n[[Page S6501]]\n\n  I am told that when the idea of a cap was first debated over in the \nPentagon, a DCAA bureaucrat made this suggestion:\n  Why not set the cap at $1 million?\n  Mr. President, the Pentagon's weak-kneed attitude on executive pays \ntells me that a cap is mandatory.\n  On March 5, 1996, the DOD inspector general, Ms. Eleanor Hill, came \nout in favor of a $250,000 cap.\n  I thank her for doing that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to place her letter of \nrecommendation in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                Inspector General,\n\n\n                                        Department of Defense,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, March 5, 1996.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Recently, the Department provided its \n     views on S. 1102, ``To amend title 10, United States Code, to \n     make reimbursement of defense contractors for costs of \n     excessive amounts of compensation for contractor personnel \n     unallowable under the Department of Defense contracts''. In \n     response to a request from Senator Grassley's office, we \n     offer our views on the legislation for your consideration.\n       We support a permanent $250,000 cap on allowable individual \n     compensation costs under DoD contracts. This is not a \n     limitation on total compensation but on the costs charged to \n     the Government. Furthermore, we would also support a \n     limitation on all Government contractors. This additional \n     limitation would prevent DoD contractors who also have \n     contracts with other Government agencies from charging this \n     compensation to non-DoD contracts.\n       I hope this information is helpful as the Congress \n     continues consideration of this important issue. If we can be \n     of further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me \n     or Mr. John R. Crane, Office of Congressional Liaison, at \n     (703, 604-8324.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Eleanor Hill,\n                                                Inspector General.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Unfortunately, Senator Boxer and I think $250,000 cap \nis too high.\n  That's what the President of the United States makes in a year.\n  Only one person on the Federal payroll should make that much money.\n  Mr. President, the appropriators seem to agree with our thinking.\n  We can thank the appropriators for their pioneering work in this \narea.\n  In 1944, they established the first ``cap'' on the defense \nappropriations bill.\n  Under Section 8117 of Public Law 103-335, they placed a $250,000 \nsalary ``cap'' on fiscal year 1995 contract payments.\n  Then, just last year, they lowered the cap to $200,000 on fiscal year \n1996 contract payments.\n  That was in Section 8068 of Public Law 104-61--the fiscal year 1996 \ndefense appropriations bill.\n  As I pointed out earlier in the debate, that's not a permanent cap.\n  It's a 1-year cap on fiscal year 1996 defense appropriations.\n  Mr. President, we need a permanent cap on all Government contracts.\n  We shouldn't take money out of the pockets of hard working American \ntaxpayers to bank-roll the big executives in defense industry.\n  We need to get the taxpayers out of the loop.\n  Pay and bonuses for top defense executives should be determined in \nthe marketplace.\n  Executive wages should be determined by successes and failures by \nprofits and losses.\n  And not by a bunch of bureaucrats in the Pentagon.\n  A $200,000 cap is a good first step in the right direction.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, throughout this debate, I have repeatedly stressed one \npoint:\n  We need to get government bureaucrats out of the business of deciding \nhow much to pay industry executives.\n  Mr. President, there is only one place where those kinds of decisions \nshould be made in this country.\n  And that's in the marketplace.\n  Those decisions should be governed by profits and business successes.\n  There is a general consensus for getting the Government out of the \nloop.\n  Government bureaucrats are incapable of deciding what an executive \nshould earn.\n  Mr. President, I have here in my hand an article taken from one of \nthe defense trade journals.\n  This one is from Defense News, June 3-9, 1996, page 14.\n  Now, Defense News is a weekly publication with close ties to defense \nindustry.\n  The article has this title: ``White House Prepares New Rule on \nCompensation for Executives.''\n  The report says the White House procurement czar is about to issue a \nnew regulation on how much executive pay can be charged to defense \ncontracts.\n  ``Industry officials'' are quoted.\n  And industry officials are saying what I am saying.\n  They say that this decision should be made in the marketplace.\n  This is what the reports says, and I quote:\n  ``Industry officials say the free market should determine how much \nthey [defense executives] are paid, and how much the Government \nreimburses them [for salary].''\n  Mr. President, that is exactly what I am saying.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, \nthe article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Defense News, June 3-9, 1996]\n\n      White House Prepares New Rule On Compensation for Executives\n\n                            (By Jeff Erlich)\n\n       Washington.--White House officials will make a decision \n     this month on what portion of defense executives' salaries \n     the government will reimburse.\n       The issue of how much corporate executives are paid has \n     taken on populist overtones as salaries continue to rise \n     while workers are laid off, a senior government official \n     said.\n       ``Some contractors seem to have tunnel vision,'' the \n     official said. ``There is a larger debate in society about \n     executive compensation. This is not just about defense \n     contracting.''\n       Industry officials, however, say the free market should \n     determine how much they are paid, and how much the government \n     reimburses them.\n       ``If you find the right guy, the leverage of his thought \n     process is way beyond the value you would attribute to him as \n     one man,'' Vance Coffman, chief operating officer of Lockheed \n     Martin Corp., Bethesda, Md., said in a May 29 interview.\n       Steve Kelman, White House director of federal procurement \n     policy, is due to issue the pay rule this month. He said May \n     28 that he has not yet made a decision.\n       Kelman will weight options that include a cap on how much \n     the Pentagon can reimburse executives for their salaries.\n       Congress has a $200,000 cap this year, pending the new \n     policy. Or Kelman could eliminate any caps and let the DoD's \n     cost-accounting principles govern levels of reimbursement.\n       He also will address other forms of pay, such as bonuses, \n     deferred salary, stock options and other compensation, often \n     earned during corporate restructuring.\n       These issues came under congressional scrutiny with the \n     merger of Lockheed and Martin Marietta corporations. Lockheed \n     Martin will get $16.5 million from the government in extra \n     compensation resulting from the restructuring.\n       ``During the past eight years, 2.2 million Americans have \n     lost their defense-related jobs. At precisely the same time, \n     the top CEOs among defense contractors have been taking home \n     huge salaries and stock payouts paid in no small part by U.S. \n     taxpayers,'' Reps. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., Bernard Sanders, I-\n     Vt., and Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., wrote May 9 to Defense \n     Secretary William Perry.\n       Bert Concklin, president of the Professional Services \n     Council, a Vienna, Va.-based consultants association, said \n     the policy should address only high levels of compensation \n     resulting from mergers, buyouts or other corporate \n     restructuring, while leaving alone normal bonuses and \n     salaries.\n       ``It should focus on what has apparently gotten the \n     attention of the critics,'' Concklin said May 28.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Grassley-Boxer doesn't get the Government out of the \nloop completely.\n  It would leave bureaucrats with authority to manipulate just a small \npiece of the compensation pie.\n  The bulk of executive compensation would be decided by industry in \nthe marketplace where it belongs.\n  In time, I hope to see a complete end to this practice.\n  It would cease to be an allowable expense under defense contracts.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4075) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE.

The purpose of \nthe program was to provide support for individual universities which \nhad not been participants in Department of Defense research programs. \nThe URISP program is only open to universities that have received less \nthan $2 million in DOD R funds in the two fiscal years preceding the \nsubmission of proposals for participation by the university. The \nprogram was intended to be a complement to the similar Defense Program \nto Stimulate Competitive Research [DEPSCoR] program in which university \neligibility is determined solely by location in a designated DEPSCoR \nstate and not by the amount of research funding an individual \ninstitution may have received in the past. Section 802 directs that all \ncontracts and grants be awarded under the URISP program using merit-\nbased, competitive procedures.\n\n  On February 13, 1996, the Department of Defense announced that it \nwill award $30 million under the URISP program over the next five \nyears. The funding is intended to allow for the building of \ninfrastructure to allow the universities to compete for DOD research \ncontracts. The average grant is $2 million, and the plan is to fund the \nfirst three years at $500,000 each and to provide $300,000 and $200,000 \nin the fourth and fifth year, respectively.\n  Unfortunately, release of full funding for the first installment has \nbeen reduced by the OSD comptroller to $140,000 because the eligibility \ndeterminations required under the law are delaying program \nimplementation. Information for the two most recent fiscal years has \nnot been available because of the time lag in compiling such recent \ndata.\n  The amendment I propose would have the effect of allowing the program \nto go forward by authorizing the use of data from the two most recent \nfiscal years for which it is available at the time the university made \nits proposal. This change will allow the effective implementation of a \nprogram that originated in the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  The Department of Defense has requested that this change be made and \nthe House has included this provision in their bill as section 244. In \nthe spirit of competition, passage of this amendment would allow \nuniversities which previously lacked the ability to vie for government \nresearch dollars to compete on a more equal footing thereby ensuring \nthat healthy competition remains the standard bearer in the research \nand development community.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been cleared by the other \nside.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4079) was agreed.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4080\n\n (Purpose: To strike section 1008, relating to the prohibition on the \nuse of funds for Office of Naval Intelligence representation or related \n                              activities)\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Lott, I offer an \namendment to strike section 1008 of the bill relating to the Office of \nNaval Intelligence. I believe this amendment has been cleared by the \nother side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne], for Mr. Lott, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4080.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike out section 1008, relating to the prohibition on the \n     use of funds for Office of Naval Intelligence representation \n     or related activities.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this amendment strikes section 1008 of the \nbill as reported out of committee. I appreciate the support of the \nmembers of the committee as well as the full Senate for this amendment.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4080) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4081\n\n(Purpose: To authorize the Secretary of the Army to convey certain real \n                property located at Fort Sill, Oklahoma)\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Inhofe and \nNickles, I offer an amendment which would transfer 400 acres located at \nFort Sill, OK, to the Department of Veterans Affairs for use as a \nnational cemetery. I believe this amendment has been cleared by the \nother side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne], for Mr. Nickles, \n     for himself and Mr. Inhofe, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4081.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Insert the following in the appropriate place:\n\n     SEC.   . TRANSFER OF JURISDICTION AND LAND CONVEYANCE, FORT \n                   SILL, OKLAHOMA.\n\n       (a) Transfer of Land for National Cemetery.--\n       (1) Transfer authorized.--The Secretary of the Army may \n     transfer, without reimbursement, to the administrative \n     jurisdiction of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs a parcel of \n     real property (including any improvements thereon) consisting \n     of approximately 400 acres and comprising a portion of Fort \n     Sill, Oklahoma.\n       (2) Use of land.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     use the real property transferred under paragraph (1) as a \n     national cemetery under chapter 24 of title 38, United States \n     Code.\n       (3) Return of unused land.--If the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs determines that any portion of the real property \n     transferred under paragraph (1) is not needed for use as a \n     national cemetery, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     return such portion to the administrative jurisdiction of the \n     Secretary of the Army.\n       (b) Legal Description.--The exact acreage and legal \n     description of the real property to be transferred or \n     conveyed under this section shall be determined by surveys \n     that are satisfactory to the Secretary of the Army. The cost \n     of such surveys shall be borne by the recipient of the real \n     property.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senators Thurmond and \nNunn for their assistance in getting this provision included in the \nDefense authorization bill. I also want to thank the staff of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee for their patience and understanding in \nworking with my staff on this issue.\n  This land transfer will put Oklahoma well on its way to getting a new \nnational veterans cemetery. This process was started nearly ten years \nago, but for one reason or another has been slow in moving forward. The \ntransfer will conclude years of searching for a location by utilizing \nthis land now a part of Ft. Sill.\n  Getting property upon which to locate a veterans cemetery has been a \nmajor struggle, and, obviously, this land transfer solves that problem. \nI am very pleased that this provision will be in the bill for the \nveterans of Oklahoma who wondered if this day would ever come.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senators Thurmond and Nunn \nfor agreeing to include this provision in the Defense authorization \nbill. I also want to thank the staff of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee for their patience and understanding in working with Senator \nNickles' and my staff on this issue.\n  This land transfer will allow Oklahoma to move forward in its attempt \nto establish a new national veterans' cemetery. This process has taken \nalmost a decade to get to this point, but I believe we now have a \nsatisfactory solution in using available land at Fort Sill, in Lawton, \nOK.\n  Finding property for this veterans' cemetery has been a major \nstruggle, and, obviously, this land transfer will mean a great deal to \nmany Oklahoman veterans. I am pleased to be a part of this solution, \nand I thank the other Senators who have helped to make this happen.\n  Mr. NUNN. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n\n[[Page S6504]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4081) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4082\n\n    (Purpose: To revise the provision relating to the environmental \n                         restoration accounts)\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator McCain, I offer \nan amendment that would remove language that refers to the treatment of \nappropriations and focuses on purposes for which authorized funds may \nbe obligated under the four environmental restoration accounts for the \nmilitary departments.\n  The amendment also eliminates all references to transfer accounts. \nThe deletion of the term ``transfer accounts'' ensures that the four \nenvironmental restoration accounts are treated as separate line items \nfor authorization of appropriations not susceptible to transfer funds \nbetween the military departments.\n  I believe this amendment has been cleared by the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne], for Mr. McCain, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4082.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 81, strike out line 18 and all that follows through \n     page 86, line 2, and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SEC. 341.

Mr. President, as it was noted in Senate Report No. \n104-267 produced by the Committee on Armed Services, it was not \npossible to include CBO cost estimates when the report was created \nbecause the cost estimates were not available. I now have CBO's \nfigures.\n  I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 1996.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the attached cost estimate for S. 1745, the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 as ordered \n     reported by the Senate Committee on Armed Services on May 2, \n     1996.\n       The bill would affect direct spending, and thus would be \n     subject to pay-as-you-go procedures under section 252 of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       If you wish, we would be pleased to provide further details \n     on the estimate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n       Attachment.\n\n\n               congressional budget office cost estimate\n\n       1. Bill number: S. 1745.\n       2. Bill title: National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 1997.\n       3. Bill Status: As ordered reported by the Senate Committee \n     on Armed Services on May 2, 1996.\n       4. Bill purpose: This bill would authorize appropriations \n     for 1997 for the military functions of the Department of \n     Defense (DoD) and the Department of Energy (DoE). This bill \n     also would prescribe personnel strengths for each active duty \n     and selected reserve component.\n       5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: Table 1 \n     summarizes the budgetary effects of the bill. It shows the \n     effects of the bill on direct spending and asset sales and on \n     authorizations of appropriations for 1997. Assuming \n     appropriation of the amounts authorized, the bill would \n     increase funding for discretionary programs in 1997 by $3.0 \n     billion over the 1996 appropriated level, although outlays \n     would decline by $0.1 billion.\n       6. Basis of estimate: The estimate assumes that the bill \n     will be enacted by October 1, 1996, and that the amounts \n     authorized will be appropriated for 1997. Outlays are \n     estimated according to historical spending patterns.\n     Direct spending and asset sales\n       The bill contains several provisions that would affect \n     direct spending or asset sales (see Table 2). The provisions \n     involve the sale of material in the National Defense \n     Stockpile, the sale of various naval vessels, civilian and \n     military retirement benefits, annuities for military \n     surviving spouses, the use of proceeds from certain property \n     sales, and other matters with less significant costs.\n       Under the 1996 budget resolution, proceeds from asset sales \n     are counted in the budget totals for purposes of \n     Congressional scoring. Under the Balanced Budget Act, \n     however, proceeds from asset sales are not counted in \n     determining compliance with the discretionary spending limits \n     or pay-as-you-go requirement.\n       Stockpile Sales. The bill would require the Administration \n     to sell certain materials in the National Defense Stockpile \n     to raise receipts by $338 million during the five-year period \n     ending on September 30, 2001, and $649 million during the \n     seven-year period ending on September 30, 2003.

Under the        \n  Balanced Budget Act, however, proceeds from asset sales are not counted in determining compliance with the discretionary spending limits or pay-as-you-\n  go requirement.                                                                                                                                       \n\\2\\ The 1996 figure is the amount appropriated for programs authorized by this bill.                                                                    \n                                                                                                                                                        \nNote.--Costs of the bill would fall under budget function 050, National Defense, except for certain other items as noted.                               \n\n       The receipts would come from selling aluminum, cobalt, \n     columbium ferro, germanium metal, indium, palladium, \n     platinum, rubber, and tantalum. Current law does not permit \n     DoD to sell any of these materials except cobalt, but CBO \n     expects that all cobalt now authorized for sale will be sold \n     during 1996.\n       To determine if the receipt targets could be achieved, CBO \n     reviewed both past sales and historical trends in prices for \n     the different materials. Using both historical average prices \n     and quantities that would probably not cause any significant \n     disruption in world markets, CBO found the receipt levels to \n     be achievable.\n       Transfer of Naval Vessels. The bill would authorize the \n     Secretary of the Navy to sell eight naval vessels to certain \n     foreign countries and otherwise dispose of two other vessels. \n     The Navy estimates the sale would generate $72 million in \n     offsetting receipts in 1997.\n       Civilian Retirement Annuities. Section 1121 would index the \n     average pay used to calculate deferred retirement benefits \n     for certain DoD civilian employees. CBO estimates that this \n     proposal would reduce spending by $40 million in fiscal year \n     1997, $98 million in 1998, $57 million in 1999, $57 million \n     in 2000, $56 million in 2001, and $54 million in 2002.\n       Section 1121 would apply, at the discretion of DoD, to \n     employees at military bases sold to private contractors. To \n     qualify for benefits under this proposal, the DoD employee \n     must continue working in the same job after the base is sold \n     to a private company. Further, the employee must be enrolled \n     in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability System and not \n     be eligible for retirement benefits. Based on the Base \n     Realignment and Closure Commission reports and data from DoD, \n     CBO assumes that about 1,200 people in 1997 and 2,000 in 1998 \n     would take advantage of this proposal.\n       Under the bill, qualified workers could count their years \n     of service under the private contractor toward meeting the \n     age and service requirements for regular retirement. Further, \n     the high-3 average federal salary used to calculate benefits \n     would be indexed to federal pay raises during the time \n     between the end of federal service and retirement. Based on \n     data from DoD, CBO estimates that only about 5 percent of \n     those affected would begin receiving benefits in the six-year \n     projection period. Direct spending outlays are estimated to \n     be less than $500,000 in fiscal year 1997, $2 million in \n     1998, $3 million in 1999, $3 million in 2000, $4 million in \n     2001, and $6 million in 2002. The bulk of the costs would \n     begin to be realized about 15 years from enactment.\n       Over the six-year projection period, the increased costs of \n     the annuities would be more than offset by forgone refunds of \n     employee contributions. Based on rates of withdrawal from the \n     Office of Personnel Management, CBO assumes that under \n     current law about 60 percent of affected employees would have \n     withdrawn their retirement contributions, when they \n     lost their federal jobs to a private contractor. Since \n     this proposal would greatly increase the value of the \n     employee's retirement benefits, most of the affected \n     workers would not withdraw their contributions and instead \n     would remain eligible for retirement benefits. Given an \n     average refund of about $34,000, the reduction in outlays \n     from fewer refunds is estimated to be $20 million in \n     fiscal year 1997 and about $40 million in 1998.\n       Section 1121 would also require that DOD amortize in 10 \n     equal payments any increase in the unfunded liability of the \n     Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund that is \n     attributable to the enhanced benefits of this proposal. DOD \n     would pay an estimated $20 million a year for 10 years \n     beginning in fiscal year 1997 and another $40 million a year \n     for 10 years beginning in 1998. The receipt of these payments \n     is not included in the cost estimate because they fund \n     additional benefits that generally lie beyond the horizon of \n     the estimate.\n       Annuities for Certain Military Surviving Spouses. Section \n     634 would provide annuities to the surviving spouses of two \n     groups of former servicemembers. The first group would \n     consist of military retirees who died before March 21, 1974. \n     The second group would consist of reservists who died between \n     September 21, 1972 and October 1, 1978, and who were entitled \n     to retired pay at the time of their death except that they \n     were under the age of 60. Based on information from DOD, CBO \n     estimates that this provision would ultimately extend \n     benefits to about 25,000 surviving spouses. We assume, \n     however, that only half of those eligible spouses would learn \n     of this provision and receive benefits in 1997, when costs \n     are estimated to total about $12 million. In 2002, we assume \n     all 25,000 will be receiving the benefits. CBO estimates that \n     payments will eventually total about $57 million a year.\n       Use of Base Closure Proceeds. Section 2812 would allow DOD \n     to use certain proceeds from the sale of base closure \n     property for the construction of commissaries or facilities \n     related to morale, recreation, or welfare activities. This \n     provision would affect proceeds from the sale of any property \n     that was acquired or constructed with commissary funds or \n     nonappropriated funds and that is sold due to the base \n     closure process. Under current law, these proceeds cannot be \n     used unless appropriated by the Congress. By 2002, CBO \n     estimates that spending under this section would total about \n     $15 million annually.\n       Retirement of Certain Officers. Section 532 would allow no \n     more than 25 retired officers in each military department to \n     be recalled to active duty. Under current law, the Army and \n     Navy have recalled about 100 retired officers to active duty. \n     This provision would force the retirement of about 150 people \n     and would result in increased retirements costs of about $5 \n     million annually.\n\n                              TABLE 2.--DIRECT SPENDING AND ASSET SALES IN S. 1745                              \n                                    [By fiscal years, in millions of dollars]                                   \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             1997     1998     1999     2000     2001     2002  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 DIRECT SPENDING                                                \n                                                                                                                \nCivilian Retirement......................................      -20      -38        3        3        4         6\nSurviving Spouses........................................       12       38       52       54       56        57\nBase Closure Proceeds....................................        2        8       12       14       15        15\nRetirement of Certain Officers...........................        5        5        5        5        5         6\nBonuses Repayments.......................................        0        0    (\\1\\)        1        2         5\nOther Direct Spending....................................

Under current law, some \n     servicemembers who leave the military and receive certain \n     separation bonus payments must repay those amounts if they \n     later receive veterans' disability compensation or military \n     retirement. For these individuals retirement and compensation \n     payments are withheld until the full amount of the bonus \n     payment has been recouped. This provision would change the \n     amount that must be repaid from 100 percent of the bonus \n     payment to the net amount of the payment following federal \n     income tax withholding, for separations from service \n     occurring in 1997 or later. Thus, beneficiaries would begin \n     receiving veterans compensation or retired pay sooner than \n     under current law.\n       Additional veteran's compensation payments would begin in \n     1999. Near term costs would be small--less than $500,000 in \n     1999 and $15 million in 2002. Total costs for individual \n     separating over the next six years would eventually amount to \n     about $70 million, but this total amount would not be reached \n     for 10 to 15 years.\n       No data are kept on the number of individuals who receive \n     separation payments and subsequently rejoin the military and \n     qualify for retired pay. Such individual would most likely \n     join and retire from the Selected Reserves. Reserve retirees \n     do not receive retired pay until they reach age 62---more \n     than 25 years after most would have received the initial \n     separation payment. Any costs associated with this part of \n     the provision would be small and would not appear for many \n     years.\n       Miscellaneous Military Retirement Provisions. Four other \n     provisions would change current law governing the military \n     retired program including survivor benefits. None of these \n     provisions would have significant costs because relatively \n     few people would be affected or changes in benefit levels \n     would be relatively small:\n       Section 515 would authorize reservists to receive \n     disability retirement if they are injured during overnight \n     stays associated with inactive-duty training.\n       Section 516 would allow certain members of the reserves to \n     receive retirement-related credit if they participate in \n     select educational programs and work in a specialty that is \n     critically needed in wartime.\n       Section 531 would allow service members who are retired due \n     to physical disabilities to receive retired pay based on the \n     grade to which they would have been promoted had it not been \n     for the onset of the physical disability.\n       Section 533 would authorize disability coverage for certain \n     officers who are injured while attending educational programs \n     on leave without pay.\n       Other provisions. The bill would give the President the \n     authority to award the Medal of Honor to seven individuals. \n     This award is accompanied by monthly payment of $400, but the \n     annual cost of all seven recipients would amount to less than \n     $500,000 per year.\n       The bill would allow the Secretary of Transportation to \n     stop trying to collect amounts that Coast Guard personnel \n     owed the government before they died on active duty. The \n     forgone receipts would be considered direct spending. Both \n     the number of people and the amount of collections would be \n     small, however, and the cost of this provision would be less \n     than $500,000 annually.\n       The bill also contains a provision that would allow the \n     government to recover the costs of compensation for certain \n     military servicemembers who are unable to perform their \n     military duties. If a third party is found liable for the \n     circumstances under which the servicemember becomes \n     incapacitated, the government would be able to collect and \n     spend the money. Collections would increase but expenditures \n     would rise by the same amount, so there would be no net \n     budgetary impact.\n     Authorizations of appropriations\n       The bill authorizes specific appropriations of $198 billion \n     for 1997 for operation and maintenance, procurement, \n     research, development, test and evaluation, nuclear weapons \n     programs, and other DoD program. These authorizations fall \n     under National Defense, budget function 050.\n       In addition, the bill would authorize specific \n     appropriations for other budget functions: $150 million for \n     the Naval Petroleum Reserve (function 270), $57 million for \n     the Armed Forces Retirement Home (function 700).\n       The bill also contains both specific and implicit \n     authorizations of appropriations for other military programs, \n     primarily for military personnel costs, some of which extend \n     beyond 1997. Table 3 contains estimates for the amounts \n     authorized and the related outlays. The following sections \n     describe the estimated authorizations shown in Table 3 and \n     provide information about CBO's cost estimates.\n       Endstrength. The bill would authorize active and reserve \n     component endstrengths for 1997 at a cost of $68 billion. \n     Endstrengths specifically stated in the bill for active-duty \n     personnel would total about 1,457,500--about 500 more than in \n     the Administration's request but about 24,200 below the level \n     estimated for 1996. DoD reserve endstrengths would be \n     authorized at about 901,900--about 900 more than in the \n     Administration's request but about 28,900 less than the \n     estimated 1996 level.\n       Also, the bill would authorize an endstrength of 8,000 in \n     1997 for the Coast Guard Reserve, which is the same as the \n     1996 level and the Administration's request; this \n     authorization would cost about $66 million and would fall \n     under budget function 400, Transportation.\n       Compensation and Benefits. The bill contains several \n     provisions that would affect military compensation and \n     benefits.\n       Pay Raises and Quarters Allowances. The bill would \n     authorize a 3.0 percent increase in the rates of basic pay \n     and the basic allowance for subsistence for military \n     personnel, at a cost of $1.2 billion. The same section would \n     also call for the basic allowance for quarters (BAQ) to \n     increase by 4.0 percent. Under current law BAQ increases \n     according to the military pay raise; consequently, the 3.0 \n     percent pay raise authorized in this bill would raise BAQ by \n     $109 million. The provision that raises BAQ by the additional \n     1.0 percent would cost another $36 million. Thus, BAQ would \n     increase by $145 million compared to 1996 rates.\n       Expiring Authorities. Several sections would extend for one \n     year certain payment authorities that are scheduled to expire \n     at the end of 1997. In some cases, renewing authorities for \n     one year results in costs over several years because payments \n     are made in installments. Payment authorities for enlistment \n     and reenlistment bonuses for active duty personnel would cost \n     $148 million in 1998. The cost of extensions of special \n     payments for aviators and nuclear-qualified personnel would \n     total $49 million in 1998. Extension of various bonus \n     programs for Selected Reserve personnel would increase costs \n     by $33 million in 1998. Finally, authorities to make special \n     payments to nurse officer candidates, registered nurses, and \n     nurse anesthetists would increase authorizations by $12 \n     million in 1998.\n       Housing Allowance During Duty at Sea. The bill would \n     authorize payment of housing allowances to certain personnel \n     in pay grade E-5 who are assigned to shipboard sea duty. This \n     change would provide about 7,000 personnel with housing \n     allowances averaging $6,000 annually, for a total yearly cost \n     of about $40 million.\n       Grade Structure. The bill would authorize the number of \n     active duty officers who can serve in certain pay grades in \n     each of the military services. This change would not increase \n     overall endstrength, but it would result in increased \n     promotions. The provision has a cost, about $35 million \n     annually, because personnel serving in higher grades are paid \n     more. Because the provision does not take affect until \n     September 1, 1997, the cost is only $3 million in 1997.\n       Special Pay for Dentists. In 1996, DoD will pay about $40 \n     million in incentive payments to dentists serving as officers \n     in the military services. This bill would increase these \n     incentives at a cost of $8 million a year.\n       Moving costs. The bill would allow DoD to pay storage costs \n     for motor vehicles when members cannot take the vehicle along \n     on a move and to reimburse members for certain expenses when \n     they pick up a vehicle at a port following government \n     shipment. Together, these two provisions would cost $4 \n     million in 1997.\n       Family separation allowance. Current law authorizes payment \n     of a family separation allowance (FSA) to servicemembers \n     whose military duties prevent them from being able to live \n     with their families. However, no allowance is paid when both \n     spouses are servicemembers and there are not other \n     dependents. This provision would pay FSA to military couples \n     who are otherwise eligible for payments at a cost of $2 \n     million annually.\n       Adoption expenses. Under current law, DOD reimburses \n     members of the military services for expenses incurred when \n     they adopt children through state, local, or non-profit \n     adoption agencies. The bill would extend this reimbursement \n     to adoptions arranged privately under court supervision. \n     Based on national adoption statistics, CBO estimates that \n     this change would increase the number of adoptions eligible \n     for reimbursement by about 50 percent, at an annual cost of \n     $1 million.\n       Military Personnel Authorization. The bill explicitly \n     authorizes appropriations for military personnel of $69,878 \n     million in 1997. Because the estimated cost of other sections \n     of the bill exceed this amount, this section has the effect \n     of reducing costs by $36 million.\n       Military Health Care Programs. The bill contains two \n     provisions that affect military health care and that have \n     significant budgetary impacts.\n       Dental Insurance. The bill would require the Secretary of \n     Defense to establish a dental insurance program for military \n     retirees\n\n[[Page S6507]]\n\n     and their dependents. DOD could bear part of the cost of the \n     premium payments. Assuming premium sharing at the same level \n     as in similar programs currently available to active duty \n     dependents and members of the Selected Reserve, this \n     provision would cost about $300 million annually.\n       Composite Health Care System (CHCS). The bill would direct \n     the Secretary of Defense to make certain changes to the \n     composite Health Care System (CHCS), an automated medical \n     information system used by DOD. These changes would \n     standardize CHCS so that the information systems of various \n     military treatment facilities and private contractors could \n     exchange data about health care beneficiaries. No information \n     is available from DOD about the potential costs of the \n     changes, and CBO is unable to estimate the cost of this \n     provision.\n       Civilian Retirement Annuities. Section 1121, which would \n     index the average pay used to calculate deferred retirement \n     benefits for certain DOD civilian employees, also results in \n     costs that would be funded by appropriations. The 10-year \n     amortization payments made by the DOD to the civilian \n     retirement fund would total an estimated $10 million in 1997 \n     and $60 million a year for each of the following years in the \n     projection period. These costs are offset by savings of about \n     $30 million in fiscal year 1997 and $50 million in 1998 \n     attributable to the provision that precludes severance \n     payment to any individual taking advantage of benefits under \n     this section.\n       Public Health Service. The bill would authorize payments to \n     Public Health Service officers of certain special pay and \n     allowances currently received by DoD military personnel. \n     Payments would be extended to optometrists, non-physician \n     health care providers, and foreign language specialists at a \n     cost of $4 million annually. These costs would fall under \n     various budget functions.\n\n  TABLE 3.--AUTHORIZATIONS OF APPROPRIATIONS IN THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997 AS  \n

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to seven \nunsung heroes of World War II. Although a half-century in the making, \nit is never too late to honor the bravery and heroism of our men and \nwomen in uniform. I view the nomination of seven African-American World \nWar II heroes for the Medal of Honor with much admiration and pride. \nThis is an honor that should have been bestowed many decades ago. The \naward acknowledges a job well done and is absolutely well deserved.\n  A 15-month study conducted by a team of military historians reviewed \nthe nation's archives and interviewed veterans to find out why no black \nservice member received the Medal of Honor during World War II. Nine \nblack soldiers were awarded the second-highest honor--the Distinguished \nService Cross. I was surprised, however, to learn that the study found \nno evidence that any African-American soldier in World War II was ever \nnominated for the Medal of Honor, though commanders, comrades and \narchival records indicate that at least four of the seven nominees had \nbeen recommended. This same report found evidence that the segregation \nof units by race often complicated training, exacerbated relations \nbetween officers and enlisted men and their units, and undermined the \nmorale of these units in both subtle and obvious ways.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee and the House Committee on \nNational Security approved a provision in the Defense Authorization \nbill that would authorize the Secretary of the Army to award the Medal \nof Honor to African-American former service members who have been found \nby the Secretary of the Army to have distinguished themselves by \ngallantry above and beyond the call of duty while serving in the U.S. \nArmy during WWII.\n  It is truly unfortunate that only one of the seven nominees--Vernon \nJ. Baker--is still living. On April 5, 1945, then First Lieutenant \nBaker led a platoon over ``Hill X'' in Italy. Along the way, he and his \nmen destroyed six machine gun nests, two observer posts and four \ndugouts while the Germans rained bullets down on them. Out of 25 men, 7 \nAmericans survived while 26 Germans were killed in the action. ``Hill \nX'' had to be taken in order to capture a castle that guarded the town \nof Montignoso along Highway 1. The route was key to the Allies push \nnorth and its capture helped to hastened the end of WWII. First \nLieutenant Baker received the Distinguished Service Cross--our Nation's \nsecond highest award--for his actions. And now at long last he will \nreceive the appropriate recognition--the Medal of Honor the highest \nhonor that we can bestow.\n  Mr. Baker, although raised in Wyoming, moved to St. Maries, ID, in \n1987 because he enjoys the State's hunting and great outdoor \nopportunities. I am proud of and thankful for the many sacrifices that \nour men and women in uniform have made in the past and continue to make \naround the world. We are certainly proud that Mr. Baker now resides in \nthe State of Idaho, and that he and the other nominees will now \nrightfully receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/19/senate-section/article/S6508-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HONORING THE DASCHLES CELEBRATING THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my distinct pleasure to rise today to \nhonor Sebastian and Elizabeth Daschle, who celebrated their 50th \nwedding anniversary on January 16, 1996. Their lives and strong \ncommitment to one another serve as an example to the entire Nation.\n  Betty Meiers and Sebastian ``Dash'' Daschle were married on a mild \nwinter day in Roscoe SD. Two days later, they were hit by the worst \nblizzard of the year. Together the Daschles weathered the storm and \nhave continued to stand beside one another through 50 years of \nsurprises and joys.\n  The Daschles devotion to one another began early, with Betty waiting \nfor her sweetheart to return home from World War II so they could be \nmarried. Since fabric was scarce at the time, Betty's wedding dress and \nthe flower girl's dress was made out of a parachute brought home from \nthe war. While the fabric was unconventional, it was plentiful and \nprovided enough material for Betty's dress to have a long, elegant \ntrain. Betty and Dash took their vows on the day of Betty's parents \n25th anniversary and, for 30 years, the two couples jointly celebrated \ntheir happiness. Clearly, commitment and lasting love run in the \nfamily.\n  Following the wedding, the young couple moved to Aberdeen, SD, to \nmake their home. After an unsuccessful search for a place to live, they \nhad to install plumbing on the top floor of a house to create a \nmakeshift apartment. Betty's father and brother built the Daschles' \nfirst house in 1948. In 1952, they built a bigger home on the same lot \nand have happily lived there ever since.\n  Through the years, Dash worked as a bookkeeper for Nelson Auto \nElectric, and eventually worked his way to become a part-owner of the \nbusiness. The Daschles are proud parents of four boys--including my \nfriend and colleague, the distinguished minority leader Senator Tom \nDaschle. The Daschles delight each day in the joy of their \ngrandchildren.\n  For the Daschles, a promise made was a promise kept. Their dedication \nto their vows and commitment to strong family ties serve as a model for \nfamilies across America.\n  I congratulate the Daschles on this achievement, and wish them \ncontinued happiness in their lives together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/19/senate-section/article/S6508-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6508-S6509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SALUTE TO THE PERFORMING ARTS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, when I think of Iowa, I envision lush, \nrolling hills; wide, blue skies; and rich, black soil. Located in the \nheartland of America, Iowa's bounteous fields and streams feed the \nworld. I'm sure most people across the country and throughout the world \nassociate my State with its exceptional agricultural products and \nproductive farmland.\n  But today, I am going to share with America a different chapter of \nthe Iowa story. Perhaps one that many already have read about or seen \non the Big Screen--and that is, Iowa's contributions to film making and \nthe performing arts. A handful of our Iowa-born friends have risen to \ncelebrity status on TV, on the silver screen, and on stage.\n\n[[Page S6509]]\n\n  To name a few--singer Andy Williams was born in Wall Lake; the Everly \nBrothers, Don and Phil lived in Shenandoah; Cloris Leachman, who played \nPhyllis on ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' hails from Des Moines, as did \nHarriett Nelson of the television series, ``The Adventures of Ozzie and \nHarriett.'' Marion Michael Morrison, better known as John Wayne, was \nborn in Winterset. The famous musician/composer, Glenn Miller came from \nClarinda. And who can ever forget the memorable sounds of the ``Music \nMan,'' Meridith Wilson is from Mason City. And, last but not least, Mr. \nPresident, internationally-acclaimed opera singer, Simon Estes, was \nborn in Centerville, IA.\n  In addition to the talents of Iowa's hometown celebrities, my State \nhas opened its doors to reveal our scenic countryside to Hollywood film \nmakers. Box office hits filmed in Iowa include, ``Field of Dreams,'' \n``The Bridges of Madison County,'' and ``Twister.'' The movie \n``Bridges'' was adapted from the novel written by my fellow Iowan, \nRobert Waller. If asked, Mr. President, I would have to concur with a \npopular scene from the movie ``Field of Dreams,'' filmed in eastern \nIowa near Dyersville. That scene included the lines--``Is this Heaven? \nNo, it's Iowa.''\n  Mr. President, the list of Iowa-born celebrities includes a hometown \ngirl who never forgot where she came from. The oldest of five children, \nDonna Belle Mullenger, attended a one room school house and helped with \nthe family chores on a western Iowa farm near Denison. Growing up on a \nfarm, Donna cherished the rare Saturday trips to town, when she would \nmeet friends at the Candy Kitchen and catch a movie at the Ritz \nTheater.\n  This girl-next-door later became a household name and Hollywood star. \nDonna Reed starred in more than 40 films, including such classics as \n``It's a Wonderful Life,'' ``Portrait of Dorian Gray,'' and her Oscar-\nwinning performance in ``From Here to Eternity.'' And for 8 years, \nDonna Reed entertained families in their living rooms across America. \n``The Donna Reed Show'' ran from 1958 to 1965.\n  As I stated earlier in one of my speeches describing the Iowa Spirit, \nthe people of Iowa strive to excel in any and all endeavors, whether it \nbe education, entertainment or enterprise. And the community of \nDenison, the county seat of Crawford County, is no exception. In memory \nof the Hollywood actress who was known to say, ``No matter what I do, I \nam still a farm girl from Denison,'' the community celebrated a 1-day \nfestival in her honor after her death in 1986. At that time, her Oscar \nwas presented to the city of Denison. One year later, Donna Reed's \nhometown community, friends and family members formed The Donna Reed \nFoundation for the Performing Arts to recognize youth and promote \neducation.\n  The Foundation celebrates its 10th annual Donna Reed Festival this \nweek, June 15-23. Building on its charter to provide affordable and \nhigh quality education to those who share a love for the arts, the \nFoundation offers performing arts workshops, and awards an annual \ncollege scholarship to applicants interested in studying acting, music, \nand dance. The first scholarship was awarded in 1987 for $500. Within 8 \nyears, the award had grown to a $10,000 national scholarship. During \nthis week's festival, performing arts instructors and professionals \nfrom New York, California, and the Midwest will conduct about 45 \nprofessional workshops. One of the highlights at the festival this year \nincludes a tribute to the 50th anniversary of ``It's A Wonderful \nLife,'' featuring a reunion of cast and crew.\n  Mr. President, I proudly salute members of the Denison community and \ntheir vision for promoting the arts. Borne of hard work, countless \nvolunteer hours, and unparalleled community spirit, The Donna Reed \nFoundation has achieved a center for cultural and performing arts in \nAmerica's heartland.\n  Mr. President, life in Iowa truly is a wonderful life.

Declaring that radio for the Black \ncommunity was an idea whose time had come, Jimmie Porter founded KBBG-\nFM radio in 1977 with his partner, Warren Nash, Jr., in Waterloo, IA. \nIncorporated as Afro-American Community Broadcasting, Inc., KBBG's \ncharter pledged to fulfill the needs, interests and wishes of ethnic \nminority people in northeast Iowa.\n  KBBG has come a long way since its first equipment testing of 10 \nwatts on July 26, 1978. On its first full day of broadcasting that \nAugust, KBBG reached a 4 to 5 mile radius. Today, the radio station \nboasts a 60-mile radius, 10,000 watts, and 11 employees.\n  The largest African American owned and operated noncommercial \neducational radio station in my State of Iowa, KBBG Radio has provided \nalmost $1.8 million of public service announcements for nonprofit \norganizations in the last 8 years.\n  Mr. President, I proudly commend KBBG Radio, its owners and its \nemployees for providing a valuable service to the Waterloo and Cedar \nFalls metro area and to northeast Iowa.\n  A model of self-development and community outreach, KBBG continues to \nbuild on its well-served motto, communicate to educate. Mr. President, \nI thank and congratulate KBBG for 18 years of service and extend my \nwishes for continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/19/senate-section/article/S6509-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6509-S6512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DR. BEATRICE BRAUDE AND JUSTICE DELAYED BUT NOT ULTIMATELY DENIED\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this past Monday, the Washington Post \nreported that Justice Department attorneys have reached a settlement \nwith lawyers representing the estate of Dr. Beatrice Braude concerning \nmonetary damages equitably due for the wrongful dismissal of Dr. Braude \nfrom her Federal job in 1953 and subsequent blacklisting. The estate \nwill receive $200,000 in damages. Family members have announced that \nthe funds--which Congress must now appropriate--will be donated to \nHunter College, the institution from which Dr. Braude received her \nbachelor's degree.\n  This settlement stems from the enormously gratifying decision of U.S. \nCourt of Federal Claims Judge Roger B. Andewelt on March 7, following a \nhearing last November, that the United States Information Agency (USIA) \nhad wrongfully dismissed Dr. Braude and intentionally concealed the \nreason for her termination. He concluded that such actions constituted \nan equitable claim for which compensation is due.\n  Dr. Braude's suit was made possible through legislation then-Senator \nJavits and I originally introduced in 1979 and which Senator D'Amato \nand I continued to press. When finally enacted, it lifted the statute \nof limitations, enabling the Court to hear Dr. Braude's case and hand \ndown its decision. I know Senator D'Amato shares my gratification with \nthe settlement announcement.\n  With Judge Roger B. Andewelt's decision and this negotiated \nsettlement, we have finally seen a measure of justice which brings back \nmemories of an old and awful time. Dr. Braude, a linguist fluent in \nseveral languages, was dismissed from her position at the USIA in 1953 \nas a result of accusations of disloyalty to the United States. The \naccusations were old; 2 years earlier, the State Department's Loyalty \nSecurity Board had investigated and unanimously voted to dismiss them. \nThe Board sent a letter to Dr. Braude stating ``there is no reasonable \ndoubt as to your loyalty to the United States Government or as to your \nsecurity risk to the Department of State.''\n  Dr. Braude was terminated 1 day after being praised for her work and \ninformed that she probably would be promoted. USIA officials told that \nher that the termination was due to budgetary constraints. Congress had \nfunded the USIA at a level 27 percent below the President's request. \nThe Supplemental Appropriation Act of 1954 (Public Law 83-207) \nauthorized a reduction in force commensurate to the budget cut. Fair \nenough. As Dr. Braude remarked years later, ``I never felt that I had a \nlien on a government job.'' But what Dr. Braude did not know is that \nshe was selected for termination because of the old--and answered--\ncharges against her. And because she did not know the real reason for \nher\n\n[[Page S6510]]\n\ndismissal, she was denied certain procedural rights (the right to \nrequest a hearing, for instance).\n\n  The true reason for her dismissal was kept hidden from her. When she \nwas unable, over the next several years, to secure employment anywhere \nelse within the Federal Government--even in a typing pool despite a \nperfect score on the typing test--she became convinced that she had \nbeen blacklisted. She spent the next 30 years fighting to regain \nemployment and restore her reputation. Though she succeeded in 1982 (at \nthe age of 69) in securing a position in the CIA as a language \ninstructor, she still had not been able to clear her name by the time \nof her death in 1988. The irony of the charges against Dr. Braude is \nthat she was an anti-communist, having witnessed first-hand communist-\nsponsored terrorism in Europe while she was an assistant cultural \naffairs officer in Paris and, for a brief period, an exchange officer \nin Bonn during the late 1940's and early 1950's.\n  Mr. President, I would like to review the charges against Dr. Braude \nbecause they are illustrative of that dark era and instructive to us \neven today. There were a total of four. First, she was briefly a member \nof the Washington Book Shop on Farragut Square that the Attorney \nGeneral later labeled subversive. Second, she had been in contact with \nMary Jane Keeney, a Communist Party activist employed at the United \nNations. Third, she had been a member of the State Department unit of \nthe Communist-dominated Federal Workers' Union. Fourth, she was an \nacquaintance of Judith Coplon.\n  With regard to the first charge, Dr. Braude had indeed joined the \nBook Shop shortly after her arrival in Washington in 1943. She was \neager to meet congenial new people and a friend recommended the Book \nShop, which hosted music recitals in the evenings. I must express some \nsensitivity here: my F.B.I. records report that I was observed several \ntimes at a ``leftist musical review'' in suburban Hampstead while I was \nattending the London School of Economics on a Fulbright Fellowship.\n  Dr. Braude was aware of the undercurrent of sympathy with the Russian \ncause at the Book Shop, but her membership paralleled a time of close \nU.S.-Soviet collaboration. She drifted away from the Book Shop in 1944 \nbecause of her distaste for the internal politics of other active \nmembers. Her membership at the Book Shop was only discovered when her \nname appeared on a list of delinquent dues. It appears that her most \nsinister crime while a member of the book shop was her failure to \nreturn a book on time.\n  Dr. Braude met Mary Jane Keeney on behalf of a third woman who \nactively aided Nazi victims after the war and was anxious to send \nclothing to another woman in occupied Germany. Dr. Braude knew nothing \nof Keeney's political orientation and characterized the meeting as a \ntransitory experience.\n  With regard to the third charge, Dr. Braude, in response to an \ninterrogatory from the State Department's Loyalty Security Board, \nargued that she belonged to an anti-Communist faction of the State \nDepartment unit of the Federal Workers' Union.\n  Remember that the Loyalty Security Board investigated these charges \nand exonerated her.\n  The fourth charge, which Dr. Braude certainly did not--or could not--\ndeny, was her friendship with Judith Coplon. Braude met Coplon in the \nsummer of 1945 when both women attended a class Herbert Marcuse taught \nat American University. They saw each other infrequently thereafter. In \nMay 1948, Coplon wrote to Braude, then stationed in Paris and living in \na hotel on the Left Bank, to announce that she would be visiting \nshortly and needed a place to stay. Dr. Braude arranged for Coplon to \nstay at the hotel. Coplon stayed for 6 weeks, during which time Dr. \nBraude found her behavior very trying. The two parted on unfriendly \nterms. The friendship they had prior to parting was purely social.\n  Mr. President, Judith Coplon was a spy. She worked in the Justice \nDepartment's Foreign Agents Registration Division, an office integral \nto the FBI's counterintelligence efforts. She was arrested early in \n1949 while handing over notes on counterintelligence operations to \nSoviet citizen Valentine Gubitchev, a United Nations employee. Coplon \nwas tried and convicted--there was no doubt of her guilt--but the \nconviction was overturned on a technicality. Gubitchev was also \nconvicted but was allowed to return to the U.S.S.R. because of his \nquasi-diplomatic status.\n  I bring all this up because, as I mentioned earlier, it is \ninstructive. The world is a dangerous place. On July 11, 1995--6 days \nbefore the 50th anniversary of the first successful detonation of an \natomic bomb--the National Security Agency released 49 of some 2,200 \ncoded messages sent by the KGB and decrypted between 1943 and 1980. The \ndecoded messages have been kept classified until now. They are known as \nthe VENONA intercepts.\n  The existence of a Soviet spy ring and the active involvement of \nAmerican communists--fellow countrymen was the KGB code word for them--\nhas long been established. Of late, details have been flooding in from \nMoscow. But this is the first American archive to be opened.\n  At the onset of the Cold War, in Edward Shils' memorable phrase, the \nAmerican visage began to cloud over. Some saw conspiracy everywhere. \nRecall, that in 1951, Senator Joseph McCarthy published America's \n``Retreat from Victory: The Story of George Catlett Marshall.'' Some \ndenied any such possibility and accused the accusers. Loyalty oaths and \nbackground checks proliferated, and all information became Top Secret. \nA culture of secrecy took hold within the American government, whilst a \nhugely divisive debate raged in Congress and the press.\n\n  We got through it. But the world remains a dangerous place, and it is \njust possible that we might learn something from the VENONA files. Had \nthey been published in 1950, we might have been spared the soft-on-\ncommunism charge that distorted our politics for four decades. We might \nhave been spared the anti-anti-communist stance that was no less \nunhelpful.\n  The fact is, there were spies in this country and they did awful \nthings--Coplon among them. But there were innocent people, too, like \nDr. Braude, who were caught in a hall of mirrors.\n  My involvement in Dr. Braude's case dates back to early 1979, when \nDr. Braude came to me and my colleague at the time, Senator Javits, and \nasked us to introduce private relief legislation on her behalf. In \n1974, after filing a Freedom of Information Act request and finally \nlearning the true reason for her dismissal, she filed suit in the Court \nof Claims to clear her name and seek reinstatement and monetary damages \nfor the time she was prevented from working for the Federal Government. \nThe Court, however, dismissed her case on the grounds that the statute \nof limitations had expired. On March 5, 1979, Senator Javits and I \ntogether introduced a bill, S. 546, to waive the statute of limitations \non Dr. Braude's case against the U.S. Government and to allow the Court \nof Claims to render judgment on her claim. The bill passed the Senate \non January 30, 1980. Unfortunately, the House failed to take action on \nthe bill before the 96th Congress adjourned.\n  In 1988, and again in 1990, 1991, and 1993, Senator D'Amato and I re-\nintroduced similar legislation on Dr. Braude's behalf. Our attempts met \nwith repeated failure. Until at last, on September 21, 1993, we secured \npassage of Senate Resolution 102, which referred S. 840, the bill we \nintroduced for the relief of the estate of Dr. Braude, to the Court of \nClaims for consideration as a congressional reference action. The \nmeasure compelled the Court to determine the facts underlying Dr. \nBraude's claim and to report back to Congress on its findings.\n  The Court held a hearing on the case last November and Judge Andewelt \nissued his verdict in March. Forty-three years after her dismissal from \nthe USIA and 8 years after her death, the Court found in favor of the \nestate of Dr. Braude.\n  Senator D'Amato and I wish to express our profound admiration for \nJudge Andewelt's decision in which he absolved Dr. Beatrice Braude of \nthe surreptitious charges of disloyalty with which she was never \nactually confronted. The Court declared that Dr. Braude ``cared about \nothers deeply and was loyal to her friends, family and country.''\n  We are equally grateful to Christopher N. Sipes and William \nLivingston, Jr. of Covington & Burling, two of\n\n[[Page S6511]]\n\nthe many lawyers who have handled Dr. Braude's case on a pro bono basis \nover the years. Mr. Sipes quite properly remarked that the decision \nrepresents an important page in the annals of U.S. history: ``The Court \nof the United States has said it recognizes that this conduct is out of \nbounds. It tells the government it must acknowledge its wrongs and pay \nfor them.''\n  Anthony Lewis wrote about Dr. Braude's case on March 15 in his \nregular New York Times column, Abroad at Home. He properly warns us \nthat the cause of the injustice to Beatrice Braude and other loyalty \nvictims--secret proceedings--is not ancient history. The anti-terrorism \nbill had a provision to allow for the deportation of aliens on secret \nevidence. It was stripped, fortunately, during floor consideration in \nthe House. But the provision is likely to reappear in some fashion. We \nmust remain vigilant.\n  Now that the parties to the Braude case have reached an agreement on \nthe monetary damages equitably due to Dr. Braude's estate, Senator \nD'Amato and I will be offering legislation soon to release the $200,000 \nto her estate. When that time comes, I hope that we will have the \nunqualified and unanimous support of our colleagues.\n  Ann Kirchheimer, a friend--now 80--who carried on Dr. Braude's fight, \nrecently commented that Dr. Braude's life following her dismissal from \nthe USIA could have been taken from the opening lines of Franz Kafka's \nbook, The Trial: ``Someone must have traduced Joseph K., for without \nhaving done anything wrong, he was arrested one fine morning.'' Indeed.\n  What happened to Dr. Braude was a personal tragedy. But it was also \npart of a national tragedy, too. This nation lost, prematurely and \nunnecessarily, the exceptional services of a gifted and dedicated \npublic servant. Stanley I. Kutler, a professor of constitutional \nhistory at the University of Wisconsin, estimates that Dr. Braude was \none of about 1,500 Federal employees who were dismissed as security \nrisks between 1953 and 1956. Another 6,000 resigned under the pressure \nof security and loyalty inquiries, according to Professor Kutler, who \ntestified as an expert witness on Dr. Braude's behalf last November. It \nwas, as I said earlier, an awful time. We had settled ``as on a \ndarkling plain, Swept with confused alarm of struggle and flight, Where \nignorant armies clash by night.'' It mustn't happen again.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article appearing in the June 17, \n1996, issue of the Washington Post, ``$200,000 Repayment Agreement for \nEstate of McCarthy-Era Victim'', Mr. Lewis's March 15, 1996 column, \n``Secrecy and Justice,'' from the New York Times, and a letter dated \nJune 19, 1996 from Mr. Sipes to my legislative director, Gray Maxwell, \nbe printed in the Congressional Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 17, 1996]\n\n     $200,000 Repayment Agreement for Estate of McCarthy-Era Victim\n\n       The estate of Beatrice ``Bibi'' Braude, who was fired from \n     the U.S. Information Agency and blacklisted 43 years ago \n     during a spasm of anti-communist zealotry, should be paid \n     $200,000, according to an agreement between the U.S. \n     government and attorneys for her estate.\n       Funding the settlement is up to Congress.\n       Braude fought for decades to clear her name after her \n     firing in 1953. By the time she was in her seventies, she \n     seemingly had exhausted all court remedies. After her death \n     nearly nine years ago, her friends and relatives took up her \n     cause and persuaded Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) \n     and Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) to sponsor legislation that \n     mandated review of the case by the U.S. Court of Federal \n     Claims.\n       Attorneys for the Justice Department argued earlier this \n     year that there was insufficient proof that loyalty concerns \n     prevented Braude from being rehired for decades. The reason \n     might have been, they argued, because she was a woman and in \n     her forties. Judge Roger B. Andewelt disagreed, saying Braude \n     was a loyal American persecuted ``during a dark era in \n     American history.''\n       He ordered the Justice Department to negotiate an amount to \n     pay Braude's estate. Christopher Sipes, of the law firm of \n     Covington & Burling, who handled the case without a fee, said \n     lawyers considered what Braude would have earned during the \n     period of her blacklisting. The case, Sipes said, represents \n     a rare acknowledgment of the wrongs committed by the \n     government during the era associated with Sen. Joseph R. \n     McCarthy.\n       Braude's niece, Ericka, responding to the agreement, said \n     she was nearly speechless. ``It's unbelievable,'' she said, \n     ``and it's about time.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 15, 1996]\n\n                  Abroad at Home; Secrecy and Justice\n\n                           (By Anthony Lewis)\n\n       The case before him, the judge said, ``harks back to a dark \n     era in American history when Senator Joseph R. McCarthy was a \n     powerful political force in this nation, when promising \n     careers in the public and private sectors were arbitrarily \n     cut short based on innuendo, unsubstantiated allegations and \n     irrational fears. . . .''\n       That was the opening sentence of a remarkable opinion by \n     Judge Roger B. Andewelt of the United States Court of Federal \n     Claims. It told a story of long ago, but one with a moral for \n     today.\n       Beatrice Braude came to Washington to work for the \n     Government during World War II. She had college and graduate \n     degrees, and she won lots of praise at work. In 1951 she went \n     to the new United States Information Agency. On Dec. 30, \n     1953, she was told she was going to get a pay raise. The next \n     day she was fired.\n       Why? They told her that Congress had cut the U.S.I.A. \n     budget. But when she applied for other government jobs over \n     the next several years, she got nowhere. She was even turned \n     down for a position as a typist, although she had a perfect \n     score on the Civil Service typing exam.\n       Ms. Braude went on to other work. She got a Ph.D. and was a \n     tenured teacher at the University of Massachusetts. But she \n     never again felt the exhilaration she had in government \n     service, and her exclusion from it was a troubling mystery.\n       Then, when the Privacy Act became law in 1974, she got her \n     records from the Government. They showed she had been fired \n     as a security risk.\n       She had been investigated by the State Department Loyalty \n     Board in 1951 because of casual past associations with two \n     people considered suspect. The board cleared her, finding \n     that there was ``no reasonable doubt'' as to her loyalty. But \n     the U.S.I.A., on the same evidence, decided to fire her--and \n     to conceal the reason.\n       Mr. Braude sued, but the courts held that she was too late. \n     In 1982 she finally went back to work for the Government--as \n     a language instructor at the C.I.A. She died in 1988.\n       But her family, still angry at what had happened, persuaded \n     Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alfonse D'Amato to \n     sponsor a bill to compensate her for any wrongdoing. It was \n     referred to the Court of Claims for a finding on whether she \n     had a claim in law or equity.\n       Judge Andewelt said there was no basis for saying that Ms. \n     Braude ``was a security risk or was sympathetic to any \n     political philosophy not within the mainstream.'' Indeed, he \n     said, the record showed her to be ``a rather typical \n     American. She cared about others deeply and was loyal to \n     her friends, family and country.''\n       The judge found that the U.S.I.A. had ``intentionally \n     concealed'' the reason for her dismissal and had \n     ``blacklisted'' her thereafter. That was wrongdoing, he said, \n     and gave Ms. Braude's heirs an equitable claim. The lawyers \n     will work out the amount due, and the court will send that to \n     Congress for action.\n       So, 43 years she was fired, 8 years after she died, \n     Beatrice Braude got a kind of justice. I asked her lawyer, \n     Christopher N. Sipes of Washington, why the effort on her \n     behalf had been so persistent.\n       ``She was happy,'' he said, ``she served her country--and \n     in a flash it was gone. In time, bewilderment turned to anger \n     and frustration. She had friends and family who cared so much \n     that they had the same burning desire to see justice done.''\n       It would be nice to think that the cause of the injustice \n     to Beatrice Braude and other loyalty victims--secret \n     proceedings--is ancient history. But it is not.\n       The Clinton Administration has pressed for a so-called \n     antiterrorism bill allowing the deportation of aliens on \n     secret evidence. An unusual combination of civil libertarians \n     on the right and left has just deleted that and other \n     dangerous sections from the legislation. But the same \n     proposals will be back on the floor next week as part of an \n     immigration bill.\n       The National Rifle Association, in its criticism of the \n     antiterrorism bill, made the case as well as anyone. ``The \n     constitutional right to confront one's accusers is a \n     necessary safeguard against government abuses,'' it said. \n     ``Our nation has survived for 200 years without resorting to \n     the use of secret evidence in criminal trials or deportation \n     proceedings. Congress must not set a dangerous precedent by \n     abandoning the right to confront evidence against you.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n     Re Estate of Beatrice Braude v. United States; Congressional \n         Reference No. 93-645x.\n\n\n                                          Covington & Burling,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1996.\n     Gray Maxwell,\n     Legislative Director,\n     Hon. Daniel P. Moynihan,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Mr. Maxwell: It was a pleasure speaking with you \n     yesterday. As we discussed, I am writing now to update you on \n     the status of Dr. Braude's case. As you may\n\n[[Page S6512]]\n\n     recall, on March 7, 1996, Judge Andewelt of the Court of \n     Federal Claims ruled that Dr. Braude had been blacklisted by \n     the Federal Government during the 1950s and 1960s on the \n     basis of spurious allegations of disloyalty and that her \n     state therefore had an equitable claim for compensation from \n     the United States for the wrongs she suffered.\n       In its opinion, the court left open the amount of \n     compensation due. Following negotiations with the Justice \n     Department, the parties stipulated to $200,000 as the \n     appropriate amount of compensation. On June 3, 1996, Judge \n     Andewelt issued his final report, ``recommend[ing] to \n     Congress that plaintiff's equitably entitled to $200,000 from \n     the United States .'' For your convenience, I have attached \n     copies of the March 7 and June 3 rulings.\n       The next, and final, step in the Congressional Reference \n     regarding Dr. Braude's case is submission of the final report \n     issued by Judge Andewelt to a review panel composed of three \n     judges of the Court of Federal Claims. See 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2509(d). This review should complete the Congressional \n     Reference and result in transmission of a final report on Dr. \n     Braude's case back to the Senate. See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2509(e).\n       It is unclear how long the review panel will take with Dr. \n     Braude's case. However, both the Justice Department and \n     plaintiff have submitted a notice of acceptance of the \n     hearing officer's report, and therefore neither party is \n     seeking review or otherwise raising any objections or issues \n     for the review panel to address. It is our hope that, in the \n     light of both parties' acceptance of Judge Andewelt's report, \n     that report will be adopted by the review panel expeditiously \n     and without modification. It is thus our hope that the Senate \n     will shortly be receiving a final report on Dr. Braude's case \n     indicating that she is equitably due $200,000 as a result of \n     her wrongful blacklisting from government employment.\n       It is our understanding that payment of Dr. Braude's claim \n     requires an appropriation from Congress. (In the alternative, \n     it may be possible, if funds are already available, for her \n     claim to be paid pursuant to a directive of Congress). For \n     this reason, we urge you to discuss her case, and Judge \n     Andewelt's favorite report, with members of the \n     Appropriations Committee, and, more specifically, with the \n     Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and State. We understand \n     that the Subcommittee has not yet scheduled a mark-up of its \n     FY 1997 Appropriations Bill. We would be happy to accompany \n     you to any meeting with the Staff and urge you to request \n     that the Subcommittee bill include funding for Dr. Braude's \n     claim.\n       Thank you again for your interest and assistance in this \n     matter. Please feel free to call me or Joan Kutcher if we can \n     be of any further assistance in this matter.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Christopher Sipes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/19/senate-section/article/S6509-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. \nThe data is undeniable: individuals from strong families contribute to \nthe society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today \nwill see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both \ninstructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment \nof ``till death us do part'' seriously, demonstrating successfully the \ntimeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics \nmake our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Mr. Gene and Mrs. \nVieta Ragsdale of Marshfield, MO, who on July 13, 1996, will celebrate \ntheir 50th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to \nthe day we can celebrate a similar milestone. Gene and Vieta's \ncommitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to \nbe saluted and recognized. I wish them and their family all the best as \nthey celebrate this substantial marker on their journey together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/19/senate-section/article/S6512-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              EARL VARNEY\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a most wonderful \nman and a dear friend of mine, Earl Varney. Earl Varney, a World War I \nArmy veteran, will be honored by the community of Worland, WY, on \nMilitary Day, June 29, 1996. Earl will have celebrated his 100th \nbirthday by that day! He is the oldest living veteran of that conflict \nnow residing in Washakie County and quite possibly in the State of \nWyoming.\n  Earl is absolutely an extraordinarily dazzling man. He is Wyoming's \nanswer to George burns! He has all of the energy, graciousness, wit and \ngood humor and civility of George Burns himself--and especially the \nwit! His good humor reminds me of the old adage that my Mother, who \nEarl knew well, used to share with me--``Humor is the universal solvent \nagainst the abrasive elements of life.''\n  My dear father, Milward Simpson, also loved Earl Varney. They used to \nhave a helluva lot of fun together. They were contemporaries in every \nsense. They were veterans of World War I, great friends and business \nassociates. They also worked together in the American Legion. They had \na shared and splendid lifetime of friendship and memories and love and \naffection. When my Dad died at the age of 95, Earl was one of the first \nto respond to offer his condolences.\n  In addition to personally knowing my parents and grandparents, Earl \nknew the parents and grandparents of my dear wife, Ann. He was at her \nparents' wedding. He is such a thoughtful and kind man, too, as he \nalways remembers others and the memorable dates and times in their \nlives.\n  Earl served this Nation proudly in the final months of World War I \nbefore the Armistice. His dates of service were September 18, 1918 to \nNovember 26, 1918. He achieved the rank of Corporal. Not only did Earl \ngive to the Nation in uniform, he has also been a great contributor to \nthe good of the entire State of Wyoming. He was born in Ansley, \nNebraska on June 14, 1896 but he went on to become a true Wyomingite. \nAfter release from the Army in 1918, Earl moved to Thermopolis, WY, and \nworked as a pharmacist in the local drug store where he first met my \nwife's father, Ivan Schroll. His other professions over the years \nincluded managing a finance and insurance office in Greybull, Wyoming, \nowning the Varney Motors Ford dealership in Worland, WY, and operating \nthe Worland Oil Corporations-Mobil Bulkplant and Service Stations. He \nalso worked in real estate. Earl didn't really embark on any kind of a \nretirement program until he reached his mid 80's!!\n  We are so very fortunate to have Earl living among us in Wyoming. \nEarl is one of those special people that make up the core and fiber of \nthe State--one of nature's nobleman. I cherish the years I have been \nthe beneficiary of his counsel and friendship. My life is richer \nbecause of him. Those of us who know him so well think of him always as \na rock solid citizen and a man who is authentic, honest and sincere--a \nman whose word is his bond. I know the proud community of Worland, WY, \nwill be making June 29 a very special day for this good and dear man--\nEarl Varney. He so richly deserves it. God bless him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/19/senate-section/article/S6512-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6512-S6513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REPUBLICANS STAND FOR CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I would like to address a subject \nthat has received much attention during the last several weeks--the \nfuture of our children.\n  As a father myself, I share the concerns of the many who recently \nmarched on The Mall this month at the Stand for Children rally. \nCertainly, parents, families, teachers, and community leaders all agree \nthat children should be protected and nurtured. This is a universal \nsentiment. We all stand for children. Every child deserves a safe and \nloving environment, adequate nutrition and a full education.\n  Child poverty and its related problems, such as hunger, certainly \ndeserve our attention. Child poverty is an especially pressing problem \nin South Dakota, where unemployment in some areas reaches as high as 85 \npercent. According to the Annie E. Casey Foundation, 17 percent of all \nSouth Dakota children live in poverty, compared to 21 percent \nnationwide. Federal programs are designed to address these issues and \nmany states like South Dakota are doing an admirable job. Child poverty \nhas dropped 3 percent in my State since 1985.\n  Looking out for the best interests of children is not a partisan \nissue. The budgets passed in Congress demonstrate that we are \nprotecting children. Child nutrition programs received an increase in \nthis fiscal year--\n\n[[Page S6513]]\n\nthe National School Lunch program was increased by $173 million, the \nSchool Breakfast program by $107 million, the Women, Infants and \nChildren program by $260 million. Head Start also was increased by $36 \nmillion. These increases mean that hundreds of additional children in \nSouth Dakota will receive the sustenance they need. The increases in \nschool-based nutrition programs are especially beneficial. They allow \nchildren to concentrate on what is really important--learning. Clearly, \nCongress is making good on its commitment to the youngest and most \nvulnerable in our society.\n  The single greatest issue affecting our children's future though, is \nthe Federal budget. Our $5 trillion debt threatens the quality of life \nof future generations on many fronts. Skyrocketing interest payments on \nour national debt will continue to squeeze out funding for other \nlegitimate Federal programs, such as child care or foster care. We must \ntake immediate action to control deficit spending to preserve our \nschool lunch or Title I programs for future generations.\n  Budget deficits darken our children's economic future as well. We \nneed a balanced budget to lower interest rates, spur economic \ndevelopment and create jobs. Lower interest rates will make a college \neducation and a first home more affordable.\n  I was very disappointed that liberals in the Senate once again \nrejected the Balanced Budget Amendment. This is a moral issue. A \nbalanced budget represents real hope and opportunity for all Americans. \nI continuously have supported a balanced budget, as well as a Balanced \nBudget Amendment to the Constitution. Our $5 trillion debt burden is an \nalbatross that our children will be forced to carry. Having just \ncelebrated Father's Day, I would like to give my daughter, and all \nother children, the gift of freedom from our national debt.\n  Balancing the budget, preserving programs like school lunch and Head \nStart, providing real hope and opportunity for future generations--\nthat's how we can stand for children. All are not mutually exclusive \ngoals. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the months ahead \nto ensure that we in Congress demonstrate a strong, bipartisan \ncommitment to children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/19/senate-section/article/S6512-4", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a treaty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/19/senate-section/article/S6513-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:45 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2803.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Georgia; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                        ``Senate Resolution 288\n\n       ``Whereas, it is estimated 37 million Americans are without \n     health insurance, many while between jobs, and more are \n     underinsured because of the effects of rising health care \n     costs and spending. The costs of health care are escalating, \n     forcing employers to trim the level and availability of \n     health care benefits to their employees; and\n       ``Whereas, overutilization of health care services for \n     relatively small claims is one of the most significant causes \n     of health care cost and spending increases. Currently, more \n     than two-thirds of all insurance claims for medical spending \n     are less than $3,000.00 per family per year in this country; \n     and\n       ``Whereas, in response to the runaway cost increases on \n     health care spending in this country, the private sector has \n     developed the concept of medical savings accounts. This \n     initiative is designed to ensure health insurance \n     availability for Americans. It is predicated on providing \n     incentives to eliminate unnecessary medical treatment and \n     encourage competition in seeking health care; and\n       ``Whereas, through employer-funded medical savings account \n     arrangements and reduced cost qualified higher deductible \n     insurance policies, millions of Americans could insure \n     themselves for both routine and major medical services. Under \n     the concept of medical savings accounts, an employer \n     currently providing employee health care benefits would \n     purchase instead a low-cost, high deductible major medical \n     policy on each employee. The employer may then set aside the \n     saving premium differential in a medical savings account \n     arrangement. The participating employees would use the money \n     in the account to pay their medical care expenses up to the \n     deductible. However, any account money unspent by the \n     participating employees in a plan year would then belong to \n     the employees to save, spend on medical care, or use \n     otherwise. This would be a strong incentive for people not to \n     abuse health expenditures and to institute ``cost-shopping'' \n     for medical care services; and\n       ``Whereas, by setting aside money for employees to spend on \n     health care, employees could change jobs and use the money \n     they had so far earned to buy interim health insurance or to \n     cover health care expenses thereby eliminating the problems \n     of uninsureds between jobs and helping to reduce ``job-\n     lock''; and\n       ``Whereas, by making medical care decisions the employee's \n     prerogative, individual policyholders have a strong stake in \n     reducing costs. This simple financial mechanism will expand \n     health insurance options to others who presently have no \n     insurance. Most importantly, this move to decrease health \n     care cost burdens in this country would require no new \n     federal bureaucracy and would be revenue neutral to \n     employers; Now, therefore, be it\n       ``Resolved by the Senate, That the members of this body \n     encourage the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation swiftly and in good faith to enable Americans to \n     establish medical savings accounts; be it further\n       ``Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate is authorized \n     and directed to transmit an appropriate copy of this \n     resolution to the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and all members of \n     the Georgia congressional delegation.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-601.

A bill to limit the liability of certain nonprofit \norganizations that are providers of prosthetic devices, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 the prosthetic limb access act of 1996\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, a few years ago I became exposed to a \nproblem that exists in the lives of thousands of Americans. It happened \nwhen one of my closet friends in Oklahoma, Buddy Martin; lost both of \nhis legs.\n  He was one of the fortunate ones who had the resources to purchase \nartificial limbs, and is able to live today a much more normal life \nthan one could imagine.\n  It is because of this exposure that I rise today to introduce a bill \nto provide relief to thousands of Americans. Everyday far too many \nAmericans are unable to live full and productive lives like Buddy \nMartin because they cannot afford adequate prosthetic care. There are \nover 250,000 Americans who cannot afford adequate prosthetic care. \nWhile the government provides assistance through Medicare and other \nprograms they can not meet all of the needs, and they don't have to. \nThe private sector\n\n[[Page S6518]]\n\nstands ready to help, through nonprofit foundations, but they cannot \nbecause of our country's product liability laws. That is why I am \nintroducing the Prosthetic Limb Access Act of 1996, I am joined by my \ncolleagues Senators Faircloth, Grams, Abraham, and Helms.\n  In Oklahoma, a nonprofit foundation called Limbs for Life takes used \nartificial limbs, reconditions them, and provides them to needy people \nin third world countries, they do not give them to Americans. It is not \nbecause there is not the need, they do not provide them because of our \ncountry's laws regarding product liability. They would be unable to \nafford the necessary insurance to provide the limbs to needy Americans. \nOne doctor in Oklahoma, Dr. John Sabolich, the Nation's foremost \nprosthesis expert, currently saws used devices in half before throwing \nthem away, because of liability. He showed me a $50,000 prosthetic arm \nthat was about to be destroyed; to make it reusable would only have \nrequired about 20 minutes of work. It is a disgrace that perfectly good \nartificial limbs have to be destroyed when there are thousands of \nAmericans who could use them.\n  My bill would provide the necessary product liability relief, while \nstill protecting the patients by providing relief for intentional \nwrongdoing. This would allow hundreds of Americans to care for \nthemselves, work, and better enjoy a more full life.\n  There are over 3,000 new amputations each week, which amounts to \n160,000 amputations each year, for a grand total of 3.8 million \namputees in the United States. The number of new amputees has increased \nover the years because of the early detection of cancer, doctors are \nable to detect cancer earlier and it is better to sacrifice a limb to \nsave a person. Therefore the demand for more limbs by needy people will \nonly increase. I have been told that if this bill is enacted that at \nleast 2,000 limbs per year could be made available for needy Americans. \nThese are 2,000 people who otherwise would not have access to an \nartificial arm or leg. These are 2,000 people who are currently not \nliving full and productive lives, who need assistance to care for \nthemselves, sometimes to just accomplish tasks that we all take for \ngranted such as eating, moving around, or even working.\n\n  I have met many of these people who would benefit from this \nlegislation and have listened to their heartbreaking stories. And for \neveryone I've heard of there are hundreds more who go daily without a \nprosthetic device, depending on others.\n  There is Nestor, a man who is missing both arms. He states:\n\n       My prosthesis is broken and I am unable to eat or do any \n     activities of daily living such as personal care or cooking. \n     I live alone and have no friends to help, so I must do things \n     for myself.\n\n  There is Pearl, a 46-year-old woman with one leg missing, who lives \nin a nursing home. She said:\n\n       I slip and fall so often when my crutches slip away from \n     me--and it hurts a lot when my wrist or neck or other body \n     parts are throbbing with pain for weeks due to my falls--and \n     although I try to be careful and watchful, the crutches still \n     can slip away from me when encountering the mopped floors or \n     wet spots that are in a nursing home.\n\n  There is Dalia, she was fitted with her current prosthesis in 1983, \nbut since then her body has changed and it no longer fits properly. She \nsays:\n\n       When I changed prosthesis, my whole body changed, my \n     balance is off especially effecting my back. I have fallen \n     down, have worsening osteoporosis and am very frustrated \n     because I can't do the things I used to do.\n\n  Mr. President, I know these are sad stories, and I know we as Members \nrun across sad stories every day. But here we can do something positive \nfor them, which will solve their problems, at no cost to the taxpayers. \nWe can provide them the same medical services we are now giving poor \npeople in third world countries, and we can do this through the \nnonprofit sector. We have needy people and a willing organization ready \nto help. Mr. President, we should at least treat our own citizens as \nwell as we treat those in other countries.\n  Mr. President, my legislation is supported not only by the Limbs for \nLife Foundation, but also: Goodwill Industries, National Amputee Fund, \nNational Association for the Advancement of Orthotics and Prosthetics, \nAmerican Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and the \nAmerican Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.\n  Mr. President, this is a simple bill which would create major relief \nfor a number of needy people. It is not a broad product liability bill, \nso therefore it should not draw the opposition that other bills have \nreceived this Congress. It corrects a small problem that literally \nmeans the world for a large group of disabled Americans. I hope we can \nmove this bill forward this year.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FRIST:\n  S. 1886. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe treatment of educational grants by private foundations, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     educational grants legislation\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I introduce a bill which is \nessential in building a higher educated and more productive labor force \nas we move toward the next century. My bill would encourage private \nfoundations to increase the amounts they currently provide for \neducational assistance to students in their communities.\n  Currently, guidelines developed by the Internal Revenue Service can \nhave the effect of prohibiting certain foundations from being able to \nprovide the maximum amount of educational assistance to local students. \nAs the Federal Government faces greater and greater fiscal constraints, \nwe must look for ways to encourage the private sector to fill unmet \neducational needs.\n  Essentially, under current law, a private foundation will not suffer \ntax penalties if it meets certain tests when providing scholarships or \neducational loans to employees, or children of employees, of a \nparticular employer. While there is a facts and circumstances test \nwhich can be met, uncertainty surrounding application of this test to \nan employer-related grant program results in much greater usage of a \nsafe-harbor percentage test which has been developed by the Internal \nRevenue Service. This safe-harbor percentage test basically limits the \namount of scholarships and loans that a foundation may provide to one \nout of four applicable children of employees of a particular company. \nThis 25-percent test can cause hardship, especially in cases where a \nsubstantial percentage of the community at large works for a single \nemployer.\n  My proposal eliminates this rigid 25-percent test.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this essential \neducation bill. By providing these private foundations relief from the \nIRS' rigid 25-percent test, we will be granting valuable and badly \nneeded educational support to America's hard-working families.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Heflin):\n  S. 1887.

Mr. President, I am introducing for myself, \nSenator Hatch, and Senator Heflin, a bill entitled ``The Federal Courts \nImprovements Act of 1996.'' A first version of the bill, S. 1101, was \nintroduced in August 1995, at the request of the Judicial Conference. \nIn October of last year, we held a comprehensive hearing on that bill \nin the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \nCourts, which I chair, at which both judges and lawyers testified at \nlength on the substance of many of S. 1101's provisions. The present \nbill was crafted after many months of detailed discussions and intense \ncollaboration between myself, Senators Hatch and Heflin, and the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts. More importantly, we have \nworked closely with the other members of the subcommittee to address \ntheir concerns and include their suggestions, making this truly a \nbipartisan bill.\n  At the onset, I would like to elaborate on the spirit in which this \nbill was crafted. I am sure my colleagues are well aware, many of my \nefforts have focused on saving the Federal Government's sparse \nresources and making the most of taxpayer dollars. As chairman of the \nJudiciary Subcommittee with jurisdiction over the courts, I am also \nconcerned that the Federal judicial system be administered in the\n\n[[Page S6519]]\n\nmost efficient and cost-effective manner possible, while maintaining a \nhigh level of quality in the administration of justice. In fact, I sent \nout a judicial questionnaire earlier this year requesting assistance \nfrom individual judges on their ideas and views of the needs of the \nFederal judiciary. I hope some of you have had the opportunity to \nreview my subcommittee's report on the courts of appeal, which I \nreleased recently. The report on the District courts will be completed \nshortly. I found it enlightening to communicate with the individual \njudges, and hope that these lines of candid and constructive \ncommunication with the individual judges and the Administrative Office \nremain open and continue to produce beneficial results in terms of \nefficiency, cost savings, and other improvements within the Federal \njudiciary.\n  In drafting the Federal Courts Improvement bill, we worked closely \nwith the Administrative Office to assess and address the needs of the \nFederal judiciary. As a result, the bill contains both technical and \nsubstantive changes in the law, many of which were carried over from \nprevious Congresses and-or originally proposed in S. 1101. During our \nworking sessions on the bill, some of the provisions in S. 1101, such \nas the sections dealing with Federal Defender Services matters, were \ndetermined to warrant further inquiry or additional hearings. On the \nwhole, the bill is broad-reaching, and contains provisions concerning \njudicial process improvements; judiciary personnel administration, \nbenefits and protections; judicial financial administration; Federal \nCourts Study Committee recommendations; and other miscellaneous issues. \nAlmost all of the provisions have been formally endorsed by the \nJudicial Conference, the governing body of the Federal courts. I would \nnow like to mention some of the more salient provisions of the bill.\n  Many provisions contained in this bill streamline the operation of \nthe Federal court system. A good example of our attempt to render the \njudiciary more efficient is section 605, which abolishes a special \ntribunal with narrow jurisdiction, the Special Court, the Regional \nRail Reorganization Act of 1973, established in the early 1970's to \noversee the reorganization of insolvent railroads. The work of this \ncourt is basically concluded, with the court's docket containing 10 \nlargely inactive cases. This section transfers the Special Court's \njurisdiction over those cases and any future rail reorganization \nproceedings to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, \nwhere the court's records and a majority of its judges are currently \nlocated, and makes other technical and conforming changes incidental to \nthe court's abolition. The elimination of this court will produce \nbudgetary and administrative economies and, according to the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts, result in an annual cost \nsavings of approximately $175,000.\n\n  Section 209 simplifies the appeal route in civil cases decided by \nmagistrate judges with consent by confining appeals of judgments in \nsuch cases to the court of appeals and eliminating an alternative route \nof appeal to the district judge. A single forum of appeal in civil \nconsent cases simplifies court procedures and recognizes the existing \npractice in most districts. The Judicial Conference recommended such \naction in the long range plan for the Federal courts. Also, this \nsection would not alter the role of magistrate judges as adjuncts to \narticle III courts since district judges would still control the \nreferral of consent cases to magistrate judges.\n  Section 304 changes the reappointment procedure for incumbent \nbankruptcy judges. Rather than requiring the judicial council for a \ncircuit or a merit selection panel to undergo a lengthy and time-\nconsuming screening process, this section streamlines the reappointment \nprocess for judges whose performance has previously been reviewed. In \nthis manner, the section eliminates unnecessary expenditures of time \nand money.\n  Another example is section 202, which authorizes magistrate judges to \ntry all petty offense cases. Traditionally, safeguards applicable to \ncriminal defendants charged with more serious crimes have not been \napplicable to petty offense cases because the burdens were deemed \nundesirable and impractical in dealing with such minor misconduct. \nSection 202 also authorizes magistrate judges to try misdemeanor cases \nupon either written consent or oral consent of the defendant on the \nrecord. This amendment enhances the efficiency of the courts, since \nmost defendants routinely consent to proceeding before the Federal \nmagistrate judge system. Presently, consent to trial of misdemeanor \ncases by magistrate judges is required to be in writing, although there \nis no legal significance between written consent and consent made \norally on the record, provided that the defendant's consent is made \nwith full knowledge of the consequences of such consent, is \nintelligently given, and is voluntary. Elimination of the written-\nconsent requirement saves time and eases burdensome paperwork for court \npersonnel, while preserving knowing and voluntary consent in such \ncases.\n  Additional sections that facilitate judicial operations are sections \n201 and 205. Section 201 authorizes magistrate judges temporarily \nassigned to another judicial district because of an emergency to \ndispose of civil cases with the consent of the parties. Section 205 \nclarifies that deputy clerks may act whenever the clerk is unable to \nperform official duties for any reason, and permits the court to \ndesignate an acting clerk of the court, when it is expected that the \nclerk will be unavailable or the office of clerk will be vacant for a \nprolonged period.\n  Provisions in this bill also clarify existing law to better fulfill \nCongress' original intent. For example, section 208 enables the United \nStates to obtain a Federal forum in which to defend suits against \nFederal officers and agencies when those suits involve Federal \ndefenses. This section would legislatively reverse the Supreme Court's \ndecision in International Primate Protection League, et al. v. \nAdministrators of Tulane Educational Fund, et al., 111 S.Ct. 1700 \n(1991), which held that only Federal officers, and not Federal \nagencies, may remove State court actions to Federal court pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. 1442(a)(1). The section would also reverse at least three \nother Federal district court decisions which held that Federal officers \nsued exclusively in their official capacities cannot remove State court \nactions to Federal court. The result of these decisions has been that \nFederal agencies have had to defend themselves in State court, despite \nimportant and complex Federal issues such as preemption and sovereign \nimmunity. Section 208 fulfills Congress' intent that questions \nconcerning the exercise of Federal authority, as well as the scope of \nFederal immunity and Federal-State conflicts, be adjudicated in Federal \ncourt. It also clarifies that suits against Federal agencies, as well \nas those against Federal officers sued in either an individual or \nofficial capacity, may be removed to Federal district court. More \nimportantly, this section does not alter the requirement that a Federal \nlaw defense be alleged for a suit to be removable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \nSec. 1442(a)(1).\n  Another example is section 503, which repeals a provision in a 1981 \ncontinuing appropriation resolution barring annual cost-of-living \nadjustments in pay for Federal judges except as specifically authorized \nby Congress. Repeal of section 140 restores the operation of 28 U.S.C. \nSec. 461 as to article III judges and parity with the other two \nbranches of Government, as enacted by the Federal Salary Cost-of-Living \nAdjustment Act of 1975 and amended by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989.\n  Several sections improve the judicial court system in other ways. \nSection 206 amends section 1332 of title 28 relating to diversity \njurisdiction to raise the jurisdictional amount in diversity cases from \n$50,000 to $75,000. The purpose of this amendment is to supplement the \nincrease of the jurisdictional amount from $10,000 to $50,000 in the \n100th Congress by a modest upward adjustment to $75,000. Section 210 \nrequires each Judicial Council to submit an annual report to the \nAdministrative Office of the United States Courts on the number and \nnature of orders relating to judicial misconduct or disability under \nsection 332 of title 28 of the United States Code. This reporting \nrequirement was recommended by the Report of the National Commission on \nJudicial Discipline and Removal of August 1993, which found that \nreliable information concerning council orders was difficult to obtain.\n\n[[Page S6520]]\n\n  In addition, section 608 extends by 6 months the due date of the \nCivil Justice Reform Act reports on the demonstration and pilot \nprograms. The bill at section 609 also extends the authorization of \nappropriations by 1 year of the use of arbitration by district courts \nunder 28 U.S.C. Sec. 651. This will give us more time, if needed, to \nconsider how we will implement permanently alternative dispute \nresolution in the courts.\n  In conclusion, this bill is the result of careful consideration by \nmembers of the subcommittee and their staff, in close collaboration \nwith the Administrative Office, who have all worked long and hard in \nattempting to produce a strong, bipartisan piece of legislation. I am \npleased to say that the legislation we are introducing today not only \nenhances and improves the operation of the Federal judiciary, but also \ntakes into consideration any potential increase in costs to the Federal \nbudget.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 1889. A bill to authorize the exchange of certain lands conveyed \nto the Kenai Native Association pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act, to make adjustments to the National Wilderness System, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                THE KENAI NATIVE ASSOCIATION EQUITY ACT\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce the Kenai \nNative Association Equity Act. This legislation will correct a \nsignificant inequity in Federal law with respect to lands conveyed to \nthe Kenai Natives Association [KNA] under the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act [ANCSA]. This legislation, which will mark the final \noutcome of a process begun nearly 14 years ago.\n  The legislation directs the completion of a land exchange and \nacquisition package between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service [USFWS] \nand KNA. The legislation will allow KNA, for the first time, to make \neconomic use of lands conveyed them under ANSCA. The final stage of \nthis process began by directing in Public Law 102-458, a land exchange \nand acquisition package between the USFWS and KNA. Over the past year, \nnegotiations were completed, resulting in the legislation I am \nintroducing today.\n  Mr. President, unlike other corporations in ANCSA, KNA, as an urban \ncorporation, was not entitled to receive monetary settlement or \nadditional lands than those granted under ANCSA. KNA ultimately \nselected 19,000 of its 23,040 entitlement within what later became the \nKenai National Wildlife Refuge. KNA lands are located between operating \noilfields within the refuge to the North and urban and suburban \ndevelopments to the South.\n  At the request of the USFWS, KNA officials chose lands along the \nboundaries of the refuge so that development would be allowed. \nNotwithstanding the representation that development would be allowed, \nthe USFWS advised KNA after selections were made that use of the \nproperty would be severely restricted by the application of section \n22(g) of ANCSA.\n  Section 22(g) requires that all uses of private inholdings within the \nrefuge comply with the laws and regulations applicable to the public \nlands within a refuge and that those lands be managed consistent with \nthe purpose for which the refuge was established. Section 22(g) has \nbeen an ongoing problem in Alaska as it has significantly limited the \neconomic use of private lands within refuges.\n  Pursuant to agreements between USFWS and KNA, this legislation will \nallow USFWS to acquire three small parcels of land and KNA's remaining \nANCSA entitlement at appraised value. These parcels include: Stephanka \nTract, 803 acres on the Kenai River; Moose River Patented Tract, 1,243 \nacres; Moose River Selected Tract, 753 acres; and Remaining \nEntitlement, 454 acres.\n  The total habitat acquisition of 2,253 acres will be purchased with \nExxon Valdez oilspill funds at a cost of $4,443,000. Therefore, there \nwould be no cost to the Federal Government for the purchase of these \nlands. Refuge boundaries would be adjusted to remove 15,500 acres of \nKNA lands from the refuge, thus resolving the 22(g) conflict. This can \nbe done because, although the property is within the refuge--it does \nnot belong to the Federal Government. KNA would also receive the refuge \nheadquarters site in downtown Kenai which consists of a building and a \n5-acre parcel.\n  Under the terms of this agreement, the USFWS has proposed, in order \nto maintain equivalent natural resource protection for Federal \nresources, that Congress designate the Lake Todatonten area, \napproximately 37,000 acres, as a BLM Special Management Area [SMA]. The \nlake is adjacent to the Kanuti National Wildlife Refuge. The SMA would \nbe subject to subsistence preferences under ANILCA and to valid \nexisting rights. While I support the intent of this provision I do \nintend on exploring its implications on land use closely during Senate \nhearings before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Kenai Native Association has waited long \nenough to resolve these issues. It is my intention to move this \nlegislation quickly and get it behind us.\n       By Mr. FAIRCLOTH (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n     Biden, Mr. Lott, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Byrd, Mr. \n     Warner, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Heflin, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. \n     Johnston, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Frist, Ms. Moseley-\n     Braun, Mr. Levin, Mr. Simon, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Reid, Mr. \n     Dodd, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n     Bradley, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n     Wyden, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Coverdell and Mr. Pryor):\n\n  S. 1890. A bill to increase Federal protection against arson and \nother destruction of places of religious worship.\n\n\n                THE CHURCH ARSON PROTECTION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Senator Kennedy and I stand here today united in our \nbelief that the rash of church arson must end and now. If we in \nCongress cannot agree that church burning is a despicable crime, what \ncan we agree upon? It is not a matter of liberals, conservatives, \nblacks, or whites. It is about justice, faith, and right and wrong. \nFive of these churches--sadly, including a recent one on last Sunday \nnight--were located in my home State of North Carolina.\n  I have every confidence that local law enforcement in my State can \nsolve these crimes, but there is a real possibility that persons from \noutside of my State and other States may have set the fires, and that \nis the need for this bill and for Federal law enforcement assistance \nand a Federal statute. We have taken too long as a nation to react to \nthis tragedy.\n  I do not know why the response has been so slow, nor do I fully \nunderstand if these crimes were the acts of conspirators or copycats.\n  What I do know is that we are sending a clear message today to anyone \nwho is thinking about burning a church, that the wrath of the Federal \nGovernment will fall upon them. Scoundrels who burn churches have no \nrefuge in our America on this day or any other day. They should and \nwill be prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of the law.\n  To that end, Senator Kennedy and I have introduced this bill, full of \nboth symbol and substance, to protect houses of worship.\n  Growing up and living in the rural South, I understand better than a \nlot of people that the church serves as a center of family life, of the \ncommunity life, and in so many of these areas life is built around the \nchurch. Consequently, they hold in more ways than one a sacred place in \nthe hearts of the people within that community. There is far more \npotential in these churches to cure what ails us as a nation than the \nFederal Government will ever possess. Let us renew our commitment with \nenergy and conscience to protect the rights of all Americans without \nregard to race or religion.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, recently, the entire Nation has watched \nin horror and disbelief as an epidemic of terror has gripped the South. \nEvents we all hoped were a relic of the past are now almost a daily \noccurrence. The wave of arsons primarily directed at African American \nchurches is a reminder of some of the darkest moments in our history--\nwhen African-Americans were mired in a quicksand of racial injustice. \nWe have come a long way from the era of Jim Crow, the Klan, and nightly \nlynchings. But these arsons are a chilling reminder of how far we have \nto go as a nation in rooting out racism.\n\n[[Page S6521]]\n\n  In the 1960's, at a time when acts of violence against African-\nAmericans were commonplace, when white freedom workers were being \nmurdered by cowardly racists, Congress first began to speak vigorously \nand in a bipartisan fashion to condemn this violence and address the \nmany faces of bigotry. Today, we again speak with a united voice in \nintroducing bipartisan legislation to address this alarming recent \nepidemic of church burnings.\n  I commend my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Faircloth, for \nhis leadership on the legislation we are introducing today. It is \nvitally important for the American people to recognize that all \nAmericans--Democrats and Republicans, whites and nonwhites, Catholics, \nProtestants, Jews, and Muslims--must speak with a united voice in \ncondemning and combating these outrageous acts. We must send the \nstrongest possible signal that Congress intends to act swiftly and \neffectively to address this festering crisis.\n  President Clinton has also spoken eloquently on this issue, and has \nprovided strong leadership. I applaud his efforts to commit substantial \nadditional Federal resources to the investigations. Just as it was \nappropriate in the 1960's for the Federal Government to play an \nimportant role in reducing racial unrest, it is vitally important today \nfor the Federal Government to take an active role in combating these \nracist arsons.\n  I also commend Congressmen Henry Hyde and John Conyers, who developed \nthe bipartisan House bill that was passed swiftly and unanimously \nyesterday, and I urge the Senate to act with similar swiftness.\n  There are four basic components to the Faircloth-Kennedy bill. First, \nit provides needed additional tools for Federal prosecutors to address \nviolence against places of worship. The bill amends the primary Federal \nstatute dealing with destruction of places of worship to make it easier \nto prosecute these cases. Current law contains onerous and unnecessary \njurisdictional obstacles that have made this provision largely \nineffective. In fact, despite the large number of incidents of \ndestruction or desecration of places of religious worship in recent \nyears, only one prosecution has been brought under this statute since \nits passage in 1988. Our bill will breathe life into this statute by \nremoving these unnecessary obstacles.\n  In addition, our bill strengthens the penalty for church arson by \nconforming it with the penalties under the general Federal arson \nstatute. By conforming the penalty provisions of these two statutes, \nthe maximum potential penalty for church arson will double, from 10 \nyears to 20 years. Our bill also extends the statute of limitations \nfrom 5 to 7 years, giving investigators needed additional time to solve \nthese difficult crimes.\n\n  Giving prosecutors additional tools will enable them to address the \ncurrent crisis more effectively. However, we must also deal with the \naftermath of the arsons that have left so many needy communities \nwithout a place of worship. The bill contains an important provision \ngranting the Department of Housing and Urban Development the authority \nto make loan guarantees to lenders who provide loans to places of \nworship that have been victimized by arson.\n  This provision does not require an additional appropriation of funds \nto HUD. It simply gives HUD authority to use funds it already has. \nThese loan guarantees will serve an indispensable function to help \nexpedite the rebuilding process and the healing process.\n  These arsons have placed an enormous burden on State and local law \nenforcement, who also must investigate the crimes and address the tense \naftermath within their communities. Our bill contains two measures to \nassist State and local law enforcement and local communities in \nresponding to these vicious crimes. The Department of the Treasury is \nauthorized to hire additional ATF agents to assist in these \ninvestigations, and to train State and local law enforcement officers \nin arson investigations. ATF already trains 85 to 90 percent of local \nlaw enforcement in how to investigate arson. This authorization will \nfacilitate needed additional training.\n  The bill also authorizes the Department of Justice to provide \nadditional funds to the Community Relations Service, a small but vital \nmediation arm established by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The mission \nof the Community Relations Service is to go into a community and reduce \nracial unrest through mediation and conciliation. The Community \nRelations Service has worked effectively to calm communities during \nsome of the Nation's most difficult moments in the battle for racial \njustice, and it has earned the respect of law enforcement officials and \ncommunity leaders nationwide.\n  In 1996, its budget was cut in half--from 10 million to $5 million. \nAs a result, at a time when its services are in enormous demand, the \nCommunity Relations Service is about to be forced to lay off half of \nits already slim staff. This bill authorizes the restoration of funds \nto the Community Relations. We must act now, because its services are \nurgently needed.\n  Finally, the bill reauthorizes the Hate Crimes Statistics Act. This \nrash of arsons demonstrates the need to document all hate crimes \nnationwide. Reauthorizing the Hate Crimes Statistics Act is essential, \nand law enforcement groups, religious leaders, and civil rights leaders \nthroughout the Nation strongly support it.\n  Taken together, this bill represents a sensible and practical \nresponse to the church arson crisis. We have a constitutional \nobligation to preserve the separation of church and state, but we also \nhave a Federal obligation to protect the right of all Americans to \nworship freely without fear of violence. We believe this legislation is \na timely and constructive step to stem the tide of violence in the \nSouth. If more can be done, we will do it.\n  In a larger sense, this tragic violence provides an opportunity for \nall Americans to examine our consciences on the issue of prejudice. We \nmust work to root out racism and bigotry in every form. If we create a \nclimate of intolerance, we encourage racist acts of destruction. While \nI respect and indeed cherish the first amendment right of free \nexpression, we must be mindful that words have consequences. It is \ndistressing that hate crimes are on the rise--whether arson of a church \nor assaults and murders because of bigotry. At other times in our \nhistory, we have been able to act together to heal a sudden or \nlingering sickness in our society, and we will do so now. The \nfundamental challenge is to re-commit ourselves as a Nation to the \nbasic values of tolerance and mutual respect that are the Nation's \ngreatest strengths.\n  The courage and faith demonstrated by the parishioners and clergy of \nthe burned churches is an inspiration to the entire country. Their \nchurches may have burned, but their spirit endures, and it is stronger \nthan ever.\n  I also welcome the outpouring of generosity from numerous sources in \nthe private sector. I commend the many individuals, businesses, \ncongregations, and charitable organizations that have pledged financial \nsupport to rebuild the churches. These generous acts, as Martin Luther \nKing once said, ``will enable us as a Nation to hew out of the mountain \nof despair a stone of hope.''\n  I urge my colleagues to join in expediting action on this urgent \nlegislation. America is being tested, and the people are waiting for \nour answer.\n  Mr. President, this Faircloth-Kennedy bill addresses the recent spate \nof arsons that have gripped the South. The bill contains a number of \nmeasures designed to assist prosecutors and investigators in pursuit of \nthe cowardly perpetrators of these crimes, and to assist victims and \ncommunities in the rebuilding process. This statement pertains to \nCongress' constitutional authority to amend the criminal provision \npertaining to destruction of religious property and violent \ninterference with right of free exercise of religious worship.\n  The bill amends title 18, United States Code, section 247 to make it \neasier for prosecutors to establish Federal violations in instances of \ndestruction or desecration of places of religious worship. Although \nsection 247 was passed in 1988, there has been only one Federal \nprosecution due to the onerous jurisdiction requirements contained in \nsection 247(b).\n  The interstate commerce requirement of section 247(b)(1) is much \ngreater than in other similar Federal statutes. For example, title 18, \nUnited States Code, section 844(i) is the general Federal arson statute \nand contains\n\n[[Page S6522]]\n\na much lower interstate commerce threshold than is found in section \n247(b)(1).\n  The $10,000 requirement of section 247(b)(2) is arbitrary and \nunnecessary, and does not reflect the serious nature of many bias \nmotivated acts of violence against places of religious worship. For \nexample, there have been a number of incidents of bias-motivated \nviolence committed by skinheads against synagogues which involved \nfiring gunshots into these sacred places of worship, or the desecration \nof solemn symbols or objects, such as a Torah.\n  The Justice Department is providing specific examples of the \nlimitations of section 247 which it will present at a hearing scheduled \nfor June 25, 1996 in the Judiciary Committee. The monetary damage \namount in these incidents described above is minimal. Yet, the \ndevastation caused by these crimes is enormous, and the Federal \nGovernment can and should play a role in prosecuting these heinous acts \nof desecration.\n  The Faircloth-Kennedy bill amends section 247 in a number of ways. \nMost importantly, the onerous jurisdictional requirements of section \n247(b) are discarded in favor of a more sensible structure that will \nbetter enable prosecutors to pursue the cowardly perpetrators of these \ncrimes.\n\n  Section 2 of the bill contains congressional findings that set out in \nexplicit detail the constitutional authority of Congress to amend \nsection 247. A hearing was conducted in the House of Representatives on \nMay 21, 1996, and a hearing will be conducted in the Senate on June 25, \n1996, in which substantial evidence has or will be presented to support \nthese congressional findings.\n  Congress has three separate bases of constitutional authority for \namending section 247. First, Congress has authority under section 2 of \nthe 13th amendment to enact legislation that remedies conditions which \namount to a badge or incident of slavery. The Supreme Court, in Jones \nv. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409 (1968), and Griffin v. \nBreckenridge, 403 U.S. 88 (1971), held that Congress has broad power \nunder the 13th amendment to enact legislation that addresses societal \nproblems of discrimination. In Griffin, the Supreme Court held that \n``there has never been any doubt of the power of Congress to impose \nliability on private persons under section 2 of the th[e Thirteenth] \nAmendment.\n  The arsons that have occurred have been directed primarily at \nAfrican-American churches. Although a number of the perpetrators have \nnot been apprehended, it is clear from the statement of the Justice \nDepartment that a substantial number of the arsons were motivated by \nanimus against African-Americans. Indeed, these events are a tragic \nreminder of a sad era in our Nation's history, when African-Americans \nwere mired in a quicksand of racial injustice. As such, Congress has \nthe authority under the 13th amendment to amend section 247, and to \neliminate the interstate commerce requirement altogether.\n  Congress also has authority under the commerce clause to enact this \nlegislation. As the record makes clear, the churches, synagogues, and \nmosques that have been the targets of arson and vandalism, serve many \npurposes. On Saturdays or Sundays, they are places of worship. During \nthe rest of the week, they are centers of activity. A wide array of \nsocial services, such as inoculations, day care, aid to the homeless, \nare performed at these places of worship. People often register to \nvote, and vote at the neighborhood church or synagogue. Activities that \nattract people from a regional, interstate area often take place at \nthese places of worship. There is ample evidence to establish that \nCongress is regulating an activity that has a ``substantial effect'' \nupon interstate commerce.\n  Mr. President, I would like to include as cosponsors of this \nlegislation the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd]; the Senator from \nConnecticut [Mr. Dodd]; and the Senator from Alabama [Mr. Heflin].\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the upcoming hearing on church \narson currently scheduled for June 25, 1996 by the Judiciary Committee \nas well as excerpts of other statements submitted in the context of \nthat hearing be made a part of the overall record pertaining to \nconsideration of the Faircloth-Kennedy church arson prevention bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Excerpt of Statement of Deval Patrick, Assistant Attorney General, \n Civil Rights Division, Before the Committee on the Judiciary, May 21, \n                                  1996\n\n       Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I appreciate the \n     opportunity to appear today to discuss the efforts of the \n     Department of Justice to prosecute those individuals \n     responsible for the deplorable act of setting fires to houses \n     of worship and intimidating their parishioners.\n       Let me assure you all, first and foremost, that the \n     Department of Justice considers investigation of church fires \n     and prosecution of those persons responsible for attempting \n     to destroy houses of worship to be among our most important \n     investigative and prosecutorial priorities. Houses of worship \n     have a special place in our society. They are, of course, the \n     center of a community's spiritual life. In many communities, \n     the church is the center of its social life as well. As we \n     have seen in communities that are the subject of today's \n     hearing, destruction of a church can have devastating \n     effects.\n       When the fire is accompanied by an explicit or implied \n     threat of violence directed at church members because of \n     their race, these devastating effects are multiplied. In our \n     society, arson of a church attended predominantly by African \n     Americans carries a unique and menacing threat--that those \n     individuals are physically vulnerable because of their race. \n     These threats are intolerable; no one in our society should \n     have to endure them. The Department of Justice is committed \n     to insuring that those who make such threats will be \n     prosecuted and will serve sentences commensurate with the \n     cowardly and despicable nature of their actions.\n       I will provide a more general overview of federal \n     prosecutorial activities.\n\n\n                          federal jurisdiction\n\n       There are a number of statutes that provide federal \n     jurisdiction over arsons at churches.\n       We also have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. 247 and 248. \n     Under 18 U.S.C. 247, anyone who ``intentionally defaces, \n     damages, or destroys and religious real property, because of \n     the religious charter of that property, or attempts to do \n     so,'' through use of fire, has committed a felony. Subsection \n     (b) of the statute states that the defendant must have \n     traveled in interstate or foreign commerce, or used a \n     ``facility or instrumentality of interstate or foreign \n     commerce in interstate or foreign commerce'' in committing \n     the crime, and caused more than $10,000 damage.\n       Section 844(h) of Title 18 applies when fire or an \n     explosive is used to commit another crime, and section 844(i) \n     of Title 18 prohibits the use of fire when destroying a \n     building used in interstate or foreign commerce. Section \n     248(a)(3) of Title 18 makes it a crime to ``intentionally \n     damage[] or destroy[] the property of a place of religious \n     worship.'' As we discuss later, however, our ability to use \n     248 may be limited.\n\n\n                        successful prosecutions\n\n       Investigation of church fires is extremely challenging. \n     Fire often destroys all of the relevant evidence. In addition \n     to examining the evidence at the scene of the fire, many \n     witnesses must be interviewed in order to get a lead, as \n     there are seldom witnesses to an arson at a church, \n     particularly churches located in rural areas, as many of \n     these churches are. There are currently over 200 federal \n     agents from the ATF and FBI assigned to the various fires we \n     are investigating.\n       We have had successful federal prosecutions, and have \n     secured sentences commensurate with the seriousness of these \n     crimes. Two recent cases demonstrate the type of \n     investigations and prosecutions that vindicate federal \n     rights.\n\n\n                        maury county, tennessee\n\n       In January of 1995, two African American churches and an \n     African American-owned tavern were burned. Local law \n     enforcement investigated, and arrested three suspects, all of \n     whom said the fires were the result of actions they took \n     while intoxicated, and were intended only as a joke. The FBI \n     also investigated, and determined that all three defendants \n     spent a Sunday watching the Super Bowl, drinking, and \n     discussing their hatred of African Americans. The discussion \n     later turned specifically to ``burning nigger churches.'' \n     After gathering various supplies, the defendants first drove \n     to an adjoining county and tried to set fire to the tavern by \n     throwing a molotov cocktail through the window. It failed to \n     ignite. They also burned a cross on the tavern property. They \n     then crossed back into Maury County and went to the \n     Friendship Missionary Baptist Church, an African American \n     church, and threw a railroad tie and molotov cocktail through \n     the window. The fire ignited and caused heavy damage to the \n     church. They also attached a small cross to the church sign \n     and ignited it. They then drove to another African American \n     church, the Canaan African Methodist Episcopal Church, again \n     throwing a molotov cocktail into the church and causing \n     damage, and again leaving a cross on church property.\n       The FBI obtained inculpatory statements and physical \n     evidence, and identified other persons who later testified \n     before the grand jury concerning the defendants' intent to \n     burn African American churches. Attorneys from the United \n     States Attorney's Office for\n\n[[Page S6523]]\n\n     the Middle District of Tennessee, as well as from the \n     Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division, participated \n     in the Federal prosecution of these three defendants. They \n     also met often with local church officials, not only to \n     keep them apprised of the developments in the Federal \n     prosecution, but also to discuss with them the impact of \n     this attack on the members of the church.\n       The defendants were arrested in August of 1995 on Federal \n     charges of violating 18 U.S.C. 241 by conspiring to set fire \n     to the two African American churches and the tavern. They \n     pled guilty to the Federal charges in October of 1995. Two of \n     the defendants were sentenced to 33 months in Federal prison, \n     and the third to 57 months, for this hate crime.\n       One reason we decided to proceed with a Federal prosecution \n     was that because the tavern firebombing occurred in another \n     county, trial in State court would have required separate \n     State indictments and resulted in the juries in each case \n     seeing only part of the overall crime. The Federal conspiracy \n     charge permitted the full scope and nature of the crime to be \n     presented in one prosecution, and provided certain \n     evidentiary advantages, such as the admissibility of co-\n     conspirator statements. In addition, the sentences these \n     defendants would have received under local law were much less \n     than Federal law would permit. The Federal sentencing \n     guidelines permitted the court to tailor sentences which \n     reflected the culpability and subsequent cooperation and \n     acceptance of responsibility by the defendants. The \n     Government was able successfully to argue at sentencing that \n     the leader of three defendants deserved an enhanced sentence. \n     The Federal investigation also revealed that the local \n     firefighters who responded to the first church burning were \n     placed at a substantial risk of death or serious bodily \n     injury by the fire, which also persuaded the court to impose \n     an enhanced sentence. The decision to proceed against these \n     defendants in Federal court and on Federal charges resulted \n     in sentences that fit the contemptible nature of their \n     actions and the effect of those actions on the members of the \n     churches they attempted to destroy.\n\n\n                        pike county, mississippi\n\n       On April 5, 1993, on the 25th anniversary of the death of \n     Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., two African American churches \n     in rural southern Mississippi burned to the ground. The FBI, \n     with some cooperation by the local sheriff's department, took \n     the lead in the investigation and identified three suspects, \n     one adult and two juveniles. The Bureau contacted the father \n     of one suspect, and met with the suspect, his father and his \n     attorney. Later the Bureau agent and a lawyer from the \n     criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division met with \n     another suspect and the suspect's parents. The suspects \n     admitted setting fire to the churches. The churches were \n     chosen because they were African American churches, and the \n     suspects admitted making racially derogatory remarks such as \n     ``Burn Nigger Burn'' and ``that will teach you Niggers'' when \n     setting the fires.\n       These fires were set in an area of Mississippi with a \n     disturbing and violent racial past. This prosecution sent a \n     strong message that this sort of violence will not be \n     tolerated. A thorough six month investigation was done, \n     followed by grand jury testimony. On October 1, 1993, all \n     three participants pled guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. 241. \n     Two defendants were sentenced to 37 months in Federal prison \n     and one to 46 months.\n       These are two instances of successful Federal investigation \n     and prosecution of hate crimes involving the burning of \n     African American churches. Other fires have been investigated \n     jointly with State and local authorities. Some of these have \n     resulted in State convictions and lengthy sentences.\n\n\n                  increase in reports of church fires\n\n       We have found a disturbing increase in the number of fires \n     at churches reported to the Justice Department over the past \n     two years. As of May 1, 1996--only four months into the \n     year--we had received reports of fires at 24 churches, \n     seventeen of which occurred at churches in which the \n     membership is predominantly African American. During 1995, we \n     received reports of fires at 13 churches, and reports of acts \n     of vandalism at three churches that did not involve fires. \n     Eleven of the fires that occurred in 1995 were at African \n     American churches. From 1990 through 1994, we received and \n     investigated reports of fires at only 7 houses of worship, 6 \n     of which were at African American churches, and acts of \n     vandalism at 5 synagogues.\n       This pattern of church fires has not been limited to one \n     region of the country. The reports of church fires occurring \n     in 1996 have come from Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, \n     Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia, South Carolina, and Texas \n     in the southern United States, and also from Arizona, \n     Maryland, and New Jersey. In 1995, we investigated church \n     fires that occurred in Alabama, North and South Carolina, \n     and Tennessee, and also one that occurred at an African \n     American church in Washington state.\n       Nearly one-quarter of the cases reported to us in 1995 and \n     1996 have been resolved. Of the 24 fires reported to us as of \n     May 1 of this year, arrests have been made in two cases, and \n     one has been determined to have been accidental. The rest \n     remain under active federal investigation, and we are hopeful \n     that we can bring some to conclusion soon. Of the 13 fires \n     and 3 incidents of vandalism occurring in 1995, 10 remain \n     under active federal investigation. Two investigations have \n     been closed after successful federal prosecution, and one \n     fire was determined to be accidental. Arrests have been made \n     in two of the incidents still under active investigation. The \n     three incidents of vandalism at churches in Alabama were \n     resolved through local prosecution.\n       We have taken a number of steps to encourage local law \n     enforcement personnel throughout the country and others to \n     contact the FBI and ATF whenever a fire appears suspicious. \n     We have also spoken to church and civil rights leaders in \n     many areas to encourage them to get the word out to their \n     parishioners and members that fires and acts of vandalism at \n     houses of worship are of serious federal concern, and that \n     they should quickly report these incidents to both local and \n     federal officials.\n       I recently went to Boligee, Alabama, to visit the sites of \n     recent church arsons and to meet with local law enforcement \n     officials as well as officials of the damaged churches. I \n     spoke both of the high priority these cases have in the \n     Department of Justice, and of our need for a close \n     relationship with local law enforcement and local citizens \n     regarding these kinds of actions. I was heartened by the \n     reception I was given by local church officials, and I hope \n     they, and other church members and other citizens around the \n     country fully understand the Department's commitment. I know \n     that Assistant Secretary James Johnson from the Department of \n     the Treasury has also made a number of visits to churches \n     around the country victimized by suspicious fires, and has \n     explained the manner in which the federal government is \n     responding to these fires.\n       I am sure that local church and community members are as \n     frustrated as we are by those instances in which church fires \n     are not yet solved. I certainly hope that those same \n     officials and citizens understand that we are actively \n     investigating these fires, and doing whatever we can to \n     determine what happened and to make arrests where criminal \n     activity occurred. It is important to remember that arsons \n     are among the most difficult crimes to solve. Fire often \n     destroys important evidence. Some of these fires were set at \n     churches located in rural, isolated areas, and for that \n     reason the fires at some were extensive. In some instances, \n     churches burned to the ground. It is not yet clear whether \n     the increase in the number of fires reported to us reflects \n     an increase in the number of fires that have occurred, or \n     reflects an increase in reporting. As I stated earlier, we \n     have actively encouraged local citizens and law enforcement \n     officials to report all fires at houses of worship to federal \n     officials, and recent publicity about some church fires may \n     have encouraged the reporting of others.\n       It is clear, however, from some of the cases that have been \n     solved, that some of the people who have set fires at houses \n     of worship are motivated by hate. Most of the other cases are \n     still under investigation. As you know, I cannot discuss \n     specifics of any open case. I can say, however, that during \n     our investigation we focus not only on the circumstances of \n     the specific fire before us, but also on whether, if we \n     identify an individual or individuals responsible for the \n     fire, there is any evidence that these individuals have any \n     ties to fires that have occurred elsewhere in the country. \n     Because these investigations are ongoing, it is premature to \n     draw conclusions one way or the other as to whether the fires \n     we are seeing are part of an organized hate movement.\n\n\n                 difficulties with federal jurisdiction\n\n       While I mentioned the Federal statutes that give us \n     jurisdiction over some fires and acts of vandalism at houses \n     of worship, using those statutes does present some \n     difficulties.\n       18 U.S.C. 241 applies when we have two or more defendants \n     acting in a conspiracy. While we can get significant jail \n     sentences under section 241, we can use section 241 only when \n     we have a conspiracy of two or more persons. When we do not \n     have two or more individuals involved in the fire, section \n     241 is not available.\n       When we are left with only one suspect, our jurisdiction is \n     provided by 18 U.S.C. sections 247 or 248. Prosecutions under \n     section 247 are complicated significantly by the fact that \n     subsection (b) of the statute states that the defendant must \n     have traveled in interstate or foreign commerce, or used a \n     ``facility or instrumentality of interstate or foreign \n     commerce in interstate or foreign commerce'' in committing \n     the crime, and caused more than $10,000 damage. These \n     provisions make this statute nearly impossible to use. The \n     $10,000 requirement means that when the damage from the fire \n     is minimal, or when hate is expressed, not through fire but \n     through desecration or defacement of houses of worship, 18 \n     U.S.C. 247 is not an available source of jurisdiction. In \n     those cases, the message of hate is just as clear, and the \n     effect on the victims often just as palpable and disturbing, \n     but an important law enforcement tool is not available.\n       18 U.S.C. 248(a)(3) also provides Federal jurisdiction in \n     church arsons. While that section could be a useful tool to \n     address this problem, we believe that the Supreme Court's \n     recent decision in United States v. Lopez, 115 S.Ct. 1624 \n     (1995), may make use of that provision more difficult.\n       Section 844(h) of title 18 applies when fire or an \n     explosive is used to commit another crime, and section 844(i) \n     of title 18 prohibits the use of fire when destroying a \n     building used in interstate or foreign commerce. Their \n     utility is limited, however, where no other crime is present, \n     or the interstate commerce nexus is not met.\n\n[[Page S6524]]\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       The Clinton Administration is determined to address this \n     problem using all the law enforcement and investigative tools \n     available, working cooperatively with our Federal as well as \n     State and local law enforcement. Solving these crimes, and \n     punishing those responsible, remains a high priority for this \n     Administration.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n    Statement by the Rev. Dr. Joseph E. Lowery, President, Southern \n  Christian Leadership Conference, Chairman, Black Leadership Forum, \n        Inc., to the Judiciary Committee, Tuesday, May 21, 1996\n\n       Mr. Chairman, and Members of the Judiciary Committee, the \n     Department of Justice through the Assistant Attorney General, \n     Civil Rights Division, has advised us that (as of April 24, \n     1996) they have investigated ``fires and incidents of \n     desecration'' at 46 different houses of worship in 15 States \n     . . . since 1990.\n       Of the 46 incidents listed, 29 remain unsolved. So far in \n     1996, 25 incidents have been reported, and 23 remain \n     unsolved.\n       We have been outraged at these continuing attacks on places \n     of worship--and sorely disappointed that until recently law \n     enforcement in particular, as well as government and media in \n     general--have seemed only mildly interested in focusing on \n     these acts of terrorism. Scant notice was given by national \n     media until a church where the assistant pastor was a well \n     known professional football star--was torched.\n       In late 1995, SCLC intensified its protest and plea to law \n     enforcement agencies to unleash all available resources to \n     bring these criminals to justice.\n       In early 1996 we visited the sites of burned churches in \n     Alabama and Louisiana. Subsequently, Asst. Atty. Gen. Deval \n     Patrick visited our offices in Atlanta to assure us that the \n     investigation of these fires would be given top priority. An \n     official in the enforcement division of the Treasury \n     Department (ATF) also called and informed us that a Joint \n     Task Force with the Justice Dept.--consisting of \n     approximately 100 persons--had been assigned to the \n     investigation. We were advised that two of the officers \n     originally assigned to the Task Force had been removed after \n     it was discovered that they had been among ATF agents who \n     attended a Good Ol' Boy Roundup, where shameful racist \n     activities took place. It is our understanding that none of \n     the agents who frequented these ``Roundups'' has been \n     dismissed or severely disciplined. African Americans are \n     concerned that many law enforcement agencies include \n     personnel who are also members of racist groups.\n       We are not surprised at this feeble response to racist \n     behavior--for like the national response to these church \n     burnings, it represents a fifty-first state in the nation--\n     ``the state of denial''. While we have been shocked as a \n     nation at the rise of hate groups and right-wing terrorists \n     that have bombed federal buildings, and militia groups that \n     pose serious threats to democracy, we have downsized the \n     racist nature of these groups. History, however, is clear \n     that hate mongers in this nation are usually integrated with \n     white supremacists, anti-Semites, and neo-Nazis. They are \n     usually gun addicts and are heavily armed with assault \n     weapons.\n       Is it any wonder that we are outraged that law enforcement \n     agencies insist on denying the racist nature of these attacks \n     on the soul of the Black community--our churches?\n       A few days ago a gang of white teenagers in Ft. Myers, \n     Florida--known as ``Lords of Chaos''--shot and killed a high \n     school band director who uncovered their mayhem. This gang of \n     white teens--from affluent homes (some of whom were honor \n     students)--had burned a soft drink warehouse, a restaurant \n     with exotic birds; had burned property of a Baptist church \n     and were on their way to attack Disney World with assault \n     weapons. What the media have hardly mentioned is that their \n     plans included a shooting spree against Black tourists \n     following the attack on Disney.\n       We are witnessing a frightening and serious assault on \n     African Americans in this nation, in the judicial and \n     legislative suites--as well as in the streets. One hundred \n     years ago, around the time of Plessy vs. Ferguson (separate \n     but equal) African Americans were stripped of political power \n     and our properties including churches were burned. One \n     hundred years later the ghost of Plessy vs. Ferguson and the \n     forces that ended reconstruction are haunting the nation. Our \n     children are cast into inferior courses by ``tracking'' and \n     other forms of miseducation and denial of justice and equal \n     opportunity in education. Our voting rights are being \n     devastated by federal judges who hold the sacred rulings of \n     their predecessors in contempt. Equal opportunities in \n     employment and economic enterprise are imperiled by the \n     assault on affirmative action. The rhetoric around welfare \n     reform suggests that welfare recipients are black, lazy, \n     dishonest, and need to be penalized for being poor. It is \n     soundly perceived and believed that efforts to balance the \n     budget are totally insensitive to the needs of the poor and \n     elderly--and that the budget should be balanced on the backs \n     of the poor. So-called angry white males are concerned that \n     affirmative action, the Federal government, and welfare \n     recipients are their enemies and are responsible for their \n     economic uncertainties. These misconceptions are fomented by \n     the rhetoric and policies of extremists in both the public \n     and private sector.\n       While we continue to call for intensive and massive efforts \n     by law enforcement to bring these criminals to justice, we \n     recognize that concomitantly, we must: (1) recognize the \n     widening impact of anti-Black, anti-poor policies, in \n     creating attitudes of hostility that can translate into acts \n     of hostility; (2) we must hold accountable the extremist \n     groups that fan flames of racial and class divisions.\n       We would strongly urge the Congress of these United States \n     to:\n       1. Call for a massive, intense effort on the part of the \n     FBI, and the entire law enforcement contingency of the United \n     States government to bring to justice those who committed \n     these crimes.\n       2. Commend, support and encourage the ministers, \n     congregations and communities that refuse to be intimidated \n     by these cowardly acts of terrorism. The message must be loud \n     and clear that the African American community will not be \n     intimidated in 1996 any more than we were in 1896, 1963 or \n     any other time. These attacks stiffen our resistance to \n     oppression and render firm our resolve in the pursuit of \n     justice and equity.\n       We respectfully urge this committee and the Congress to \n     remember the history of fire bombing of churches in our \n     community. While no life has been lost, we recall with deep \n     pain and sorrow the murder of four little girls in Sunday \n     school in a church in Birmingham, Alabama. These criminals \n     must be stopped before such tragedies recur.\n       3. We respectfully urge the committee and the Congress to \n     seek ways and means of addressing the economic distress, the \n     loss of jobs, the growing fears and uncertainties about the \n     future in ways that do not make African Americans, Hispanics, \n     women, and low income persons--scapegoats.\n       We urge the Congress to engage in a positive campaign to \n     achieve racial justice and an end to political, judicial, \n     economic and street violence.\n       We believe that an intelligence system and advanced \n     criminological technology that can identify terrorists in \n     faraway lands, and in New York and Oklahoma, ought to be able \n     to apprehend angry arsonists who burn churches.\n       Finally, some religious extremists have offered rewards for \n     the culprits and challenged civil rights groups to match the \n     reward monies.\n       We believe the religious community could better serve the \n     common good by engaging in joint efforts to eliminate the \n     climate of hostility which encourages acts of hostility. We \n     are willing to work together for social justice, the beloved \n     community, and an end to economic, political, judicial and \n     physical violence.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Excerpts of Testimony of John W. Magaw, Director, Bureau of Alcohol, \n Tobacco and Firearms, Before the Committee on the Judiciary, May 21, \n                                  1996\n\n       Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Conyers, and members of the \n     Committee, for providing this forum to discuss the Federal \n     response to the recent series of church fires, predominately \n     African-American, that have occurred in the Southeastern \n     United States. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is \n     the arson investigative agency of the Federal government, and \n     we bring unparalleled expertise to fire investigations. \n     Today, I'd like to highlight ATF's role in working with State \n     and local fire and police authorities, the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, and the Civil Rights Division of the \n     Department of Justice in investigating these fires. The \n     burning of churches is a particularly heinous crime because \n     those who would attack our churches seek to strike at our \n     most fundamental liberties and sources of personal support. \n     African-American churches historically have served as places \n     of sanctuary, centers of the community, and symbols of \n     freedom. ATF is committed to fully applying all of our \n     investigative resources to determine the cause of these fires \n     and arrest those responsible for the arsons.\n       Although ATF has dedicated a tremendous amount of resources \n     to investigating this unusual increase in the number of \n     church fires, church fires are not necessarily a new \n     phenomenon. According to statistics compiled by the National \n     Fire Data Center (NFDC) in the U.S. Fire Administration, 179 \n     church fires were reported in 1994. The NFDC estimates that \n     the statistics represent half of the actual number of fires \n     which occur each year. ATF has investigated 135 church fires \n     across the United States since October 1, 1991. However, as \n     depicted in the displayed pie chart, all church fires that \n     ATF initially investigates are not determined to be arsons.\n\n\n                   current church fire investigations\n\n       Since January 1995, ATF has conducted more than 2,600 fire \n     investigations. During this same period, ATF has conducted 51 \n     church fire investigations. Twenty-five of these \n     investigations are arsons which occurred at predominately \n     African-American churches in the Southeast. These include six \n     in Tennessee: five each in Louisiana and South Carolina; four \n     in Alabama; three in Mississippi; and one each in Virginia \n     and Georgia. These locations are reflected in the displayed \n     map chart. As you know, these investigations are ongoing and, \n     therefore, I am unable to go into detail about the specifics \n     of these fires. I can tell you that, as of May 15, 1996, \n     there have been two individuals arrested in connection with \n     fires in Williamsburg County and Manning, South Carolina. In \n     addition, there have been three arrests in Lexington County, \n     South Carolina; one arrest in Tyler, Alabama; and another in\n\n[[Page S6525]]\n\n     Satartia, Mississippi. I am confident that we will make \n     additional arrests in the near future.\n  The concentration of arsons at African-American churches, depicted on \nthe line chart, raises the obvious possibility of race/hate-based \nmotives. The proximity in time and geographic region indicates the \npossibility that some of the fires are connected. Because of the \npotential of racial motives, and the possibility that some fires may be \nconnected, there has been an extraordinary degree of coordination of \nthe various investigations. We are always aware of the possibility that \nevidence and information developed in one investigation might provide \nvaluable leads in another. While the targets, timing, and locations of \nthe arsons have resulted in heightened attention to race/hate-based \nmotives and possible connections, ATF must also examine all other \npossible motives for the fires. Motives can range from blatant racially \nmotivated crimes to financial profit to simply personal revenge or \nvandalism. In any event, the motive in one arson does not automatically \nspeak to the motive in another arson or series of arsons. A conspiracy \nwas uncovered involving at least two fires in South Carolina. We have \nnot yet found any evidence of an interstate or national conspiracy, but \nuntil our work is done no motive or suspect will be eliminated.\n\n       The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) is the \n     arson investigative agency of the Federal government and we \n     bring unparalleled expertise to fire investigations. AFT \n     derives its authority to investigate arson incidents, in \n     part, from 18 U.S.C. Section 844(i) which makes it a Federal \n     crime to use explosives or fire to destroy property affecting \n     interstate commerce. The legislative history of this law \n     makes it clear that Congress intended it to cover churches \n     and synagogues. The interstate nexus generally flows from \n     national or international affiliations that involve the \n     movement of funds, property, and other support services \n     across State boundaries.\n       Since January 1995, ATF has conducted more than 2,600 fire \n     investigations. During this same period, ATF has conducted 51 \n     church fire investigations. Twenty-five of these \n     investigations are arsons which occurred at predominately \n     African-American churches in the Southeast. We are working in \n     concert with over 20 State and local law enforcement and fire \n     agencies, as well as with the FBI, the Civil Rights Division \n     of the Department of Justice, U.S. Attorneys' offices, and \n     local prosecutors. We have committed virtually every arson \n     investigative resource at our disposal to the investigation \n     of the African-American church fires. Approximately 100 ATF \n     special agents have been assigned to the active \n     investigations in the Southeast. We have employed all of \n     ATF's investigative resources, such as our National Response \n     Teams, Certified Fire Investigators, and ATF-trained \n     accelerant detecting canines to help process the crime \n     scenes.\n       Because of the potential of racial motives, and the \n     possibility that some fires may be connected, there has been \n     an extraordinary degree of coordination of the various \n     investigations. A conspiracy was uncovered involving at least \n     two fires in South Carolina. We have not found any evidence \n     so far of an interstate or national conspiracy, but until our \n     work is done no motive or suspect will be eliminated. \n     African-American churches have served as places of sanctuary, \n     centers of the community, and symbols of freedom. We will \n     continue to vigorously pursue all investigative leads to \n     solve these arsons and remove the fear.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-\nby-section analysis of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the section-by-section analysis was ordered \nto be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n             Faircloth-Kennedy Church Arson Prevention Act\n\n       Section One: Short Title: This section notes that the bill \n     may be cited as ``The Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996.''\n       1. Sections Two and Three: Amendment to Federal Criminal \n     Code.--Title 18, United States Code, Section 247, is one of \n     the principal federal statutes addressing destruction of \n     religious property. Since its passage in 1988, this provision \n     has been used once by federal prosecutors, despite the \n     hundreds of incidents of destruction or desecration of \n     religious property. (The one case involved the murder of a \n     cult member by another cult member.) The reason prosecutors \n     do not use the statute is because it contains jurisdictional \n     requirements that, as a practical matter, have been \n     impossible to meet.\n       Specifically, section 247(b) contains a very high \n     interstate commerce requirement, a requirement that is not \n     constitutionally mandated, even after Lopez. The level of \n     interstate commerce required under section 247(b) is much \n     higher than is required in other similar federal statutes, \n     such as the arson statute.\n       In addition, in cases of destruction of religious property, \n     there is a requirement that the damage exceed $10,000. The \n     monetary requirement is arbitrary, and does not reflect the \n     seriousness of many crimes. For example, there have been a \n     number of very serious cases involving skinheads firing \n     gunshots into synagogues that could not be prosecuted under \n     this statute because the damage did not exceed $10,000.\n       The upshot of these two requirements is that section 247 is \n     essentially useless because prosecutors cannot meet the \n     unduly onerous jurisdictional requirements. The attached bill \n     (Section 3) addresses this problem by eliminating these \n     unworkable jurisdictional requirements and replacing them \n     with a more sensible scheme that will expand the scope of a \n     prosecutor's ability to prosecute religious violence under \n     section 247. The monetary requirement is eliminated \n     altogether, and the interstate commerce requirement is \n     replaced by a much more workable framework that will enable \n     prosecutors to prosecute church arsons, as well as other \n     serious acts of religious violence, under this statute. The \n     House bill contains a very similar provision, and the \n     Administration supports this approach.\n       The Senate bill pertaining to section 247 contains two \n     additional features that are not contained in the House bill. \n     First, the Senate bill conforms the penalty provisions of \n     section 247 so that they are identical to the general federal \n     arson statute. Presently, if a defendant is prosecuted under \n     the federal arson statute for the arson of a building in \n     which nobody is injured, he faces a maximum possible penalty \n     of 20 years. However, if that same person burns down a place \n     of religious worship, and is prosecuted under section 247, \n     the maximum possible penalty is 10 years. Similarly, the \n     statute of limitations for prosecutions under the general \n     federal arson statute is seven years, while it is only five \n     years under section 247. The Senate bill corrects these \n     anomalies by conforming these provisions of section 247 to \n     the provisions of the federal arson statute.\n       The Senate bill (Section 2) also contains the requisite \n     Congressional findings that enable Congress to amend section \n     247. These findings, in conjunction with the extensive \n     factual record that is being generated, are intended to \n     ensure that the bill withstands constitutional scrutiny.\n       2. Section 4: Loan Guarantees--The Senate bill contains a \n     provision intended to assist victims in seeking to rebuild \n     without running afoul of First Amendment establishment clause \n     concerns. Under this provision. HUD will have the authority \n     to use up to $5,000,000 from an existing fund to extend loan \n     guarantees to financial institutions who make loans to \n     501(c)(3) organizations that have been damaged as a result of \n     an act of terrorism or arson. This provision does not require \n     an appropriation of additional funds to HUD. It will simply \n     give HUD the authority to use already existing funds in a new \n     manner. The financial benefit derives primiarly to the \n     financial institution, which now has the ability to make \n     certain loans that it might now otherwise have considered. \n     The House bill does not contain this provision.\n       3. Section 5: Additional Resources to ATF--ATF trains \n     approximately 85-90% of state and local law enforcement in \n     how to investigate suspicious fires. It has been very \n     difficult for state and local enforcement to keep pace with \n     the recent spate of arsons. As a result, ATF has played a \n     prominent role in these investigations. The bill contains \n     authorization language (Section 5) for ATF to add \n     investigators and technical support personnel to participate \n     in these investigations, and to train state and local law \n     enforcement with the necessary arson investigation skills to \n     enable them to conduct these difficult investigations. The \n     House bill does not contain this provision.\n       4. Section 5: Additional Resources to Community Relations \n     Service--The Community Relations Service is the mediation/\n     conciliation arm of the Justice Department that was created \n     as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Its mission is to go \n     out in the community to quell racial unrest through mediation \n     and conciliation. From working in Memphis following the death \n     of Martin Luther King to working in Los Angeles during the \n     Rodney King riots, the Community Relations Service has worked \n     to calm communities during our nation's most tense moments. \n     CRS focuses on non-litigation approaches to problem solving, \n     and has earned the respect of police chiefs and community \n     leaders across the country.\n       In an unfortunate development, CRS had its budget cut in \n     half (10 million to 5 million) during the 1996 appropriation \n     cycle. Consequently, effective June 22nd, at a time when \n     their services are in great demand, CRS will be forced to lay \n     off almost half its staff, unless they get additional money. \n     Section 5 of the bill contains authorization language for CRS \n     to receive such sums as are necessary to perform these \n     essential services. It is Senator Kennedy's hope that CRS \n     ultimately will be funded at 1995 levels. The House bill does \n     not contain this provision.\n       5. Section 6: Reauthorization of the Hate Crimes Statistics \n     Act--Newspaper reports give differing accounts of the number \n     of church fires that have occurred over the past two years. \n     The inability to document the number of such incidents points \n     to the need to reauthorize the Hate Crimes Statistics Act \n     permanently.\n       Section 7 contains a provision permanently reauthorizing \n     the Hate Crimes Statistics\n\n[[Page S6526]]\n\n     Act. Although the Senate has already passed a separate bill \n     reauthorizing the HCSA, the House has not acted. Given the \n     paucity of time remaining in this legislative term, it is \n     imperative to pass the HCSA reauthorization as soon as \n     possible. As a result, it has been included in the Senate \n     bill.\n       If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at 224-\n     4031. I hope your Senator will consider co-sponsoring this \n     proposal so that the Senate can send a strong message to the \n     American public on this pressing issue.\n       6. Section 7: Sense of the Senate--Section 7 is a sense of \n     the Senate resolution commending individuals and entities who \n     have assisted financially, or offered to assist financially, \n     in the rebuilding process. This resolution encourages the \n     private section to continue these efforts.\n       7. Section 8: Severability Provision.--This clarifies the \n     severability of all provisions of this bill.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think I have 2 minutes left. I yield 2 minutes to the \nSenator from Alabama for his comments.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, may I make an inquiry? Am I listed on \nthat bill as cosponsor? I just want to find out.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Senator Faircloth, I think, is indicating in the \naffirmative, Senator.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Yes, the ones so far are Senator Lott, Senator \nThurmond, Senator Warner, Senator D'Amato, Senator Gramm, Senator \nFrist, and Senator Cochran. There are several others, and many more who \nare going to sign on, but you are listed, Senator Thurmond.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes, 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, we recently awoke once again to disturbing \nnews that has become all-too-commonplace. We were told that during the \nnight, additional southern black churches had been burned. These recent \nchurch burnings came amidst heightened national concern over the \nepidemic of such episodes throughout the South. As each fire is \nreported, we cling to the hope that what we will hear is that it was \nthe result of an accident and not the work of some demented arsonist. \nThe evidence, however, points away from the accidental fire.\n  As these hateful incidents continue to occur with alarming \nregularity, we are reminded of some of the most terrible moments of the \ncivil rights struggle of the 1960's. Then, homes, businesses, churches, \nand other property was set afire in the dark of the night by those who \nwanted to preserve the existing social order. Their goal was to \nintimidate and frighten those working legally for the causes of \nequality and integration.\n  To those of us who remember those dark days and who applaud the \nprogress which has been made in our society since then in terms of race \nrelations, these current images of fires at churches in the early hours \nbefore dawn are profoundly disturbing and disconcerting. This is not \nsupposed to happen in this day and age, not in the South or anywhere in \nthis country.\n  Such incidents remind us that such hatred is alive in the United \nStates of America and it is directed today at the very heart of these \nsmall, rural black communities. We ask ourselves who would hate a group \nenough to burn its church, the spiritual and social center of the \ncommunity. The forces of evil are intentionally striking at the very \nsoul of these communities by destroying their most sacred and powerful \nsymbols.\n  Last week, the President said:\n\n       ``This country was founded on the premise of religious \n     liberty. It's how we got started * * * It is the cruelest of \n     all ironies that an expression of bigotry in America that \n     would sweep this country is one that involves trashing \n     religious liberty.\n\n  Most would agree that one of the most logical institutions or symbols \nfor bringing different people together would be a house of worship. \nWhat better venue could there be for transcending social and cultural \ndivision than the spiritual setting provided by a church?\n  These fires are far more than an expression of religious bigotry. The \nfact that these small churches are so much more to the community than \nsimply places of worship makes the expressions of hatred even more \negregious. They go beyond religion to the very essence of racial \nhatred. We have to ask ourselves what kind of hatred could possibly \nmotivate individuals to destroy these symbols of a community in such a \ndespicable manner.\n  As the Government searches for ways to address this epidemic, \nincluding the legislative efforts which I strongly support, we have to \nlook at the twin possibilities of a conspiracy and the work of copycat \narsonists. If it is a conspiracy, the work of one isolated group or \ngroups fanning their hatred across the South, then our task is to find \nthe perpetrators and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law. \nSome of the evidence points to a conspiracy, such as the timing of the \nfires--they have all occurred in the very early hours of the morning, \nbefore day-light. As disturbing as it would be, it would be better for \nus as a country if the fires are the result of a conspiracy, the work \nof one group of individuals that does not reflect the current sentiment \nin this region of the country.\n\n  If, on the other hand, they are the result of copycats, which is more \nlikely the case, then we are dealing with a societal disease. \nAddressing such a societal ill is far more difficult and requires a \nmuch different response that goes beyond basic law enforcement. At the \nsame time, it provides us with an opportunity to reevaluate race \nrelations in this country and to seek new ways to improve them. As \nthese tragic fires illustrate, some remedial attention with regard to \ncontinued progress in race relations is needed.\n  There are some ways in which communities can be brought together \nbecause of these fires. White churches should invite their black \nneighbors who have lost their places of worship to come and worship \nwith them. Black and white churches should come together in forming \nwatches to prevent these attacks in the future. Ministers--black and \nwhite--should speak forcefully about racial equality and of the \nimportance of honoring houses of God and keeping them sacred.\n  These rather small but common-sense acts of neighborliness and \nspiritual leadership could direct more attention on where we are in \nterms of racial attitudes and relations. It is sad that with all the \nprogress we have made over the last few decades, these kinds of \nterrorist acts still occur. Throughout my career, I have striven to \npromote racial harmony in my State and throughout the Nation. I am \nproud of the progress we have made. But, as my time in the Senate draws \nto a close, I am, frankly, quite disheartened that these kinds of \nincidents are again plaguing our society.\n  While we do all in our power possible to stop these hate crimes, \nbring their perpetrators to justice, and encourage compliance with the \nlaw, we should also ask ourselves if there is more we can do as \nindividual communities to advance the causes of equal rights and racial \nharmony. So, Mr. President, I support the Faircloth-Kennedy bill. I \nthink it is an improvement over the House bill. A lot of work has gone \ninto this. I think it approaches the situation with an investigatory \ndevice, to try to enhance the right of the FBI to investigate these \nterrible acts that are occurring throughout our Nation.\n\n  Senator Pryor has asked me to add his name to this. I am sure there \nwill be others. I ask unanimous consent the cosponsors' names be \nallowed to be entered for a period of time following this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I also see this as an opportunity to bring \nfurther improvement in regard to race relations. Yesterday I spoke with \na group of Methodist ministers. I told them this was an opportunity to \nextend a hand of friendship to the black members of churches that were \ndestroyed, to endeavor to try to work with them to improve their lot in \nthe agony they are suffering today. I think this is an opportunity.\n  I do not know whether this is a conspiracy or whether it is a copycat \nsituation. If it is a conspiracy, we should root out the perpetrators \nof this and punish them. If it is a copycat situation, then we have to \ntry to work to remove the root cause.\n  So, it is something I think the American people ought to be aware of, \nand that they ought to do everything they can to address these crimes.\n\n[[Page S6527]]\n\n  I fully support this bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, any time I have remaining I also yield \nback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts and the \nSenator from North Carolina, have they completed their remarks and the \nintroduction of their bill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair and ranking minority member for \nyielding for this purpose. We yield back our time.\n  Mr. NUNN. I congratulate both Senators on taking this step. I think \nthere is nothing that is so discouraging and heartbreaking than to see \nthe burnings that have taken place of churches across much of our \ncountry.\n  I congratulate both the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator \nfrom North Carolina. Maybe we can get unanimous support for denouncing \nthis unexplainable and detestable series of acts. Whatever the cause, I \nthink the message should go out that the U.S. Senate is firmly on \nrecord, both sides of the aisle, every political philosophy, deploring \nthis kind of conduct.\n  So I congratulate both Senators for introducing this bill. I know it \nwill receive prompt and careful consideration by the Senate and the \nrespective committees.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong \ncondemnation of the rash of church burnings that have swept through the \nSouth. This is a national crisis.\n  These acts of terrorism, which are aimed solely at predominately \nblack churches, strike at the very heart of what is sacred in our \ncountry--the right to freedom of religion and fundamental civil rights. \nChurches, mosques, temples, and synagogues are sanctuaries where \nAmericans enjoy the freedom to worship. That is why these acts are \ntruly repugnant, and I am outraged that the arsons continue.\n  Yesterday the Senate passed unanimously a resolution expressing our \nhorror at these repugnant acts, and calling for rigorous investigation \nand prosecution of these crimes. I was proud to be a cosponsor of that \nresolution.\n  But we can and must do more. That is why I am cosponsoring the bill \nintroduced by my colleagues, Senators Kennedy and Faircloth, that will \nmake it easier for the Federal Government to investigate and prosecute \ncrimes involving the intentional destruction of churches.\n  Our Nation has made tremendous progress since the civil rights \nmovement in the 1960's. Church burnings turn the clock back on the \nstrides we have made since the 1960's and bring shame to our great \nNation. Our Nation cannot tolerate the increasing number of black \nchurch arsons. The burnings have reached epidemic proportions.\n  It is a painful reminder of a time when hate and ignorance prevailed \nin many parts of the country. The perpetrators of these crimes must be \ncaught and punished. They must know that our Nation will not tolerate \nor encourage these cowardly acts. Citizens around the country are \noutraged that places of worship--mostly in small Southern towns--are \nbeing burned to the ground. Many of the churches are historic \nlandmarks. Some were erected over 100 years ago.\n  Black churches are the lifeblood in small Southern communities--by \nburning these churches the arsonists strike at the very heart of the \nblack community. But, all of us who worship and believe in God are hurt \nby these church burnings; they strike everyone.\n  Faith built our country. We must begin building bridges to destroy \nthe plague of racism. It is the basis of our Constitution that everyone \nhas the freedom to worship wherever they please. These fundamental \nfreedoms must be protected from those who would like to bully and \nintimidate peaceful, worshiping citizens.\n  Nearly 40 churches have burned since the beginning of the year. This \nis the worst kind of terrorism. It is reminiscent of a time when the Ku \nKlux Klan and other hate groups felt free to burn crosses, lynch \ninnocent blacks, and burn churches. The current wave of church burnings \nhas targeted remote, isolated places of worship in Southern black \ncommunities. These arsonists sneak into the night to torch churches \nfalsely believing they will not be caught. We must not let these \narsonists continue to commit their acts without being punished.\n  Our country will not tolerate this kind of moral outrage and shame. \nFederal prosecutors should be able to investigate and prosecute these \ncriminals to the fullest extent allowed by law. Federal prosecution of \nthose who are responsible for these fires at churches should be the \nhighest national priority. We need to have the resources to go after \nthese criminals; a civilized society cannot continue to have churches \nbeing burned to the ground every other day.\n  It is encouraging that my Senate colleagues in a bipartisan fashion \nhave come together to condemn the church burnings. This is an issue \nthat crosses all racial and party lines. We need to begin rebuilding--\nthe churches across the South and the moral fabric of our country.\n  We must do all that we can to bring these criminals to justice. We \nare all the victims of the rash of church burnings in our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Kennedy-Faircloth bill. The \nlegislation will give law enforcement officials the tools they need to \nstop this terrible epidemic.\n  We must come together to begin healing the racial wounds caused by \nthe church fires. Racism and hatred have no place in our country.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues to express concern and \noutrage at the dastardly acts of hatred and violence against black \nchurches, against good and decent people, people of faith with a strong \nsense of community. This legislation is a bipartisan statement that the \nUnited States Senate is determined to bring this outrage to a halt.\n  Make no mistake, those who have set these churches ablaze have \nrekindled our desire to stamp out bigotry and prejudice everywhere. \nThere was a time in America, not long ago, when many of us were \ninvolved in the Civil Rights movement with men and women of good will--\nwhite and black--who demonstrated and marched for equal rights and \njustice in the face of the worst kind of violence, hatred, and bigotry. \nBlack churches had long been a refuge from prejudice and served as the \nsymbol of community for millions of Americans who were the victims of \nblind intolerance that raged throughout this country.\n  We cannot and must not let the hatred and ignorance of a few \ncriminals, arsonists, separatists, or supremacists turn back the clock \non the progress we have made toward racial equality. We must, in this \nface of the haters, the bigots, and the racists, strengthen our resolve \nto tear down the walls that divide us and stand together, shoulder-to-\nshoulder, in solidarity against intolerance and this kind of violent, \ndestructive, sociopathic behavior directed at our fellow citizens.\n  Those who have committed these hate crimes have forgotten the lessons \nof history. They have forgotten or never learned what America went \nthrough in the 1960s. They have forgotten the faces on the bridge in \nSelma, the burning bus of the Freedom Riders ablaze in Anniston, AL and \nthe horrifying scene of demonstrators being dragged from the bus and \nbeaten. They have forgotten the image of ``Bull'' Connor ordering the \nuse of police dogs and fire hoses on demonstrators in Birmingham. They \nhave forgotten or never learned the meaning of the assassination of Dr. \nKing. These thugs are no different than the haters, cowards, and common \ncriminals in white hoods who burned crosses in the middle of the night \nin a reign of terror against innocent people who sought only fairness, \nequal rights, and justice.\n  We can thank God that history taught most of us a lesson. History has \npassed its own lesson on the cross-burners along with men like ``Bull'' \nConnor because of their racism, ignorance and cowardice. But now, years \nlater, those who learned nothing from history, or those too young, too \nalone, too desocialized, disinterested, or demoralized to know better \nare burning churches instead of crosses, and they must be brought to \njustice.\n  As a nation and as one people united in our constitutional, \nreligious, and philosophical belief in equal justice\n\n[[Page S6528]]\n\nunder the law, we cannot let the actions of these criminals result in \nbitterness, anger, or retaliation. We cannot let them divide us. We \nmust remember the words of Martin Luther King who said,\n\n       ``I've seen too much hate to want to hate myself, and I've \n     seen hate on the faces of too many sheriffs, too many White \n     Citizens Councilors, and too many Klansmen of the South to \n     want to hate, myself; and every time I see it, I say to \n     myself: hate is too great a burden to bear.''\n\n  Let Dr. King's words be our lesson as we find these criminals, bring \nthem to justice, and rally together for an end to hatred and \nintolerance in this Nation.\n  I commend the Senators who have taken the leading roles in crafting \nthe language on which we will be voting, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to cosponsor the Church Arson \nProtection Act of 1996 introduced today by Senators Kennedy and \nFaircloth.\n  Since the beginning of this year, a series of fires have swept our \ncountry. More than 30 predominantly African-American churches in the \nsoutheast have been burned. Not all of the fires have been set by \npeople filled with racial hatred. But many have. And even one is too \nmuch.\n  Passing this measure is the least we can do to address this problem. \nWith this new law, we send a clear message to every person who is \nthinking of setting fire to a place of worship: we will catch you. If \nyou think that any church is small and remote, think again. No church \nis too small or remote for us not to care about it. If you think that \nyou can burn all of the evidence, think again. We will find the \nevidence. If you think that no one cares if you burn a church used by \nAfrican Americans, think again. This Nation condemns your actions.\n  In the last few months, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms, and State and local law enforcement have vigorously \ninvestigated the fires in our churches. They have made numerous arrests \nand have leads on many other cases.\n  Despite this progress, the news of these fires is genuinely \ndisturbing and perplexing. How could anyone do such a heinous thing? \nHow could anyone burn a church and feel proud of their actions? No one \nwho is truly committed to the principles of our country could do this. \nThis Nation was founded on tolerance and respect for religious worship. \nAnd the greatest battle of our country's short life has been fought for \nthe principle of racial tolerance.\n  Many people may say that these fires are a blow aimed at racial and \nreligious equality. And they are. But they are feeble and small swats. \nWe will rebuild the burned churches; we will condemn the bigots who \nstarted the fires; and with this law, we will help assure that \npunishment is swift, sure, and severe. These fires cannot undo the \nprogress in race relations that we have made as a nation.\n  So today, I rise to cosponsor this legislation. And I urge my fellow \nSenators to pass it rapidly an unanimously.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, what has happened recently in this \ncountry is abominable and we have all heard the reports: yet another \nchurch, attended by black parishioners, was torched in the South. The \nrecent rash of arson attacks on black churches should put this country \nin fear; it has to this Senator.\n  These cases of arson are more than the destruction of a structure; it \nis the destruction of the congregation and the communities themselves. \nThis is the time for this body, and for all this Nation, to lend their \nsupport to these communities and these congregations for they have \nsuffered a tremendous loss. If we allow this to continue with impunity \nin America, what protection do any of us have?\n  The reporting of over 30 church burning in 18 months indicates the \nneed for a swift and just response. The responsible parties must be \ncaught and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. These malicious \nburnings must end and end now.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1891. A bill to establish sources of funding for certain \ntransportation infrastructure projects in the vicinity of the border \nbetween the United States and Mexico that are necessary to accomodate \nincreased traffic resulting from the implementation of the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, including construction of new Federal \nborder crossing facilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n  the border infrastructure, safety, and congestion relief act of 1996\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Border \nInfrastructure, Safety and Congestion Relief Act of 1996 with Senator \nBingaman of New Mexico.\n  When the Senate debated the North American Free Trade Agreement, I \nopposed it on the grounds that the United States was unprepared for its \nimpact on our environment, infrastructure, and labor relations. In fact \nour Mexican border States face trying to handle the increased traffic \nfrom NAFTA in less time than it takes to design, review and construct \nmajor highway projects.\n  Now that NAFTA is a reality, however, I am determined to make it work \nto California's best advantage.\n  Whatever its shortcomings, NAFTA has increased trade across our \nborders. However, this trade boom now threatens to overwhelm residents \nand businesses in the border region of San Diego and Imperial Counties. \nIn California's border community of Otay Mesa, my colleagues, you can \nsee that the new global economy is choking old city streets.\n  To get a good idea of the problem, you need look no further than Otay \nMesa Road.\n  Just a few miles up the road is the Otay Mesa Port of Entry. Serving \na border region of over 4 million people, it is the third-busiest truck \ncrossing on the United States-Mexico border and the only commercial \ncrossing facility linking San Diego and Tijuana. The number of trucks \ncrossing annually at Otay Mesa has increased from 668,000 in 1993 to \nmore than 1.5 million today. Daily traffic is expected to double again \nby the year 2010.\n  The Otay Mesa Port is connected to the U.S. Interstate Highway System \nby this one city street, which narrows to two lanes before reaching \nInterstate 905. Otay Mesa Road already carries traffic that is three \ntimes its design capacity.\n  In Imperial County the situation is similar, if slightly less \nintense. The Calexico/Mexicali Port of Entry serves a regional \npopulation of 1 million. The border crossing opens on to a two-lane \nroad with no shoulders, which is expected to carry truck, car and bus \ntraffic through the heart of Calexico.\n  Between Otay Mesa and Calexico, construction is beginning on a new \nFederal border port of entry at Tecate. The U.S. Department of \nTransportation is providing no direct funding to link any of these \nstations with the regional road networks.\n  The California Transportation Commission recently approved shifting \n$244 million from other transportation projects in the State to the \nborder region as a down payment on about $1 billion in needed \ninfrastructure improvements to serve commercial vehicle traffic \ncrossing the California-Mexico border.\n  The State of California is doing its share. Now, State transportation \nofficials are demanding Federal assistance--over and above the State's \ncurrent Federal highway funding--to help pay for these border \nimprovements.\n  That is why Senator Bingaman and I are introducing the Border \nInfrastructure, Safety and Congestion Relief Act of 1996.\n  Our bill provides a two-level system for Federal assistance to fund \nthe States' top-priority border infrastructure projects:\n  First, it establishes a $500 million Border Infrastructure Trust Fund \nto provide grants by the Secretary of Transportation to the States in \norder to pay for new or upgraded connections to the National Highway \nSystem.\n  States could also be reimbursed for projects that have begun any time \nsince 1994, when NAFTA was implemented. This means that California \nwould not be penalized for putting its State money up early to prepare \nfor NAFTA with projects such as the new inspection station at Otay \nMesa.\n  We also allow provide up to $10 million, if needed, for the Attorney \nGeneral to use to provide transportation improvements for the Border \nPatrol\n\n[[Page S6529]]\n\nand other law enforcement agencies. I believe that we should do more at \nthe border to deter drug smuggling and illegal immigration. My bill \nwill provide important help in funding access roads, lighting, and \nother transportation improvements needed by our Federal law enforcement \nagencies.\n  The second part of our bill would authorize Federal loan guarantees \nto assist the States in financing major construction of high-cost, \nrevenue-producing projects, such as toll roads. The assistance is \nprovided through the State Infrastructure Bank pilot program, \nestablished under the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995. \nOur bill, however, would authorize new Federal funds to finance border \ninfrastructure projects.\n  The final part of the bill authorizes Federal assistance to railroad \nprojects in the border region which are intermodal and will provide \ntraffic congestion relief by providing a rail alternative for freight \nshipments. These loan guarantees for railroad improvements would be \nprovided under the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of \n1976.\n  This assistance is critical to San Diego's efforts to reopen the \neastern extension of the San Diego & Arizona Eastern Railway. Extending \nthis railroad across southeastern California will provide a critical \nlink to the U.S. national rail network. By providing fast and efficient \nservice to new markets throughout Mexico, it is also San Diego's best \nopportunity to take advantage of NAFTA. Trade with Mexico's interior \noffers the San Diego region its greatest opportunity to take full \nadvantage of NAFTA. But this cannot happen without good, dependable \nrail service.\n  In today's post-cold-war global marketplace, the competition is \neconomic. America's place in the world will be determined largely by \nour ability to produce and market goods and services and deliver them \nefficiently into that global marketplace.\n  I have been working with the San Diego House delegation, local \nelected officials, and members of the community to make Washington pay \nmuch greater attention to our infrastructure needs at the border. The \nSan Diego Association of Governments, the four-State Border Trade \nAlliance business group and the Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce \nhave endorsed my legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1891\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Border Infrastructure Safety \n     and Congestion Relief Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) although the United States Customs Service has \n     collected increased duties, merchandise fees, and revenues \n     from other commerce-related activities because of the \n     approval and implementation of the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement, these increased revenues have not been accompanied \n     by Federal funding for improving transportation facilities \n     along the international borders of the United States to \n     ensure the free and safe flow of trade destined for all \n     States and regions of the United States;\n       (2) because of NAFTA, all 4 States along the United States-\n     Mexico border will require significant investments in highway \n     infrastructure capacity and motor carrier safety enforcement \n     at a time when border States face extreme difficulty in \n     meeting current highway funding needs;\n       (3) the full benefits of increased international trade can \n     be realized only if delays at the borders are significantly \n     reduced; and\n       (4) the increased revenues to the general fund of the \n     Treasury described in paragraph (1) should be sufficient to \n     provide Federal funding for transportation improvements \n     required to accommodate NAFTA-generated traffic, in an amount \n     above and beyond regular Federal transportation funding \n     apportionments.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to reward States for collecting Medicaid funds \nexpended on tobacco-related illnesses, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n               the tobacco medicaid recovery act of 1996\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Tobacco \nMedicaid Recovery Act, along with Senator Wellstone.\n  This bill will create a new Federal/State partnership to help recover \nMedicaid costs associated with tobacco use.\n  Mr. President, for years, the tobacco industry has hooked Americans \non products that cause death and disease. They've made billions of \ndollars in the process. But they've never been held accountable.\n  When big tobacco sells it's deadly products, all Americans pay the \nprice. Not only through the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers \nwho are lost to lung cancer and other diseases. But through the higher \ntaxes that must be paid to support programs like Medicaid.\n  Mr. President, 10 courageous states are suing the tobacco industry \nfor the large Medicaid costs associated with tobacco use. There are two \nother states, including New Jersey, that will soon file suit and 10 \nothers that may file before the summer is out. These suits enjoy \nbipartisan support from Democratic and Republican governors and \nDemocratic and Republican state attorney generals. In fact, I was \npleased to be joined this morning in unveiling this legislation with \nMike Moore, attorney general from Mississippi, Hubert ``Skip'' \nHumphrey, attorney general from Minnesota, and Bob Butterworth, \nattorney general from Florida. They are all leaders in suing the \ntobacco industry for Medicaid costs and strongly support this \nlegislation. The Minnesota suit is being supported by its Republican \nGovernor, Arne Carlson, and the Florida suit is being supported by its \nDemocratic Governor, our former colleague Lawton Chiles.\n  Mr. President, the tobacco industry is fighting hard to avoid being \nheld accountable. It doesn't just use every hardball legal tactic in \nthe book. It has even sent its hired guns into state attorney generals' \noffices to intimidate them.\n  In one case, a state official was warned not to sue the industry--and \nif the state did, the industry would force the state to pay enormous \nsums--including the possible deposition of every single Medicaid \nrecipient in that state.\n  Mr. President, the courageous states, like Mississippi, Minnesota and \nFlorida, who have taken on the tobacco companies deserve more Federal \nsupport--because they are doing the Federal taxpayers' bidding. If they \nare successful in their litigation, they must return the Federal \nportion of Medicaid funds to Washington. The Federal government should \nbe helping them get this money, not sitting on its hands.\n  This legislation would allow the states to keep a third of the \nFederal\n\n[[Page S6531]]\n\nportion to better serve the needs of their Medicaid recipients--their \nseniors, disabled, poor children and pregnant women.\n  Another third of the Federal share would go to the National \nInstitutes of Health to conduct research on the diseases caused by \ntobacco products, like lung cancer and heart disease.\n  Finally, the balance would go into the Federal Treasury to help \nreduce the deficit.\n  Currently, many states are sitting on the fence, thinking how \ndifficult and expensive it will be to sue the tobacco industry. This \nbill may get them off the fence, and into battle with the industry.\n  Mr. President, it is time for the Federal government to help states \nget the taxpayers' money back. It is time to reward the states for \ntrying to hold the tobacco companies accountable, and provide an \nincentive for those considering entering the fray.\n  This bill could provide states with millions in much needed Medicaid \nfunds. It could increase funding for the National Institutes of Health. \nAnd it will not increase the deficit.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \ncommon sense legislation that will help our state taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the legislation \nand a summary of it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1892\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Tobacco Medicaid Recovery \n     Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Federal taxpayers pay for approximately $20,000,000,000 \n     each year in Federal health expenditures to treat tobacco-\n     related illnesses, including expenditures incurred under the \n     medicare and medicaid programs operated under titles XVIII \n     and XIX of the Social Security Act, health care programs \n     carried out by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under \n     chapter 17 of title 38, United States Code, and other Federal \n     health care programs. These expenditures often contribute to \n     an increase in the Federal budget deficit.\n       (2) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, tobacco-related illnesses cost the medicaid \n     program under title XIX of the Social Security Act \n     $5,100,000,000 each year.\n       (3) The efforts of several States that are attempting under \n     Federal law, including in some cases, under the Federal anti-\n     racketeering statutes, or under State law, to recover the \n     health care costs incurred under the medicaid program for the \n     treatment of individuals with diseases attributable to the \n     use of tobacco products from the manufacturers of such \n     products, are to be commended.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to reward States \n     that successfully recover the Federal and State health care \n     costs incurred under the medicaid program for the treatment \n     of individuals with diseases attributable to the use of \n     tobacco products by providing increased funding for their \n     medicaid programs and to provide increased resources to the \n     National Institutes of Health.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The Secretary shall treat the amount so \n     determined as an overpayment under this section, in \n     accordance with paragraph (2)(A), and with respect to such \n     amount shall do the following:\n       ``(i) Provide that the State shall retain \\1/3\\ of such \n     amount, for the purpose of using such funds to meet the non-\n     Federal share of expenditures under the State plan with \n     respect to which payments may be made under this title.\n       ``(ii) Pay \\1/3\\ of such amount to the Director of the \n     National Institutes of Health, for the purpose of conducting \n     disease research.\n       ``(B) Any amount of new budget authority or outlays \n     resulting from the provisions of this paragraph shall not be \n     counted for any purpose under section 251 or 252 of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       ``(C) For purposes of this paragraph--\n       ``(i) the term `manufacturer of tobacco products' has the \n     meaning given such term by section 5702(d) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986; and\n       ``(ii) the term `tobacco products' has the meaning given \n     such term by section 5702(c) of such Code.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 1902(a) (42 U.S.C. \n     1396a(a)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (61);\n       (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (62) and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by inserting after paragraph (62) the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(63) provide that the State shall provide prompt notice \n     to the Secretary of the amount of any recovery from a \n     manufacturer of tobacco products, as defined in section \n     1903(d)(7)(C)(i), of expenditures for medical assistance \n     provided under such plan for the treatment of individuals \n     with diseases attributable to the use of tobacco products, as \n     defined in section 1903(d)(7)(C)(ii).''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsections (a) \n     and (b) shall apply to amounts recovered on and after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Lautenberg Bill to Reward States for Recouping Medicaid Expenditures \n                     for Tobacco-Related Illnesses\n\n       This legislation recognizes the following:\n       States who sue the tobacco industry for Medicaid costs face \n     tremendous expenses, intimidation and extraordinary legal \n     tactics from the tobacco industry.\n       Pursuant to the Medicaid statute and other legal \n     interpretations, states must return the Federal Medicaid \n     share of any award to the Federal government.\n       States should be rewarded for their efforts to recoup \n     Federal tax dollars.\n       This bill will do the following:\n       Upon a settlement or a jury award between a state and a \n     tobacco company, the Federal government shall return 33 \n     percent of the Federal share of the award to the states to be \n     used in their Medicaid programs.\n       Another 33 percent of the Federal share shall be placed in \n     an NIH Trust Fund to be used for research on lung cancer, \n     heart disease and other illnesses.\n       The final 34 percent of the Federal share shall be used for \n     deficit reduction.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1893. A bill to provide for the settlement of issues and claims \nrelated to the trust lands of the Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla \nIndians, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n          the torres-martinez settlement agreement act of 1996\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nthat will ratify the settlement agreement negotiated by the U.S. \nDepartments of the Interior and Justice, Imperial Irrigation Water \nDistrict, Coachella Valley Water District, and the Torres-Martinez \nDesert Cahuilla Indian Tribe. This settlement agreement resolves a long \nstanding dispute to replace reservation lands the Torres-Martinez Tribe \nlost due to flooding from the Salton Sea.\n  In 1876, the Torres-Martinez Indian Reservation was created by a 640-\nacre section of land in Coachella Valley, California at the northern \nend of the Salton Sink. The Reservation was expanded in 1891 adding \napproximately 12,000 acres to the original 640-acre reservation. \nBetween 1905 and 1907, flood waters of the Colorado River filled the \nSalton Sink, creating the Salton Sea, inundating approximately 2,000 \nacres of the reservation lands. In 1909, an additional 9,000 acres of \nland were then submerged under the Salton Sea.\n  Today, the federal government holds 25,000 acres of the reservation \nin trust for the Tribe. Of this parcel, 11,800 acres is either \ncurrently under water or has been condemned as uninhabitable due to \nrunoff and drainage water from the irrigation systems of the Imperial, \nCoachella, and Mexicali Valleys into the Salton Sea. Since 1982, the \nUnited States government, acting for the Tribe, has been negotiating \nwith the Imperial and Coachella Valley Water Districts to compensate \nthe Tribes for the loss of their reservation lands.\n  In the settlement agreement, the Torres-Martinez Indian Tribe will \nreceive $14 million: $10 million from the U.S. government and $4 \nmillion from the water districts. From these funds, the Tribe can \nacquire and take into trust 11,800 acres of land. Of these parcels, \n11,160 must be contiguous to existing reservation land. The Tribe can \nacquire the remaining 640 acres within the Coachella Valley only if the \nlocal\n\n[[Page S6532]]\n\ngoverning body or Riverside County does not object. The Tribe's right \nto conduct gaming on lands taken into trust is limited and restricted \nto one gaming operation on one site.\n  In return, the irrigation districts would be granted a permanent \nflowage easement over tribal and Federal lands within the minus 220 \nfoot contour of the Salton Sink.\n  The settlement of this land dispute has been a major concern for many \nyears. It has taken more than ten years for all parties involved to \nreach a consensus on the settlement agreement. There have been \ncompeting interests and priorities for everyone involved, including \ncompletion of the construction of the Route 86 Expressway project.\n  All parties involved in negotiating this settlement agreement have \nworked hard to reach a consensus to implement this agreement. The Tribe \nhas agreed to give local communities the right to veto its purchase of \nland and Riverside County has passed a resolution in support of this \nsettlement agreement. Moreover, construction of Route 86 will progress.\n  I commend the Departments of the Interior and Justice, the Coachella \nand Imperial Water Districts, and the Torres-Martinez Tribe for \nremaining committed to resolving this issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution passed by \nRiverside County in support of the agreement and correspondence I have \nreceived from the Water Districts and the Torres-Martinez Tribe \nindicating the accuracy of this legislation in completely implementing \nthe settlement agreement, be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, Congressman Sonny Bono introduced \nidentical legislation last Thursday and the Native American and Insular \nAffairs Subcommittee of the House Resources Committee has scheduled \nhearings this afternoon on this legislation. I look forward to working \nwith the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs to implement this agreement \nin law and the Appropriations Committee to provide funds as outlined in \nthe settlement agreement.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me today in enacting this legislation.\n\n\n                               exhibit 1\n\n Submittal to the Board of Supervisors, County of Riverside, State of \n                               California\n\n     From: Supervisor Wilson.\n     Subject: Support of Legislation for Settlement With Torres-\n         Martinez Indian Tribe.\n       Recommended Motion: That the Board take a position in \n     support of the attached draft legislation, proposed by \n     Congressman Sonny Bono and providing for settlement with the \n     Torres-Martinez Indian Tribe by providing compensation for \n     acquisition of lands in the Coachella Valley; further, direct \n     the county Executive Office to immediately forward copies of \n     the Board Minute Order to members of California's \n     Congressional delegation.\n       Justification: The accidental creation of the Salton Sea in \n     1905-1907 resulted in approximately 12,000 acres of Torres-\n     Martinez Indian Tribal lands in the southeastern Coachella \n     Valley being either underwater or unusable. There has been \n     litigation since 1982 by the Federal Government on behalf of \n     the Tribe against Coachella Valley Water District and \n     Imperial Irrigation District, and the Tribe itself filed \n     litigation in 1991. In addition to the issue of compensation \n     to the Tribe, the completion of Highway 86 is also at risk, \n     as the alignment and construction of the highway is \n     contingent on right-of-way on existing Tribal lands.\n       The attached draft legislation has been developed in \n     consultation with all parties, and I am advised that all are \n     in agreement with its provisions. It provides the Tribe with \n     funds to acquire 12,000 acres, either in entirety in the \n     ``primary'' acquisition area (Avenue 56, also known as \n     Airport Blvd., south to the Riverside/Imperial County line) \n     which is adjacent to existing Tribal lands, or up to 640 \n     acres (out of the total 12,000) in the ``secondary'' \n     acquisition area (the remainder of the Coachella Valley, \n     generally from Desert Hot Springs southeast to Avenue 56).\n       Finally, the legislation authorizes the Tribe to establish \n     a single gaming site, and provides land use jurisdiction \n     within the secondary acquisition area with the ability to \n     protest acquisition/conversion of land to Tribal status \n     within 60 days of being notified of the Tribe's intent.\n       County Counsel worked directly with Congressman Bono's \n     staff in development of the draft legislation, and I urge the \n     Board's support of this proposed settlement.\n     Roy Wilson.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                              Bayh, Connaughton & Malone, P.G.\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 14, 1996.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I would like to transmit \n     correspondence from Coachella Valley Water District, the \n     Imperial Irrigation District and the Torres-Martinez Desert \n     Cahuilla Indians regarding the Torres-Martinez settlement \n     legislation (H.R. 3640).\n       For the past four years, on behalf of the water districts \n     and in full cooperation with the Tribe, I have assisted in \n     facilitating this settlement through the Departments of the \n     Interior and Justice. The legislation introduced by Rep. Bono \n     in the House accurately and completely implements the \n     settlement agreement. Thus, all parties support enactment of \n     this legislation and ask that you sponsor the companion bill \n     on the Senate side.\n       We appreciate your consideration of our request and are \n     grateful for all of the help we have received from Mia Ellis, \n     Susy Elfving and your other staff members over the past \n     several years.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1791, President George Washington commissioned \n     Pierre Charles L`Enfant to draft a blueprint for America's \n     new capital city; they envisioned Pennsylvania Avenue as a \n     bold, ceremonial boulevard physically linking the U.S. \n     Capitol building and the White House, and symbolically the \n     Legislative and Executive branches of government.\n       (2) An integral element of the District of Columbia, \n     Pennsylvania Avenue stood for 195 years as a vital, working, \n     unbroken roadway, elevating it into a place of national \n     importance as ``America's Main Street''.\n       (3) 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the White House, has become \n     America's most recognized address and a primary destination \n     of visitors to the Nation's Capital; ``the People's House'' \n     is host to 5,000 tourists daily, and 15,000,000 annually.\n       (4) As home to the President, and given its prominent \n     location on Pennsylvania Avenue and its proximity to the \n     People, the White House has become a powerful symbol of \n     freedom, openness, and an individual's access to their \n     government.\n       (5) On May 20, 1995, citing possible security risks from \n     vehicles transporting terrorist bombs, President Clinton \n     ordered the Secret Service, in conjunction with the \n     Department of the Treasury, to close Pennsylvania Avenue to \n     vehicular traffic for two blocks in front of the White House.\n       (6) While the security of the President and visitors to the \n     White House is of grave concern and is not to be taken \n     lightly, the need to assure the President's safety must be \n     balanced with the expectation of freedom inherent in a \n     democracy; the present situation is tilted too heavily toward \n     security at freedom's expense.\n       (7) By impeding access and imposing undue hardships upon \n     tourists, residents of the District, commuters, and local \n     business owners and their customers, the closure of \n     Pennsylvania Avenue, undertaken without the counsel of the \n     government of the District of Columbia, has replaced the \n     former openness of the area surrounding the White House with \n     barricades, additional security checkpoints, and an \n     atmosphere of fear and distrust.\n       (8) In the year following the closure of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue, the taxpayers have borne a significant burden for \n     additional security measures along the Avenue near the White \n     House.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the President should direct the Department of the \n     Treasury and the Secret Service to work with the Government \n     of the District of Columbia to develop a plan for the \n     permanent reopening to vehicular traffic of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue in front of the White House in order to restore the \n     Avenue to its original state and return it to the people.\n                                 ______\n\n\n               FORD (AND BROWN) AMENDMENTS NOS. 4053-4054\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. FORD (for himself and Mr. Brown) submitted two amendments \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill, S. 1745, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 4053\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 113.

SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING THE UNITED STATES-JAPAN \n                   SEMICONDUCTOR TRADE AGREEMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States and Japan share a long and important \n     bilateral relationship which serves as an anchor of peace and \n     stability in the Asia Pacific region, an alliance which was \n     reaffirmed at the recent summit meeting between President \n     Clinton and Prime Minister Hashimoto in Tokyo.\n       (2) The Japanese economy has experienced difficulty over \n     the past few years, demonstrating that it is no longer \n     possible for Japan, the world's second largest economy, to \n     use exports as the sole-engine of economic growth, but that \n     the Government of Japan must promote deregulation of its \n     domestic economy in order to increase economic growth.\n       (3) Deregulation of the Japanese economy requires \n     government attention to the removal of barriers to imports of \n     manufactured goods.\n       (4) The United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement \n     has begun the process of deregulation in the semiconductor \n     sector and is opening the Japanese market to competitive \n     foreign products.\n       (5) The United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement \n     has put in place both government-to-government and industry-\n     to-industry mechanisms which have played a vital role in \n     allowing cooperation to replace conflict in this important \n     high technology sector.\n       (6) The mechanisms include joint calculation of foreign \n     market share, deterrence of dumping, and promotion of \n     industrial cooperation in the design of foreign semiconductor \n     devices.\n       (7) Because of these actions under the United States-Japan \n     Semiconductor Trade Agreement, the United States and Japan \n     today enjoy trade in semiconductors which is mutually \n     beneficial, harmonious, and free from the friction that once \n     characterized the semiconductor industry.\n       (8) Because of structural barriers in Japan, a gap still \n     remains between the share of the\n\n[[Page S6536]]\n\n     world market for semiconductor products outside Japan that \n     the United States and other foreign semiconductor sources are \n     able to capture through competitiveness and the share of the \n     Japanese semiconductor market that the United States and \n     those other courses are able to capture through \n     competitiveness, and that gap is consistent with the full \n     range of semiconductor products as well as a full range of \n     end-use applications.\n       (9) The competitiveness and health of the United States \n     semiconductor industry is of critical importance to the \n     overall economic well-being and high technology defense \n     capabilities of the United States.\n       (10) The economic interests of both the United States and \n     Japan are best served by well functioning, open markets, \n     deterrence of dumping, and continuing good cooperative \n     relationships in all sectors, including semiconductors.\n       (11) A strong and healthy military and political alliance \n     between the United States and Japan requires continuation of \n     the industrial and economic cooperation promoted by the \n     United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement.\n       (12) President Clinton has called on the Government of \n     Japan to agree to a continuation of a United States-Japan \n     Semiconductor Trade Agreement beyond the current agreement's \n     expiration on July 31, 1996.\n       (13) The Government of Japan has opposed any continuation \n     of a government-to-government agreement to promote \n     cooperation in United States-Japan semiconductor trade.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) it is regrettable that the Government of Japan has \n     refused to consider continuation of a government-to-\n     government agreement to ensure that cooperation continues in \n     the semiconductor sector beyond the expiration of the \n     Semiconductor Trade Agreement on July 31, 1996; and\n       (2) the President should take all necessary and appropriate \n     actions to ensure the continuation of a government-to-\n     government United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement \n     before the current agreement expires on that date.\n       (c) Definition.--As used in this section, the term ``United \n     States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement'' refers to the \n     agreement between the United States and Japan concerning \n     trade in semiconductor products, with arrangement, done by \n     exchange of letters at Washington on June 11, 1991.\n                                 ______\n\n\n               BINGAMAN (AND BUMPERS) AMENDMENT NO. 4058\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Bumpers) proposed an amendment to \nthe bill, S. 1745, supra;

Mr. President, when Congress passed legislation last \nyear transferring the authority to review proposed rail mergers from \nthe former Interstate Commerce Commission to the Surface Transportation \nBoard, a major issue of concern in the Senate was whether or not the \nBoard should retain exclusive jurisdiction over ensuring that healthy \ncompetition is protected before any proposed merger is approved. That \ncongressionally imposed responsibility is indeed important and its \nfirst major test will be seen soon when the Board issues its decision \non the proposed merger of the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific \nRailroads.\n  Never before has such a large consolidation of control over rail \ntraffic been\n\n[[Page S6543]]\n\nproposed and never before have so many expressed such strong \nreservations about the dangers to competition posed by such a merger.\n  The Board must discharge its responsibility to protect competition \nand in this case to do so, it must condition approval of the proposed \nmerger with mandatory divestiture of the parallel lines created as a \nresult of the merger to an independent rail competitor.\n  This condition is essential to approve the proposed merger. Granting \ntrackage rights alone is not sufficient to protect competition. In \nreviewing this question, the Board should consider the following:\n  First, the proposed merger would leave two railroads in the West, the \ncombined UP-SP and the BN-Santa Fe, with control of 90 percent of the \nrail traffic in the West, resulting in reduced competition, higher \nshipping rates, and reduced service.\n  Second, the proposed merger will cause many shippers to go from three \ncarriers to two, and many more from two carriers to only one. The \nDepartment of Justice's review estimates over $6 billion in shipping \ntraffic would be affected by this reduced competition.\n  Third, oddly enough, the competitive harm in this proposed merger is \ntwo times the competitive harm of the proposed Santa Fe-Southern \nPacific merger proposed and rejected in the mid-1980's.\n  It is not surprising that numerous shipping groups have publicly \nopposed the merger in its present form and favor divestiture to solve \nthe competitive problems. These groups include the Society of Plastics, \nthe NIT League, and the Gulf States of Texas and Louisiana. The \nAmerican Farm Bureau, National Grange, and National Farm Bureau are \namong the many agriculture groups opposed to the merger and requesting \nconditions other than the BNSF-CMA agreement. Divestiture of parallel \ntracks and facilities will result in preservation of competitive \noptions for all shippers who would otherwise see reduction in \ncompetition from two carriers to one, and for a significant number who \nwould go from three to two.\n  Mr. President, last fall I joined with the chairman of the House \nSmall Business Committee, Congresswoman Jan Meyers, in convening a \njoint session of our Small Business Committees, to hear from small \nshippers who have been affected by mega-mergers like this in the past \nand who know what the consequences of this proposed merger, if approved \nin its current form, will be for them in the future. They were \nunanimous. They know that only actual, real competition protects them \nfrom the serious consequences of being captive to a single shipper. \nThey have come out in droves to voice their fears in their public \nfiling to the Board. Their interests collectively must be protected.\n  Because of the intense interest in these parallel lines by competing \ncarriers, divestiture would not force the applicants to sell any of \nthese lines for less then their market value. Divestiture allows the \nmerger to go forward and gives the UP and SP the benefits of end-to-end \nefficiency and the administrative-corporate consolidation that they \nwant while protecting competition for shippers.\n  Unfortunately, the trackage rights solution to these serious threats \nto competition will not resolve the problems. Even with added access, \ncompetitors operating over lines controlled by an aggressively \ncompetitive owner are inferior to the owner of the line who uses \ncontrol of access to place the competitor at a serious disadvantage. \nTrackage rights alone do not constitute available competition, only \naccess to actual moving traffic does. That can be achieved only by \nmandatory divestiture of parallel lines.\n  The Departments of Justice, Transportation, and Agriculture oppose \nthe current proposed merger due to these competitive problems. Numerous \nshippers groups and many of the affected States have voiced concerns as \nwell. Mr. President, I believe Congress wants the Board to discharge \nits duty to protect competition. We will see this decision as the \ncrucial test whether it will or will not.\n  Congress explicitly recognized divestiture as a viable condition \navailable to the Board when it passed the ICC Termination Act creating \nthe Surface Transportation Board. Congress specifically wrote \ndivestiture into the new law with this need in mind. Divestiture to the \nhighest bidder certainly promotes free-market competition. The Board \nclearly has this authority and should use it to protect \ncompetition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/19/senate-section/article/S6542-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6543-S6544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    FINAL REPORT BY THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE WHITEWATER\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, yesterday, after 13 months, 51 \nhearings, 159 witnesses, thousands of pages of documents, and nearly 2 \nmillion taxpayer dollars, the Special Committee To Investigate \nWhitewater concluded its work.\n  Our committee found no instance in which the President or the First \nLady have acted unethically, illegally or abused their power.\n  Mr. President, the special committee released two varying reports \nyesterday: A Republican majority report and a Democratic minority \nreport. Our committee started its work in true bipartisan fashion. \nUnfortunately, as the investigation repeatedly failed to produce any \nsubstantive or legitimate wrongdoing by the President, the majority \nveered the committee down a path of partisan politics and speculation. \nAs a result, our bipartisan teamwork broke down. It disintegrated to a \npoint that two separate reports are needed in order to report our \nfindings as clearly as possible.\n  The biggest failing of this committee, however, was our failure to \nkeep faith with the American people. For months, I reminded our \ncommittee of the importance of being credible and of the need to \nmaintain the confidence of the American people. Constituents in my home \nState often expressed their displeasure with our committee's partisan \npolitics. And they told me they no longer trusted our committee to find \nthe truth in a fair and impartial manner.\n  Mr. President, we were charged with the mission of finding all of the \nfacts relating to the President's relationship with Whitewater and \nrelated matters. That's what the American people wanted us to do. That \nis what they expected us to do. Unfortunately, the majority decided to \nmake allegations first, and find the facts second. If the facts failed \nto support the allegations, the majority simply discarded the facts.\n  I believe, and most of my colleagues will agree, that there were few \ninstances where the White House could have produced documents faster or \nanswered questions more quickly. In its attempt to be careful and \ncautious, the White House ultimately ran into perception problems. The \nWhite House looked as if it was covering up the truth. Once all the \ninformation was gathered, we learned the White House had not acted \nimproperly--rather in many cases it was as open and forthcoming as \npossible. In no way did the White House act to obstruct justice or \nattempt to impede this committee's investigation.\n  The majority granted the special committee $400,000 to extend our \nhearings well beyond our original February deadline. Nearly 4 months \nlater, our committee conducted only 10 more hearings. This track record \nmakes it very clear to me that we could have concluded our work by the \noriginal deadline, and that the majority simply intended to continue \nthese hearings further into the Presidential election season.\n  Now, after finding no wrongdoing by the President in relation to the \nsubject at hand--Whitewater and Madison Guaranty--the Majority has \nleaked reports that it intends to pursue perjury charges on three of \nthe President's aides and advisers. This is a clear attempt to move \nattention away from the fruitless investigation by creating a new \nallegation. Like many of the smoking guns that amounted to no more than \nsquirt guns, it again appears to be another effort to make news where \nthere is no news, and to make political noise in an election year.\n  Our committee spent nearly $2 million to examine the facts. The \nResolution Trust Corporation [RTC] spent nearly $4 million conducting \nan independent investigation clearing the Clintons of any wrongdoing. \nAnd the independent counsel has spent more than $26 million on its \nongoing investigation. Including the House committee hearings, nearly \n$40 million of public money has been spent to bring all relevant \ninformation into the open.\n\n[[Page S6544]]\n\n The final reports put to rest the suicide of Vince Foster, concluded \nthe Clinton White House did not interfere with RTC and Department of \nJustice investigations, and discovered then-Governor Clinton did not \nmisuse his power to influence State regulators.\n  It is time for us to move beyond this political issue. It is time for \nCongress to address the issues that really concern the American people. \nWhen I go home people ask me what Congress has done to preserve their \nquality of life, what Congress has done to improve our education \nsystem, and what Congress has done to improve our health care delivery \nsystem. I can count on one hand the number of times somebody asked me \nabout Whitewater over the past 2 years.\n  As a member of the Special Whitewater Committee, I took my job \nseriously. I understood the importance of our committee, and I stand by \nthe minority report. Our report studies the facts very carefully, and \nafter compiling all of the facts we made our conclusions accordingly. I \nurge all interested parties to read this report, and I am hopeful it \ncompletes the mission we were instructed to pursue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/19/senate-section/article/S6543-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JIM SMITH\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nKentucky businessman whose success allowed him to give something back \nto Kentucky. Jim Smith, who passed away May 31, was one of western \nKentucky's most successful self-made businessmen.\n  Mr. Smith, the youngest of eight children, dropped out of school in \nthe 10th grade. After being involved in several construction company \npartnerships, he struck out on his own and turned one bulldozer into a \nmulti-million dollar construction business. Jim Smith Construction Co. \nbuilt most of the major highways in western Kentucky. He also expanded \ninto other areas, including coal, transportation, a hotel, and a \nrestaurant.\n  A close friend and business partner, David Reed, was quoted in the \nPaducah Sun as saying, ``Those of us who know Jim well realize \nimmediately the void his passing will mean, not only to us personally \nbut to all of western Kentucky.'' Former Kentucky Gov. Julian Carroll \nsaid of Mr. Smith, ``I've known him as a friend, a businessman, a \ncitizen of the community, a Christian * * * but of all the roles that \nJim filled in his life, the one that he relished the most, and agonized \nover the most, was being the father of four sons.'' Even though he was \nwealthy, Mr. Smith required his sons to work and earn their living.\n  Mr. Smith is survived by his wife, Sandy; four sons, Mike, Rex, \nChris, and Steve; two stepchildren, Joelle Smith and Joel Weaver; three \nbrothers, Hiram, Hugh, and Bill Smith; and three sisters, Geneva \nYoungblood, Imogene Riggs, and Lucille Wade. I would ask that my \ncolleagues join me in honoring this extraordinary Kentuckian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/19/senate-section/article/S6544-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HIDDEN HUMAN TOLL OF GAMBLING\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, in all the discussion about the \nproblems of gambling in the United States, most of us in those \ndiscussions use statistics.\n  What we frequently fail to understand are the human beings involved \nin the addiction.\n  Ken Adelman, the former head of The Arms Control and Disarmament \nAgency and now a columnist who is nationally syndicated, recently had a \ncolumn in the Washington Times that told about a cousin of his.\n  It tells in simple, graphic terms why we need a commission to look at \nthis problem.\n  I don't know how many personal cases I have heard of since \nintroducing the bill on the commission, but it is enough to encourage \nme to fight for its creation, and I hope my colleagues will have the \ngood sense to pass the measure and create the commission.\n  I ask that the Washington Times column be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 13, 1996]\n\n                     Hidden Human Toll of Gambling\n\n                            (By Ken Adelman)\n\n       Stopping for a fund-raiser in Las Vegas last weekend, Bill \n     Clinton solicited big gambling bucks, as has Bob Dole. Lost \n     in the policy debate over state-sponsored gambling--via \n     lotteries, casinos, horse races, whatever--is the personal \n     dimension.\n       This hasn't been lost on our family, which has endured pain \n     from my first cousin, Alby, becoming a compulsive gambler. At \n     15 years old, I should have sensed Alby's problem when our \n     grandfather, Papa, took us on a trip abroad. The whole way \n     Alby wanted to bet on whose room would have a higher number \n     (Papa's or ours), whether our seats would be on the right or \n     left side of the airplane, on anything really. He was--and \n     presumably is, though I haven't seen him in years--an \n     engaging and brilliant fellow. We never suspected the years \n     of jail and a failed life gambling would bring.\n       Between prison sentences, beginning at age 16 or so, Alby \n     would hit the track, poker tables, and sports events. No \n     state lotteries had yet been established, so we can't blame \n     them for our family woes. How much state-sponsored gambling, \n     now dubbed ``gaming,'' multiplies the number of Albys in \n     America should be a key focus of the national commission on \n     gambling, which Congress is now debating.\n       ``The main ambitions I ever had were fantasies,'' Alby told \n     me in 1975, when I spent six months researching his life. He \n     poured his mathematical genius, personality and wit into \n     gambling. Alby won big at times--$10,000 in one day and \n     $7,700 in one race. But those triumphs were fleeting as all \n     winnings went back into the game. The amounts were \n     staggering, at least to me. Alby burned through more than $1 \n     million before turning 30. He squandered it all, as well as \n     two marriages and a host of natural abilities.\n       Alby became attracted and then addicted to horse-racing \n     while still in high school. ``When you're at the track or \n     when you're gambling, you're in a different world,'' he \n     mused. ``There's nothing else that matters until you walk \n     into reality again. It's a dream world.'' Gambling became his \n     trademark.\n       ``When I won, I would have a lot of money in my pocket and \n     flash it around. It was an ego trip for me.'' And a macho \n     thing, since compulsive gambling is mostly a man's disease. \n     Unlike alcoholism or drug addiction, only 10 percent of \n     compulsive gamblers are women.\n       But women become victims. One elderly landlady in New \n     Mexico housed Alby and a buddy when they were 16. After they \n     skipped out without paying rent, she wrote Alby's parents, \n     ``They were both good, likable kids.'' She missed them after \n     Alby ``left town like something from a cannon. He said he \n     needed to return home on account of a death of a sister.'' No \n     sister had died. Such began a life of lies.\n       Though having now spent more than half his life behind \n     bars, Alby never considered himself a criminal. He trashed \n     common convicts, especially armed robbers: ``They're \n     stupidest people in the world. They go to jail for 10 years \n     for a hundred bucks when I can get $50,000 with a pen in hand \n     rather than a gun.''\n       Like most compulsive gamblers, Alby abhors violence. None \n     of his crimes involved guns, knives or physical assaults. \n     They involved passing bad checks and schemes of every sort. \n     Though non-violent, they still hurt others, especially family \n     members. Alby's father bailed him out of jail and dangerous \n     situations for several years before giving up. His \n     grandfather lasted longer, but after Alby stole his prized \n     stamp collection and World War I medals, he too gave up.\n       The burden falls too on friends and neighbors. Rummaging \n     through family correspondence, I came across scores of sad \n     stories. One came from the mother of a high school buddy who \n     ``loaned'' Alby his coin collection but never got it \n     back.``My son is a stranger to you but he is my only child \n     and the most important person in the world to me,'' she wrote \n     Alby's folks. ``The coins he's been saving since he was \n     little were his only concrete asset. They are now gone.\n       Though sharing an addiction, compulsive gamblers differ \n     from drug and alcohol abusers. The gambling life is one of \n     involvement and stimuli. Drug and alcohol addicts lead a life \n     of withdrawal and passivity.\n       While gambling is as old as humanity itself--archaeologists \n     have found a 4,000-year-old lamb bone used as dice--\n     compulsive gambling is a relatively new affliction. Upward of \n     10 million compulsive gamblers in America--perhaps 10 times \n     the number of drug addicts--may be increasing in numbers now. \n     For state and local lotteries not only furnish the \n     opportunity, but encourage ``striking it rich'' without any \n     effort.\n       Alby's tragedy may become epidemic since legalized gambling \n     has increased 2,800 percent over the past two decades. To \n     grasp this danger, imagine the furor if state and local \n     governments not only legalized drug sale and use but \n     themselves sold and advertised drugs to the general public.\n       As Congress debates establishing a national commission on \n     the effects of gambling, everyone has focused on the \n     commission's subpoena powers. More critical would be a focus \n     on the human toll gambling takes, on tales of wasted lives, \n     like Alby's.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/19/senate-section/article/S6544-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6544-S6545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               INS EMPLOYMENT VERIFICATION PILOT PROJECT\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, at the end of May, the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service and a consortium of meatpacking companies \nannounced an innovative pilot project in which the companies will \nvoluntarily verify the employment eligibility of noncitizens who seek \nemployment.\n  I commend the meatpacking industry, specifically IBP and BeefAmerica\n\n[[Page S6545]]\n\nin Nebraska, as well as companies elsewhere in recognizing that the \njobs they offer are a major draw for immigrants, some of whom are not \nin the country legally, and for taking the initiative to help root out \nthose who are not eligible to work. The meatpacking industry wants to \nhire legal workers; this industry is also well aware of how difficult a \ntask that can be given the availability of forged documents. The \nEmployment Verification Pilot will test, across an entire industry, a \nhiring system that has already demonstrated success in smaller pilot \nprojects.\n  In a relatively short period of time we should expect that the word \nwill spread: Nebraska and other States with good job opportunities will \nkeep the welcome mat out for those authorized to work, but will shut \nthe door to those who are not. The participating companies together \nemploy about 56,000 workers at 48 sites in 10 States. Participation by \nthese employers ensures that about 80 percent of the meatpacking \nindustry will be covered.\n  I also commend the INS for their response to an issue of utmost \nimportance to the country--protecting American jobs and continuing \nefforts to reduce the primary incentive for illegal immigration--the \njob magnet. I also want to laud the INS for recognizing the usefulness \nof a voluntary system. By participating with employers in fashioning \nthe program, the INS has forged a partnership that will lead to \nsuccess.\n  The process is simple. Employers who volunteer to participate can \nquickly verify with INS, through a computer, whether their newly hired, \nnoncitizen employees are authorized to work. In most cases, \nverification will be received in minutes. Through quick verification, \nthis project cracks down on illegal employment while protecting the \nrights of legal immigrant workers.\n  I believe this pilot project has the potential to restore American's \nfaith in the legal immigration system and I look forward to the \nevaluation of the program after it has gotten off the ground. I also \nlook forward to continue working with INS and employers to ensure that \nAmericans jobs are protected and available for those who are in the \nUnited States legally.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/19/senate-section/article/S6544-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF BASEBALL\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on a warm spring afternoon, on \nJune 19, 1846, the seeds of modern baseball were planted in the fertile \nsoil of New Jersey. On that day, one of baseball's first teams, the \nKnickerbockers, invited a group known as the New York City Club to join \nthem for a game of ball. They met on the Elysian Fields of Hoboken, NJ, \nand played under a unique set of rules, which the Knickerbockers had \nrecently devised. With the first pitch, the modern game of baseball was \nborn. The new pastime quickly captured the young Nation's interest and \nfired its imagination. Clubs were soon modeling themselves upon the \nKnickerbockers, and Hoboken's Elysian Fields became one of the first \ngreat centers of baseball activity in the United States.\n  Over the last 150 years, the seed first planted in New Jersey became \nfirmly rooted in the American landscape and then spread around the \nglobe.\n  But although baseball is enjoyed throughout the world, it is a \nuniquely American game. It both mirrors and molds our national \ncharacter.\n  It has been said that ``Whoever wants to know the hearts and minds of \nAmerica had better learn baseball.'' This is undeniably true, because \nbaseball is one of the world's most democratic games. Each team has \nequal opportunity to win, since no timeclock decides when the game is \ndone. Only hard work and teamwork determine a winner. What could better \nreflect our national philosophy?\n  But baseball not only mirrors our character, it also molds it. For \ngenerations of immigrant children, their first American experience \noften came on the baseball diamond. During World War II, when our male \nbaseball players joined the war effort, all-female teams were formed. \nDisplaying exceptional talent and tenacity, these ballplayers vividly \ndemonstrated that a woman could fill a man's shoes. In 1947, baseball \nset a powerful example for the Nation; when Jackie Robinson joined the \nBrooklyn Dodgers, professional baseball became one of the standard \nbearers of the desegregation movement.\n  For all that baseball has done, perhaps its greatest contribution is \nsimply the bond that it forms between one generation of Americans and \nthe next. It is a bond forged between children and parents who have \nspent long days together at the ballpark or on the ballfield.\n  As Americans, we come from diverse cultures, often with very \ndifferent customs and beliefs. It is only our common experiences that \nbind us together as a nation. Whether playing it or watching it, \nbaseball has been one of the few shared experiences enjoyed by all of \nus, a common thread which has helped stitch together the tapestry of \nAmerica. So, it is no exaggeration to say that baseball is, and will \nalways be, a part of our national identity, our national heritage, and \nour national greatness.\n  I am pleased to recognize the important role which New Jersey played \nin baseball's history. Too few people realize that baseball's first \nmatch game was played in Hoboken. Hopefully, the events taking place \ntoday in Hoboken, to celebrate that first game, will help spread the \nword. Congratulations Hoboken, and happy 150th anniversary to America's \nnational pastime, the sport of baseball.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a letter from President Clinton be printed \nin the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, June 19, 1996.\n       Warm greetings to everyone gathered in Hoboken, New Jersey, \n     to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the celebrated \n     baseball game on Elysian Fields between the Knickerbockers \n     and the New York Club.\n       Throughout its long and storied history, baseball has \n     stirred the hearts and captured the imagination of the \n     American people. From hot summer days on the sandlot to cool \n     autumn nights at the World Series, baseball has passed from \n     generation to generation as new stars rise to replace the \n     legends of the past and new fans learn to root for the home \n     team.\n       Through wars and depression, good times and bad, we have \n     been beguiled by the sights and sounds of this graceful and \n     timeless game. The crack of the bat on a hard-hit ball; the \n     slap of a fastball into a catcher's mitt; the smooth \n     precision of a well-turned double play; the thrill of a \n     stolen base; the sight of a home run as it clears the center \n     field fence--these are the things that have imprinted \n     baseball in the soul of America.\n       I join you in celebrating this cherished national pastime \n     and the players, managers, coaches, and fans who have made it \n     a permanent part of American culture. Best wishes for a \n     memorable day.\n\n     Bill Clinton.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/19/senate-section/article/S6545-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6545-S6546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO LUCILLE MAURER, FORMER STATE TREASURER OF MARYLAND\n\n   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the State of Maryland mourns \ntoday.\n  We have lost a tremendous public servant and role model in Lucille \nMaurer, who died Monday at the age of 73, after a long struggle with a \nbrain tumor.\n  Lucy Maurer was a long time Montgomery County legislator who went on \nto serve as Maryland's first female treasurer. She served as treasurer \nfor over 9 years, ending this past January. As treasurer, she was \nwidely recognized for her effectiveness, her professionalism, her \nintelligence, and her commitment. Lucy also served in the House of \nDelegates and on several school boards.\n  But her public service was not limited to fiscal affairs; Lucy Maurer \nalso committed her considerable talents and energies to those who \nneeded them most--Maryland's children. Whether the issue was education, \nnutrition, or safety, Lucy wanted the promise of a better future to \nbecome a reality for every child.\n  Lucy was an outstanding example of all that is good about democratic \npolitics. She was also a great friend and an inspiration to so many \nwomen--and men--who hold public office. We looked to emulate the \nstrength, fiscal and political savvy, confidence, and can-do spirit \nthat was so much a part of her.\n  She was an inspiration to the many unheralded women across Maryland \nwho work everyday to improve their communities and make a real \ndifference. I hope Lucy's community involvement--with groups like the \nPTA and the League of Women Voters--will encourage even more women to \nbecome active in community and political affairs. I can think of no \nlegacy more important that Lucy Maurer could leave for the Maryland she \nloved so much.\n\n[[Page S6546]]\n\n  I would like to extend my condolences to Lucy's husband, Ely Maurer, \nto the rest of the Maurer family, and to the colleagues and friends in \nMaryland and across the country who are mourning Lucy's passing. I \nshare, and the U.S. Senate shares, your tremendous loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/19/senate-section/article/S6545-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CUBAN POLICY\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, one of the most shortsighted policies we \nhave anywhere is our policy toward Cuba.\n  The reality is, we are letting a small group dictate American policy \nbecause of domestic political interests.\n  There is not a single nation in the world that doesn't believe our \npolicy toward Cuba is counterproductive.\n  Our aim should be to get the Government of Cuba to ameliorate their \nhard stands on human rights issues, and it has had the opposite effect.\n  Certainly, if we had followed a different course, it is hard to \nbelieve the situation could be any worse than it is right now.\n  Recently, the New York Times had an article by Larry Rohter titled, \n``Latin American Nations Rebuke U.S. for the Embargo on Cuba.''\n  They are right in their criticism.\n  I ask that the New York Times article be printed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 6, 1996]\n\n       Latin American Nations Rebuke U.S. For the Embargo on Cuba\n\n                           (By Larry Rohter)\n\n       Panama, June 5.--In a display of near unanimity, the \n     countries of the Organization of American States, gathered \n     here for their annual meeting, singled out the United States, \n     criticizing the recent extension of the economic embargo \n     against Cuba as a probable violation of international law.\n       The criticism came in the form of a resolution aimed at the \n     Helms-Burton Law, which President Clinton signed into law in \n     March.\n       A vote on Tuesday on the measure, which had 32 co-sponsors, \n     ended with the United States, traditionally the \n     organization's dominant force, as the sole dissenter.\n       Dismayed by the strong language of the resolution, the \n     United States fired back with a harsh assessment of the \n     behavior of some of its closest allies, including many \n     members of the organization who have supported American \n     intervention in the past in places such as Haiti and the \n     Dominican Republic.\n       In a stinging speech at the gathering, which ends on \n     Friday, the United States delegate, Harriet C. Babbitt, \n     condemned the resolution as an act of ``diplomatic \n     cowardice.''\n       ``What is the message that will emerge from this \n     assembly?'' she asked her fellow delegates. ``That the \n     hemisphere will flex its muscles to defend and justify \n     illegal expropriations, but remain silent while our brothers \n     and sisters in a neighboring state remain subject to the \n     caprices of a brutal dictator? Where is our sense of \n     perspective?''\n       Cuba was ``excluded'' from the organization in 1962 as part \n     of an American diplomatic effort to isolate Fidel Castro and \n     the Communist Government he continues to lead.\n       Since then, Cuban officials and the state-controlled press \n     have regularly ridiculed the organization as a claque of \n     subservient puppets manipulated by the United States.\n       In Havana, a spokesman for the Cuban Foreign Ministry said \n     the resolution ``was really a surprise,'' and thanked \n     organization members for their support.\n       The Helms-Burton legislation tightens the 35-year-old \n     economic embargo against Cuba by allowing American citizens \n     to sue foreign companies that ``traffic'' in property seized \n     from Americans and denies executives of those companies the \n     right to enter the United States.\n       Congress overwhelmingly approved the bill after Cuban Air \n     Force pilots shot down two small civilian aircraft owned by \n     Cuban exile groups in February, killing four people.\n       The resolution is directed against all laws that ``obstruct \n     international trade and investment'' or ``the free movement \n     of persons.''\n       In addition, the Inter-American Juridical Committee, an \n     independent body that advises the organization on legal \n     matters, was asked to ``examine the validity under \n     international law'' of Helms-Burton and to prepare a \n     ``judgment'' as soon as possible.\n       Coming from a forum that has always done its best to avoid \n     controversy, the vote could only be interpreted as a stunning \n     defeat for the United States and a rejection of the Clinton \n     Administration's get-tough policy toward Cuba.\n       But at a news conference after the rebuke, Ms. Babbitt \n     tried to put the best face on the vote and to mend some \n     fences. ``We have in effect agreed to disagree on this \n     issue,'' she said. ``We share the same goal, but we disagree \n     on the methods of attaining that goal.''\n       Privately, members of the American delegation said they \n     were distressed not only with the language of the resolution \n     but also by the manner in which it was pushed through. They \n     also complained of being given insufficient time to consult \n     with Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/19/senate-section/article/S6546-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        OPERATION SMILE WINS CONRAD N. HILTON HUMANITARIAN PRIZE\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there are kind hearts in the world.\n  The Conrad N. Hilton Foundation--for the first time--is awarding a $1 \nmillion prize to a humanitarian organization committed to alleviating \nhuman suffering.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Operation Smile, a \nVirginia-based organization dedicated to bringing smiles to the world's \nchildren. Operation Smile, an international, volunteer, medical-\nservices organization, provides reconstructive surgery to indigent \nchildren suffering from facial and functional deformities.\n  I am delighted that Operation Smile was chosen by the Conrad N. \nHilton Foundation.\n  Both Operation Smile and the Hilton Foundation fuel the spirit of \nvolunteerism. Operation Smile, embracing the mission of all \nhumanitarians, touches the face of humanity, literally, figuratively, \nand spiritually. For centuries, throughout much of the world--even in \nour great Nation--children born with facial deformities were sentenced \nto a life of private pain and public humiliation. Operation Smile was \nfounded in 1982 by the husband-and-wife team of Dr. William P. Magee, a \nplastic surgeon, and Kathleen Magee, a nurse and social worker. I \nparticularly want to commend the founders of Operation Smile, their \nvision and hard work have made the dreams of many youngsters come true.\n  The generous award by the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation will help keep \nthis hope alive. By establishing this prize, the foundation, according \nto the executive director of the Hilton Prize, seeks to recognize and \nsupport all persons working hard, and often under difficult conditions, \nto alleviate human suffering.\n  Today, selfless volunteers with Operation Smile provide \nreconstructive surgery and related health care to children around the \nworld. Thanks to the unwavering dedication of Operation Smile \nvolunteers, over 18,000 children have witnessed a personal miracle and \nembarked on a new life.\n  Internationally, Operation Smile educates and trains local medical \nprofessions and creates an infrastructures for volunteer and financial \nsupport--all of which contributes to a local network of self-\nsufficiency.\n  From the State of Virginia, as well as the other 28 chapters around \nthe country, Operation Smile reaches into schools and communities, \nidentifying children in need of reconstructive surgery. With the \nunwavering support of volunteer surgeons and hospitals, Operation Smile \ninsures that no child will suffer through a childhood made traumatic by \nfacial disfigurement.\n  Mr. President, the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation could not have chosen \na more worthy organization. Operation Smile deserves a standing \novation. In fact, I applaud both Operation Smile and the Conrad N. \nHilton Foundation for showing the world the promise of hope and the \npower of smiles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/19/senate-section/article/S6546-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6546-S6547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CAPT. DONALD A. HEMPSON, JR.\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to honor and congratulate \nCapt. Donald A. Hempson, Jr. on 27 years of dedicated service in the \nU.S. Navy. Today, June 19, 1996, Captain Hempson will retire from the \nNavy as commander of Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service [DRMS] \nlocated in Battle Creek, MI. During Captain Hempson's 3-year command, \nDRMS made great strides in its mandate of reutilization, transfer, and \ndonation of excess government property. Captain Hempson successfully \ncommanded the service under many changes brought about by ``Reinventing \nGovernment'' initiatives. His vision and drive were key to the success \nof DRMS during this transitional period.\n  DRMS reuse, transfer, and donation of government property reached an \nall-time high of $3.5 billion in 1995, a 21-percent growth since 1993. \nThe DRMS Sales Program saved American taxpayers over $302 million last \nyear, an increase of 134 percent since 1993. These money saving \nprograms have enjoyed great success during the past 3 years,\n\n[[Page S6547]]\n\nand much of it is due to Captain Hempson's leadership.\n  Captain Hempson has had a long and far reaching naval career. He is \nqualified in nuclear submarines and has served several sea assignments \nas a Supply Officer. His shore assignments have included logistics, \nacquisition, and financial management in many different offices and \ncommands. Captain Hempson has also been designated a Surface Warfare \nSupply Corps officer. His decorations include the Legion of Merit, the \nMeritorious Service Medal and the Navy Commendation Medal, each with \none Gold Star in lieu of second award.\n  Captain Hempson is an immensely qualified individual who has \ngraduated from Georgia Institute of Technology, the Wharton School of \nthe University of Pennsylvania, Northwestern University's Kellogg \nGraduate School of Management, and the Brookings Institution. His \nextensive training has served the Defense Department well. Captain \nHempson is married to Sandra R. Zayatz Hempson, and they have two \nchildren, Donald and Kelly.\n  I know my Senate colleagues join me in thanking Capt. Donald Hempson \nfor his 27 years of dedicated service to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/19/senate-section/article/S6546-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SALINE CELTIC FESTIVAL\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to honor the Saline Celtic \nFestival which will take place on the banks of the Saline River on July \n6, 1996, in Saline, MI. This festival celebrates Irish, Scottish, and \nWelsh cultures and will feature traditional Celtic food, music, and \ndance. This year's Celtic festival is especially significant because it \nmarks the 30th anniversary of the Saline, MI--Brecon, Wales Sister City \nprogram.\n  On April 18, 1966, Mayor George Johnson invited the City of Brecon, \nWales to become a Sister City in the People-to-People program \nestablished by President Eisenhower in 1956. The program's goal was to \npromote strong ties among different cultures. The Saline-Brecon union \nwas the first to involve United States and Welsh citizens under the \nprogram.\n  Over the years, the relationship between the two cities has often \ninvolved the exchange of music. In 1967, Musical Youth International, \nduring its tour of Europe, was the first official group from Saline to \nvisit Brecon. In 1984, the mayor of Brecon asked the city of Saline to \nbecome involved in a 3-day Dixieland Jazz Festival it was planning. \nSaline quickly accepted the invitation and sent the Saline Big Band to \nBrecon, Wales. An original ``Hymn for Brecon'', written by Dil Murrell, \nwas performed for their gracious hosts. The trip was a memorable \nexperience for the group of 35 that traveled to Wales. They were \ntreated with great hospitality and made many new friends at the \nfestival. During the following years, Saline sent its high school choir \nand marching band--and in 1988, the Saline Big Band made a return visit \nto Brecon.\n  The residents of Brecon have also reached out to the City of Saline. \nThe first guests from Brecon were Mayor and Mrs. Tony Elston in 1973. \nIn 1986, while celebrating the 20th anniversary of the twinning of the \ncities, nearly 60 citizen ambassadors traveled from Brecon to Saline. \nThis year will also see a large group from Brecon celebrating the \nCeltic Festival in Saline.\n  Thirty years have fostered a solid friendship between Saline and \nBrecon, they've learned about each other, and as Mayor Little has so \naptly put it, they have become ``one community separated by a large \nbody of water.'' I know my Senate colleagues join me in Saluting the \nSaline Celtic Festival and the 30th anniversary of the Saline-Brecon \nSister City program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/19/senate-section/article/S6547-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 1890\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE.
