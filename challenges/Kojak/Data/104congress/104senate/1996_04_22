Mr. President, today is a very sad day in the northwest \nKansas community of Goodland. For today is the day when much of the \ncommunity will gather to say their final farewells to one of Goodland's \nfavorite sons.\n  Much of America came to know Brook Berringer for his leadership on \nthe football field, and for the role he played in helping to \nquarterback the Nebraska Cornhuskers to back-to-back national \nchampionships in 1994 and 1995.\n  More important than being a champion on the field, however, is being \na champion off the field.\n  And in the days that have followed the tragic death of Brook and his \nfriend and former Goodland resident Tobey Lake, countless Kansans and \nNebraskans have testified to the fact that Brook was a champion in all \naspects of his life.\n  ``Unassuming,'' ``modest,'' ``role model,'' ``a great kid''; these \nare some of the words that Brook's family, friends, teachers, and \ncoaches have used to describe him. Brook used his status as a football \nhero to make a difference in the lives of others.\n  He was active in church and charitable activities, and was a \ndedicated member of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.\n  He returned to Goodland often during his college years to visit with \nfamily and friends, and to provide an inspiration to young people.\n  Brook's tragic death occurred just 2 days before the National \nFootball League draft, in which he surely would have been selected. In \na gesture typical of this outstanding young man, Brook had said that he \nhoped he would be selected by Kansas City or Denver, so he could remain \nclose to home.\n  Mr. President, as I think about Brook Berringer, I am reminded of the \nfamous poem by A.E. Housman entitled ``To an Athlete Dying Young.''\n  The last four lines of that poem read:\n\n     Now you will not swell the rout\n     Of lads that wore their honors out\n     Runners whom renown outran\n     And the name died before the man.\n\n\n[[Page S3750]]\n\n\n  In countless communities in Kansas and Nebraska, the name and the \nmemory of Brook Berringer will live on for years and years to come.\n  Mr. President, I know I speak for all Senators, particularly my \ncolleague Senator Kassebaum and my two colleagues from Nebraska, \nSenator Exon and Senator Kerrey, in extending our sympathies to the \nfamilies and friends of Brook Berringer and Tobey Lake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3749-5", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO VICE ADM. JOHN BULKELEY\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, it is with deep sorrow I note the passing of \nVice Adm. John Bulkeley. Friday morning a memorial service was held at \nMemorial Chapel at Fort Myer to honor Admiral Bulkeley, and I think it \nonly appropriate that the Senate takes a few minutes to honor this true \nAmerican hero.\n  Admiral Bulkeley had a long and distinguished military career. \nHowever, he is best remembered for his service during World War II. In \nAugust 1941, then-Lieutenant Bulkeley assumed command of Motor Torpedo \nBoat Squadron 3, which participated in one of the most spectacular \nevents of the Philippine campaign.\n  Lieutenant Bulkeley helped break through Japanese lines to transport \nGen. Douglas MacArthur and his staff from Corregidor and Bataan to \nMindanao. From there MacArthur flew to Australia, where he assumed \ncommand of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific.\n  Shortly thereafter, Lieutenant Bulkeley returned to Negros Island and \nlocated and transported the President and Vice President of the \nPhilippine Islands through the Japanese lines to Mindanao to be flown \nto Australia.\n  For his service in defense of the Philippines, Admiral Bulkeley was \nawarded the Medal of Honor. The citation read in part:\n\n       For extraordinary heroism, distinguished service and \n     conspicuous gallantry above and beyond the call of duty, as \n     Commander of Motor Torpedo Board Squadron Three, in \n     Philippine waters during the period December 7, 1941 to April \n     10, 1942. The remarkable achievement of Lieutenant Bulkeley's \n     Command in damaging or destroying a notable number of \n     Japanese enemy planes, surface combatant and merchant ships, \n     and in dispersing landing parties and land based enemy forces \n     during the four months and eight days of operations without \n     benefits of repairs, overhaul or maintenance facilities for \n     his squadron, is believed to be without precedent in this \n     type of warfare. His dynamic forcefulness and daring in \n     offensive action, his brilliantly planned and skillfully \n     executed attacks, supplemented by an outstanding leader of \n     men and a gallant and intrepid seaman. These qualities \n     coupled with a complete disregard for his own personal safety \n     reflect great credit upon himself and the Naval Service.\n\n  Admiral Bulkeley's service did not end there. He went on to further \ndistinguish himself in the European theater. In 1944, while in command \nof 110 mine sweepers and escorting motor torpedo boats, he spearheaded \nthe invasion of Normandy by sweeping the Baie de LaSeine assault area \nprior to the arrival of the assault force. In July he conducted an \noperation which successfully deceived the Germans into believing that \nthe main landings for the invasion of Southern France would come in the \nBaie del Ciotat. Consequently, Admiral Bulkeley engaged in a running \ngunfight with two German corvettes, both of which were eventually sunk.\n  Admiral Bulkeley also served with distinction in the Korean conflict, \nduring which he commanded a destroyer division. Later he commanded the \nnaval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n  Finally, in June 1967, Admiral Bulkeley reported to Washington, where \nhe headed the Board of Inspection and Survey, a position he held for an \nunprecedented 21 years.\n  So I think it is fair to say Admiral Bulkeley's life was marked by \ncourage, dedication, and sacrifice. He is a man who loved his country \nand served it with distinction. We would all do well to emulate Admiral \nBulkeley, a true American hero who will be greatly missed.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3750-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I want to touch on a couple of matters \nthis morning. The first relates to the opportunity that I had during \nthe recent recess to travel to the former Yugoslavia. I was fortunate \nenough to travel with two colleagues who, in the past, have indicated a \ngreat deal of interest in Bosnia and other countries of the former \nYugoslavia, the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Senator Reid, and \nthe senior Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch.\n  Our purpose was really threefold: First, to assess the progress of \nthe Dayton accords; second, to examine, as carefully as we could, the \nrole of the United States military and our Foreign Service personnel in \nthe implementation of those accords; and third, to assess the longer \nterm issues of democratization and privatization as they are developing \nin the former republics of Yugoslavia.\n  It was with a great deal of sadness that we left on the very day that \nthe Secretary of Commerce lost his life in a plane crash near \nDubrovnik. He and I were supposed to have attended a reception the \nfollowing evening in Zagreb, Croatia.\n  I was extraordinarily saddened and disturbed by the early reports \nthat we were given regarding his accident. There has been no one more \ndedicated to the causes of economic development in troubled countries \nthan the Secretary of Commerce. There has been no one who has carried \nthe message of new opportunities for U.S. business all over the world \nmore diligently than Secretary Brown.\n  Last week, I addressed my thoughts with regard to the many \nextraordinary accomplishments of Secretary Brown. I will not do so \nagain this morning except to say that his loss will be mourned and his \neffort will, again, be realized for what it was: a major achievement in \npeace, a major achievement in creating new-found opportunities for U.S. \nbusinesses abroad, and a major opportunity for countries to continue to \nfind new ways to work and to conduct business with the United States.\n  His peace effort, on behalf of this country and the people of the \nformer Yugoslavia, was deeply appreciated. And I must say, every place \nwe went, it was the first issue to be raised with me by governmental \nleaders and others who mourned his loss and recognized his \ncontribution. They expressed the hope that his effort would continue, \nthat through other people and in other ways, the extraordinary \naccomplishments of the Secretary of Commerce would be continued.\n  So, while our trip began on a very sad and somber note, our entire \ndelegation chose to continue with it, in part, to show the people of \nBosnia and the entire region that the United States remains committed \nto the peace and development effort for which Ron Brown gave his life.\n  The Dayton accord has meant a lot of things to a lot of countries and \na lot of people, but I think it is fair to say that today in the former \nYugoslavia there exists what is termed a ``cold peace.'' We see a lot \nof opportunity for those who have confronted one another politically \nand militarily to find peaceful solutions, and there has been progress \nin that regard. But there is a long, long way to go.\n  As we traveled to all of the countries that comprise the former \nYugoslavia--Bosnia, Serbia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, \nCroatia, Slovenia--as well as Albania and Hungary, we could see the \ntremendous success that has been generated, in part by the courageous \nnew leadership in each of these countries.\n  There can be no better success story thus far in this area than what \nwe witnessed in Slovenia: a dynamic private sector working daily and \nweekly to become more a part of the West; economic success very evident \nas we\n\n[[Page S3751]]\n\nwalked the streets; political success, very evident as we listened to \nthe debate.\n  Slovenia may be the first and the strongest, but there are others, \ntoo.\n  We were extremely pleased at the progress we saw in the former \nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the only country of the former \nYugoslavia to make a completely peaceful transition to independence. \nWithout a doubt, their peaceful existence today can be tied directly to \na decision made initially by former President George Bush--and later \ncarried out by President Bill Clinton--to send a meager 200 troops \nalong the Macedonian border. There are now 550 U.S. troops stationed \nthere.\n  Were it not for those troops, there is no doubt, in my mind at least, \nthat Macedonia, too, could have been engaged in war. Those troops \nsinglehandedly stopped the conflict that we see so prevalent in so many \nother areas of the former Yugoslavia. We owe a great debt of gratitude \nto those brave people who still today patrol the Macedonian border in \n10 remote locations for 21 days at a time, patrolling, watching, \nobserving with great diligence the activity along the Macedonian \nborder.\n  The visibility of American peacekeepers in Bosnia and at the \nMacedonian border--the knowledge that they are there--has served as a \nvery strong warning to all countries in the region that we will not \ntolerate--we will not tolerate--the conflict that we have seen \nelsewhere. Because of that presence--I must say, only because of the \nU.S. presence--we see peace today.\n  In terms of successful transitions toward democracy, much can also be \nsaid for Albania, frankly. The work there under President Berisha has \nbeen extraordinarily impressive. I must say, of all countries I have \never visited, none has needed democracy and privatization more. Under \nthe Communist regime, the construction of more than 600,000 concrete \nand steel bunkers is evident regardless of where you are. They are \nubiquitous reminders of the paranoia of the past, demonstrated through \nvirtually every aspect of public policy in that country.\n  It is clear the Albanians have suffered a great deal. My generation, \nthose people who were born after the war, feeling the full brunt of \nCommunist rule, a totalitarian dictatorship, could not possibly have \nimagined what freedom could now entail. But it is freedom they are now \nenjoying. It is democracy they are now growing. It is free enterprise \nthey are now pursuing. We applaud them in their efforts and find \nremarkable progress in the very short time that they have had the \nopportunity to pursue that freedom, to pursue that new future.\n  Perhaps our travels to Slovenia, Albania, and the other republics of \nthe former Yugoslavia made our visit to Bosnia all the more tragic. \nBosnia is a beautiful country, with mountains and idyllic scenes of \nwinding streams through small villages of burnt orange tile roofs. The \nidyllic areas and the extraordinary beauty make all the more tragic the \nscene there now.\n  In all my travels, and having seen all the pictures we are provided \non television and in the newspapers and magazines and books, there is \nno way one could be prepared for the incredible scene that one \nwitnesses as soon as you get off the airplane in Sarajevo. The \ndevastation cannot be fully appreciated unless you see it with your own \neyes. There is no building untouched. Most buildings are virtually \nblown away, roads completely destroyed, bridges out, buildings without \nwindows, houses without roofs, rubble in virtually every direction.\n  Not only is there devastation, but there is danger. We are told there \nare more than 3 million landmines planted throughout that country. \nAlmost daily people become victims of these mines. Limbs blown away, \nlives destroyed, given up because those mines continue to be so \ndangerous.\n  Unfortunately, it is hard to describe what this conflict has been all \nabout. It is not over political philosophy. It is not over economic \ndeterminism. It is over ethnic differences and ultranationalism, fanned \nin the flames of rhetoric by leaders outside Bosnia.\n  Admira Ismic and Bosko Brekic were two people who felt the full brunt \nof this ultranationalism and this war between ethnic groups. They lived \noutside of Sarajevo, both 25 years old. They grew up together, fell in \nlove as high school sweethearts and decided to go to college together \nin Sarajevo. They were chemistry students, very good students.\n  In 1992, as they became increasingly concerned with the thousands and \nthousands of weapons raining in on Sarajevo, they, like many others, \nasked for safe passage out of that war-torn city. They had been given \nassurances from both sides that they would be given safe passage. They \npacked their meager belongings as college students, put them on their \nbacks, and began walking down a road and across a bridge. They were \nonly about halfway across the bridge when Bosko was shot in the back. \nIt was not long after that--moments--that Admira was shot, too. They \nboth fell in the middle of that bridge, embracing one another; and \nthere they died.\n  They were left there in the sun on that bridge for 8 days, according \nto Associated Press reports. Finally, during the middle of the night, \nbecause both sides continued to argue as to who was at fault, they were \nburied right next to the bridge, and there they lay for 3 years.\n\n  During the week we were there, Admira's and Bosko's bodies were \nexhumed and moved to another cemetery in Sarajevo.\n  Cemeteries carry a special significance in Bosnia. You see them \neverywhere. Soccer fields are now cemeteries; city parks are now the \nsites of thousands and thousands of additional graves. Admira's and \nBosko's grave will be among them. They were buried together during the \nweek we were there. Her father expressed both sadness and exhilaration. \nSadness that life could be taken from two such young, promising \nstudents who could give so much to their country, but exhilaration \nthat, after 3 long years, in peace he could bury them in a permanent \nlocation.\n  He said, ``I was worried that I, too, would be killed prior to the \ntime I could accomplish this task.'' Admira and Bosko's story is but \none of thousands and thousands of stories just like that. The number of \npeople buried in mass graves now is estimated to be over 300,000--tens \nof thousands of people amassed together, their families robbed of even \nthe opportunity to mourn for them individually. They are mourned, but \nnot forgotten.\n  Mr. President, now there is peace. There is no more war. The shooting \nhas ended. People are crossing that bridge freely. Life is coming back \nto the city. One day, in my view, Bosnia and all the other countries \nthat once comprised Yugoslavia can flourish. They can flourish, like \nSlovenia, like Macedonia. There is no doubt in my mind that with proper \npolitical leadership, with the opportunity to continue to experience \nsome stability, indeed, there is a possibility that all of these \ncountries could experience democracy.\n  So, I have four observations in closing, having had the opportunity \nto travel through this war-torn, yet extraordinarily beautiful area. \nThe first is that this President, this administration, Assistant \nSecretary of State Richard Holbrooke, and so many others who personally \nmade the contribution to achieve meaningful peace in Dayton deserve a \ngreat deal of credit. It was courageous. Everyone recognizes how many \ntimes others have tried and failed, but this worked. This worked, in my \nview, because the United States put its moral, military, and diplomatic \nstrength behind it.\n  We would have failed had the United States not been willing to commit \nits credibility, its resources, and its talent to the task in spite of \nthe political risks involved. This administration ought to be given our \ngratitude and the credit it deserves for showing the kind of leadership \nrequired at times like this.\n  Second, let me say that we have never been better served by anybody \nthan we are now being served by our U.S. military and Foreign Service \npersonnel. Adm. Leighton Smith, Gen. Bill Nash, our Ambassadors, those \nwho are attempting in what has to be some of the worst circumstances \nany of our personnel have faced in post-cold-war periods anywhere \ndeserve our thanks.\n  We have not been served better. We were told that in Sarajevo for \nmany months Foreign Service personnel were not only required to work in \nwhat were clearly unacceptable circumstances, but they were required to \nlive there, to\n\n[[Page S3752]]\n\neat there, to sleep there, to exist there for month after month after \nmonth without even the opportunity to leave the Embassy. And yet they \ndid so, demonstrating all the professionalism that we could probably \nexpect, even as they watched this Congress shut the Government down, \nand as they attempted to explain to those Bosnian nationals who were \nworking for the United States Government, in particular, why we could \nnot pay them. They worked anyway. They carried on their mission as best \nthey could.\n\n  So it was with our U.S. military. In mud that had to have been 10 \ninches deep, in tents and in buildings on top of a hill, they tried as \nbest they could to establish a presence from which to carry on their \noperations. Soldiers told us that one night, after having just \nconstructed their tents and established their infrastructure in this \nbase, 80-mile-per-hour winds blew it down, blew down equipment, blew \ndown tents, blew down virtually everything that was standing. So, \nagain, the next morning, with the determination we have come to expect \nfrom the U.S. military, they put it all back, determined to carry out \nthe mission as only the U.S. military can.\n  As we traveled all through Bosnia and all the former Republics of \nYugoslavia, the one thing we were told over and over again is that \nwhile it may be a 32-country mission, the fact is one country made the \ndifference, one country made it happen, one country made it all \npossible. One country had the credibility, the stature, the power to \nbring peace to this region. That one country is well represented by our \nmilitary and Foreign Service personnel.\n  My third observation is that we must applaud the people of the former \nYugoslavia, especially those in Bosnia, for their resiliency, their \ndetermination to find peace, tranquility, stability, economic vitality, \nand, yes, a political opportunity to achieve the same level of \ndemocracy as others in the region. That determination could not have \nbeen more evident.\n  I thought it was a poignant metaphor to be standing on a hill in \nSarajevo overlooking two soccer fields. One soccer field was filled \nwith crosses, thousands and thousands of crosses marking the graves of \ncasualties of the war. The other soccer field was filled with mud and \nyoung boys playing soccer, mud on every inch of their bodies, \ndetermined to play, recognizing that in the field just next to them lay \ntheir former friends and relatives, brothers and sisters.\n  It is that determination, that willingness to survive it all, to \nconfront it all, that we found in great abundance throughout the \ncountry. Certainly, we applaud the people in all of these Republics, in \nall of these countries, struggling to achieve democracy, for their \ndetermination and their ability to accomplish what they know they can.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we ask frequently as we traveled through each \ncountry, ``Tell us why a skeptical South Dakotan or a skeptical \nAmerican ought to agree that our presence there is in our best \ninterest. How would you tell him or her that our troops, our personnel \nought to be there, and what is it about the American interests that \nwould convince a skeptical American that they should stay, at least \nthrough the end of this year?''\n  I think the answer, as given on so many occasions in such eloquent \nfashion, simply came down to this: ``Only you can make it happen. Only \nyou can ensure that the progress you are seeing continues.'' A \nSlovenian perhaps said it best when he looked me in the eye as we were \ndiscussing this, and he said, ``Let me tell you very honestly, in the \nshort-term there is nothing in it for you--nothing. But in the long \nterm, you who espouse democracy, who have enjoyed it for 200 years, \nhave the opportunity to see people who have lived for generations under \ntyranny, under dictatorship, under communism, now breathe freely under \ndemocracy. We, the small, struggling republics, could be like you.''\n  ``What is that worth? How much is that worth to you?''\n  He said, ``New little countries are like children: They fight \nsometimes, often unnecessarily. They need a firm hand. They need \nguidance. They need somebody to watch over them as they struggle to \ngrow. And you--well, you are like a big brother. You are the only one \nwe've got. You can turn away or you can stay. It's up to you.''\n  Mr. President, let us hope these democracies--these children--\ncontinue to grow. Let us hope that the people of these wonderful little \ncountries continue to experience democracy and free enterprise. Let us \nhope that as they do, we have the courage and the dedication and the \nopportunity to make little, weak democracies strong ones. That is what \nthis is all about.\n  Let me say it again, were it not for the courage and the commitment \nof this administration, our military, and Foreign Service personnel, \nlittle countries would have no reason to dream, would have no \nopportunity to experience what we in this great country experience each \nand every morning when we wake up.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Washington \nwaiting to speak. I had another statement, but I will wait until she \nhas concluded before I make that statement. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me congratulate my colleague, the \nminority leader, for an excellent statement. I hope that all of our \ncolleagues take time to read it. Certainly, we do stop and question our \nrole in the world often on this floor, and I think the words that \nSenator Daschle just gave to us are words that we all should heed. I \nappreciate his statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3750-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3752-S3753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  IN OPPOSITION TO RIDERS ATTACHED TO THE INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today is Earth Day. It is a day that many \nyoung people and adults across our country take time out to plant a \ntree, clean up a river or a lakeside, and to make the statement that \neach of us has a responsibility to pass on a safe, clean, healthy, and \nsecure environment to the generations that come behind us.\n  Mr. President, today I use Earth Day to voice my concerns with the \nmany riders that are attached to the Interior section I of the omnibus \nappropriations bill that is currently in conference. These riders, I \nbelieve, are not good policies for today or for tomorrow, and they \ncertainly go against the concept that Earth Day was designed to \nhighlight.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly concerned about three riders that \nmost directly affect my home State of Washington. The riders are the \nlimitations to the interior Columbia basin ecosystem management \nproject, the restricted timber salvage provisions, and the threats to \nthe Lummi Nation.\n  Mr. President, let me begin with the Columbia basin ecosystem \nmanagement project. Most people in this Chamber know little about the \nColumbia basin project. I would like to change that today by explaining \nbriefly what the project is and what its creators hope to accomplish.\n  This project is a joint planning effort by the Forest Service and the \nBureau of Land Management to develop a scientifically sound ecosystem-\nbased strategy for managing the forests and the lands of the interior \nColumbia basin. Its most salient feature is that it is one of the first \nattempts made in natural resource policy to get ahead of the problem, \nrather than simply reacting to it. Its original proponents, Senator \nHatfield and former Speaker Foley, had dealt firsthand with the spotted \nowl controversy and wanted to attack the problems of the inland West \ndifferently.\n  In addition--and this may come as a surprise to my colleagues--almost \neveryone, from commodity interests to environmental activists, agrees \nthat we have problems with the ecosystems of the inland West. They \nagree on something. So let us use that consensus to figure out how to \nmanage these damaged or unhealthy lands. We need to develop a plan to \nensure sustainable commodity production, healthy fish stocks and \nwildlife populations, and protection of ecosystems. That is what the \nColumbia basin project attempts to do.\n  Unfortunately, some commodity interests are afraid of this project. I \ndon't want to discount their fear, because I know some businesses have \nbeen hurt by changing Federal policies and lawsuits. However, the \nlimitations imposed in the Interior appropriations rider will too \nseverely restrict sound\n\n[[Page S3753]]\n\nresource management, ecosystem restoration, and decisionmaking.\n  At every stage of this lengthy appropriations process, I have tried \nto improve the Columbia basin provisions, since I knew I did not have \nthe votes to strike the section. I was successful in two areas. First, \nwe have allowed the agencies to spend up to $4 million to finish this \nimportant project. This is a dramatic improvement over the original \nHouse bill, which prohibited any money from being spent for \nimplementation of the project and which allowed only $600,000 to be \nspent to complete the project.\n  The second important change I fought for was the removal of shackles \nfrom the scientists. The bill had limited the scientific assessment to \nsuch things as forest land management and had prohibited study of \nanything else. The omnibus appropriations bill now allows a scientific \nassessment of the entire ecosystem, not just that portion of the system \nprimarily affecting commodity production.\n  So, the Columbia basin project provisions have improved somewhat from \nwhat the House originally proposed. However, serious, serious problems \nremain. The most wrongheaded provision is that shielding many timber \nsales, mining operations, and other projects from Endangered Species \nAct consultation. Any national forest or BLM district may, at its \ndiscretion, amend the plans in place for protecting threatened fish and \nwildlife, namely PACFISH and INFISH, and thereby avoid later \nconsultation on potentially harmful activities.\n  This provision is made worse by another limitation imposed in the \nappropriations bill: The agencies may not select preferred management \nalternatives in the draft environmental impact statements or publish a \nrecord of decision. These restrictions on implementation of the \nNational Environmental Policy Act thwart decisionmaking about \nmanagement decisions that affect diverse and wide-ranging species, such \nas salmon and bull trout. It allows individual forests to alter \nexisting fish and wildlife protections in any manner they desire and \nthen escape ESA consultation scrutiny on individual projects and timber \nsales.\n  Mr. President, sufficiency language regarding the ESA and NEPA is \nvery popular with this Congress. I believe that limiting consultation, \nrestricting public review, and piecemeal management of public lands is \na bad way to manage our Nation's resources. I urge the conferees to \nstrip the entire Columbia basin project section. In the alternative, \nthe conferees should delete the ESA and NEPA sufficiency language and \nallow the agencies to select a preferred alternative and publish a \nrecord of decision providing direction regarding the best management \nalternative.\n\n\n                             TIMBER SALVAGE\n\n  Last month I offered an amendment to repeal the timber salvage rider \nand replace it with a long-term timber salvage program. Unfortunately, \nthe majority voted against my amendment, deciding the agencies should \nnot be required to comply with environmental laws and should be \nprotected from public challenge of their decisions. After the defeat of \nmy amendment, the omnibus appropriations bill went forward with \nlanguage contained in the chairman's mark designed to solve a few of \nthe problems associated with the timber salvage rider, by only a few.\n\n  Let me be clear. I appreciate the efforts of Chairman Hatfield to get \nthese modest changes included in the timber salvage rider. They move in \nthe right direction, but simply do not go far enough.\n  The major flaws with the salvage provisions in the omnibus \nappropriations bill are: First, they do not give the agencies \nsufficient authority to withhold sales and/or suspend harvesting where \nthere is serious environmental damage; second, they extend the \nsufficiency granted these controversial old growth sales indefinitely; \nthird, they provide language in the report that attempts to influence \nongoing marbled murrelet litigation; fourth, they give too much power \nto timber sale contract holders in negotiations; fifth, they restrict \nthe timeliness for buy-one provisions and alternative volume; and \nsixth, they provide no money to fund buyouts.\n  I urge the conferees to work with the administration to improve these \nprovisions because they could provide needed flexibility on these \nhighly controversial and damaging old growth sales. We need to provide \ntimber purchasers with fair replacement volume or buy out their \ncontracts as quickly as possible and ease growing tensions in the \nPacific Northwest.\n  The anger and frustration of many citizens concerned about ecosystem \nhealth and protection of our forests is increasing. We must act quickly \nto avoid harming key watersheds and important old growth ecosystems. \nThe time is now.\n\n\n                            the lummi nation\n\n  Another provision I continue to oppose is that preventing the Lummi \nNation, and potentially other tribes, from exercising their water \nrights on tribal lands. The Lummis and other parties, including non-\nIndian landholders, are engaged in negotiations that appear to be going \nvery well. I appreciate the willingness of Senator Gorton to remove \nlanguage that would likely have derailed these negotiations. However, \nthe language still existing in the omnibus appropriations bill is \ncounterproductive and simply ignores the history of the dispute. In \naddition, that language represents a threat to tribal sovereignty and \nsets an extremely poor precedent for government-to-government \nrelations.\n  From the day I first became aware of this language I have been trying \nto remove or modify it because I respect tribal and local efforts to \nresolve the issue. Unfortunately, despite repeated efforts to develop \ncompromise language that would serve all parties' interests; despite \nrepeated opposition from leading tribal policy experts in Congress; \ndespite veto threats, as evidenced in the statement of administration \npolicy; and despite the continued progress of negotiations, the \nprovision remains virtually unchanged.\n  There is only one purpose for this provision: to threaten and coerce \nthe Lummi people. This is the wrong way to encourage negotiated \nsettlement of a controversial, far-reaching, and complicated dispute \nover tribal water rights. I urge the conferees to remove the punitive \nlanguage and allow the affected people and governments to solve this \nproblem.\n  Mr. President, some of my colleagues have argued that the concerns \nexpressed by the administration have been sufficiently addressed. While \nI agree that progress has been made and appreciated the many \nconcessions both sides have made in the omnibus appropriations bill, I \nwant to state clearly that serious concerns, expressed in writing by \nthe administration, myself and others, remain unaddressed.\n  Mr. President, we are already more than halfway through fiscal year \n1996. We need to rid this bill of these three controversial riders, \nother antienvironmental riders, and others, such as those addressing \nindividual transferable quotas for our fisheries and HIV-positive \nmilitary personnel.\n  We need to govern. We need to fund our Government through the \nappropriations process and set policy through the authorizations \nprocess. Let us strip these riders and send a clean spending bill to \nthe President--and get on with governing. It would be the right message \nfor Earth Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3752-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, today marks Earth Day. It is a day to\n\n[[Page S3754]]\n\ncelebrate our past achievements in protecting the environment. It is \nalso a day, I hope, to rededicate ourselves to environmental \nprotection.\n  I think, without question, over the last 26 years since the first \nEarth Day in 1970, we have made enormous environmental gains. We have \ntaken steps to clean up our air and our water, cut toxic emissions from \nfactories by 50 percent--that is in half--and we have taken steps to \nprevent pollution that threatens our children's health.\n  I remember when my own city, San Francisco, used to pollute the bay \nand the ocean through 40 different outlets all around the city. The \nwater in the San Francisco Bay has been cleaned up. Dungeness crab has \ncome back to the bay. And I know that this is appreciated by all our \ncitizens: Lead levels in children's blood has been cut by 70 percent. \nWe have worked to protect our remaining wild places and to wisely \nmanage irreplaceable natural resources. But in spite of these \naccomplishments, much, much work remains to be done.\n  According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 50 million \nAmericans every year drink tap water which fails to meet at least one \nFederal health standard. About 1 million people each year become ill \nfrom drinking unsafe tap water, the Centers for Disease Control \nreports.\n  Toxic air pollutants need to be regulated to protect public health. \nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, exposure to \nparticulate matter may result in as many as 70,000 premature deaths \neach year. In my own State, in Los Angeles County, children actually \ngrow up in Los Angeles with reduced lung capacity because of pollution.\n  There are 1,290 toxic sites on the Superfund national cleanup \npriority list, and they include 96 in my own State of California. One \nin four Americans lives within 4 miles of a Superfund site. These sites \nmust be cleaned up. So we need to move forward. Instead, our past \nenvironmental achievements are being threatened often by this very \nCongress, by efforts to roll back existing environmental laws.\n  Of immediate concern is the omnibus appropriations bill which \ncontains more than a dozen riders, riders which would roll back \nexisting environmental protection. Many have proposed cuts in funds \nthat assist States in providing clean, safe drinking water to \nAmericans. They have proposed cuts that would affect the Environmental \nProtection Agency's ability to enforce the Clean Air Act and to issue \nnew standards for toxic air pollutants. They have proposed cuts in the \nSuperfund Program, which would jeopardize cleanup of over 400 of the \nworst toxic waste sites around the country.\n  One of them is Iron Mountain mine in Redding, CA. This is an old \nvacant chemical mine with a huge hole in it. The hole is as big as a \n30-story office building, and when it rains the water and the air \ninteract with the metals within the mountain, and it throws off \nsulfuric acid, which then drains into the river and metallizes the \nriver banks. This is one of California's urgent priority Superfund \nsites that needs cleanup.\n  Also of particular interest to me and to the people of California is \nthe rider on the Mojave National Preserve, the newest unit of our \nNational Park Service System. The conferees on the omnibus \nappropriations bill have agreed to a revised rider for the National \nMojave Preserve that, like the earlier versions, is intended to \noverturn provisions of the California Desert Protection Act and strip \nnational park protection for the Mojave National Preserve. The new \nrider reinstates multiple-use management of the east Mojave, management \nwhich allowed open pit mining, cross-country motorcycle racers, and \nother destructive activities to occur in the area.\n\n  In 1994, Congress overwhelmingly approved the California Desert \nProtection Act, which I authored, and which established the Mojave \nNational Preserve. That national preserve was already a compromise. I \nwould have had it a national park, but Congress agreed that the Mojave \nqualified as a national park and should be managed by the National Park \nService under park, not multiple-use, regulations. The Desert \nProtection Act transferred management of the Mojave from the Bureau of \nLand Management to the National Park Service so the area would receive \nthe protection and the care that it deserves.\n  The National Park Service opened a new visitor center and improved \nlaw enforcement. It actually made arrests and shut down a \nmethamphetamine lab, and it improved resource protection. Visitation to \nthe area increased substantially and motels, restaurants, and other \nbusinesses in the nearby communities flourished as a result.\n  Now the Mojave rider on the omnibus appropriations bill seeks to \nreverse that decision. The omnibus appropriations bill appropriates \nfunding for the National Park Service to manage the Mojave National \nPreserve, but it requires the agency to administer the area as a \nmultiple-use area before passage of the California Desert Protection \nAct. In other words, it pretends that the Desert Protection Act, \noverwhelmingly passed by both Houses and signed by the President, does \nnot really exist.\n  This multiple-use management permits a wide variety of development \nactivities which degrades the area's outstanding natural and cultural \nresources. Specifically, the new rider requires the National Park \nService to manage the Mojave under the historic management practices of \nthe Bureau of Land Management rather than under the policies and \nregulations of the National Park Service.\n  This establishes a dangerous precedent.\n  While early language that attempted to transfer control of the Mojave \nto the Bureau of Land Management has been dropped, the new rider could \nbe interpreted to require the National Park Service to approve \nresource-damaging activities that were previously allowed within the \nMojave before its designation. That would include off-road vehicle \nraces, open pit mining, garbage dumps, and uncontrolled use of \nfirearms.\n  Many are particularly concerned that one of the reasons for this \nrider is to permit this kind of open pit mining in the New York \nmountains.\n  In my legislation, we very carefully maintain that existing mining \nuses, those with existing permits, would be able to continue, so that \nno jobs would be lost. But apparently there are those who even want to \ngo in and open pit mine some of the more fragile areas of this \npreserve.\n  This new rider could be interpreted to allow unlimited use of \nmotorized vehicles in wilderness areas. The new rider sets the stage \nfor litigation over its interpretation, and the new rider limits \nfunding for the Mojave to less than one-half what the Park Service \nestimated would be required in FY 1996.\n  The statement of managers accompanying the rider requires the \nAppropriations Committees to approve the preserve's general management \nplan. This gives authority to committee members to dictate provisions \nof a park management plan for the first time in the history of this \nkind of legislation. In sum, it leaves the east Mojave a national \npreserve in name only, and no one is fooled by that.\n  The Mojave has been discussed and debated in the House and Senate for \n8 years now. The California Desert Protection Act, which passed in the \nlast Congress and was signed by the President, as I have already \nstated, was a substantial compromise. Rather than carrying out the \nintent of the legislation, which was to have a national preserve under \nNational Park Service management, we see in the omnibus appropriations \nbill further efforts to erode and destroy the Desert Protection Act. \nThis, frankly, is unconscionable. It is absolutely contrary to the \nwishes of the people of the State of California.\n  A Field Institute poll, an objective poll, conducted in December of \nlast year, shows continuing, overwhelming support; 85 percent of \nCalifornians support keeping east Mojave a national park--85 percent. \nIn every region of the State, people overwhelmingly support keeping the \nMojave as a national park.\n  As we celebrate Earth Day, Congress, I believe, should strip all \nenvironmental riders, including the Mojave rider, from the omnibus \nappropriations bill. That is what Congress can do right now to continue \nour commitment to environmental protection.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown).

Mr. President, Teddy Roosevelt said that, ``Conservation \nis a great moral issue, for it involves the patriotic duty of ensuring \nthe safety and continuance of the nation.''\n  As a result of the translation of that ethic into the legislative \nprocess, and the foresight of our political predecessors, the United \nStates today leads the world in efforts to protect the environment.\n  Our laws have become models for other nations' efforts to grapple \nwith their own air and water pollution and wildlife conservation \nchallenges. And, as a result of this commitment to a healthier \nenvironment, the United States has succeeded in reversing the course of \nenvironmental degradation that we followed for too long.\n  Today, on Earth Day, rivers and lakes are cleaner, waste is being \ndisposed in a more secure and responsible manner, and the air most of \nus breath contains fewer dangerous pollutants, such as lead. We can \nrejoice at the progress made.\n  Congress and a number of Republican and Democratic Presidents can and \nshould take credit for this accomplishment.\n  The tangible environmental success this Nation has experienced over \nthe last three decades is one of the reasons I have been so \ndisappointed by the direction of the debate over the environment in the \n104th Congress.\n  It is as though too many of us have forgotten the environmental \nchallenges we have faced and overcome since President Nixon create the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and Congress began its legislative \njourney that produced: The Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water \nAct, Superfund, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the \nrest of the laws that make up the canon known as American environmental \nlaw.\n  Collectively, that body of law represents one of the most important \nlegacies we will leave our children and grandchildren.\n  I hope the fabric created by those laws will not be stretched and \ntorn. I hope the quality of our environment that results from \nimplementation of those laws will not be sacrificed to short-term \npolitical considerations.\n  We need to embrace opportunities to improve and refine the impressive \nbody of environmental law that has been developed over the last three \ndecades.\n  In the spirit of that bipartisan legacy, today--Earth Day--I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to embrace their legislative \nheritage and work to protect and strengthen it. The contribution of \nthis generation of lawmakers to that impressive body of law should be \none of thoughtful improvement, drawing upon the lessons learned from \npast implementation of those very laws.\n  We should continue to search the fabric of our laws and seek to \nrepair the rips and the frayed ends.\n  We should seek commonsense solutions to our remaining environmental \nproblems.\n  In doing so, we should work to find consensus, as we have even in \nthis partisan year with the passage in the Senate, unanimously, of the \nSafe Drinking Water Act and the recently enacted small business \nregulatory reform bill.\n  As we stand here on Earth Day and survey the few months remaining in \nthis legislative session, let us resolve to keep the fabric of American \nenvironmental law whole. Let us not turn back the clock on the \naccomplishments of a generation.\n  In that regard, just on Friday, 41 of our colleagues here in the \nSenate joined with me in sending a letter to our majority leader and \nthe Speaker, to indicate our strong determination not to roll back the \nstandards affecting clean air; not to weaken the regulations relating \nto safe drinking water or industrial polluters; not to slow down or \nstop the cleanup of hazardous waste sites; not to weaken the community \nright-to-know laws, such as the toxic release inventory; not to abolish \nprotections for endangered species and all the other efforts that are \nunderway.\n  It is our view that we have a sufficient number of votes to extend \ndebate for whatever length of time, if that is required to protect the \nlaws that we have steadfastly supported over the last generation. It is \nour strong desire, our sincere hope, that extended debate on any of \nthese efforts will not be necessary, that we can work together to \nresolve our differences and to continue to build upon the impressive \nrecord that we have now generated over the last three decades.\n  So, as we stand here on Earth Day, let us again renew our commitment \nto work together to eliminate those threats to the environment that we \nsee yet today. Let us eliminate the antienvironmental riders from the \nappropriations bill this week, to demonstrate our commitment to Earth \nDay, to demonstrate our resolve, continuing to build on the impressive \nrecord that we have achieved. On the major environmental laws that are \nbeing reauthorized, let us work to find ways in which to strengthen \nthose laws, enact new ones where we identify new ones are needed, and \nleave future generations with a clean and healthy environment.\n  As Teddy Roosevelt stated nearly a century ago, that is truly our \npatriotic duty. It is one I believe every Member of this body can and \nshould embrace on this day, on all days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Mr. President, as we all know now, today is Earth Day, \na day dedicated to remembering our commitment to the environment, to \nthe future, a commitment on the part of every generation of Americans \nto assure that those who come behind us will not be jeopardized by \ncontemporary actions and, better, that those who follow us will have \nthe opportunities to enjoy a healthy environment--an environment in \nwhich recreation can be pursued, an environment in which future \ngenerations will not be troubled by the water they drink, by the air \nthey breathe, by the environment in which they live.\n  There has been a lot of rhetoric in this 104th Congress, finger \npointing about who is for the environment and who is not for the \nenvironment. I do not know anybody who is not for an improved \nenvironment; at least I have not met them.\n  In all the discussion, though, a little-told story is that this \nCongress has passed one of the most historic pieces of environmental \nlegislation in the history of our country. I will quote from F. Graham \nLiles, Jr., who is executive director of the Georgia Soil and Water \nConservation Commission. It is a letter addressed to me dated April 11, \n1996. He says:\n\n       With regard to the new Farm Bill, I feel this is probably \n     the strongest conservation legislation to have been signed in \n     decades.\n\n  I do not believe that, when we were considering the farm bill, it was \ngenerally acknowledged that that legislation is monumental \nenvironmental legislation that this Congress can take credit for, that \nit will be a legacy of the 104th Congress. Yes, the farm bill\n\n[[Page S3756]]\n\ndoes bring about monumental change in marketing reforms, in flexibility \nin terms of farmer planning, vast savings in these Government programs. \nBut the untold story is the environmental effect of the legislation.\n  Another general thought--I am going to describe some of these \nachievements, but this is the kind of environmental legislation that is \nlogical, that in my judgment creates the appropriate balance between \nthe stewards of the land and public policy. It is characterized by a \nword called ``partnership.'' I do not think we can say this is the case \nin each of our environmental laws. But here in this new farm bill the \nconcept of partnering, shared responsibility, working together to \nproduce a positive result is well rooted in the legislation. Therefore, \nit can become a benchmark, a guide, something to point to in terms of \nthe manner in which we should design future legislation designed to \nprotect the environment.\n  Under the farm bill conservation title, as I said, the bill is hailed \nby many, including the American Farm Bureau, as ``the most \nenvironmentally responsible farm legislation in history.'' In the State \nof Georgia, the soil and water conservation commission, as I just \nquoted, calls it the strongest conservation legislation to have been \nsigned in decades.\n  Under the conservation title, it reauthorizes the following programs:\n  The Conservation Reserve Program. Under this program landowners idle \nhighly erodible farmland in exchange for payments--partnership. This is \nthe Government working with the stewards of the land. Under this \nprogram soil erosion rates in my State of Georgia have dropped 50 \npercent. The Speaker often refers to producing effect more than effort. \nThis is effect--reducing erosion rates in Georgia by 50 percent. And \n36.5 million acres of sensitive farmland nationwide is being protected \nunder the Conservation Reserve Program.\n\n  We hear a lot of discussion about wetlands and our desire to protect \nthem. This new farm bill focuses on wetlands. Under this provision of \nthe bill, farmers enter into cooperative easement arrangements with the \nGovernment. Once again, Mr. President, partnership. Generally, \npermanent or 30-year easements are arranged and a farmer is \ncompensated. It is a cooperative arrangement. Under these provisions, \nwe will protect nearly 1 million acres of wetlands nationwide.\n  Fish and Wildlife Service oversight is replaced by State technical \ncommittees. We are moving the decisions to the States.\n  The Forestry Incentive Program. Farmers are provided with cost share \nagreements with the Department of Agriculture designed to plant trees \non private land. The program is simple--incentives to plant more trees. \nIn my State, we have over 800 participants. We have planted over 10,000 \nacres of new trees. That is just Georgia alone; 10,000 acres of new \ntrees. This program has put trees on land that would have ordinarily \nbeen used for other purposes.\n  New programs that were authorized in this bill:\n  The Environmental Quality Incentive Program, the EQIP program. This \nis the cornerstone of the conservation title for soil and water quality \nrestoration and enhancement. Its highlights are: The program targets \n$1.2 billion over 7 years to assist crop and livestock producers in \nbuilding environmental improvements on the farm, including animal waste \nfacilities, grass waterways, filterstrips, and other practices geared \ntoward land preservation.\n  Mr. President, partnership. Here, again, in each one of these titles \nwe see a new roadmap to the work on the environment, working with, as \npartners and facilitators, stewards of the land itself.\n  Farms for the Future Program. This program will provide $35 million \nto buy easements on prime American farmland in areas where they are \nthreatened. Some of the best farmland is being swallowed by \ndevelopment. This program understands that and tries to ease the burden \nof the development. This money will protect our country's best farmland \nfrom urban sprawl and will preserve it for future generations, as I \nsaid a moment ago, trying to preserve and keep for our future \ngenerations historical and environmentally sound areas for them to \nvisit and study and review.\n\n  Wildlife Habitat Enhancement Program, the WHEP Program. You have to \nhave an acronym for everything here. The WHEP Program will provide $10 \nmillion per year for cost-share payments to farmers who improve their \nwildlife habitat for upland and wetland wildlife. Again, partnership, \nMr. President, working with the stewards of the land. This is \nespecially important for States like mine with extensive bird and \nriparian populations. This is a win-win for naturalists and sportsmen \nalike.\n  The Florida Everglades restoration. Congress has resolved to clean up \nthe Florida Everglades by providing $200 million for acquisition, \neasements, and other restoration activities. Congress here, instead of \ntalking, has taken action by cleaning up the Everglades. This method of \ncleanup will allow farmers to survive and will repair the land in a \nunique partnership.\n  So, Mr. President, I reiterate that we have created in this historic \npiece of legislation conservation efforts, efforts to protect wetlands \nand include wetlands in the reserve. Forestry, the planting of new \ntrees, the protection of environmental quality, the Farms for the \nFuture Program, wildlife habitat and the Everglades--all of these \nenvironmental programs are encompassed in the new farm bill. This is a \nnew historic piece of legislation, not only with regard to the farm \nprograms, but with regard and with the intent to partner with the \nstewards of the land, these great protectors of the land, because no \none has a greater interest in protecting the environment than our \nfarming and agricultural community.\n  This is the stamp that demonstrates that very fact.\n  Mr. President, in the debate with regard to environmental \nlegislation, as I said when I made an opening statement, there is a lot \nof rhetoric that follows the environment. It is often politicized \nextensively. We do, as I said in scoping out the word ``partnership'' \nhave to be conscious of a balance between protecting the environment \nand protecting the fundamental rights of the owners of our land, of \nsecuring an appropriate balance in terms of the burden and costs of the \nenvironmental legislation. We cannot ignore the fact that some of our \nwork in the environment has posed great questions for us with regard to \ncost and logic.\n  Some of the bureaucrats, some of the regulators, in my judgment, have \nforgotten this concept we call partnership. They are in the business of \nimparting a word that was more reminiscent of arrogance, bossism, \npushiness. Let me just give a couple of examples of the kind of thing \nthat I think most Americans find illogical.\n  There is a gentleman by the name of Junior Childress. He is from \nAlabama. He has a radiator repair store. He thought he could be \nenvironmentally correct and start a nest egg at the same time when he \ntook a load of car batteries to Interstate Lead Co. for recycling in \n1985. Here we have a radiator repairman. He took several batteries to \nthe Interstate Lead Co. in 1985 and sold them to this other company for \nthe monumental sum of $337.50. I repeat, he sold a handful of batteries \nto this other company for $337.50--an absolutely legal transaction, \nnormally.\n  Subsequently--and by subsequently, I mean 9 years later; 9; a decade \nlater--this company, Interstate Lead Co. was determined to be a \nSuperfund site which alleged that they had not managed toxic material \nappropriately. They came under the scope of the Superfund cleanup. The \nproblem is that the owner of Interstate Lead Co. had left the country \nin the decade and was residing somewhere in Germany. So under our new \nregulatory system they go through the transaction records and find \neverybody who has ever done business with this outfit and put them on a \nliability list. If the person responsible for it does not have the \nresources or has disappeared or died then we start going through the \nrecords and seeing anybody that ever did business with this Interstate \nLead Co.\n  Lo and behold, 9 years ago, Junior Childress sold them $337.50 worth \nof batteries, and because of that, 9 years later, finds himself and his \nfamily liable--liable--for the full responsibility, which is $90 \nmillion. That is not a very good financial transaction--$337.50; now he \nis on the hook for $90 million--\n\n[[Page S3757]]\n\nhe and 900 other people who were interacting and selling goods to this \ncompany.\n\n  This is the kind of illogical conclusion that, in my judgment, has \ndone so much damage to the environment, because it makes people \ncynical. It makes them lose faith. Everybody who reads this story is \ngoing to say, ``My heavens, what logic could there be in this? How in \nthe world will we go back and unload on this man who sold a handful of \nbatteries to this company 9 years ago,'' and wrap the arms of the \nGovernment around him and cause him to bear the burden of this \nliability?\n  I happen to know an individual in my own State who is in the business \nof recycling, recycling metal, recycling other goods, who has \nexperienced this same threat. This company, no need to name it, is 100 \nyears old. It is 100 years old. That family has been doing business in \nAtlanta, GA, for 100 years. They are as good a public citizen as you \nwill ever meet. They are committed at every level of the community. \nThey are good citizens. They are good stewards. They are good business \npeople. Their company, after a century of operation, is at risk, all of \ntheir savings, all that they have built, all that they have stored, all \nof their work is at risk, for an incident just like this.\n  It is this kind of illogical behavior that is at the core of people \nasking us to change some of the way we manage our pursuit of a sound \nenvironment. This man, Junior Childress, my friend in Atlanta, GA, \nshould not be staring down a double-barreled shotgun called the U.S. \nGovernment. They simply do not have any liability here. They have been \ngood stewards. They did things the way they thought they should be \ndone. Yet they are at risk.\n  It is this kind of illogical behavior--this does not help our pursuit \nof cleaning the environment, Mr. President. This hurts. I just \ndescribed the farm bill and the logical flow of events between stewards \nand the Government. That helps. That produces a better environment. \nThis hurts.\n  Mr. President, I see I have been joined by my good colleague from the \nState of Wyoming. I am going to yield up to 10 minutes to my colleague, \nthe Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I appreciate our colleague bringing us to \nthe floor to talk today about the environment. Certainly, this is Earth \nDay, and we ought to talk about it.\n  We just have one Earth and one planet. There is more and more of us \nand we have the same amount of space. Clearly, we will have to pick up \nafter ourselves. I suspect there is no one in this body, and indeed, \nvery few anywhere, who would not agree with that.\n  There are differing views of the best way to do it, of course, to \nprovide a healthy environment. There are questions of who should do it. \nShould it be left entirely to the central Government, to the Federal \nGovernment? Should we take advantage of the State and local expertise? \nShould there be incentives for the private sector to perform? Those are \nthe kinds of questions that I think we need to be asking.\n\n  There should be questions about the balance between use and the \neconomy and the environment, and how we have jobs and how we protect \nthe environment at the same time. There is reason to disagree on those \nkinds of things. There is a question of whether or not there should be \ncongressional oversight of the statutes of laws that have been passed. \nMany of them--indeed most of them--passed 20 years ago. Or whether or \nnot there should be opposition to every effort to restructure some of \nthese laws and, indeed, to sort of demonize every effort as if it is \ngoing to be gutted or rolled back when, in fact, the effort is to take \na look at a bill that has been in place for 20 years and see if there \nare better ways to do it, to see if it could be done more efficiently. \nThat is what it is about.\n  I am sorry there has been this sort of politicizing of this issue in \nthis Congress. I think it is appropriate that we use Earth Day not just \nto look at the past environmental successes but to look to the future \nas well. The successes have been numerous, to say the least. You would \nnot know it by the kind of ``Chicken Little'' rhetoric that comes from, \nI think, environmental extremists who would rather scare folks than \ndeal with the facts. I hope we can stick with the facts. We do not do \nenough of that here. There is too much overstatement about ``gutting'' \nand ``rolling back'' when that is really not what is happening.\n  Look how far we have come since Earth Day in 1970. Our rivers, lakes \nand streams are vastly improved. The Potomac is a good example. It was \na wasteland 20 years ago, and now families fish there on the weekends. \nI suppose we all come from a little different life experience. I grew \nup in Wapiti, WY, which I am sure you all have heard of. It is just a \npost office and a school halfway between Yellowstone Park and Cody. It \nis called by some the ``most scenic 50 miles in the world.'' And it \ncould be. In fact, we had the last place next to the forest, and all \naround us were wilderness areas. I do not think there is anybody who \nhas a stronger feeling or a caring for the environment than I do coming \nfrom there.\n  On the other hand, you may have come from a city where there was \nexcessive pollution, and that is your experience. But now our air is \ncleaner, according to EPA. Particulate matter emissions have been \nreduced 60 percent. VOC's have been reduced 25 percent. Carbon monoxide \nhas been reduced 40 percent. Lead emissions have been reduced by 96 \npercent. All emissions have been reduced by a third. That is great.\n  Wildlife populations are increasing, such as the bald eagle, white-\ntailed deer, elk, moose, bighorn sheep, and wild turkey. Simply put, \nthe environment is cleaner now than at any time in the last 50 years. \nAmericans are living longer and healthier because of that. We can be \nvery proud of that. Both Democrats and Republicans have been a big part \nof this success during the 26 years since the first Earth Day. For 18 \nof those years, there was a Republican President in the White House. So \nwe can all share in this movement forward on a nonpartisan issue.\n  However, despite all that we have done, we still have some things to \naddress, certainly. Unfortunately, we are now trying to solve 21st \ncentury environmental problems with laws designed a quarter of a \ncentury ago. One of the areas in which I happen to be involved is \nendangered species. I do not know of anybody that does not want to \nprotect endangered species. Certainly, I do, and everybody I know on \nour committee wants to do that. It has been up for reauthorization now \nfor 3 years. It has not been reauthorized. It is not doing as well as \nit might be. It is not doing as well because we need to do something \nabout peer review for science.\n  I went to a hearing out west, and we had scientists from both sides \nof the issue, from lumber people to environmentalist scientists, and \nyou would never know they were talking about the same thing. If you \nwant science to be the basis, we need to change that. We need peer \nreview. We need to set priorities. There is a finite amount of money, \nso which of these endangered species do we put our money into. Are they \nall equally valuable? I do not know.\n\n  We have to do something to encourage private landowners to be more \ninterested in endangered species. Now, frankly, in my State, if someone \ndiscovers an endangered species on their ranch or property, they are \nhesitant to know about it, because it might mean you cannot use your \nproperty for anything else. We need to find a way so that private \nowners can say, ``Let us work on that.''\n  So we have to update these things. That is what we are seeking to do. \nBut this year, unfortunately, every time we take a look at how we might \nchange it and make it more effective and efficient, then we are \nconfronted with this ``we are going to save you'' idea. Frankly, the \nadministration has led that. Regarding everything that has happened, \nthe President is going to ``save you'' from those crazies in the \nCongress.\n  We have to start using some facts and we have to start really dealing \nwith what the issues are. And I hope that this Earth Day will cause us \nto help do that. I think we can utilize the vast expertise local people \nhave. All of these efforts will help us. I think there has to be, \nobviously, some balance. There are different kinds of environmental \nplaces, of course--parks and wilderness and forests--and many of those \nthings should be set aside for single use. But the vast majority of \nFederal lands should be managed for multiple use. I am thinking about \nthe\n\n[[Page S3758]]\n\nWest, particularly, because that is where I am from. Those are multiple \nuse lands and we can find a balance between jobs, the economy, and \nprotecting the environment; I am confident of that. It does not have to \nbe one or the other. That is what we are seeking to do.\n  Superfund legislation. I am, frankly, disappointed. It is designed, \nof course, to clean up sites that have hazardous waste. We have spent \nbillions of dollars, mostly that comes from a tax, to do that job. Do \nyou know what most of it has gone for? Litigation. Lawyers and \ncourtrooms. That is where the money has gone. A great deal of it comes \nfrom insurance policies for people involved. Someone said that nearly \n90 percent of that money has gone to legal activities, not cleaning up \nthe sites. That is what we really need to do.\n  So there has been a status quo opposition almost at every turn. I \nhope we get by that. I think there has been some deliberate misleading \nof people. This idea of somehow we are going to poison the children is \nsilly. I am just as interested in my children as Carol Browner is or as \nVice President Gore is. So we ought not to be talking about that. Some \nof that stuff is downright misleading.\n  The idea that one political party cares more about the environment \nthan the other is laughable. We all live here together. We need to make \nsome changes. I hope we can upgrade the Superfund in the next few \nmonths and that we can do something about the Endangered Species Act, \nClean Water Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. We are ready to do \nthat. We need to get the bogeyman out of the closet and quit talking \nabout the sky is falling and take a real factual approach to making \nthese things work better. We, indeed, can do that.\n  So, Mr. President, thanks to the efforts of lots of folks in this \ncountry, thanks to the efforts of people who care about the \nenvironment, the sky is not falling, it is in pretty good shape. We \nneed to take care of it. We have some responsibility. Every citizen has \nsome responsibility and we can do that. I am glad it is Earth Day. I \nlook forward to this country being in even better shape next Earth Day, \nand all of us need to contribute to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming, and \nI appreciate his remarks. The exact figure on the Superfund is $25 \nbillion that has been spent, and we have corrected 12 percent of the \nproblem. So that is an issue in and of itself.\n  At this point, I yield up to 5 minutes to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise with great pleasure on Earth Day. \nEnvironmental legislation has been one of the most enjoyable areas of \nlegislation in the 16 years I have had in Congress and the 4 years that \nI served in the Colorado State Senate.\n  I was a sponsor of Colorado's conservation trust fund, a measure that \nset money aside to be used to purchase open space, preserving it for \nfuture generations. We, in Colorado, prize our environment and our open \nspace and are determined to make sure we do not repeat the mistakes of \nthe east coast and west coast, as they have seen cities grow together \nwithout adequate open space. It could only be done through a positive \nprogram. That is why the Colorado trust fund was such a monumental \neffort--not because the money is as great as we would like--it is not, \nbut it is growing. It represents a positive step for the environment. \nInstead of saying ``no,'' we can say ``yes.''\n  I am convinced that real environmental progress is going to be a \nproduct of saying ``yes,'' of thoughtful and assertive action that does \npositive things, not just negative things. I am a sponsor of the \nminimum stream flow statute, sought to recognize minimum stream flow as \na proper use of water and recognize it as a property right in the \nState. It is a fundamental step toward adding minimum stream flow to \nall of our streams.\n\n  Mr. President, on the national level, one of the most enjoyable \nthings I have done are three additions to the Rocky Mountain National \nPark. The Rocky Mountain National Park is perhaps one of the most \nbeautiful areas in the entire world, and it attracts literally millions \nof visitors every year.\n  Tragically, in recent years, Democratic Congresses have dramatically \nincreased the cost of entering the park so that it becomes a preserve \nfor only those who can afford to enter it rather than the poor. It has \nbeen a tragic mistake, in my view, because Democratic Congresses' \nactions have served to restrict young people who may not be wealthy \nfrom having an opportunity to visit that park. Our natural wonders of \nbeauty, I believe, should be available to all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I am the sponsor in Colorado of the only wild and \nscenic river, the Cache La Poudre River. It was with great pride that \nwe put it together. It was a compromise between those who use the river \nand those who enjoy it from an environmental and scenic point of view. \nIt set aside areas where water storage can be added, which is important \nfor preserving our water quality and our water flow in the State. But \nit also set aside specific large portions of the river for wild, \nrecreational, and scenic uses.\n  Mr. President, I am the sponsor of three studies on the Cache La \nPoudre River examining a portion of the river to be included as a \nnational heritage area. Before this Congress right now is a bill that I \nhave worked on for more than a decade. The Cache La Poudre River \nNational Water Heritage Area bill is one that will set aside the flood \nplain of the Cache La Poudre River as it flows down from the mountains \nthrough Fort Collins and through Greeley just below the areas that are \ndesignated as wild and scenic.\n  It is a wonderful opportunity because through land exchanges--that \nis, taking land that is declared surplus in the State owned by the \nFederal Government and exchanging it for ownership in the flood plain--\nwe can preserve the area in the flood plain along an important stretch \nof river that, if no action is taken, will become city within two to \nthree decades. Literally, we have the chance to do what they wished \nthey had done in New York or what they wished they had done in San \nFrancisco or what they wished they had done in Los Angeles--leave open \nspace and beauty.\n  Mr. President, I have been shocked at the very partisan nature of \nsome of the attacks by Democratic Members on this floor upon \nRepublicans. I cannot help but reflect that this bill, which has \nunanimous support at home from both Democrats and Republicans, appears \nto be in jeopardy of dying simply because of the actions of the \nDemocratic Senator from New Jersey, who put a hold on the bill for \nmonths and months, and may well have achieved killing it. It is an \nenvironmental bill. I must say I cannot understand the action of that \nDemocratic Senator and why he would want to kill it. But to claim that \ninterest in the environment falls along partisan lines is just silly. \nIt is widely shared by all Americans, and it is why we honor this day.\n  I am convinced that we have to take strong, bold, affirmative action \nif we are to do our part. Simply saying no is not enough.\n  Mr. President, most important of all, refusing to look at the \nstatutes that have been passed with an eye to improving them is not \nenough either. No one can look at the Superfund and not be ashamed of \nwhat has happened. Ninety percent of the money that was spent on the \nSuperfund, money designed to clean up our environment, is spent for \nlawyers and process costs. That is a disgrace. Anyone who comes to this \nfloor and decries the efforts to reform Superfund simply has not taken \nthe time to look at it or does not genuinely care about the \nenvironment, and I know that cannot be true.\n  The reality is we need to use that money in the Superfund to clean up \nthe environment--not simply pay lawyers. The actions with regard to \nenvironmental reform should not be dictated by trial lawyers who donate \nlarge amounts of money to political campaigns. They ought to be \ndedicated in our interest and our need to reform and improve the \nenvironment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  [Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries.]\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will note that no demonstrations are \nallowed from the galleries.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nUtah.\n\n[[Page S3759]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n              Holistic Resource Management, Earth Day 1996\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with my colleagues \nin commenting on Earth Day and, I hope, adding some information and \nperspective to the debate on Earth Day that will move in the direction \nthat will be good for our country as a whole.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this 26th \nanniversary celebration of Earth Day. Many natural factors influence \ngrazing on western public lands, with precipitation or the lack thereof \nprobably being the single most important one. Without moisture, and \nspecifically, moisture falling at the correct time, the amount of \npotential forage can be severely impacted. We can try but there is \nusually little, outside of asking for divine intervention, that humans \ncan do to influence natural events. But we can change perceptions about \npublic land grazing. We can manage the conflict that arises based on \nthese perceptions. Never before in the history of this country has \nthere been an issue so divisive, emotional and surrounded by \nperception, myth and hysteria as the issue of western public land \ngrazing. Yet there are solutions; solutions that can solve conflict \nthrough planning, science, consensus, and shifting from traditional \nparadigms.\n  I speak to you today about a solution that has my support. It blends \nnew ideas about natural resource management, planning and science with \na healthy dose of old-fashioned hard work and common sense. Coordinated \nresource management is not about the management of grazing; any issue \nthat has polarized western public land managers, public land users and \nlawmakers. CRM is a process that offers solutions to natural resource \nproblems, requiring the cooperation of landowners, Government agencies, \nand other interested individuals and groups. Coordinated resource \nmanagement is a voluntary and cooperative solution to natural resource \nmanagement issues. CRM is based on the work of many, but notably the \nwork of Allan Savory culminated in his book ``Holistic Resource \nManagement.''\n  Conflict about management and use of western public lands has \nfestered for years especially over multiple uses on lands managed by \nthe Bureau of Land Management. This low profile agency, often \noverlooked by most Americans, has become the focus of intensive battles \nover the variety of uses it manages. Western public lands have gone \nfrom being the lands that no one wanted, to lands targeted by special \ninterest groups for designation or special uses. This has been done \nwithout regard for traditional uses of the land and the families and \nindustries that have adapted to the use of these lands. Conflict \nbetween users perceptions about management and the future of western \npublic land agencies are the issues. These can be resolved by careful \nimplementation of coordinated resource management.\n  Using the best efforts of local people, private landowners, \ninterested Federal, State, local and State agencies, CRM integrates and \ncoordinates resource uses to accomplish specific goals. The process is \ndesigned to achieve comparability between land and resources uses. \nThere are a number of success stories world wide where CRM has been \nused to solve resource management issues. In my State, one of the \nnotable examples is the Desert Ranch in northeastern Utah. Once a ranch \ntroubled by apparent downward trends in forage production, conflicts \nwith wildlife, incidents of extreme erosion, and degraded riparian \nareas, it is now a model of natural resource management efficiency. \nAfter implementing a holistic or coordinated resource Management plan, \nthe ranch now graze more livestock than it has traditionally and \nproduces some of the finest big game hunting in the West. Cattle have \nbeen used at such intensities as to make traditional private and public \nland range managers blanch. In most instances several hundred more \ncattle than normal graze pastures, which rebound with dramatic \nincreases in forage production. Riparian areas have improved \nsignificantly, after being grazed at such intensities, to the point \nthat streams are stocked by naturally breeding populations of trout \ninstead of the Utah Division of Wildlife resources. Compare this to \nadjacent public and private lands where decreases in the numbers of \nlivestock are almost annual, and where erosion and over grazing impact \nriparian areas and their value. Why this dramatic difference? Hard \nwork, vision and a coordinated resource management plan. There are many \nother successes, especially tied to grazing. But the value of CRM is \nthat the process can be applied to almost any resource management issue \nincluding the designation of wilderness.\n  CRM addresses the dilemma of managing areas with multiple use \nownership, conflicting management objectives and requirements, \nconflicting land-use demands and off-site impacts. The overall goal of \ncoordinated resource management is to serve as a vehicle to reach \nagreement on natural resources issues that will improve natural \nresources values for all users and to promote quality natural resource \nmanagement through collaborative efforts. In other words, if people \ncome to the table with the goal of reaching consensus, regardless of \nthe diversity of agendas, many natural resource conflicts can be solved \nand perceptions changed. I support the concepts of CRM and encourage \nthe use of the process to solve natural resource problems. We can set a \ngoal to use the coordinated resource management process as a dynamic, \nlong-term tribute to Earth Day 1996.\n  I remember as a freshman Member of this body sitting on the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee when someone came before that committee \nfor confirmation. I will not identify him because I do not want to \nembarrass him. The exchange that occurred between him and the then \nchairman of the committee, the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston], \nspeaks for itself and does not need to necessarily be personalized.\n  In the process of the confirmation hearing, Chairman Johnston said to \nthis man, somewhat startling me, ``When you make your decisions on the \nenvironment, will you make those decisions on the basis of sound \nscience or superstition?'' Well, I sat there as a new member of the \ncommittee and thought this is a very easy question to answer. I \nwondered why the chairman raised it. Then I heard the response from the \nwitness. He started to give all kinds of discussions about \nconsiderations that had to be examined and constituencies that should \nbe heard from, and so on. Chairman Johnston interrupted him. He said, \n``You are not answering my question. When it comes to issues of the \nenvironment, will you make your decisions on the basis of sound science \nor superstition?'' The answer came back in the same mode, that there \nare many constituencies of the Department of Energy and the \nconstituencies have to be heard. A third time Chairman Johnston stopped \nhim and asked the question. ``Do not evade it. Give me a direct answer. \nWill you make your decisions on the basis of sound science or \nsuperstition?'' For the third time the answer started to come out, and \nthe chairman cut him off, and said, ``It is clear that you do not want \nto answer the question, and we will move on.''\n  I was sufficiently disturbed by that. But when it finally came my \nturn to question the witness, I said to him, ``Do you realize what this \nRecord says as it currently stands? You have been asked three times by \nthe chairman of this committee, a senior member of the Democratic \nParty, a major figure in the party that controls both Houses of \nCongress, and the administration, that, `Will you make your decisions \non the basis of sound science or superstition?' and each time you have \nfailed to answer. Unless you do answer that, the Record is going to \nstand quoting you as saying you do not believe that sound science \nshould rule over superstition when it comes to the environment. Do you \nreally want the Record to show that?'' At that point he said to me, \n``Well, no, Senator, I do not want the Record to show that. Of course \nwe will pay attention to science.'' I said, ``That is the point that \ngets lost in all of this debate about the environment. We have a number \nof misconceptions about the environment to make us feel good, and I am \ndelighted that you have finally made it clear that at least in your \narea under your jurisdiction environmental decisions will be based on \nsound science instead of response to the superstitions that are going \naround.''\n\n[[Page S3760]]\n\n  That particular exchange, long since passed into history, has stuck \nin my mind. I repeat it here on Earth Day because I think that is the \ncrux of the various controversies that we are involved in when we talk \nabout the environment.\n  Let me address one of the misconceptions that I find as I go around \nand talk to people about the environment. That is the notion that \nNature is perfect, human beings are despoilers, Nature does things in \nan orderly way, and human beings just mess things up. That, I think, is \nthe misconception that surrounds this whole environmental debate.\n  I sat in the chair one evening during the debate on the grazing bill, \nand the senior Senator from Wyoming, Senator Simpson, showed us some \nphotographs. I was sufficiently impressed by that. I think we ought to \ntake a look at them again. I brought them along.\n  It so happens that over 100 years ago, in 1870, a photographer went \nout in Wyoming and started to take pictures of the magnificent scenery \nthat is available in Wyoming.\n  Here is the photograph taken on August 12, 1870, of a particular \nvista in Wyoming. In 1976, a photographer went back to the same spot \nand took a picture from the same location.\n  If you will examine the difference, you will see that under wise \nmanagement by human beings, the grasses are much healthier, the area \nand vegetation is much lusher. Human beings, instead of despoiling the \nground, have in fact improved it.\n  The Senator from Wyoming had a number of such pictures. I have \nbrought along two of them. Here is another one. Here is the 1870 \nphotograph--pretty barren, pretty bleak. Here is the 1976 photograph, \n100 years later--much healthier vegetation, much healthier conditions.\n  In the debate on the Utah wilderness bill, I produced this photograph \nfor our colleagues to see. This is not 100 years. This is only 50 \nyears. The Escalante River in 1949. You can see how barren this is. \nAfter 50 years of wise management in the area, you can see now that \nthis area is revegetated.\n  I showed this in Utah during the Easter break, and I was attacked by \nsome people who said, ``Senator, just because its pretty doesn't mean \nits wilderness.''\n  They pointed to the lower photograph and said, ``That's a violation \nof nature because,'' Senator, ``you're not smart enough to know this. \nWe are. Some of that vegetation down there is not indigenous to Utah. \nThese trees that ended up here came from outside of Utah. It's a \nviolation of the purity of this wilderness to have Asian species in \nthat area.''\n  I went back to some land managers to ask them about that, and they \nsaid, ``Yes, there is some tamarisk there. Some of the green vegetation \naround the river area--you see no vegetation whatever here--some of the \ngreen vegetation is tamarisk, but most of the vegetation is cottonwood, \nshrubs, and grasses indigenous to Utah. Tamarisk is not a weed. It is a \ntree that was imported ironically for soil conservation reasons. The \ntamarisk was planted to prevent erosion.\n  Now, if we adopt the notion that everything nature does is perfect \nand everything we need to do should be geared toward preserving things \nin their absolutely natural state, we run into a very serious problem. \nThat problem is this: Nature is not constant. Nature changes the face \nof the land all the time.\n  Secretary Babbitt has just spent 4 days walking along the C Canal \nto try to raise our awareness of Earth Day. Why the C Canal? Because \nwith one storm, nature devastated the C Canal. It was all scenic, \nprotected, and preserved, but nature came along and after one storm, \nwith the winter floods the C Canal was devastated.\n  If you go back to my home State of Utah and say we want our land to \nremain in the condition that nature decreed that it should be, the \nargument could be made that the entire State should be under water. \nThere was a time--and it can be demonstrated by the geologic features \nalong the benches around the Salt Lake Valley, and throughout the \nmountains, that Lake Bonneville, as we call it, once covered most of \nthe State of Utah and southern Idaho. It was bigger than any of the \nGreat Lakes--bigger than Lake Michigan or Lake Huron or Lake Superior--\nit was a huge body of inland water.\n  Is it not wonderful that nature has created this magnificent, inland, \nfreshwater sea? And then something happened. Nature changed it. One \nday, in southern Idaho, up by Lone Rock, the lake burst its banks and \nan outlet to that freshwater sea was created. It started, over the many \nmillennia, to disappear.\n  What we have remaining in Utah now is another magnificent gift of \nnature. It is the Great Salt Lake. The salt flats to the west of the \nlake are the remnants of Lake Bonneville which over the millennia. In \nthat area now you have this unique natural phenomenon called the \nBonneville Salt Flats created by nature. If we are going to say that in \nthe name of the environment we must preserve nature as it was, we have \nto go back to the boundaries of Lake Bonneville and try to find some \nway to fill it all up with water again because that is what nature once \nhad.\n  The fact of the matter is--and this is sound science, Mr. President--\nnature changes. It changes daily. It changes over the years. It changes \nin ways that are good, and, as the C Canal, it changes in ways that \nare bad.\n  Our responsibility as proper, sound stewards of the land and \nenvironment is to make intelligent decisions and not get carried away \nwith superstition, nor rely on misconceptions as fact.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield up to 15 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Chair. I wish to thank the Senator from \nGeorgia very much for his leadership as we debate this issue.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, today, as we celebrate Earth Day, we \nshould stop to consider our air, the quality of life, and the world we \nwill leave our children. And because of the lessons that he taught that \nwe should pass on to our children, this is the right occasion to look \nback on the legacy of Teddy Roosevelt, a great Republican, a true \nconservative, who first taught America the importance of conservation. \nUnder President Roosevelt's stewardship, America first endorsed the \nwise use of our natural resources, established the National Park \nSystem, and preserved for all time the great Yellowstone National Park.\n  In a message to Congress on December 3, 1907, President Roosevelt \nsaid:\n\n       To waste, to destroy our natural resources, to skin and \n     exhaust the land instead of using it so as to increase its \n     usefulness, will result in undermining in the days of our \n     children the very prosperity which we ought--by right--to \n     hand down to them amplified and developed.\n\n  President Roosevelt's words are as true today as when spoken 90 years \nago. We Republicans can be proud of President Roosevelt's heritage, but \nas a nation we must implement President Roosevelt's vision of leaving \nour children an environment and an economy better than that which we \ninherited.\n  We are all environmentalists. We have to be. Who can be against our \nlife support system? Our own personal experiences make the environment \nan emotional issue. All of us have great stories of the outdoors.\n  Being from Idaho, I can tell you that I have had some tremendous \ntrips down the white-water rapids where, as you begin to hear the first \nroar of the rapids, you are filled with anticipation, and then when you \nmake it through those rapids the exhilaration that you feel camping \nunder the majesty of the canopy of ponderosa pines, with the full moon \nabove.\n  I know the great splendor of Idaho's Sawtooth Mountains, and I wish \nto leave my children a legacy of conservation of which they can be \nproud.\n  Before coming to the Senate, I served as mayor of Boise, ID. Boise is \ngraced with the Boise River. This river serves many uses. It provides \nabout a third of our drinking water. It serves as a major recreational \nand fishing amenity, and it provides habitat to many diverse species.\n  How many cities in America can boast of bald eagles and blue heron \njust 5 minutes from the center of downtown? Boise is fortunate, but \nBoise is not unique. From the Puget Sound to the Everglades, this \ncountry is blessed with some of the most magnificent natural and scenic \ntreasures on the planet. We are also blessed with the largest\n\n[[Page S3761]]\n\nand most vibrant economy on the planet. We must preserve these gifts of \neconomy and environment.\n\n  If you have a high-paying job but you live in a community where the \nair and the water is polluted, weeds and trash have overrun your parks, \nyou do not have quality of life. But conversely, if your community \nenjoys clean air, clean water, beautiful open spaces, but you do not \nhave a job and you cannot provide for your children, then you do not \nhave quality of life either. So, our challenge is to reach that balance \nbetween a clean environment and a sound economy. I believe that we can. \nIn fact, this Senate has already taken major steps to make that happen.\n  I am proud of the work that we did on the Safe Drinking Water Act \nreauthorization. Working in a bipartisan way, we passed a bill that is \nstrong on public health protection; in fact, we ought to call it the \n``safer'' drinking water act. It takes into consideration the costs of \nproviding clean and safe water.\n  The Safe Drinking Water Act should serve as a model for accomplishing \nsound environmental law. Everyone had a seat at the table and a say in \ndrafting the legislation. The environmental and public health \nadvocates, water utilities, States, cities, counties, businesses, all \nworked cooperatively on the bill. Republicans and Democrats put aside \npartisan politics for the good of the Nation.\n  As a result, the Senate passed the Safe Drinking Water Act 99 to 0, \nand everyone in this Chamber can be proud of that legislation. That is \nan example of a bill that improves public health and safety and leads \nto good quality of life. It is good for the environment, and it is good \nfor our communities.\n  There were lessons learned during the 10 months we negotiated that \nbill, and those lessons will serve us well as we look at other \nenvironmental issues. One key was the active participation of State and \nlocal governments. Who knows better what each community needs, a local \nleader or a Washington bureaucrat, who quite often has never been to \nyour State or your community? Believe me, as a former local official, I \nhad much more confidence in my city's ability to meet its needs than \nany orders from Washington, DC.\n  True, Congress must set national standards, but we should allow local \nand State governments the flexibility to let those standards work in \ntheir specific situations. The only way to do this efficiently and \neconomically is by bringing the local leaders and the State leaders \ninto the process. We should also let local communities solve their \nproblems without the burden of Government redtape.\n\n  One example is the Henry's Fork Watershed Council in northeastern \nIdaho. The council grew out of years of conflict between fly fishermen \nand irrigators. Each group had what they believed to be legitimate \nclaims to the waters of Henry's Fork system. The river is a blue-ribbon \ntrout fishery, revered by fly fishermen from across the world for is \ncrystal clear water and trophy rainbow and brown trout. But the farmers \nin Fremont and Madison Counties need the water from the Island Park \nReservoir also. They need the water to irrigate their acres of potatoes \nand barley. A great number of Idaho's famous potatoes are grown in this \nregion, and those crops help sustain the economy of that part of Idaho.\n  Finally, after years of fighting, the Fremont-Madison Irrigation \nDistrict and the Henry's Fork Foundation fly fishermen realized that \nwhile they argued, the quality of the resource that they both so \ndesperately needed was deteriorating. So they put aside their \ndifferences and they started working together for the common good.\n  It has worked. Last summer, for example, when the water temperatures \nsoared and threatened the fish, the irrigators voluntarily agreed to \nrelease the water from the dam, filling the streambeds with cold water \nand saving the fish. Before this cooperative agreement, it might have \ntaken weeks of negotiations and miles of redtape before anything was \ndone.\n  I will add that the Federal Government is a partner in this sort of \nsituation--the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Forest Service, the \nBureau of Reclamation, the Natural Resources Conservation Service. But \nthe key is it was the local parties that got together and found the \nsolution--local people, local solutions.\n  In another pristine part of Idaho, industry has taken the lead in \nenvironmental protection and restoration. Potlach Corp. has voluntarily \nset aside valuable forest land along Mica Creek. I have been to that \nlocation. I took with me the chairman of the full Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, Senator John Chafee. The goal of the Mica Creek \nproject is to establish baseline management data surrounding natural \nevents and conditions. The project is proof that there are so many, \nmany businesses in this great land of ours who want to do the best \npossible job that they can to protect and even enhance the environment. \nAnd just as in the case of Mica Creek, they did not need Government to \ntell them to do this. They did this on their own, because they know it \nis the right thing to do.\n\n  Local people, local solutions--they can also help with other \nmonumental tasks facing Congress, tasks such as the Endangered Species \nAct.\n  There is a growing recognition in this country that the Endangered \nSpecies Act must be reformed. Last year I introduced legislation to \nimprove the Endangered Species Act, to make it more effective in \nrecovering species and to make it more fair. Last month I began \nbipartisan discussion with my colleagues on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee and the administration with the goal of developing a \nbill over the next few weeks that will actually preserve endangered \nspecies, improve their habitat while recognizing the legitimate needs \nof people and making the act work. This is a goal that we can all \nshare.\n  My view is that too often the interpretation and the implementation \nof the Endangered Species Act has gone far beyond the original intent. \nThe Endangered Species Act should not be a tool that places entire \ncommunities at risk by threatening their economic survival. At the same \ntime, we cannot turn our backs on the efforts to save endangered \nspecies.\n  For now, though, this Endangered Species Act, on its present course \nof heavy regulation, putting people at risk, is not working. To single \nout individual communities to carry the full brunt of recovery of an \nendangered species when the entire national community is the \nbeneficiary is wrong. But to say that the extinction of a species is no \nbig deal and just the luck of the draw of that particular species is \nalso wrong. The extreme entities that would advocate both positions, in \nall honesty, probably deserve one another, on some remote desert island \nwhere the only way they will survive is to help each other.\n  So, what is right? Should we make concerted efforts to save species? \nAbsolutely. Can we prioritize which species we should make greater \nefforts towards? We must. Can we do this without undermining private \nproperty rights and putting whole communities at risk? We had better, \nor the outcry against the act will kill it.\n  Reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act is, without question, \none of the most politically polarized issues that we will ever deal \nwith. It may also be one of the most important environmental issues for \nus and for our children. As lawmakers, we have a duty to rise above the \nrhetoric. So, let us get real and let us get practical.\n  A lot has changed since the Endangered Species Act was enacted in \n1973. For one thing, scientists have made tremendous advances in every \ndiscipline. Biology, botany, genetics, and other sciences are much more \nsophisticated than they were 23 years ago. But the rules and the \nregulations of the Endangered Species Act have not changed to keep up \nwith the science. So we need to acknowledge the advances and use them \nto balance an improved Endangered Species Act.\n  Untold millions of dollars have been spent to save species with very \nfew results. Of the more than 1,500 species of plants and animals that \nhave been qualified for protection in the 23 years the law has been in \neffect, only 20 have been removed from the list, either because they \nhave gone extinct or were placed on the list by mistake. Only six can \nbe claimed as successes under the Endangered Species Act, and even they \nwere largely recovered due to the efforts of private conservation \ngroups.\n  One such group is the Peregrine Fund at the World Center for Birds of \nPrey in Boise, ID.\n\n[[Page S3762]]\n\n  The efforts of this private group has led to a proposed delisting of \nthe peregrine falcon. Just 20 years ago, there were only 39 known pairs \nof peregrine falcons in the lower 48 States. Today, recovery and \nreintroduction efforts have produced nearly 1,000 pairs. More than 81 \npercent of the falcons released have reached independence. The success \nof the Peregrine Fund should be a model for reforming the Endangered \nSpecies Act. If at all possible, we want to avoid putting species on \nthe endangered list. We would like to take them off, and the only \nacceptable way is through recovery. This cooperative effort shows that \nwe can use good science and manage a species early in its decline and \nbring about these kinds of results. We can recover species, and the \nwork of the Peregrine Fund shows that if Government will provide \nincentives and then get out of the way, that we can, through innovation \nand good science, achieve the very results that all of us applaud.\n  I envision an Endangered Species Act that uses good science, \ninnovation, incentives, and, where necessary, public financial \nresources to do what we, the stewards of this wonderful land, can do to \nbenefit not only other species but ourselves as well.\n  I envision an Endangered Species Act that encourages all of us to \nparticipate willingly to conserve rare and unique species.\n  I envision an Endangered Species Act that treats property owners \nfairly and with consideration and that minimizes the social and \neconomic impact of this law on the lives of citizens.\n  Working together, we can draft legislation that takes that important \nstep in that direction. We can make the act smarter, and we can make \nthat act better.\n  I believe that Congress has abdicated its responsibility by not \ndealing with the Endangered Species Act sooner. I can see why. Advocate \nchange and you are immediately labeled as antienvironmentalist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I grant the Senator from Idaho 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, this should not be a contest to see \nwho is more for the environment. We should all be in favor of a \ncleaner, safer, healthier America for our children and their children.\n  I have called myself a probusiness environmentalist. We have been \nable to strike a balance between development and the environment. A \ngood environment makes good business and, therefore, good business will \ninvest in protecting the environment. Economic growth and quality \nenvironment are not mutually exclusive. They, in fact, can and should \nand must support one another.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, at this time, I yield up to 10 minutes \nto the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3755-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3762-S3766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              EARTH DAY, 1996: A DIFFERENT SHADE OF GREEN\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, on a day set aside to recognize the \nimportance of protecting our environment and preserving our natural \nresources, I am pleased to join with my colleagues in this frank \ndiscussion of the substantial progress we have made and the steps we \nhave yet to take.\n  But first, it is important to recognize that environmental protection \nis not a partisan matter. It is not about Republicans or Democrats. \nThis is one issue which should bring us together, because on this \nissue, we share the same goal: We all want a clean America, where our \nchildren can breathe clean air and drink clean water. And there is not \na man or woman in this Congress who would demand anything less for \ntheir families.\n  I am so proud, Mr. President, that over the past 20 years, we have \nmade such great strides toward achieving that goal.\n  Our urban landscapes are no longer polluted by the thick, black smoke \nof industrial smokestacks. Our lakes and rivers are no longer the \ndumping ground for toxic sludge. We are recycling newspapers, glass, \nand plastics in record numbers. Through efforts such as the \nConservation Reserve Program, Congress is working in partnership with \nthe American people to ensure our generation leaves behind a cleaner \nEarth than the one we inherited.\n  We acknowledge that government at all levels can and should play a \nstrong role in protecting our environment. Maybe that is why the United \nStates spends more per capita on environmental protection than any \nother Western, industrialized nation.\n  The question is no longer whether or not we want to protect the \nenvironment--we all do. The question is, How do we achieve it?\n  It is an interesting coincidence that just a week ago, the American \npeople were filing their Federal income tax returns and thinking about \nGovernment and how it impacts the family finances.\n  Today, exactly 1 week after Tax Day, we are marking Earth Day. And \nonce again, the American people have an opportunity to think about \nGovernment--this time, its impact on the environment. But in the 26 \nyears since Earth Day was first celebrated, Americans have grown \nconcerned with Washington's environmental activism: What it is doing to \njobs and salaries, and the bite it takes out of the family checkbook.\n\n  What they are telling us is yes, government ought to protect the \nenvironment. But they are also saying it can do better by the \ntaxpayers, too. And so they have asked this Congress to find a better \nbalance, a ``different shade of green'' for Earth Day, 1996.\n  Over the past two decades, the Federal Government has worked toward \nbetter environmental protection by passing new legislation and imposing \nnecessary new regulations. But in our zeal to protect the environment, \nwe have often neglected to consider the serious, unintended \nconsequences of the actions we are taking here in Washington.\n  We have cleaned up neighborhoods by clamping down on pollution, but \nwe have handcuffed job-providers from finding better ways to achieve \nthe same results.\n  We have sought out and protected wetlands and other unique \nenvironmental areas, but we have often commandeered people's land, \nwithout compensation, to do it.\n  We have demanded a great deal of the American people through our \nenvironmental regulations, but we have forgotten about the burdensome \ncosts and confusing bureaucracies our vigilance have imposed on \neverybody.\n  It is hard to measure the benefits of our well-intentioned, \nenvironmental safeguards when these Federal regulations come at such a \nhigh cost.\n  The American people are telling us that Washington has gone too far, \nespecially given the estimates that complying with environmental \nregulations cost an estimated $850 billion every year. That is $850 \nbillion no longer available to pay higher wages and better benefits, \nand creating new jobs.\n  Is it possible that the environmental policies of the past have a \ncost that can be measured in terms greater than just dollars? Could \nthey be costing human lives as well? According to researchers at \nHarvard University, the answer is yes. Because the government has \nincreasingly focused its precious resources guarding the public against \nminuscule, theoretical risks, they are ignoring much greater dangers--a \nsituation Dr. John Graham of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis \nlabels ``statistical murder.'' It is a policy, say researchers, that \ncosts 60,000 lives every year.\n  In other words, we have spent a lot of our taxpayers' hard-earned \nmoney on wasteful and nonproductive programs, rather than spending \nthose dollars on finding a cure for, say, cancer, leukemia, or heart \ndisease.\n  That kind of micromanagement, undertaken at such a horrible cost, is \nthe wrong approach. No wonder so many average Americans feel they are \nbeing victimized by oppressive environmental legislation. In many \ncases, the Government has caused more damage than it has improved, and \nour goal should be to balance environmental protection with the need \nfor economic growth as well. We always talk about the best welfare \nprogram being a job, but we have unnecessarily lost thousands of jobs \nbecause we have ignored\n\n[[Page S3763]]\n\nthe end result of bad policy. If we are ever going to achieve balance, \nthe solutions will not be dictated from Washington, DC, where layers of \nbureaucracy and waste cloud every decision. Sensible relief will only \nbe found outside the beltway, by reining in the Federal regulators and \ngiving our constituents the freedom to achieve the environmental goals \neveryone shares.\n  The Government can set goals or limits, but we should then step back \nand let the creative genius of Americans work on the solution in less \ncostly, innovative ways. Expensive, one-size-fits-all dictates from \nWashington are not the answer, nor is using old technology to treat new \nproblems. If experience has taught us anything over the past 26 years, \nit is that wisdom and compassion does not flow from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  That has clearly been the lesson of the Superfund program, a classic \nexample of Washington-knows-best gone wrong.\n  Let us look at the facts.\n  Mr. President, 25 billion taxpayer dollars have been spent over the \npast 15 years cleaning up toxic waste sites on Superfund's National \nPriorities List. Yet as of today, only 12 percent of these sites have \nactually been cleaned up. Excessive administrative costs and a bloated \nbureaucracy have eaten away a lot of the money, while billions of \ndollars have gone to line the pockets of trial lawyers, who continue to \ndelay Superfund's important work. The lawyers are benefiting while the \nAmerican taxpayers get burned.\n  The end result? Fewer hazardous sites are being cleaned up and more \nAmericans are being put at risk.\n  Clearly, the Superfund program is broken. Congress has an opportunity \nthis year to reform Superfund and redirect the taxpayers' dollars away \nfrom the bureaucrats and lawyers, and toward meeting the original \nintent of the law: and that was cleaning up the environment.\n  The Endangered Species Act is another well-intentioned, but \nproblematic, piece of legislation.\n  I have always believed the Federal Government can assist landowners \nin being the best stewards of their lands. But the Endangered Species \nAct provides an incentive for them to actually harm endangered species.\n  Under the act, if a landowner is told by the Government that their \nproperty is home to an endangered species, they are stripped of their \nability to use their own land. Not only are they deprived of that \nland--and the enjoyment and revenue it might generate--but they are \nalso denied any compensation from the Federal Government.\n  While that is obviously not the intent of the Endangered Species Act, \nit has become an unfortunate, perverse byproduct of the legislation.\n  One way Congress could improve the endangered species legislation is \nto provide incentives for property owners that would enable them to \nprotect the environment, instead of forcing them into desperate actions \nwhen they've been threatened by Federal bureaucrats.\n  Mr. President, what is most often lacking in Washington's attempts to \nimprove the environment through regulation is an effort to get the big \npicture--a scientific approach to assess the various risks, and then \ndirect resources where they can do the most good. Risk assessment and \ncost-benefit analyses are commonsense approaches undertaken out in the \nreal world, but sorely missing in the Federal Government.\n  When businesses or individuals make important decisions, they usually \nperform their own version of a risk assessment. To best serve the \ntaxpayers--who deserve to know what kind of bang their getting for \ntheir bucks--Federal agencies ought to be targeting their resources in \nthe same way, eliminating overzealous regulation by asking the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to focus on real solutions to real \nproblems. This will not only free up more funds for financially \nstrapped Federal agencies, but also provide a higher level of \nenvironmental and public health protection.\n  Giving our job creators more flexibility in meeting national \nstandards is another way to eliminate the pervasive command and control \napproach that has infected many Federal programs. A pilot program \ncalled Project XL is proof that these efforts do work.\n  I have been working on Project XL with the Minnesota Pollution \nControl Agency, Minnesota-based 3M, and the EPA. This popular program \nallows participating companies to come up with their own methods to go \nbeyond minimum environmental compliance. Allowing business to best \ndetermine how to meet all Federal standards is an innovative idea that \nshould be expanded. As long as those standards are met, the path \ntraveled to reach compliance should be open to experimentation.\n  And finally, the Federal Government needs to promote a better \npartnership between all levels of government, job providers, \nenvironmental interest groups, and the taxpayers. The most effective \nway for the Federal Government to play a strong role in protecting the \nenvironment is to do it in concert with those closest to the problems. \nLocal solutions, not Washington domination.\n\n  That means setting reasonable national standards and giving technical \nadvice to State and local governments and businesses. I have always \nbelieved that Minnesota taxpayers and our elected officials in St. Paul \nare much more aware of local problems and how to solve them than \nWashington will ever be.\n  ``It is not easy being green,'' went the lyrics of a popular song \nfrom the 1980's. Maybe not, if being green in the 1990's means \npromoting an environmental agenda that flies in the face of common \nsense and treats the taxpayers with contempt.\n  Americans are looking for a different shade of green, Mr. President, \nan approach to the environment that strengthens the protection of our \nprecious natural resources, promotes better health and safety measures, \nand helps rein in the exploding regulatory costs that are threatening \npeople's paychecks.\n  Government does have an important role in ensuring a strong \nenvironmental safety net. But we can do better. In closing, Mr. \nPresident, by reforming the system and providing balance, we will \nenhance environmental cleanup and preservation while we protect \nlandowners from undue Government interference, reduce costly, arbitrary \nregulations, and ultimately, save more lives.\n  So, Mr. President, on Earth Day, 1996, that is the shade of green \nthis Congress is working to deliver.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank my colleague from Minnesota. I yield up to 10 \nminutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair. And I thank the Senator from Georgia for \nhis effort to organize this group of conversations regarding the \nprotection of our environment.\n  I noticed from some of the comments that certain Democrats, anyway, I \nshould say, have appeared to take offense that Republicans are actually \nworking to protect the environment, apparently under the belief that \nEarth Day is a special day for them to demagog and politicize \nenvironmental issues. The real purpose of Earth Day is to recognize \nimportant work being done to protect our environment.\n  Today I want to discuss briefly two specific projects undertaken by a \nbroad group of interests in my home State of Arizona that do exactly \nthat.\n  The first has to do with ranchers in southeast Arizona who are acting \nas true stewards of the lands for the purpose of protecting the \ngrasslands on which they currently are grazing. Many ranchers are \nworking in harmony with nature not only to earn a living but also to \nprotect the environment upon which they are earning that living. They \nare using their natural resources in a way that it is meant to be used.\n  In his forward to Dan Dagget's book called ``Beyond the Rangeland \nConflict--Toward a West That Works,'' David Getches, who is chairman of \nthe board of trustees of the Grand Canyon Trust, said of ranchers on \nthe Colorado Plateau--I am quoting--\n\n       It's not hard to find ranchers on the plateau who share \n     some of our most heartfelt values. Most want their \n     grandchildren to know a region with a healthy ecosystem and \n     places of wonder, beauty and solitude. And most can \n     understand that economic stability and permanence of \n     communities are intertwined with the permanent health of the \n     surrounding land, water, and wildlife.\n\n  Certainly Professor Getches is correct because some of the people who\n\n[[Page S3764]]\n\ncare the most about the land are those ranchers. I speak specifically \nof a new group called the Malpai Borderlands Group which is the essence \nof this commitment for protection. I met with representatives of the \nMalpai Group over the Easter recess when I was in Douglas, AZ. I was \nvery impressed with the work they are doing as a combined group of \nranchers, representatives of environmental groups, Federal agencies, \nand other people in the community.\n  The area in which they are working together is an area of thousands \nof acres in both New Mexico and Arizona which is the home of a great \nmany endangered species and an environment that needs help. The land \nownership is about half private and half Federal agency, the Federal \nlands being the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service as \nwell as some State trust land.\n\n  But in 1990 this group got together to begin discussing ways of \ndealing with what they thought was a deteriorating situation, an attack \non ranching generally, and also a deteriorating environment. The \ngrasslands, with some shrubs, were moving inexorably to shrub lands \nwith some grass. And this occurred for many reasons. But the principal \none was the absence of a very natural element--fire.\n  For years fire used to sweep through this area every decade or so \nand, in effect, cleanse it of all of the woody shrubby plants which \nthen promoted very shortly thereafter fresh new grass for the wildlife \nthen to thrive on. But because of the fire suppression that has not \noccurred in the last 100 years or so, the result is that the grasslands \nhave gradually now become woods where there are shrubby lands that \ncannot support grazing.\n  So the agenda of this group was to address both the threat of \nfragmentation of the landscape--selling off smaller parcels for \ndevelopment--and the decreasing productivity and loss of biological \ndiversity accompanying the encroachment of these woody species on the \ngrasslands.\n  What they did is form the 501(c)3 organization called the Malpai \nBorderlands Group with 45 rancher members. And its 19-member board \nincludes local ranchers, a scientist, and a businessman, and, as I \nsaid, representatives of various environmental groups. It has a 5-year \nplan for ecosystem management that targets three key concerns.\n  First, conservation and land protection, including such things as on-\nthe-ground projects, use of fire, and holding of conservation \neasements; second, sustaining rural livelihoods, including innovative \napproaches to grazing, possibly the cooperative marketing of beef, and \nexploring other opportunities with low impact to the environment; and, \nthird, science and education, including a comprehensive resource \ninventory of the area.\n  The Malpai Group has taken an evolutionary, if not revolutionary, \napproach to ranching, working with biologists, soil conservation \nspecialists, BLM and Forest Service representatives, and the Nature \nConservancy to find ways to keep this area literally a working \nwilderness.\n  As I alluded to, reintroducing fire is a crucial element of the \nMalpai group's plan to restore the range. As a result, they have worked \nin several experimental areas restoring that element of fire and \nbringing back the grasslands.\n  The success of this group, as I said, is really due to a commitment \nof the landowners. Participation is purely voluntary. The enthusiasm of \nthis group of land stewards is clearly a shining example to those who \nwould like to create such organizations and protect their own areas, \nworking together.\n  As Bill McDonald, Malpai Borderlands Group president, says of the \ngroup: ``In a political climate where the traditional position on the \nissue of land use is usually to be at one end of the spectrum or the \nother, we find ourselves in the `radical center.' We invite you to join \nus right there.''\n  Mr. President, I joined that group just a couple of weeks ago to try \nto help them clear away some of the bureaucratic underbrush that might \nprevent them from moving forward with their very important, innovative \nexperimentation.\n  Now, the second key thing relates to the forests in the arid \nSouthwest. Natural fire is not just a friend of the grasslands but has \nalso helped to maintain the health of our forests over the years. Once \nagain, because of fire suppression and other problems, our forest \nhealth has deteriorated because that natural phenomena that used to \nkeep it healthy is no longer part of our management process. Instead, \nwhat happens is that because we suppress fire, the fuel in the forests \nbuilds up and the growth begins to become very concentrated, with the \nresult that when the fire comes, it burns not only the underbrush as it \nused to do, thus clearing the forest of the smaller, scrubbier kind of \nplants, but quickly crowns to the top of the trees and literally jumps \nfrom tree to tree, devastating entire forests.\n  The other problem with the forests is the health condition today. Too \nmany trees are crowding into too small an area which then sucks all of \nthe nutrients and the moisture from that area, thus providing a more \ndisease-prone forest. Rather than the open and rather park-like \nenvironment that existed 100 years ago, tree densities now make a very \nunattractive and unhealthy forest. Mr. President, 100 years ago the \ntree density was typically 20 trees per acre, with most trees of a \nrelatively large diameter. By contrast, the present forest averages \nabout 850 trees per acre, with an average diameter of less than 4 \ninches. I have three cross sections of trees in my office. One is about \nthis big, one this big, and one is this big. All three trees are 60 \nyears old, but the big tree exists in the open park-like environment, \nand the little tree exists in a cramped environment with 850 or 1,000 \ntrees per acre. Obviously, all are competing for the same nutrients and \nwater.\n\n  What we need to do is open the forests up. Two professors from \nNorthern Arizona University have begun an ambitious program to do \nprecisely that. Professors Wally Covington and Margaret Moore have \nbegun to use what they call adaptive management techniques to restore \nthe southwestern ponderosa forests to their natural presettlement \nconditions. Their partners are the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. \nForest Service, and Northern Arizona University. Their work is being \nsupported by Secretary Bruce Babbitt, Secretary Glickman, and others in \nthe region who understand the importance of bringing environmental \ngroups and other persons interested in forest health together to \nreintroduce some of the natural methods of forest management that have \nbeen lacking in recent years, including both the thinning of the small, \nunhealthy trees and the use of fire to get rid of the brush and the \nfuel which could, of course, create the fire danger.\n  In October 1995, these scientists initiated the Southwest forest \necosystem restoration project near Mount Trumbull, AZ. This is roughly \na 5,000-acre pilot project in which these new management techniques \nwill be utilized to determine whether or not they can truly restore the \nhealth of the forest and whether these management techniques would then \nbe useful throughout the arid Southwest. They will remove the dense, \nyoung growth to restore the open forests of large older trees and hope \nto do ecological sampling that include overstory trees, understory \ntrees, understory shrubs, grasses, wildflowers, and forest floor fuels. \nSampling will also extend to birds, mammals, and insect communities.\n  I saw a pilot project just west of Flagstaff which had only been \nunder experimentation for 2 years, but it is amazing that sap contents \nof the trees--which did not mean anything to me before I heard about \nit--had grown by an order of magnitude in just 2 years, thus making the \ntree almost impervious to bark beetles.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we worked with the other side. We have \nanother speaker. I ask unanimous consent our time be expanded by 7 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield 2 additional minutes to the \nSenator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I see the majority leader is here.\n  Just increasing the sap content of the trees makes them more \nimpervious to beetles, and thus disease, thereby creating more \nnutrients in the grasses because the forest has opened up. Wildlife \nneeds less grass because the protein\n\n[[Page S3765]]\n\ncontent has quadrupled. There are so many benefits to this kind of \nmanagement that it is clear we need to expand it to broader sectors of \nour forest environment.\n\n  The point is there are innovative things being done to protect our \nfragile environment, with land stewards and environment groups and \nothers all working together. These two examples I have discussed today \nshow that through this kind of cooperation and innovation, we can truly \nprotect the environment in a very bipartisan and cooperative way.\n  I commend these two experiments to my colleagues.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Arizona \non his remarks.\n  I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for \nyielding.\n  As we celebrate the 26th anniversary of Earth Day, Americans will \nagain have an opportunity to reflect on many of our past environment \nsuccesses and, frankly, some shortcomings, which I hope we will be able \nto address. We should also take this opportunity to set a course to \ncorrect any past failures regarding the protection and restoration of \nour precious environment, as well as dwelling and focusing on those \nthat have been successful.\n  Let me, as many of my colleagues before me have done, set the record \nstraight once again, Mr. President. We are all environmentalists here \nin the Senate. I think most of us would call ourselves \nenvironmentalists in the United States of America as citizens. This is \na beautiful country. It is home to all of us. The environment is not a \nDemocratic issue. It is not a Republican issue. It should be a \nbipartisan issue. I very frankly and honestly, as one who has worked \nfor the past 2 years on the Superfund bill, take great issue with those \nwho would somehow accuse me or anyone else in my party of being \nantienvironment. Yet that is happening.\n  Unfortunately, the political environment has become so partisan \nduring this Congress that it is almost outrageous. My children, I \nthink, would like to drink clean water. I certainly recognize the fact \nthat President Clinton's daughter might like to drink clean water. I \nhope you will recognize that my two sons and my daughter would like to \ndrink clean water as well.\n  My family breathes the same air as Vice President Gore and his family \nand the President and his family. I have enjoyed fishing and hiking in \nthe trails and ponds and lakes and streams of New Hampshire, probably \nsome of the same lakes and streams that some of the people in the \nadministration have. We are very proud of the fact that in northern New \nHampshire we have the great northern forests which are protected by \nlandowners, as well as the Federal Government. But landowners take good \ncare of that land and have been good stewards. We are very proud of \nwhat they have done to protect that land.\n\n  I think most of the environmental laws on the books today were \ninitiated--not just signed; were not vetoed, certainly--but were \ninitiated by Republican Presidents--Theodore Roosevelt, George Bush, \nRichard Nixon, to name just a few. They have very strong environmental \nprotection records. Our National Park System was started under \nPresident Theodore Roosevelt. The EPA was started under Richard Nixon. \nThe Clean Air Act amendments and the Oil Pollution Act were under \nGeorge Bush. They were all initiated under Republican administrations. \nYes, the Congress, many Democrats in Congress, sent those bills to the \nPresident's desk. My point is it is a bipartisan matter, and these \nbills were signed.\n  One statute, though, I have been involved in stands out as one of the \nleast effective. That is a bill called Superfund. Mr. President, $30 \nbillion has been spent over 15 years to clean up 50 sites. If you do \nthe math on that, it does not work out very well. I have devoted many \nhours on developing appropriate reforms to this failed program. Our \ngoal is to change this program from one of litigation and wasted \nresources and delay to one that actually cleans up hazardous sites \nexpeditiously.\n  While Republicans and Democrats agree on the need for reform, there \nis still some disagreement on how to get there. One of the basic \nproblems with the current Superfund Program is that it is more focused \non process than results, more focused on litigation and arguing than on \ngetting results.\n  I issue a challenge now to my Democrat colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle and say that we are ready--Majority Leader Dole is ready, \nI am ready, and Senator Chafee is ready to get a bipartisan Superfund \nbill and put it on the President's desk. I challenge my colleagues not \nto play politics with this bill and help us get it there.\n  A number of environmental laws are long overdue. For 3 years, I have \nbeen involved in efforts to reauthorize the Safe Drinking Water Act as \nwas Senators Chafee, Kempthorne, and others. The vote was 99 to 0. I \nfind it hard to believe that we can be accused of being \nantienvironment.\n  There is no doubt that the environmental movement in the 1970's \nserved an important purpose. Our air and water are cleaner today and \ncontinue to improve. Now is the time to reflect on the successes and \nbuild upon them and address some of the failures, so that we can get \nmore bang for the buck. Let us face it, many of the things that have \nbeen done to clean up the environment have been done, but pollution \ncontrols from this point forward will be very expensive. We need to be \nable to pick and choose the best technology and be up to speed on that. \nCarol Browner, the EPA Administrator, said, ``We need to develop \nbetter, smarter, cheaper regulations.''\n  I could not agree more. Is the environment getting cleaner? Yes, \nthanks to a lot of bipartisan leadership over a lot of years. Are there \nless expensive efforts to achieve the same or higher level of \nprotection? I think the answer is yes. I think we have an obligation to \nlook at those least expensive methods, and one condition is that it \ndoes not detract in any way from the pace of cleanup of the \nenvironment.\n  To what degree should the Federal Government mandate regulations on \nStates and local communities without providing adequate resources to \ncomply? That is another question we need to ask. But there are a number \nof themes that my Republican colleagues and I believe should be the \nfoundation for effective improvements in current environmental law. One \nshould be that we ought to promote sound, effective market-based \nenvironmental regulations, because when you bring the market in, you \nsave the taxpayers money and you bring the businesses in as a \npartnership. Therefore, since they are responsible for some of the \nproblems, they are willing to help us clean them up. We must recognize \nthat States and local communities often do a better job of protecting \nthe environment within their borders than the Federal Government can. \nSo, partners, not enemies.\n\n  We must incorporate better risk management and cost-benefit analysis \nin our environmental regulations that will enable us to prioritize our \ngoals. We must base our environmental decisions on the highest quality, \npeer-reviewed science, not questionable, unreliable data and unfair \npolitics. Finally, and most important, our goal is to enhance, not \ndetract from, a cleaner environment, to enhance it. That is our goal, \nnot just to save dollars for the sake of saving dollars. If it detracts \nfrom our environment, then we spend the money. And if we can spend less \nand do more and accelerate the pace, why not do it? We have an \nobligation to do that.\n  I ask my colleagues to take a look at that and realize that just \nbecause we say we can do it better, not less efficiently, that does not \nnecessarily mean it is negative. We all want a clean, healthy \nenvironment to pass on to future generations. It is one of our most \nimportant responsibilities.\n  However, the American people also believe we need to reduce \nGovernment waste and bureaucracy, to update environmental programs, to \naddress problems more effectively and allow American business to remain \nmore competitive. If we can do all of those things and enhance the \nenvironment, we ought to do it.\n  My Republican colleagues and I are trying to accomplish these goals. \nWe consider such things as cost benefits and risks and rewards not as \ntrivial, but as very important. We must strive to prioritize risk \nreduction and get the biggest bang for the buck in every American \nprogram. That is just common sense.\n\n[[Page S3766]]\n\n  Environmental policy is at a crossroads, Mr. President. We have a \nhistoric opportunity to improve our environmental laws so that they \nbetter serve the American people. That is not to say that we have \nfailed in the past. We have many, many, many successes, including the \nMerrimack River in my State, which is now beginning to see fish and \nrecreation again. It should not be controversial. We all live on this \nplanet, and we should be working together on this. If there is anything \nwe ought not to be partisan about, it ought to be the environment.\n  I will close on this point. This week, as Earth Day commences, the \nSenate Environment and Public Works Committee begins hearings on a \nSuperfund bill. During the Earth Day festivities, Americans will be \npresented with a number of conflicting images of what is good for the \nenvironment and what is not. It is my hope that the President and \nMembers of Congress, as I said earlier, will rise above the urge to \nexploit this event for short-term political gain and join our efforts \nto inject common sense and fairness into the Nation's Superfund \nProgram, which is the one program which I happen to be involved in \nbecause I chair the subcommittee.\n\n  So, Mr. President, at this point, I yield the floor and thank my \ncolleagues, and I thank the Senator from Georgia for the opportunity to \nspeak on this very important issue.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute remains.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank all of the Senators who came to the floor to \nhonor Earth Day and to talk in very meaningful terms about how to \nmanage our environment. This legislation, wherever it falls in the \nenvironment, should be guided by a working relationship between the \nGovernment and the stewards of the land. In too many cases, recently, \nwe are seeing the Government taking on the form of arrogance. We have \nthreatened the constitutional rights of personal property. That is a \nvery high law, the Constitution. If it becomes public policy to take \ninterests of private property owners, the public will have to assume \nthe responsibility for that. That has to be a working partnership. We \nhave to protect our constitutional rights. We must learn to work \ntogether on this legislation. We have heard words like partnership, \nbalance, working together, common ground, nonpartisan. This is the \nanswer to our modern environment.\n  I appreciate the Senate's time this afternoon, and I yield back \nwhatever seconds are remaining.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, is leader time reserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader time has been reserved.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, first, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia for his efforts this morning on Earth Day and on the \nenvironment. I will be making a statement later on that.\n  I thank Senator Smith for his efforts on Superfund. He has been \nworking on this, I know, month after month after month, and we have \nbeen trying to come together with a bipartisan bill. Hopefully, that \nwill be accomplished and we can pass Superfund legislation in the next \n30 to 60 days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3762-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    NOMINATION OF CHARLES STACK TO ELEVENTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Last Friday, I outlined some of my views on the issue of \njudicial nominations, one of the most lasting legacies of any \nPresident. I said that Federal judges should respect the clear language \nof the Constitution as it is written; that judges should understand \nthat society is not to blame for crime, criminals are; that judges \nshould protect the rights of crime victims, not invent new and more \nexpansive rights for criminal defendants.\n  Today, let me make another point: Those who seek to sit on the \nFederal bench should be well-grounded in the basics of constitutional \nlaw. Unfortunately, Charles ``Bud'' Stack, one of President Clinton's \nnominees to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, does not meet this \nstandard.\n  During his recent confirmation hearing, Mr. Stack was unable to cite \nany fourth amendment case concerning the law of search and seizure. He \ndemonstrated little knowledge about Supreme Court precedent on capital \npunishment. And despite the Supreme Court's highly publicized decision \nin the Adarand case, Mr. Stack was unable to discuss any Supreme Court \nor Federal case concerning discrimination or affirmative action.\n  When asked how he would remedy his own ignorance of key aspects of \nthe law, Mr. Stack said he ``Could attend some courses'' or ask other \njudges for help.\n  Yet Mr. Stack has been nominated to sit on one of the Nation's most \ninfluential judicial panels, the court that effectively serves as the \ncourt of last resort for the citizens of Florida, Georgia, and Alabama.\n  Apparently, Mr. Stack's most important qualification is his prowess \nas a political fundraiser. According to news reports, administration \naides had discussed offering Mr. Stack an ambassadorship and a seat on \nthe Federal district court as a reward for his rundrasing efforts, but \nthat Mr. Stack had his heart set on a court of appeals position.\n  Mr. President, I understand that Mr. Stack raised millions and \nmillions of dollars for President Clinton and the Democratic Party, but \ndoes that qualify him to be on the next highest court in the land? I do \nnot think so. That is not what the judicial system is all about.\n  Mr. President, I understand that the American Bar Association has \ngiven Mr. Stack a qualified rating, but in my judgment, this rating is \nyet another example of why we should not rely on the ABA to review the \nqualifications of our judicial nominees.\n  Although I do not know Mr. Stack personally, I have no reason to \nchallenge his integrity. I am sure he is a fine man who has contributed \nmuch to his community and to his country. But that is not the point. \nThe question we must ask is whether Mr. Stack is, in fact, qualified to \nsit on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, the second highest court \nin the land? The answer, or course, is, ``No.'' President Clinton \nshould withdraw the Stack nomination without delay.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3766-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3766-S3769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NO MORE GAMES--RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know that under the rule we will move \nvery swiftly to the term limit legislation, but I would like to speak \nbefore that debate starts on another matter which, although not \ndirectly before the Senate today, is very much in the thinking of \nMembers of the Senate and the House of Representatives, certainly the \nPresident and, most importantly, working families and needy working \nfamilies, and that is the issue of the increase in the minimum wage.\n  On ``Face the Nation'' yesterday, Senator Dole was asked whether he \nwould allow a straight up or down vote on the minimum wage. Senator \nDole said, ``No, our view is that it needs to be packaged with other \nthings--maybe comp time, flex time.''\n  Let me be very clear in response. There is no reason to delay or \nsaddle the minimum wage with other controversial measures. I intend to \noffer a clean vote on increasing the minimum wage on the nuclear waste \nbill or any other bill this week or next week that is open to \namendments. There is no excuse for further delay in raising the minimum \nwage.\n  Raising the minimum wage is a matter of basic economics, not \npolitics, for millions of American families. More than 10 million \npeople will receive a direct pay increase if the minimum wage is raised \nto $5.15 or $5.25 an hour. To those millions of working Americans, the \nissue is not politics. It's paying the rent and putting food on the \ntable for themselves and their families.\n  An overwhelming majority of Americans want the minimum wage \nincreased. They do not want to see this legislation buried in \nprocedural maneuvers, or loaded up with antiunion amendments. They want \nto see it increased, and increased now.\n  Yet, ignoring the clear interest of low-wage workers and the desire \nof an overwhelming majority of the American people, Senator Dole \nintends to\n\n[[Page S3767]]\n\nprevent a straight up-or-down vote on the minimum wage. We can only \nwonder why. Senator Dole says it is politics, but it is hard to believe \nthat this kind of inside-the-beltway politics will work to his \nadvantage.\n  A Lou Harris poll released 2 weeks ago found that 85 percent of \nsurveyed adults support an increase to $5.15 an hour, and Chilton \nResearch Services found that 80 percent support such a raise. Even 73 \npercent of Republicans support raising the minimum wage to $5.15.\n  But no group feels more strongly about this than women. The Chilton \nsurvey asked about the strength of the respondents' feelings and found \nthat a clear majority--57 percent--feel strongly that the raise should \nbe enacted. But 64 percent of women strongly agree with the \nlegislation.\n  What explains the strength of women's support?\n  First, 60 percent of the 10 to 12 million people who will get a pay \nincrease from this legislation are women, and 77 percent of those women \nare adults.\n  That means 7 million women, and 5 million adult women will get a pay \nraise from this bill.\n  Second, who are these 5 million adult women? Two million are single \nheads of households with at least one dependent. They are raising \nfamilies, caring for children, and trying to get by on poverty level \nwages.\n  Third, 60 percent of minimum wage workers are married. They \ncontribute, on average, 51 percent of family earnings. We are not \ntalking about teenagers earning pocket money. We are talking about \npeople whose families depend on them for their survival and well-being.\n  Fourth, what kinds of work do these 7 million women do? Many of them \nare in the retail, hospitality, and food service industries, where they \nwork as cashiers, serve meals, clean hotel rooms, and work in \nlaundries. Their jobs are hard and unrewarding, but they do them with \ndignity, working to provide for their families.\n  Fifth, but many of these women work directly with children in \noccupations that are almost entirely held by women, such as child care. \nThe vast majority of child care workers would get a pay increase from a \nraise in the minimum wage to $5.15. Teachers aides, too, hold low-paid \njobs dominated by women. These people deserve more for the care they \ngive the Nation's children--it is time they got a raise.\n  Sixth, the other major industry that employs large numbers of women \nat or just above the minimum wage is health care, including occupations \nsuch as nurses aides and home health care aides. These are some of the \nhardest jobs in our society, caring for the sick and helpless, washing \nthem, feeding them, cleaning their bedpans. The women who hold these \njobs deserve a raise.\n  Seventh, raising the minimum wage is the best, most targeted solution \nwe have to the problem of the income gap between the richest and \npoorest American families. Its distributional effects are powerful and \npositive.\n  Since 1979, the bottom three-fifths of American families have \nexperienced a loss in their real income, while the top 1 percent of \nfamilies saw its income grow 62 percent.\n  The bottom 40 percent of American families, whose incomes have \nsuffered the most since 1979, would get 60 percent of the gains from \nraising the minimum wage.\n  That says that those workers who are out there now working 40 hours a \nweek, 52 weeks of the year, the ones that have fallen the furthest \nbehind since 1979, they would get 60 percent of the benefits of the \nincrease in the minimum wage, and they are the ones who have been left \nfurthest behind.\n  This is the single most effective thing Congress can do for those \nfamilies. Compared with balancing the budget--I ask the attention of \nour colleagues on this issue--compared with balancing the budget, for \nexample, which the Congressional Budget Office claims will raise \naverage wages one-half of 1 percent by the year 2002, the Congressional \nBudget Office says, if you pass the Republican balanced budget \namendment by the year 2002, average wages will increase one-half of 1 \npercent. Raising the minimum wage will increase the earnings of people \nin the bottom 40 percent by 4 percent in just 2 years--the bottom 40 \npercent. If you go down to 30 percent or 20 percent it becomes 8 or 10; \ndown to just the bottom line, you go up to about 20, 22 percent, \nbecause you will go from $4.25 to $5.15, or $5.25, as suggested over in \nthe House of Representatives. That represents almost 25 percent of the \nwages.\n  But just with this very modest increase, we are seeing for the bottom \n40 percent of American workers that they will go up 4 percent while \njust the balanced budget in and of itself will provide one-half of 1 \npercent.\n  Eighth, women will not lose jobs, despite the scare tactics of the \nRepublicans. The economy has added 10 million new jobs since the last \nincrease 5 years ago. A dozen studies show that even teenagers won't \nlose jobs. In fact, the Card & Krueger study of New Jersey and \nPennsylvania showed that employment in the fast food industry increased \nafter New Jersey raised its minimum wage. Other studies have also found \nemployment increases. There are two reasons: First, better wages \nattract more employees to the job market; second, because workers have \nbetter pay, they have more to spend and the economy gets a boost that \nleads to more employment.\n  Massachusetts raised the minimum wage to $4.75 an hour as of January \n1, 1996. Unemployment has fallen in Massachusetts since the start of \nthe year, while in neighboring New Hampshire, which left its minimum \nwage at $4.25, unemployment has increased.\n  In Massachusetts, we have seen the continued reduction in the \nunemployment figures virtually across the State, even with that \nincrease up to $4.75 an hour.\n  The opponents of raising the minimum wage cry crocodile tears about \nits effect on the employment of people at the bottom of the economic \nladder, but the people at the bottom of the economic ladder want the \nraise.\n  Lou Harris' most recent poll showed that 94 percent of Americans with \nhousehold income of $7,500 or less support the legislation.\n  So to all those on the other side from whom we hear the arguments \nthat they are most concerned about those poor workers, many of them \nwomen, many of them minorities; we do not want to have them thrown out \nof a job, the fact is the poor workers are the ones who overwhelmingly \nsay they want the increase in the minimum wage.\n  Industry lobbyists probably should not try to speak for families at \nthe bottom of the economic ladder.\n  This is an issue about women and the children they raise; 100,000 of \nwhom will be lifted out of poverty with this bill's passage--100,000 \nAmericans lifted out of poverty when this bill passes. Two million \nsingle heads of households who have to feed their children on poverty \nwages, get them to school while getting themselves to work, arrange for \nchild care and provide them shelter is the issue in this legislation.\n  Mr. President, $1,800--the annual increase in the earnings this bill \nwill provide to minimum wage workers--provides 7 months' of groceries \nfor those families, 9 months' worth of utility bills, and an entire \nyear of health care costs; the tuition for a community college or a \nState 2-year college.\n  This is an issue of fairness. CEO pay is up 30 percent and corporate \nprofits are higher than they have been since the 1960's. It is time \nbusinesses shared that wealth with the lowest paid of their workers. \nProductivity has increased 25 percent over the last 20 years, but the \nvalue of the minimum wage has fallen 25 percent.\n  Is that not an interesting phenomenon? Productivity has increased 25 \npercent and generally at other times when we have had a level playing \nfield, where all of the country moved up in terms of wages, the \nstandard of living, the hopes and dreams for everyone, for the families \nand for their children, and for the parents, everyone moved up \ntogether. Now we have seen a 25-percent increase in productivity, which \nis usually associated with the increase in the wages for those workers, \nand we have seen a 25-percent reduction for those individuals at the \nlowest level of the economic ladder, again men and women that are \nworking.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this legislation could mean important savings \nto the Government. This is an argument that is forgotten by those who \nare unalterably opposed to the minimum wage. It would mean savings to \nthe\n\n[[Page S3768]]\n\nGovernment in food stamps, Medicaid, and other public welfare programs. \nWe can save more than $600 million in AFDC, $350 million in Medicaid, \n$300 million more in food stamps.\n\n  In a two-earner family where both parents earn the minimum wage, \n$3,600 in additional pay would make a dramatic difference in their \ndependence on public support. Why? Because their income would be \nsufficiently raised that they would no longer qualify for that kind of \nsafety net. And if they no longer qualified for it, that would be a \nsavings. And what should that mean savings for? Workers and workers' \nfamilies because they are the principal ones paying taxes.\n  Or you can ask the question the other way. Why should all American \nworkers, who are the bulk of the taxpayers, subsidize certain companies \nthat are using sweat labor and refuse to pay the minimum wage for those \nwho are working in the workplace?\n  That is what is happening today. So this is action in the interest of \nsaving American taxpayer funds because it will raise sufficient numbers \nof needy people out of eligibility for these various support payments.\n  Mr. President, it is time to stop playing games and raise the minimum \nwage. I urge the majority leader to schedule a clean up-and-down vote \non our bill to raise the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour. We need that. \nAmerican workers need it.\n  It is interesting to those of us who had introduced at the start of \nthe last Congress the increase in the minimum wage; that could have \ntaken effect a year ago. We have already lost that year. Purchasing \npower has already declined. At that time, it was 50 cents, 50 cents, 50 \ncents. Instead, we went 45, 45, 45 as a way of compromise, and it is \ntime we address this issue. This issue is not complex, nor complicated. \nIt is a simple, straightforward issue that every Member is familiar \nwith. We do not need to have more studies, more hearings. It is a \nmatter of fundamental economic justice and fairness for hard working \nAmericans. It is about time we get about that business.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for allowing me the opportunity to \nspeak at this time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Chair. Before I discuss the pending \nbusiness, I might make one comment. It certainly seems that partisan \naccusations are still alive and well. I sit here and listen to \nRepublican this and Republican that. Of course, we are in the middle of \nan election year, but it occurs to me that in a 2-year period when the \nPresident of the United States was a Democrat, the Democrats controlled \nthe Senate and Democrats controlled the House, we did not hear these \ncalls on behalf of women and children and lower income workers. Such a \nbill was not introduced, and no committee hearings were held. In fact, \nthe President indicated that was not the way to go. So now I am \nrelieved that we have discovered women and children and the lower paid \nworkers of this country and perhaps we can have a debate on it and do \nthe right thing. But I would like to discuss something that should be \nof bipartisan concern.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could I just respond?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I just wanted to mention the fact that, of course, \nduring that debate in the earlier Congress we were debating \ncomprehensive health care. The value of the comprehensive health care \nwas between 40 and 50 cents an hour. It was the request of the workers \nat that time that we focus on that rather than the minimum wage, and \nthe minimum wage came back into play right after that was defeated. It \nwas very easy and understandable for those of us who had been working \non it, but I just mention to our colleague that the last time we had a \nbipartisan increase in the minimum wage, as the Senator knows, was in \n1989. At that time we had two-thirds of the Republicans who supported \nit. We had a Republican President, Democratic Congress, and now we have \na Republican Congress and a Democratic President. Presidents Eisenhower \nand Nixon supported it as well.\n  So this is, as we have tried to point out over the period of time, \nwhat Republicans and Republican Presidents and Republican Congresses \nhave supported, as Senator Dole and Congressman Gingrich did at other \ntimes. So it is a bit of a stretch to say that they would have \nsupported it another time if it was just a partisan issue but not \nsupporting it now.\n  I know we may have differences on the understanding of those series \nof events, but I wanted to just have a chance to add those brief \ncomments to the Record.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I would just say to my colleague that it is not I who \nwas making it a partisan issue or saying it was a partisan issue. It \nhas not been that in times past. It seems as if recently it has become \na partisan issue. And I think the point still is well made that for a \nperiod of 2 years, both before and after the health care debate, \ncertainly after the health care debate, when control of the Congress \nwas well within the power of the other side, this could have been \nbrought up and discussed. And the President did indicate that the \nminimum wage was not the way to go. As I understand it, the position is \nthat there was other legislation which would obviate the need for the \nminimum wage, and some would say today there is other legislation that \ncould obviate the need for the minimum wage. I am not even saying where \nthis Senator would come down. I would like to listen to the debate on \nit. We have not had a chance to debate it.\n\n  I just find two things that are happening very strange. First, is now \nit is an issue that is first and foremost in the minds of some of my \ncolleagues on the other side. And, second, they seem to be the ones who \nare trying to make this a partisan issue. I say, let us consider it on \nits merits, both sides of the aisle, and do the right thing about it. \nBut, if we start off in the very beginning making it a partisan issue \nand trying to draw lines and distinctions when the people on the other \nside of the aisle have sat and done nothing with regard to the minimum \nwage when they had it within their power to do so, we are not going to \nhave much progress.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could I have one final moment in the exchange? Of \ncourse, as the Senator knows, we have had good Republican support on \nthe last vote for an increase in the minimum wage. That, I think, was \nsomething that was notable.\n  Second, as the Senator knows, we have not been given an opportunity \nto get to this issue scheduled as an order of doing business. As we \nhave said--and I am sure the Senator is familiar with this--if we were \nable to get a time agreement on a clean bill, we would certainly \nwelcome that opportunity. We have indicated we would be glad to let \ntime go, as the Senator knows, on the two last occasions where the \nSenate has addressed it. We have had Republican support, the majority \nof the Members. There was Republican support.\n  Finally, as the Senator knows, we have both the minimum wage and the \nEITC, both of which affect the working poor. The increase in the \nminimum wage has the greatest advantage for single individuals, which, \nincreasingly, are numbers of single women. The EITC has a greater \nimpact on those families where they have a number of children. Really, \nif we are interested in doing it, these matters ought to be embraced \nand put on together. We have seen the expansion of the EITC in recent \ntimes, although there were attempts to cut back on that during the \nbudget consideration.\n  So I agree with my colleague and friend. I would welcome the \nopportunity to join with him so we could have a good discussion. Let \nMembers of this body have a look at these items and then make a \njudgment. I am just concerned, as the time goes on, and as we know we \nhave less than 40 days legislatively where we expect the Congress to \nmeet and where the House has not taken action, it might be appropriate \nto do so at a particular time. But I am grateful to the Senator for his \ncomments, and I certainly welcome the chance to engage in further \ndiscussion when we focus on this particular matter.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I appreciate the comments of my colleague, and I share \nhis view this is something that ought\n\n[[Page S3769]]\n\nto be considered deliberately and fully at the appropriate time. I \nthink it is wise that we approach it from the standpoint of what is \ngood for the country; that neither side try to make undue political \npoints at the outset. Otherwise, we are not going to get anywhere. I \nsimply say, I share my colleague's concern and desire to get anything \nup for a vote.\n  It has taken 49 years to get the matter I am about to discuss up for \na vote in this body, so I would like to turn to that now unless my \ncolleague has any more comments.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3766-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 21, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 21) proposing a \n     constitutional amendment to limit congressional terms.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the joint resolution.\n\n       Pending:\n       Thompson (for Ashcroft) amendment No. 3692, in the nature \n     of a substitute.\n       Thompson (for Brown) amendment No. 3693 (to amendment No. \n     3692), to permit each State to prescribe the maximum number \n     of terms to which a person may be elected to the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate.\n       Thompson (for Ashcroft) amendment No. 3694, of a perfecting \n     nature.\n       Thompson (for Brown) amendment No. 3695 (to amendment No. \n     3694), to permit each State to prescribe the maximum number \n     of terms to which a person may be elected to the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate.\n       Thompson amendment No. 3696, to change the length of limits \n     on Congressional terms to 12 years in the House of \n     Representatives and 12 years in the Senate.\n       Thompson (for Brown) amendment No. 3697 (to amendment No. \n     3696), to permit each State to prescribe the maximum number \n     of terms to which a person may be elected to the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate.\n       Thompson motion to recommit the resolution to the Committee \n     on the Judiciary with instructions.\n       Thompson (for Ashcroft) amendment No. 3698 (to the motion \n     to recommit), to change instructions to report back with \n     limits on Congressional terms of 6 years in the House of \n     Representatives and 12 years in the Senate.\n       Thompson (for Brown) modified amendment No. 3699 (to \n     amendment No. 3698), to change instructions to report back \n     with language allowing each State to set the terms of members \n     of the House of Representatives and the Senate from that \n     State.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, this is a constitutional amendment to \nlimit the terms of Members of Congress. It calls for a limitation of 12 \nyears, 2 terms in the U.S. Senate; a limitation of 12 years, 6 terms in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  As I indicated, the last vote on term limitations in this body was in \n1947, so it has taken about 49 years to get the second vote on this, \nnot that anybody has been particularly pushing for it.\n  I believe it is the first constitutional amendment for term limits to \never come out of committee. This had a full committee hearing. It \npassed out of the Judiciary Committee, and now, for the first time, a \ncommittee bill is on the floor ready for consideration. I think it is \nlong overdue.\n  In this body, it has been my observation that we pay as close \nattention as we can to what the American people want. We pay as close \nattention as we can to what our constituents want. We have offices all \nacross the various States. We go to those offices, we listen, we get \ntallies on what people are calling in about, what people's concerns \nare. We go out and we pride ourselves, as elected Members, having town \nhall meetings, and we say a large part of the purpose of that is to \nlisten, to see what is going on so we can be reflective of the opinions \nof the people that we represent.\n  We run our campaigns on the same basis. We say, let us be your \nRepresentative and we will go up and listen to the people. Let us turn \nthe Congress back to the people. We try to respond every time we get \nthe feeling that 51 percent of our constituents want something. There \nis nothing more responsive than someone who has been elected to office, \nwho feels his constituents are pressing for something, even by the \nbarest of margins--except in one area. That is the area we are dealing \nwith here today, term limits.\n  We see poll after poll after poll, and we poll early and often. \nSometimes it is like all that is happening around here is a rendition \nof those polls. My colleague from Massachusetts was talking about how \nmany women favored minimum wage, how many Republicans, how many \nDemocrats, all based on polling results. Who is ahead in the \nPresidential race? All these various issues. Who is for us and who is \nagainst us? By what margin? The distinction between last week, when 52 \npercent of the people were for this proposition, and the week before \nlast when only 49 percent of the people were for this proposition, so \nwe see a little movement there.\n  There is extreme, extreme attention to the temperature of the \nAmerican people and to our constituents, except about one thing, and \nthat is term limits. Poll after poll indicates that upward of 75 \npercent of the American people favor term limits, and the overwhelming \nmajority of States and localities that have had the opportunity to vote \non term limits have come out in favor of term limits. Mr. President, 22 \nStates have imposed term limits on themselves, even while other States \nwere not doing so, saying: We think it is an idea whose time has come. \nIt would be for the benefit of America for us to set the example, and \nwe are willing to impose it on ourselves even though there is no \nobligation for other States to do so.\n  Yet, even in light of this overwhelming majority of the American \npeople who feel something is basically going wrong with their country \nand they are searching for something fundamental to do about it, we pay \nabsolutely no attention to what is going on. We pay no attention to the \noverwhelming sentiment of the American people with regard to this one \narea.\n  The case can be made that we ought to be more reflective in some \ncases, that we ought to be a little more isolated. This is supposed to \nbe a deliberative body and sometimes we do not take enough time to \nreally reflect on the important issues that are facing us. Sometimes we \nget too caught up in the number of bills that we can pass and the \ngamesmanship of what is going on in this town. But, why is this the \nonly one area where this rule seems to apply to this body, and no other \narea? The answer, of course, is because in a Congress that busies \nitself in regulating other people's lives and purifying other \ninstitutions, other businesses, other individuals, that changes when it \ncomes to doing something about ourselves, even something as innocuous \nas a 12-year term. This constitutional amendment would not even need to \nbe ratified for 7 years. Then it would be prospective. It is the most \nminimal first step toward trying to put us in a position to face the \n21st century that we could possibly think of. It probably would not \naffect anybody in this body right now, another 12 years on top of what \nthey have already served, and on top of the 7 years it might take for \nratification of the constitutional amendment. That is not exactly a \ndrastic move, not exactly a revolutionary change. Yet we have all this \ndifficulty even getting to first base.\n  Let us talk about what this is not all about, because the detractors \nof term limits, in their scrambling around to try to come up with \nreasons why in this particular case the overwhelming majority of the \nAmerican people are wrong, have set the terms of the debate for us, in \nmany cases.\n  What it is not about is vindictiveness. A lot of people are angry \nwith the Congress of the United States, but this is not about \nvindictiveness. Life is too short for that.\n  On the contrary, Mr. President, I really believe that imposing term \nlimits on ourselves would do more to restore the dignity and the esteem \nof Congress with the American people than anything else. I pointed out \nthe other day that columnist George Will wrote a book awhile back \ncalled ``Restoration,'' and it was about term limits. Most people would \nhave a hard time seeing that connection until they got into it and read \nit.\n  The point is, and a very valid point, I think, indeed, is that at the \ntime our\n\n[[Page S3770]]\n\ncountry was founded, people would line the streets and say, ``Long live \nCongress, long live Congress.'' Can you imagine what most of them would \nbe saying today if they had a shot at making a comment at us parading \ndown the street together?\n  What has changed in that period of time? We have lost the respect of \nthe American people. I believe this self-imposition is something that \nthe people feel in their hearts is right and something that would, in \none way, be to our own detriment--it might cut a few careers a few \nyears short--but would do more to restore the faith of the United \nStates people in the U.S. Congress than anything else. And that, Mr. \nPresident, is probably more important than anything else, because \nCongress is the message deliverer, and we have some tough messages to \ndeliver to this country. A lot of it is not going to be well received. \nA lot of it is not being well received, but it is the truth, and it has \nto do with the future of our country and the things we need to do to \nmake sure we fulfill that tacit understanding that each generation is \nsupposed to have with the next, and that is, that we will leave this \nplace a little better off than we found it. We are not fulfilling that \ncommitment now.\n  Another thing it is not about is simply changing new faces for old \nfaces. There is nothing that inherently goes wrong with someone because \nthey have been around a place for a while. There is nothing beneficial \nabout changing a new face for an old face if a new face comes in with \nthe same attitude as the old one had. That is not what it is all about.\n  In fact, I am willing to concede that you could make a pretty good \ncase for the proposition that for the majority of our history in this \ncountry, our system served us pretty well. We went through two world \nwars in this country, we went through a Civil War, we went through a \nGreat Depression, and we had to dip into the till pretty deep \nsometimes, but we always came back and balanced our budget. We had a \nbalanced budget as late as 1969 in this country.\n  Our Founding Fathers did not address term limits. It never occurred \nto them that we would wind up with the professionalism and the \ncareerism that we see today.\n  So, for a long, long time, we could get by with what we had, because \nwe did not have the culture of spending, we did not have the growth of \nGovernment and all the demands and pressures that are on us day in and \nday out to spend more and more and more. We did not have members so \nfaced with the proposition, are we going to get along with people and \nget reelected by saying yes to any and every spending measure that \ncomes down the pike, or are we going to risk our political future and \nsay, ``We can't do things the same old way anymore; we can't \nnecessarily grow each program at 10 percent a year anymore.''\n  Everybody in this town knows that--both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue \nand both sides of the aisle. We know that, and yet we are afraid, \nbasically, to say that. Or somebody says it and somebody else will get \nup and say they are trying to harm old people and trying to harm young \npeople to get political advantage out of it for the next election. We \nget into that cycle: scare people momentarily. Sometimes it works, and \nyet the American people have this sense, this innate sense that \nsomething is really going wrong, something is not working right.\n  So it is not about vindictiveness or even throwing the rascals out. \nMy goodness, we in this body, anything that we are able to accomplish, \nwe stand on the shoulders of giants. Many giants have been in this \nbody. I hold this body in the highest esteem. I have reverence for this \nbody. I have never understood why somebody would want to be part of an \ninstitution for which they did not have any respect.\n\n  I used to come here as a very young man and sit up in the gallery and \nwatch the great debates that would take place, even at that stage, and \nthat has not been that long ago. People were talking about the issues. \nPeople seemed to have a little bit more time to deliberate. We were \nstill right at the point where we were capable of balancing the budget. \nThat time has changed.\n  So what is it about? What it is about is not all the little things \nthat you hear debated back and forth on the 6 o'clock news. If you \ncannot get it out in 15 or 20 seconds, it is going to be totally lost. \nIt is not about new faces, it is not about experience, it is not about \nwhether the lobbyists or the staffs are for it or against it. It is \nabout dealing with the monumental problems that are facing this \ncountry, problems that are so great and so ingrained that many \nthoughtful people on both sides of the aisle think that it is already \ntoo far gone for us to do anything about. And it is about the fact that \nwe are proving ourselves incapable under current circumstances of \ndealing with it.\n  We are mortgaging our future, and it has to do with nothing more \nbasic than our need to perpetuate ourselves and to avoid risk, which \ntoo often means avoiding the truth, and, therefore, we continue to go \ndown the road that we know is bound to lead to disaster unless we make \nsignificant changes.\n  What does this desire for reelection and staying do to us? It causes \nus to spend. It all comes down to the growth of Government and the \nculture of spending. This is not a partisan issue. You can pick your \nadministration or you can pick who is in control of Congress--the House \nor the Senate--and go back for the last few decades, and I am willing \nto say that there is enough fault on either side; that neither side can \ntake partisan advantage of this if you view it objectively.\n  Every time someone stood up to speak the simple truth about the \nfuture and took their eyes for a few minutes off the next election and \ntried to do something that would make this country stronger for the \nfuture, the other side would invariably get up and take partisan \nadvantage of it, scare people, go on television with 30-second ads, and \nwhoever brought it up would cower back to their corner, not to be \nbrought up again for a while.\n  Mr. President, there is no simple solution to what I am talking \nabout. It is fundamental. We have gotten ourselves into a deep ditch. \nWe did not get there overnight, and we will not get ourselves out of it \novernight, but we have to start examining possibilities that will put \nus in a position of doing something about it.\n  How can we continue down this road? This proposal will not affect me \npersonally either way and it will affect hardly any of the Members in \nthis Congress, I would think. But if we had a system that concentrated \non how best could we operate in the next century in order to solve \nthese problems, I think that term limits would be a major, major step \ntoward doing that.\n  I believe if we open the system up so that people knew that these \njobs would be open from time to time, in the first place you would draw \nmore people into the system. Right now, unless you have access to \nmillions of dollars--and usually through incumbency, which allows you \nto raise millions of dollars--it is not a participation that you can \nenjoy as an average citizen. We have 250 million citizens in this \ncountry, and one small fraction of 1 percent are all that have any \nrealistic shot of ever setting foot on this floor.\n  So bring more people in. What kind of motivation would those people \nhave? If people were coming into the system knowing from day one that \nthis could not be their career, that, hopefully, they have already had \na career and, hopefully, they will have another one and this will be an \ninterruption to a career and not a career in and of itself, would they \nbe as frightened of the special interests?\n  Would they be as frightened of the poll numbers? Would they be as \nfrightened of the proposition that 51 percent of the people might get \ntemporarily mad at them if they spoke the truth and said, ``You can \nhave a 7 percent increase this year but you can't have 10 percent''?\n  I think we would have people who would come in with a different \nagenda. I think we would have people who would come in with the idea, \nmore likely--not universal, because nothing is--more likely that, I'm \ngoing to give a few years to my country. Just because it is 12 years \ndoes not mean you have to stay 12 years either. That is a maximum. Give \na few years to my country the way they used to, the way they used to \nsome years ago, and try to do the right thing. It is called public \nservice. That is what it used to be. Citizens used to come in and do \nthat. That is what the Founding Fathers had\n\n[[Page S3771]]\n\nin mind, and that would go on. I think it is only a Congress which is \npeopled by individuals who have that attitude that is ever, ever going \nto get us out of the monumental straits we are in.\n  By the year 2000, the net interest paid on the national debt will \nsurpass defense spending and is projected to become the second largest \nFederal expenditure after Social Security. This is from the Bipartisan \nCommission on Entitlement and Tax Reform --the bipartisan commission. \nBy 2012, unless appropriate policy changes are made, projected spending \non entitlement programs and interest on the debt will grow so rapidly \nthey will consume all tax revenues collected by the Federal \nGovernment--all tax revenues. In 2030, to bring the deficit down to the \ncurrent level, the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform \nconcluded that either all Federal taxes would have to be increased by \n85 percent or all Federal spending programs would have to be cut in \nhalf. This bipartisan commission is telling you what is going to \nhappen. Have you heard it anywhere else?\n  By 2012, mandatory spending, interest, and entitlements will exceed \nall Federal revenues, leaving no money for the Federal Government to \nspend at its discretion on programs like education, law enforcement, \nresearch and development, national defense, and health research. By \n2030, entitlement spending alone is projected to exceed all Federal \nrevenues.\n  We have had a philosophy now for several years in this town that a \nSenator is judged in large part by the amount of pork he can bring back \nto his State, not realizing that ultimately what is good for Tennessee \nis good for America and what is bad for America cannot be good for \nTennessee or any other State.\n  We have a proliferation of interest groups as we pass more and more \nlaws and regulate more and more things. Those who are the objects of \nthose laws and those who are being regulated naturally come to town to \ntell us what we are doing to them. When these programs are ingrained \nand people are used to receiving these moneys, there is no turning \nback. It is always more and more and more.\n  You attend hearings for a month, and you will never hear anybody \ncoming back in saying they want to give some money back to the Federal \nGovernment. It all goes the other way. We are now facing what one \nphilosopher said a long time ago; that is, the ultimate test for any \ndemocracy is whether or not, when they discover they can pay themselves \nout of their own treasury, there can ever be any turning back.\n  The other thing we need to address, along with the absolutely \nhorrendous fiscal problem that lies for our children to keep up with, \nis the public cynicism. Out of all of this trying to be responsive, out \nof all of this poll taking, out of all this technology that we have to \nmonitor the pulse so we can claim we are doing just exactly what the \npeople want us to do, what do the people think about their Government?\n  A very thoughtful gentleman by the name of Haynes Johnson wrote a \nbook a year or so ago called ``Divided We Fall.'' He stated the \nfollowing:\n\n       For at least a decade, and in reality far longer, people at \n     the bottom have grown increasingly alienated from those at \n     the top, and especially from leaders who seem unable and \n     often unwilling to address their concerns. Over the last \n     generation, surveys on public alienation have tracked \n     America's steadily eroding confidence in its leaders and \n     in its institutions--a decline so uniform and so steep \n     that it raises the most serious questions about public \n     faith in the democratic system and therefore the ability \n     of that system to function.\n  Mr. President, that is serious stuff. Mr. Johnson went around the \ncountry talking to people, and spent a long time in researching this \nbook. He pointed out a recent Harris poll indicating that, ``At the \nbottom in public esteem were law firms, with only 11 percent of \nAmericans expressing great confidence in them. Barely above them was \nCongress at 12 percent.'' Thank God for law firms.\n  He further states:\n\n       Traditionally, American politicians are driven by the \n     short-term approach. From city council members to members of \n     Congress, emphasis is on the ``quick fix'' to complex \n     problems and on claiming political credit for responding to \n     immediate needs. The result, as we have seen, is postponement \n     of decisions on major long-term issues. Thus, the real size \n     of the budget deficit is masked. Genuine attempts to reduce \n     it are put off to the next session of Congress--and the next \n     and the next. Action is not taken today; it is always planned \n     for tomorrow, to take place in what Washington policymakers, \n     in typical semantic obfuscation, call ``the out years.'' The \n     out years never quite arrive; they continue to lie beyond \n     grasp. So the debts increase and the charade continues with \n     each new congressional session.\n\n  I ask my colleagues whether or not that sounds familiar.\n  Finally, he states that:\n\n       These are among the many reasons the political system \n     remains under siege. A more elemental one involves the public \n     conviction that the American political system has produced a \n     generation of politicians in both parties who can't, or \n     won't, tell the truth, because if they do, they will not win; \n     and that lie permeates American politics.\n\n  It is a sad situation, Mr. President, sad situation. For those of us \nwho simply say, the status quo, we cannot make any fundamental changes, \nthings are going great, I think the evidence is overwhelmingly to the \ncontrary.\n  So, Mr. President, I say let us give the States an opportunity. That \nis all we are doing with this constitutional amendment. Let us give the \nStates an opportunity to address this issue and see whether or not the \npeople really believe what the polls indicate that they do. I feel like \nthat is the least we can do and is our foremost responsibility to see \nif we cannot better derive a system in the future that would allow us \nto cope with this unbelievable cynicism of the American people toward \nus and our clear inability to get a handle on problems that are going \nto be the ruination of the next generation. I yield the floor.\n  [Disturbance in the visitors' galleries.]\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Just to mention to those in the gallery, it is \nagainst Senate rules to have any show of approval or disapproval of any \nstatements made on actions taken on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me begin by offering my appreciation and compliments to the \nSenators from Tennessee and Missouri for having worked as hard as they \nhave on the issue of term limits and bringing the issue of term limits \nto the attention of the U.S. Senate.\n  I think our freshman class is strongly supportive as a group of the \nterm limits effort. I think that Senators who have led this battle \ndeserve special acknowledgement for the support they have given. I rise \ntoday and thank them and also make some comments of my own which are \npertinent to this debate.\n  Mr. President, in my State of Michigan, the people have already \nspoken on an important issue the Senate will consider here this week; \nthat is, term limits. In 1992, Michigan voters passed term limits for \nFederal officials by an overwhelming margin--6 years for the U.S. House \nof Representatives and 12 years for the U.S. Senate.\n  I repeat, it was an overwhelming margin, Mr. President. This was not \na close vote. In 1993, as a candidate for the U.S. Senate, and in 1994 \nI ran on a platform committed to trying to make certain that the will \nof the people of my State was acknowledged and was followed by the \nCongress of the United States.\n  The fight for term limits in Washington, however, must continue. I \npledge to fight in Washington and make sure that the limits the people \nof Michigan voted for would be permissible. Term limits are widely \nobserved at other levels of Government, Mr. President.\n  The President of the United States, 41 Governors, 20 State \nlegislators, and hundreds of State and local officials currently abide \nby term limits. Why not Congress?\n  There has been an overwhelming expression of support for term limits \nin State after State. Since 1990, more than 25 million votes have been \ncast by voters in 22 States supporting congressional term limits. Polls \nhave consistently shown that more than three-quarters of the American \npeople favor term limits. I believe, Mr. President, that it is our \nobligation to fight to make sure that the people's voice does not go \nunheard.\n  The 104th Congress is the first Congress to have recorded votes in \neither Chamber on term limits. The Senate\n\n[[Page S3772]]\n\nvote this week will join the 1995 House vote to produce first-ever \nvotes in both Houses. The vote in the House was held in March 1995 and \nreceived a majority of 227 votes. Passage, however, of a constitutional \namendment would have required a two-thirds majority, or 290 votes.\n  For the first time in history, the Senate will vote on term limits. \nWhile the measure is not currently expected to receive the necessary 67 \nvotes required for passage, this vote is an important beginning to what \nI believe is an inevitable outcome. While approval by two-thirds of the \nHouse and Senate will not be easy, the support of 75 percent of the \nAmerican people will make a difference as we continue this important \neffort.\n  When I campaigned for the Senate in 1994 in my State, I heard from \none end of Michigan to the other a consistent and very, very \nresponsive, positive public outpouring of support for term limits. \nPeople felt that the Congress, in particular, and Washington as an \ninstitution was out of touch. They felt that a lot of factors were at \nplay, but, most importantly, they felt that too many people ran for \nCongress or for the U.S. Senate, went to Washington, and ultimately \nstayed so long that they lost sight of the reasons that they ran for in \nthe first place.\n  Promises in campaigns were seldom, if ever, kept. Indeed, by the end \nof a term the promises of the previous campaign had often been totally \nforgotten. People felt that this lack of contact and communication, \nthis out-of-touch, Washington, inside-the-beltway mentality was the \nreason that Washington had not been able to deal with important \nproblems confronting America and, in particular, the problems of the \nFederal budget deficit and runaway Federal spending.\n  People in my State believe that they have sent too many of their \nhard-earned earnings to Washington. They would like to keep more of \nwhat they earn. They feel the Federal tax burden is too high. They \ncannot understand why they have to balance their family budget, but we \nin Washington have not been able for 25 years to balance the Federal \nbudget.\n  The reason, they feel, more than any other that has led to this \nproblem, this lack of responsiveness, is that too many Federal \nofficials have been away from home too long, too many Federal officials \nhave lost touch with voters back home and do not understand the things \nthat motivate the average working families in Michigan.\n  Mr. President, I do not think Michigan is atypical. I suspect that \nvirtually every Member of this body hears the same thing in their \nState. I suspect Members of the House of Representatives, likewise, \nhear the same sentiments expressed to them when they are in their \nconstituency.\n  Now, this Congress has begun to move, I believe, in the right \ndirection to address some of these concerns. Last year, for the first \ntime we voted in the very first action taken by the Congress, to apply \nthe laws that apply to the rest of the country to Members of Congress \nthemselves. We put an end, in the Congressional Accountability Act, to \nthe double standard that said that things we adopted here as Federal \nlaw were fine for the rest of America but not fine for ourselves. That \nhas begun to change the way we do things here in the U.S. Senate.\n  I have been intrigued by the fact that so many of my colleagues and I \nhave found that meeting the various labor and other laws, requirements \nthat we now are required to follow, have changed the way we operate our \noffice and made us more mindful and concerned about labor relations and \nother issues that come on a day-to-day basis before us in our Senate \noffices. In the same way that has put us more in touch, I think nothing \nwill put Congress more in touch with people back home than a frequent \nand regular turnover in the composition of the House and Senate of the \nUnited States.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe that the term limits movement is a movement \nthat will only grow. If 75 percent favor term limits today, I believe \nit will be even a higher percentage in the years to come. That is why \nwhether or not we are able to succeed this year in passing term limits, \nit is only a matter of time, I believe, before we will have term limits \nas part of our Constitution.\n  To that, I want to commend the majority leader, Senator Dole, for \nscheduling the vote on term limits here in the Senate. For all the talk \nabout bringing reform to Congress, I believe our best approach to make \nCongress better is through term limits. I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this much-needed reform of our political system. I urge them to \nsupport it because it is the right direction to take. I urge them to \nsupport it because it has such strong popular support. I also urge them \nto support it because I think it is only right that the citizens of the \nvarious States have the chance to set the limits on terms of Federal \nofficials.\n  To conclude, that the citizens of Michigan do not have the \nconstitutional authority to determine how long their Members of \nCongress and their U.S. Senators may serve, is, in my judgment, a \nstrong repudiation of the rights of people in a free democracy to make \ndecisions for themselves.\n  Mr. President, I close on this note, by urging my colleagues to \nsupport the term limit efforts we are undertaking this week.\n  Before I yield the floor, I will ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 2 minutes to make a brief statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3769-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SYMPATHY TO MICHIGAN FAMILY\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \ncondolences to the entire Bitar family of Dearborn, MI, who lost their \ntwo sons due to the most recent violence in Lebanon that occurred last \nThursday. Hadi, who was age 8, and his brother, Abdul Mohsin, age 9, \nwere visiting their grandmother in their home village of Qana during \ntheir spring break from school when the fighting broke out last week. \nThey sought refuge in the United Nations shelter, which was tragically \nbombed.\n  The loss of civilian lives, Mr. President, no matter where it occurs, \nis always devastating, but it is especially tragic when children, in \nthis case, 8-and 9-year-old children, are killed senselessly. When a \nloss such as this occurs so close to home, as it did in an important \ncity in my State, many individuals in the Michigan community were \naffected. They feel this very deeply. I am here today to speak on their \nbehalf.\n  This occurrence highlights both the urgency and the necessity of \nbringing peace to the Middle East. I strongly urge the administration \nto persist in trying to negotiate a cease-fire in Lebanon and to bring \nan end to the hostilities immediately. I sincerely hope that no more \ntragedies such as this occur and that no more innocent lives are lost \nwhile these negotiations persist. Yesterday, I attended a special \nprayer service for the two boys who were killed last week. The ribbon I \nam wearing today, Mr. President, was given to me at that service as a \ntribute to the lives that have been lost. All I can say, Mr. President, \nis I intend to be on the floor every day to talk about what is going \non, and these tragedies, until, hopefully, we will see a cease-fire and \nan end to the senseless killing and the bloodshed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3772-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3772-S3786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO LIMIT CONGRESSIONAL TERMS\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment before the body is amendment \n3698.\n  Is there further debate?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you for the recognition. I want to \nthank my friend, the Senator from Michigan, for his outstanding \nanalysis. I also want to express my sympathy to him and to those \ncitizens of Michigan whose children were victims of the latest \nbombings. I commend him for his work in this area and thank him for \nbringing our attention to this matter.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk about term limits. I want to mention \nsome important reasons why I think it is essential that Members of this \nbody support the opportunity of the States to ratify a constitutional \namendment.\n  The Senate does not have the authority to amend the Constitution. We \nmerely have the authority to extend to the States the right to ratify a \nproposed amendment to the Constitution. To vote against this proposal \nis basically to say that the wisdom of the\n\n[[Page S3773]]\n\nCongress is so superior to that of the States that we should not even \nentrust them with decisionmaking power on limited tenure.\n  Why, then, should we have congressional term limits? Why should we \nsend to the States this opportunity for ratification? I believe we \nought to because that potential for ratification is consistent with the \ncentral values of this Republic, the central political themes and \nunderstandings of our democracy. The first of those is that we are \nrepresentatives of the people. We come here to provide the people a \nvoice. And while we are to exercise our own judgment, we are to \nrepresent the people of the State or district from which we hail.\n  What do the people of America think about term limits? Well, the \npolling data indicates that 74 percent of them favor term limits. And \n41 States have imposed term limits on their Governors. As it relates to \ncity councils, many cities--from New York to Los Angeles--have imposed \nterm limits on their own city councils.\n  As you look at the political map, you find out that there is a \nglaring hole in the term limits net: the U.S. Congress. It exists for \nthe President, not the Congress; it exists for Governors, for State \nlegislatures, for cities, counties, and towns. all kinds of things \nacross America. But there is one place where it has not existed.\n  There is another fundamental value of American culture that term \nlimits respects and reinforces. It is the value of access and \nparticipation. When a few people believe they are the only people that \nhave the capacity to do a particular job, they tend to shut others out \nof the process. The unfortunate effect of incumbency is that it has \nclosed down the system even further.\n  The American people are understanding folks. They have watched as 91 \npercent of the incumbents who run for office win reelection. That means \nthat a challenger has a 1-in-10 chance to defeat a sitting Member. Now, \nyou do not have to be a math wizard to understand that, in an open seat \nsituation, the two challengers have a 50 percent chance of winning. \nFurthermore, the data suggests that when there is the prospect of an \nopen seat, the number of candidates increases exponentially. In other \nwords, there is a substantial broadening of the variety of choices that \nthe American people have from which to choose.\n  I think we ought to make sure that happens more and more frequently. \nThose who study political science indicate that as you approach an open \nseat race there are increasing numbers of individuals who prepare \nthemselves for the vacancy by offering themselves as candidates.\n  That is one of the reasons why I think the 6-year limit in the House \nis so valuable. It would virtually guarantee that we would have \nenhanced levels of choice for the American people in every elections.\n  It is also important to look at the history of term limits. I think \nthe word ``history'' is important here. So often people debate term \nlimits as if this were some theory that needs to be hashed out in the \nthink tanks before the American people could understand it. This is not \na decision made in a vacuum of facts or experience. It is a decision \nmade in an arena with which the American people are fully familiar.\n  The American people have a history of term limits. It is not the \npassion of the moment. It is not the whim of a particular time. It is \nan understanding about the way government works. And they have said, \nyes, we want it for the Presidency of the United States. So you have \nterm limits for the Presidency of the United States.\n  Let me also say that I believe that those who indicate that there are \nnot enough qualified people in the country to replace qualified Members \nof the Congress have a view of a talent pool in America which is unduly \nshallow.\n  When George Washington walked away from the Presidency after his \nfirst two terms in office he understood that America was a place filled \nwith knowledgeable citizens whose judgment and capacity would sustain \nthis Republic, and he did not allow himself to be swayed by the \narrogant nonsense that there are just a few people in America who are \nbright enough, or capable enough, or sound enough to make decisions. He \nunderstood that the tree of liberty would be nourished by an influx of \ncreativity that would be found as individuals stepped aside to return \nto citizenship and as citizens stepped in to accept the \nresponsibilities of government.\n  It is high time that we had the same understanding of the talent pool \nin the United States. The pool of available talent in this country is \nincredibly deep. We have great resources. We have tremendous citizens. \nThere are outstanding persons, and we ought to tap them and call them \ninto the process. Then we ought to send ourselves home to live under \nthe very laws for which we vote.\n  I do not want to be a part of those who underestimate the strength \nand the capacity of the people of this great land. We have a tremendous \ncapacity in America. We should open the door of self-government to \nthose individuals so that they can participate in government by virtue \nof coming in and being a part of the U.S. Congress.\n  What would the United States look like if we were to have had term \nlimits? What kind of changes would there be? Mind you that I am \nprepared to say that I believe we ought to make the decision about term \nlimits based on the fundamental values of this country, based on the \nsense that we ought to have open access and that we ought to have more \nparticipation based on the fact that we represent the people.\n  But what would America look like? When Stephen Moore of the Cato \nInstitute conducted a study, he indicated that we would have had a \nbalanced budget amendment, something we have yet to get. In 1990, 1992, \nand in 1994, we would have approved the balanced budget amendment.\n  Not surprisingly, the line-item veto, which we only passed this \nmonth, would have been enacted more than 10 years ago, in 1985. Think \nof the thousands, tens of thousands, think of the millions of dollars \nthat might well have been saved had we had the capacity to knock pork \nout of Federal budgets as early as 1985. I believe that newcomers do \nreflect something special about the process.\n  Let me make another point. Some people have said that we need \nexperienced people in Washington. I could not agree more. But I have to \nsay that I do not believe that the only experience we need in \nWashington is government experience. Some of the very best Members of \nthis body are individuals who have brought a wealth of experience from \nthe private sector. To suggest that we need people who have years and \nyears of experience in government is a bankrupt idea which fails to \nunderstand that experience happens in places outside the public sector.\n  A couple of other things that are significant to me about the Cato \nstudy.\n  And what are the things which would have failed? You guessed it. The \nlast two tax increases and the last two congressional pay increases \nwould not have passed the Congress. Interesting. All of the things that \nwould restrain Government would have passed, and the things which fund \nGovernment would not have.\n  It comes down to this fundamental set of values as to whether \ngovernment exists for the benefit of government or whether government \nexists for the benefit of the people. In ``The Federalist Papers,'' \nMadison wrote of a Congress with a ``habitual recollection of its \ndependence on the people.'' Unfortunately, we find ourselves in a \ndemocracy where the citizens all too frequently have a constant \nrecollection of their dependence on government.\n  Just think of the agriculture bill we passed early this month. \nFarmers were waiting to find out what they could plant. It was a \ncountry dependent upon government, instead of a government that was \ndependent upon, and cognizant of, the citizens.\n  The principal value here is that we recognize what it is the people \nwant. In this case, it is a constitutional amendment on term limits. I \nbelieve we should reinforce a reform which would promote access and \nparticipation, and which would level the playing field so that \nindividuals who offer themselves for service have a fair shot.\n  One last footnote. A term-limited Senate would be a different Senate \nbecause it would require the Chamber to operate on the basis of merit, \nrather than seniority. While I respect the individuals whose dedication \nto their country has allowed them to serve this body, I do not concede \nthat they are,\n\n[[Page S3774]]\n\nby virtue of their service, the most qualified to lead committees or \ndetermine policy. I believe we should think about developing, and would \ndevelop if we had term limits, a leadership framework based on merit, \nnot rank seniority. Incidentally, the 3-2 constitutional amendment I \nproposed would do just that.\n  Mr. President, it is time for us to respect the values of the \nAmerican people; 70 percent of them would like to consider a term \nlimits constitutional amendment. The time for us to extend them that \nopportunity is now.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  (Mr. ASHCROFT assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Missouri. He \nhas been a leader in this fight for a long time. His points are so well \nmade. He mentioned the precedent set by George Washington, that after \nserving two terms, purportedly got on his horse and rode out of town \nnever to return to Washington. People asked him to stay, but he knew \nbetter. He knew there were other people who were qualified to serve, \nand because he left when he did, other people were able to serve. He \nset a good example.\n  The same example was set by Thomas Jefferson. He served two terms \nback when a President could serve for as long as they could continue \ngetting elected. So this is the example that was set for us. And, of \ncourse, the people who were in the Congress at that time would not have \nthought of serving many, many years in Congress. They were citizen \nlegislators who came to town to interrupt their career and not make a \ncareer. So I think that the Senator's point is very well made.\n  I see my colleague from Colorado is in the Chamber. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Tennessee for his \nleadership on this issue, as well as the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri. Both of these first-term Senators have made an enormous \ndifference in the body, and I think their service speaks volumes about \nthe talent that is available in this Nation.\n  Mr. President, this is a hotly debated item, and while opinion in \nthis country overwhelmingly supports term limits, it is not a secret \nthat it is not the most popular item ever presented in this Chamber. We \nhave had difficulty getting votes. The first vote on this was in 1947 \nby a Senator from Texas. He succeeded in getting one vote--his own--and \nit was a long time before it was raised again.\n\n  In the last several years, we have been able to get several votes, \nbut they have never been clear and on the point. I think we should note \nat least that Senator Dole's leadership provides the first opportunity \nin the history of our country to have this issue aired in this Chamber \nin a clear fashion. He is the first majority leader of the Senate to \nbring it to the floor and hopefully provide us with the opportunity for \na vote. It is a courageous thing to do because there is enormous \npressure in this body and outside this body not to allow it to come \nforward.\n  Over 200 years ago, Thomas Jefferson wrote a friend and he suggested \nsome interesting things. He said three things were missing in the \nAmerican Constitution: a Bill of Rights, of course, which was passed \nlater on; limits on the tenure of the chief executive--he was about 150 \nyears too early, but he got that right, because, as all the Senators \nare well aware, that was eventually passed and added to our \nConstitution--and lastly, the third item Thomas Jefferson mentioned was \nrotation in office for Members of Congress.\n  What prophetic words. Two of the three have come to pass. Mr. \nPresident, I believe with all my heart the third will come to pass as \nwell.\n  Many Members for whom I have deep respect have spoken on this subject \nand expressed real regret about this issue. To some, they have taken \nthe issue personally, as a question of the value of their service or a \nquestion of the value of their continued effort to serve this country.\n  Speaking for myself, but I believe speaking for others as well, no \nsuch intent or castigation of their service is intended at all. As a \nmatter of fact, there could be nothing more American than putting a \nlimit on power. That is really what this is all about. It is not just \nabout the example of Cincinnatus returning to his farm after serving \nhis country. It goes to the very core and very heart of what Americans \nbelieve about government. We are unique. We are not simply the longest \nsurviving democracy in the history of mankind, but we are a shining \nexample to the rest of the world of what can blossom forth when people \nare free, what can happen when the power of the Nation is primarily \ncentered in the individual and not in those who govern.\n  The world's history, recorded for some 4,000 to 5,000 years, is \nreplete with examples of people who performed great service. It is also \nreplete with examples of countries where power corrupted. Americans, \nwhen we drafted our Constitution, were more aware than any people in \nthe history of mankind of the value of governments in the past. The \nwritings of Polybius, Montesquieu, and Cicero were on the minds and \nwords and lips of the drafters of the Constitution.\n  They understood the cycle of government that Polybius had observed, \nso many, many centuries ago; the tendency of power to corrupt. The \ntendency of democracy to turn into an aristocracy, ruling by the few; \nand the tendency of an aristocracy to devolve into a dictatorship, and \nthe corruption that comes from dictatorship; followed by anarchy and \nthen the process starting all over again.\n  Those evils were on the minds and in the hearts of the people who \ndrafted our Constitution. They sought for something different and \ngreater than anything in the history of mankind, any government in the \nhistory of mankind. They sought to find a government that would last. \nThey sought to find a government that would provide the blessings of \ntranquility and order and liberty; that would not be simply temporary, \nas every government had been in the past, but that would be as close to \npermanent as we could achieve.\n  They believed that reliance on the individual and a stable form of \ngovernment could bring about blessings to mankind that had never before \nbeen seen. This great experiment in democracy, in republican democracy, \nhas shown exactly what they had hoped for. The very essence of what \nAmerican government is all about is an understanding that power \ncorrupts and a firm belief that, to have a stable, lasting government, \nwe need to limit power. We need to limit power because power can \ncorrupt and destroy and harm the stability and the freedom that we so \nhighly prize.\n  For those who think that term limits is out of touch with the \nAmerican experience, who have not read the words of Jefferson, who have \nnot looked at the history of this country, where the pattern was for a \nturnover in Congress--for those who have not focused on that and \nsomehow doubt that term limits is in the tradition of the American \nexperience, think about the limits we put on power. It is the very \nessence and the very genius of what the American experience is. We \ndesigned a Government where the House is able to check the Senate and \nthe Senate check the House. We do not allow a rush to judgment. We \nthink a longer view, a more thorough analysis, can be beneficial. Is it \nslower? Yes. Does it limit one body's power? Yes. Would the Senate be \nmore efficient without a House? I suspect you could get an argument on \nthat. But our founders thought the essence was to limit power to cause \ngood deliberation and also prevent corruption.\n  It is not just the House and the Senate that balance each other. It \nis an executive that has the power of a veto. And it is not just the \nexecutive and the Congress that face limitations, we have a Supreme \nCourt and a court system that limits our power as well. The founders \nthought long and hard and they set up a system of government whose very \nessence, whose very core is a limitation on power.\n  They were concerned, some would say obsessed, with preventing the \ncorruption that comes with too much power so they set up a system that \nputs its primary focus on individuals and not in government, not in the\n\n[[Page S3775]]\n\nhands of a few but in the hands of many. And what power we gave to the \nFederal Government we limited.\n  It is not just the checks and balances in the Federal system that \nexist, but a separation of powers between the Federal and the State \nlevel. Specific provisions, article X, the Bill of Rights, leaves those \npowers to individuals and States not specifically given to the Federal \nGovernment. All Members know this. They are familiar with it. But to \nsay or to think for one moment that term limits is not the very essence \nof the spirit of the American experience of government is to miss the \npoint. Our whole approach has been an understanding of the corruption \npower can bring about, and the need to make sure--the need to make \nabsolutely sure--that no one can rule without limitations. This is not \nan aberration. This is not a change of the spirit of the American \ngovernment. This term limit is the embodiment of it.\n  Some will say wait a minute, we have gotten along pretty well without \nit. For those, I suggest they look at the history of this Nation. For \none, term limits was not included in the Constitution because people \nnever thought Congress would turn into a lifetime career. Service in \nthe U.S. Congress was thought to be just that, a service. One of the \nbig issues early on was raising of the pay to $6. For that they threw \nout most of the Congress, for that huge pay increase. Service in the \nHouse and the Senate was thought to be a time where you would serve \nyour country, not gain financially. That has changed. Some will say \nMembers of Congress are overpaid. Others, many here, think they are \nunderpaid. But whether you believe we are overpaid or underpaid, there \nis no question that the salary for a Member of Congress is much \ndifferent than what it once was.\n\n  There is no question that it is a good living compared to any \nstandard in America today. Are there people here who could earn more? \nYes, I hope so. There are some who could earn less on the outside. But \nthe point is this. Serving in Congress has changed from a period of \nservice that costs people money to serve, where the remuneration was \nmuch less than what they could get on the outside, to a compensation \nthat, even by the most meager description, is fairly adequate; \nsomething quite good.\n  The phenomenon of people serving a long period in Congress has \naccompanied a number of things. One, a dramatic increase in \ncompensation, and a dramatic increase in the power that is here. \nService now is different than it was in the 1800's. There are financial \nmotives that did not exist.\n  Do we want to go back to those days where Members of Congress \nreceived little or nothing? No, perhaps not. But neither should we \nclose our eyes to the impact of that change. The simple fact is, this \ncountry has changed. Because of the power and because of the rewards, \npeople now wish to serve long periods of time.\n  There are three areas that I believe will change dramatically if we \npass term limits. Here they are.\n  First of all, I believe the background of the people who serve in \nthis body in both the House and the Senate will change if we have term \nlimits. One need only look at the lengthy service of time that some \nMembers have. But even more significant, I think, is that when we \ndebate legislation we debate without the benefit of people having fresh \nexperiences in the real world with regard to that legislation. I cannot \ntell you how many times I have come and listened to millionaires \ndiscuss the minimum wage, when they never held a minimum wage job in \ntheir life. Let me tell you, if you got through school by working and \npaying your own way with a series of minimum wage jobs, you have a \ndifferent view of minimum wage jobs than if you inherited your money.\n  If spring break meant you had a chance to get a second job to make \nyour tuition payment instead of taking a yacht tour on your daddy's \nyacht, you have a different view of what that issue is.\n  If you are concerned about welfare, I can tell you, if you have had \nto work for a living, if you have had to scratch for a living, you have \na different view of what welfare is and ought to be than if you have \nbeen wealthy all your life.\n  If you are talking about regulating businesses and jobs, you have a \ndifferent view if you have been subject to that regulation. Members of \nCongress for the first time--and I think it is of great benefit to this \nNation--are now being subjected to the same laws, or almost the same \nlaws--we are not quite there but we are close--almost the same laws \nthat working men and women in this country are. Does that make a \ndifference? You bet it makes a difference. I see, day after day, \nthoughtful, reasonable, intelligent people on this floor talk about \nimposing regulations on the working men and women of this country.\n  Mr. President, with due respect, I cannot help but think if they had \nactually had those jobs, if they had actually done that work, they \nwould have a much different view. I believe term limits will change \nsome of that. Term limits will mean some turnover in the people who \nserve. I think it is much more likely we will have people serve here \nwho have actually had working experiences in the areas they attempt to \nregulate.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Tennessee here, a physician, in \nour midst. All of us have grown to respect and admire him greatly as we \nhave gotten to know him and seen the integrity that he brings to his \njob. But he brings something more than just a bright mind and great \nintegrity. He brings firsthand experience of his profession as a \nphysician. It is not a secret that when Members have questions about \nthat, they turn to the Senator from Tennessee for a practical view. Do \nthey always agree with him? No. But they at least have access to \nsomeone who has actually done it, who understands it, who has been \nthere firsthand. How much more effective this body could be if we had \nmore Members who had real lifetime experiences like the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  I believe, as I listen to these issues debated, if we had that, we \nwould have much more effective laws. One thing else I would suggest. If \nwe had people who worked for a living and a real turnover, I do not \nbelieve we would have had 65,000 pages of new regulations put in the \nFederal Register last year.\n  For Members who are not aware of it, that is what it was--over 65,000 \npages of new regulations were added last year. That is not the total \nregulations that Americans are subjected to; that is just what we added \nlast year.\n  If you sat down today to read the regulations to which you are \nsubjected and for which you can go to prison if you violate them or at \nthe very minimum face heavy fines, if you simply wanted to find out \nwhat it is you are required to do, and you read 300 words a minute, \nwhich is pretty good for regulations, and you read all day long, 8 \nhours a day, with no coffee breaks, 5 days a week with no holidays and \n52 weeks a year with no vacations, you would barely get halfway \nthrough. You literally could not read them if you devoted yourself full \ntime, and those are what we expect the American people to follow. That \nis just the new ones; that is not the ones that are already on the \nbooks.\n  (Mr. THOMPSON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, one of the great benefits of term limits is \nto bring into this body a group of people who have a broader wealth of \npractical experience. By that turnover, I think what we will find is \nthat we have become better legislators.\n  There are a few subjects, no matter the most liberal Democrat or \nconservative Republican who, if they sit down and get their facts \nright, cannot come to agreement on. Yes, there are differences; yes, \nthere is a different philosophy. But generally when men and women have \nthe same basis of facts, they are able to come to a similar logical \nconclusion.\n  I believe one of the great advantages of term limits is it will give \nour Members broader background, a greater basis of personal facts and, \nas a consequence, they will be able to work better together. I think \nyou are going to find them able to do a much better job.\n  There is no society in the history of mankind that has ever produced \n65,000 pages of new regulations every year, not Hammurabi, not Napoleon \nwith his code, nobody ever came close.\n  If we think we can continue to be effective and competitive in a \nworld market when we have committed to tying ourselves in redtape and \nregulations, we are dreaming. That is not going to change until we have \nlegislators who have had real-life experiences. That is\n\n[[Page S3776]]\n\none reason I think term limits will be a great blessing for this \nNation.\n  Second, it is my observation, from having spent 10 years in the House \nand 6 years in the Senate, that unlimited terms has led to a corruption \nof the process. Mr. President, I do not make that charge lightly. Let \nme be specific about it.\n  One of the political action committees or groups that supported me \nwhen I ran for an open seat for the Senate was very frank. They said, \n``If we had an incumbent that had a decent record, we would never have \nsupported you, no matter how much we like you, no matter how you would \nvote, no matter what you would do. Our policy is to support \nincumbents.''\n  Is it a good policy on their part? I do not think it is good for the \ncountry, but it is probably good for their narrow issues. I do not mean \nto give shortchange to those issues. I agree with this particular group \nand many of the things they do, but not with their announced policy to \nonly support incumbents. Is that unusual? Tragically, it is not. The \nreality is many of our political action committees support incumbents \nif they have a voting record that is close to what they want.\n  Instead of being viable competitive races, what we have seen is a \nsystem where the funding for campaigns has become huge and incumbents \nhave had an enormous advantage. Let us not kid ourselves. Anyone who \nsays, ``Look, we don't need term limits because democracy will take \ncare of the process,'' has not looked at the facts.\n  In 1 year in the House, we had more people indicted than we had \nincumbents defeated. Let me repeat that. One of the years in the House, \nwe had more Members of Congress indicted than we had incumbents \ndefeated. Does that mean some people who were indicted got reelected? \nYes, that is exactly what that means.\n\n  Mr. President, this is not a fair fight; this is not a fair process. \nIncumbents have an incredible advantage. Those who say, ``We don't need \nterm limits because the voters will take care of it,'' overlook the \nfact of what happens when one candidate is on the air and can outspend \nthe other candidate 3 and 4 to 1. They are closing their eyes to the \nreality. The simple fact is, as long as you have long-term incumbency, \nyou are going to have an enormous advantage for incumbents in this \nCongress. We have corrupted the process.\n  In the House of Representatives, even in years when you have huge \nturnovers, you have had more than 90 percent of incumbents reelected. \nThe Senate incumbency is of little less value, I suspect, because there \nare slightly more competitive races. But make no mistake about it, \nincumbents in the Senate have a huge advantage in terms of fundraising.\n  If you believe in viable, competitive races, you are going to want \nterm limits. The process has been corrupted and it is not going to \nchange until we put a limit on the number of terms a Member of Congress \nmay serve.\n  Third, Mr. President, I think there will be an advantage to this \nNation with term limits with regard to the pork-barrel spending. Let me \nput it as succinctly as I can.\n  This Nation, in 1945, was the greatest creditor nation in the history \nof the world. More people owed us more money than any in the history of \nmankind. We produced 50 percent of the world's GNP. One nation, 6 \npercent of the world's population, produced half the world's products \nand services, and we were the greatest creditor nation on the face of \nthe Earth.\n  Today, we are the biggest debtor nation on the face of the Earth. We \nowe more money than any nation in the history of mankind.\n  How does that happen? How could thoughtful, reasonable people spend \nthemselves into potential insolvency? How could we set up trust funds \nthat promise benefits, require people to pay in for their whole life on \na chain-letter financing scheme? If private insurance companies did \nwhat the Federal Government does, we would put them in jail for fraud.\n  How could this happen? All of us know how it has happened. All of us \nknow how this spending went wild. It happened because we set up a \nsystem where people would be in place for long periods of time, and the \nway to get along was to go along.\n  Members have heard this on the floor. This does not shock or surprise \nanyone. Perhaps someone will come down and say, Hank, that's not true, \nbut, Mr. President, it is true.\n  I cannot mention how many times I have been in debate on farm bills \nand we will offer an amendment to eliminate the honey program. Some \nMembers sincerely believe, if we did not have a subsidy program for \nhoney, that bees would lose interest in flowers. Perhaps their parents \ndid not give them a talk about the birds and the bees. But, they either \nbelieved that or they voted for the honey program for another reason, \nand that reason, if you review the debate, is pretty clear.\n  People said, ``Look, this may not be the best program in the world, \nbut if you do not vote for the honey program, I will not vote for your \ncotton program.'' And, ``If you don't vote for the cotton program, I \nwon't vote for the tobacco program.'' And ``If you don't vote for the \ntobacco program, we won't vote for the peanut program.''\n  Mr. President, how does this happen? Everybody here knows that is \nwhat happened. Everybody knows and understands how we got into these \nsilly programs. We got into these silly programs because people said, \n``I can get what I want for my State if I will simply support these \nprograms for other States.''\n  Term limits make a big difference in that. Are you going to go \nagainst the chairman of the Appropriations Committee who you know is \ngoing to be there for another 20 years and you know that if you ever \nwant anything out of that Appropriations Committee, that person, that \nman or woman, is going to remember you and is going to penalize you?\n  The simple fact is, the majority of Members of Congress over the last \nquarter century, and perhaps the last 50 years, have not done it. It is \npart of how we got into this circumstance. The pork-barrel spending, \nspending not on what each of us felt in our heart was a good program--\nwe have passed programs that are nonsensical.\n  How do you defend a subsidy program for tobacco, for heaven's sake? I \ndo not think anybody comes here thinking that makes sense--maybe there \nare some--but it gets passed and it stays in law. And it does, not \nbecause people think it is such a great idea, but because they know to \nget along you have to go along.\n  Mr. President, if you have term limits the world changes. Suddenly \nthe person who could retaliate against you, if you did not support \nevery one of his appropriations or her appropriations is not there \npermanently. Yes, you may not get what you want this year, but next \nyear or the year after there will be a new chairman, there will be a \nrotation, there will be fresh ideas, there will be new people, there \nwill be a turnover in thoughts and ideas and personnel and the ability \nto enforce the go-along, get-along rule will be dramatically reduced. \nWill it be ended? No. I wish there was a way to end it. But this will \ndramatically reduce the ability of people to enforce a go-along, get-\nalong policy. It will dramatically cut back on pork barrel spending.\n  Mr. President, I am persuaded that all three of these things will \nhappen if we have term limits. We will have much more knowledgeable \npeople. We will eliminate some of the corruption in the process by \nhaving a turnover rather than having the built-in advantage for \nincumbents. We will strike a blow at pork barrel spending in a way that \nwill be more effective than anything that is currently being done.\n  But, Mr. President, I am persuaded not just by these three things, \nbut by something much more important. There are people who can come to \nthis body and serve and keep their confidence and keep their \nindependence and keep their integrity. I salute them. Many serve in \nthis body right now, and America is a better place for it. But we must \ndecide whether or not it is better to have a rotation of those who \nserve in public office. It is better to have a turnover. Will some \ngreat talent be lost? Of course there will. But, Mr. President, some \ngreat talent will be found. This is not a zero-sum game. For every \nperson who retires we bring in someone new with fresh, new vibrant \nideas and new experiences.\n  This Nation was founded on the precept that we will reflect the will \nof the people. Almost 80 percent of the American people in every survey \nthat is\n\n[[Page S3777]]\n\nfound support this idea. Some surveys go as low as 75, others to 85 and \n90. But the reality is the American people support term limits. They \nsupport that because they do not believe that anyone in American \nGovernment should be that powerful or that this should be a lifetime \njob.\n  I believe, Mr. President, we will find an enormous benefit to the \nAmerican public with term limits. Is it going to pass this time? I do \nnot know. The vote count seems to indicate that we are short. But, Mr. \nPresident, I do believe it will pass. I do believe Thomas Jefferson's \nthird suggestion for the Republic will be enacted. I believe we will be \na stronger, greater, more productive and creative people because of it. \nI yield back, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of \nSenator Brown. He has outlined the issue very, very well, as has the \nPresiding Officer, and as others.\n  Mr. President, as Americans from across this great Nation demand true \ncongressional reform and greater accountability from their elected \nofficials, I rise today to strongly support this resolution which would \nimpose term limits on Congress.\n  When I ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1992, I made a \nfirm commitment to the voters of Minnesota's Sixth District that I \nwould support Federal term limits. When I ran for the Senate in 1994, I \nmade that same commitment. And amidst a political climate of voter \ndistrust and disgust with the system, I firmly believe that my strong \nsupport for term limits is one of the reasons I won both of those \nelections.\n  On January 5, 1993, after I was sworn into public office for the \nfirst time, the very first thing I did was cosponsor a bill to \nestablish term limits for Members of Congress: two 6-year terms for \nSenators, and six 2-year terms for Members of the House.\n  After 2 years in the House, and now into my second year of serving in \nthe Senate, my enthusiasm for term limits has not wavered. If anything, \nI am even more convinced that congressional term limits would be the \nsingle most important reform measure Congress could pass this session.\n  When we look at the problems facing our Nation today, and the \ninability of Congress to deal with our skyrocketing budget deficit and \nnational debt, much of the responsibility rests upon career \npoliticians, because studies have shown, the longer elected officials \nare in Washington, the more they come to believe that government has \nall the answers. More spending will solve the problems.\n  The longer they serve in Congress, the more likely they are to \nsupport even larger spending programs which means they believe--maybe \nthey have been here too long--that Congress or Government has all the \nanswers, not the individual.\n  Congress is no longer the body of the people that was envisioned by \nour Founding Fathers. Instead of citizen legislators, it has become a \nbody of professional politicians whose ultimate goal, again, is to \nspend the entire balance of their careers in public office. Public \nservice has become the basis of their way of life. Again, I would like \nto add, public service in itself is not bad. But, again, too much power \nor control in the hands of too few for too long is bad.\n  But when individuals have a vested interest in maintaining their \nelected positions, they are hardly the people you should entrust to \nreduce the size of Government and reform the institution that keeps \nthem fed.\n  Career politicians too often put their own short-term personal \ninterest in seeking reelection ahead of the long-term good of the \ncountry.\n  Too often, they are the first to cave in to special interests and too \noften, career politicians are the last people in Washington who really \nwant to cut spending.\n  And again, statistics show, the longer a person serves in Congress, \nthe more spending he or she supports, because they believe Washington \nhas all the answers.\n  During the 1980's, it was easier to remove a member of the Soviet \nPolitburo than it was to remove a Member of the U.S. Congress.\n  The arrogance of power exhibited by these career politicians has led \nmany voters to become disenchanted, frustrated with Congress' inability \nor unwillingness to put aside personal motives of protecting political \ncareers and honestly deal with the Federal Government's budget \nproblems.\n  Fortunately, Mr. President, times have changed. Some of the most \nardent opponents of term limits are no longer among us. I believe one \nof the reasons for this change is the commitment of so many of our new \nSenators and Representatives to the concept of term limits. And it is a \nmessage that resonates mightily across this country. National polls \nhave shown time and time again that the American public overwhelmingly \nsupports term limits.\n  Throughout my campaign in 1994, I spoke with voters across my great \nState--Minnesotans young and old, Republican and Democrat, from factory \nworkers to corporate executives. And these individuals impressed upon \nme the importance of term limits.\n  Opponents of term limits claim that Congress will lose effective \nleaders, which it will. I will say there are many who have served many \nyears and served well, but, at the same time, Congress will gain \neffective new Members, who will take up where others have left off. In \nthe private sector, many corporations and factories replace their \nCEO's, every 5 to 10 years, mainly to get new life, new ideas, and new \nenthusiasm, new direction for their business, times change and needs \nchange.\n  In the words of former Minnesota Congressman Bill Frenzel, ``All the \ntitans of Congress were pea-green freshmen once. They were good when \nthey got there. Experience did not make them smarter. It just gave them \nmore staff and made them harder to say no to.'' Like Congressman \nFrenzel, I, too, believe that ``Congressional term limits would restore \nbalance to our system by extending to the legislative branch the noble \nprecedent of term limits applied by the 22d amendment to the executive \nbranch only. Both branches need limits.''\n  The 1994 elections were a mandate for change. Establishing term \nlimits will deliver on a promise we made to the American people. It was \na promise, I can assure you, from which this Minnesota Senator will not \nback down. Because service in this institution should be exactly what \nour forefathers intended it to be--that is, a temporary period of \nservice to the Nation, followed by a return to our jobs, to the family \nbusiness or to other careers, a return home, to live under the laws he \nor she helped to enact.\n  We talk about the lack of faith Americans have in Congress and those \nwho serve here. We joke about those polls which show Members of \nCongress at the lowest levels when it comes to the public trust. But, \nMr. President, it is not a joke. We have got to restore the public \nconfidence which has been stripped away by years of abuse by powerful, \nlifelong politicians.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that term limits are a first \nstep toward restoring that trust. I believe that is a vital step. I \nurge my colleagues to support the passage of this resolution which will \ngo a long way toward restoring the faith of the American people in \ntheir elected representatives here in Washington.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been suggested. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I want to thank our friend and colleague, \nSenator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, for what he is doing and the way he \nis doing it. He does it out of the utmost sincerity, the utmost \nauthenticity. I have known him a long time, since back in the days when \nhe worked with our leader, Howard Baker, in a different role. He ran on \nthis issue. A lot of people did. This was just one of many issues that \nhe laid himself out to the voters on. He said, ``I believe in this.'' \nAnd they said, ``We believe in you.'' So that is why he is here.\n  There are those in both parties who would hope to avoid this measure, \nobviously. I want to indicate my strongest\n\n[[Page S3778]]\n\nsupport for this measure which is offered by our friend, to limit the \nterms of service in the U.S. Congress--contentious, a bitter pill for \nsome, difficult to grasp for others, but seen pretty clearly by the \npeople of the United States, especially in my own State, where 77 \npercent of the people voted for term limits. Of course, they did not do \nthat when I was running for my third term. But I was always very, very \nmuch in favor of limitation of terms, as I say, until I got to my third \none. Then I had a lapse, just a light lapse, and now I am restored. I \nam back. Of course, not running again, but I will get to that in proper \ncontext.\n  Let me tell you why I am here to support Senator Thompson. I did not \ncome quickly or early to this position. I came painfully to this \nposition about term limits. I really thought they were a mistake at \nfirst. I say facetiously--obviously, when I ran for my third term, but \nI cannot help but notice now there is a certain strain in some \neditorial commentary about this measure, implying that it is some kind \nof ``feel-good'', toothless symbolic action, a way of diverting us from \nour real challenges. Saying if we would only do our work, ``if you \nwould just do your work, you would not need all these remarkable dodges \nand sophistries.''\n  I cannot disagree with those charges any more strongly than I do \nright now. I will briefly describe for my colleagues the real-world \nroad which I took to my current opinion--book, page, and hymn number, \nwith no musical accompaniment. Here it is. My interest come only when I \nfirst served this party in this Senate as the Republican whip--I hope \nyou hear this--when I became the whip, the second in my party serving \nunder this remarkable man, Senator Bob Dole, who I have the richest \nadmiration and regard for, in every respect. I served him loyally and \nwill continue to do that in any capacity that he would request of me--\nhere or whatever the endeavors of his life take him. It was when I was \nthe Republican whip that I began to appreciate the severe need for some \nkind of term limitation.\n\n  Let me tell you how that work went on, even though many of my \ncolleagues know exactly what that work is, the work of the whip. We \nwould have a very tough vote ready on this floor. The troops would be \nout, the deputy whips, and the leader would say, ``This is a critical \nnational issue,'' and I and my colleagues would go to each Senator and \nsay, ``This is a tough bill, but this is a critical national issue. \nThis is bigger than you, bigger than me, bigger than any individual \nitem. Are you with us?'' About once every 2 months, sometimes even once \na month, one of my colleagues would say, ``You know, I would love to do \nthat, but I can't, because if I do that, I'll be history. I'll be out \nof here. I've got a tough campaign and you are asking me to cast this \nvote--forget it. I'm gone if I vote that way. They will just use it \nagainst me, and I'm out of here. I'll be history.''\n  So we would go down the list. Both parties do this--do not miss this. \nI hope the American people do not miss it. OK, you go down the list and \nsay, ``This Senator is up for reelection. So we cannot ask too much of \nhim or her, that would be terrible. We cannot put the heat on them. But \nthis other Senator was just reelected. We can get him or her to go with \nus,'' and so on, down the list. Everyone around here knows how very \nsolicitous we become of our colleagues on our own side of the aisle \nwhen they have a tough reelection fight. That is the way this \nremarkable arena works. Help so-and-so, he is coming up, get the heat \noff of him, put it on this fellow who has 5 more years, and they will \nforget his vote by the time it is time for his reelection. On and on it \ngoes. That is the way it is played.\n  On every even-numbered year, one-third of the Senate and the entirety \nof the House is quaking in its political skin, afraid to cast any of \nthe really, really tough votes, because they dare not do anything but \ncast the really political vote, the one, if it is called political, for \nwhich there is only one reason, and that is to get reelected.\n  That is what I found. It was very clear to me what was happening. \nThere is this large number, every even-numbered year, all of the House \nMembers, a third of the Senate, a large number of legislators in \nWashington, thinking too much about politics and not sufficiently about \nprinciple and about the best interests of their Nation. It is no wonder \nthat it is terribly hard around here to take action against the \nchallenges that so vex this country.\n  That is what I observed. What I felt then and now, if we do term \nlimits, then after it kicks in--I shall tell you what you have after it \nkicks in. You will have one-third of the U.S. Senate voting right. That \nis what you will have. Then you go find 18 other people, and that will \ngive you 51. You can always find those other 18 people because they are \nin that pool of about 40 Democrats and Republicans in this body who are \n``always right there.'' They are always there. They are steady, \nthoughtful, they watch, they sometimes do their partisan strut--often, \nand we are all good at that--and they are always there. They are the \nones from whom you would draw 18 and then with the 33 you have voting \nright with no pressure, you find the 18 out of the pool of 40 and move \non with the Nation's business.\n\n  The astonishing and truly regrettable aspect about all of this is, \neven when there is a broad consensus about the nature of the problem, \npure politics will keep us from addressing it.\n  If you want a few examples, well, I just happened to drag a few in. \nCase in point. This year, the Consumer Price Index--this is a pure \n``no-brainer,'' and there was not a shred of substantive controversy \nhere until the senior citizens groups got worked up. Every economist \nwho testified before the Finance Committee said that it is overstated. \nEvery single one of them. Every budget analyst agrees that so long as \nthe Government indexes inflation at too high a rate, we will overspend \non COLA's--and in everything from Social Security to Federal \nretirement, to military retirement. And we will also collect too little \nin tax revenues as a consequence of improper indexing. That, my \nfriends, results in larger and larger deficits. This is no secret. We \nall know this is the case.\n  There is not a thing that I will relate in these remaining minutes \nthat is not consistent with the facts. We all know this is the case. \nThe economists who have testified know it to be true. That CPI \noverstates inflation by 0.7 to 2.2 percent. CBO knows it is true. OMB \nknows it is true. And that is why neither of them is using CPI to index \nour discretionary appropriations caps. I hope you heard that. No, they \nboth use a ``chain-weighted GDP index.'' I am going to try that one on \nthe floor. I know that is a mouthful. But if it is good enough for OMB \nand CBO, surely it should be good enough for us, as we wander through \nthe wilderness here. So we will try that chain-weighted GDP index, \nwhich will knock off about 0.4, and that will be a lot better progress \nthan what we are getting right now.\n  But the politics have been diagnosed as the problem. The President \ndoes not want to offend anyone who might be receiving a COLA. I \nunderstand that. Even if the COLA they are now getting is certifiably \ntoo large and even though it has nothing to do with your net worth or \nyour income. Try that one. That is the way it works. It does not matter \nwhat your net worth or your income is. CPI, Consumer Price Index--oh, \nis that a COLA? They are not the same. Heed the words of our able \nfriend from New York, Senator Pat Moynihan, about how the distortion \nhas come about with the cost-of-living allowance and CPI. They do not \nfit. But they have been fitted.\n  So even if the COLA is now certifiably too large, we do nothing. And \nso the President, being the very savvy political person he is, in a \npolitical year, intends to use this as a political weapon. A \nRepublican-controlled Congress will refuse to jump off the cliff, then, \nbecause of that effect, not wanting to give him any political benefit. \nAs a consequence--both parties playing what is called partisan \npolitics--nothing gets done, even when we all agree that it is a must \nand could be done without really setting back this country in any \nsense. And a 1-percent reduction in the CPI--and nobody is suggesting \nthat--in 10 years lops $680 billion off the pile. It is a lot smaller \nin 7 years, about $68 billion. So that shows you the exponential \ngrowth, if 1 percent of the CPI would save $68 or $70 billion in 7 \nyears in 10 years it will save you $680 billion. You are saying that is \nimpossible, but it is not. That is what is happening here, and that is \nwhat we should address--and we do nothing.\n\n[[Page S3779]]\n\n  When we did this and discussed it in the Bipartisan Commission on \nEntitlement and Tax Reform, we actually, naively, thought that it would \nbe like falling off a log, to simply do something with the CPI, which \nis so overstated at every turn. But, no, the AARP did not like that \nidea at all. No, indeed. And the Commission for the Preservation of \nMedicare and Medicaid thought that was an ugly trick. And so they will \nhelp us administer it on into bankruptcy.\n  I am grateful to my colleagues for hearing me out, because I deal \nwith these issues regularly, and I have been talking about these things \nall of my political life. This is not something new or some swan song \ncaper in the middle of the night. I am grateful for those who come up \nand say, ``You are right, Al, we need to do something about CPI.'' I \nwish I could count all of my colleagues who have said that; yet, \nnothing gets done. How can that be?\n  The answer lies wholly in the area of political fear. That is a word \nI want to use. The word is ``fear.'' Forget all the rest of it. \n``Fear.''\n  So there is an example just right off the bat--and that is the meat \npart of the bat, not the end--how term limits might immediately save \nfuture taxpayers untold billions in deficit spending. One percent in 10 \nyears would be $680 billion. And we are not even asking that.\n  So, as I say, in 1994, I served on the President's Bipartisan \nCommission on Entitlement and Tax Reform. And like that movie, ``The \nMan Who Knew Too Much,'' I almost wish I had not been appointed to do \nit. I have shown you a copy of our report. This is the interim report. \nThis was approved by a vote of 30 to 1. Who was on this Commission? Who \nwere these dastardly people that were pointing out these things with \nregard to Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, bankruptcy in \nthe system? I will tell you who they were. Let me read the names: \nChairman Bob Kerrey and Vice Chairman John Danforth, two very fine men \nthat I have come to enjoy. Who was on the Commission? I am not going to \nread the titles because the names will be so familiar: Bill Archer; \nDale Bumpers; Mike Castle; Eva Clayton; Thad Cochran; Chris Cox; Kika \nde la Garza; Robert Denham; John Dingell; Pete Domenici; Tom Downey; \nSandra Freedman; Porter Goss; William Gray, former Congressman; Robert \nGreenstein; Judd Gregg; Karen Horn; Tom Kean; Alex McMillan; Carol \nMoseley-Braun; Daniel Patrick Moynihan; Pete Peterson; Harry Reid; Roy \nRomer; Dan Rostenkowski; Martin Sabo; Jim Sasser; Myself; Richard \nTrumka, and Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming. Those are the Members who served \non the Commission. Some did not attend any meetings. I think you might \nbe able to pick out one or two.\n\n  There we were. That is the work we did and we put out this statement. \nIt was signed by all but one of these people. I have shown you the \nremarkable cross-pollinization of the issue with those people that I \njust described and some of them we enjoy and work with every day. Then \nwhy did we sign this--30 of 31 of us? It was because it is a report of \na statement of fact. It is not about ideas, not about ideology, not \nabout partisanship. These are facts.\n  One fact is very evident--and remember we were appointed by our \nPresident--and that one fact is that we are on an unsustainable course. \nWe have locked into the law a huge promise of benefits that far exceed \nour country's ability ever to pay. The unfunded mandates for these \nprograms will simply wipe us away. We all know this to be the case. \nLargely due to the growth of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and \nFederal retirement, this country stands, by the year 2012--now here is \nwhat the report disclosed: That with no increase in revenues--that \nmeans no more taxes, no more, never, never, ever no taxes--and having \ndone a perfect health care bill, which we know would--as we see in our \nvotes with regard to the Kassebaum-Kennedy proposal--be tough to do, \nand ours is presently an incremental approach and has to be--but if we \nwere to do a ``perfect health care bill'' and no further taxes now, and \nof course that would please all of our constituents. Then hear this \nscenario;\n\n  Were this the case then in the year 2012, there will then be only \nsufficient revenue--that is, money--to pay for Medicare, Medicaid, \nSocial Security, Federal retirement, and interest on the national debt. \nThere will be not one penny for transportation, education, defense, \nWIC, WIN, Head Start, NEA, NIH, the National Institutes of Health, or \nanything else in this Government. Remember too--I do so hope the people \nof America can remember that those of us in this body do not even vote \non 67 percent of the national budget. Those of us in the Congress of \nthe United States do not cast a single vote on 67 percent of the \nnational budget. It goes right on out the window, period Automatic \npilot. In 7 years we will not be even casting a vote on 73 percent of \nthe national budget. It will just be going out, being paid out and it \ngoes out regardless. It goes out without regard to means testing or \n``affluence testing.'' It just gets paid out. It goes to people \nregardless of their net worth or their income. Every year that we are \nhere--you have seen it, and I have seen it--we spend our time hacking \naround on the Appropriations Committee on the only things we can find \nthat we can cut, which is defense, education, transportation, WIC, WIN, \nHead Start, and we don't lay a hand on all the things we call \n``mandatory spending.''\n  So we are trapped. We are trapping ourselves daily ever more deeply. \nThese things cannot be sustained. That is the situation which is \nimpervious to ideology, or philosophy. It really does not matter \nwhether your highest priority as an elected Senator is placed on a \nstrong national defense, or on the children, or on vaccinating our \nkids, or the NIH, or the NEA, or roads, or whatever, or veterans, or \nseniors, or whatever it is we most want to do ourselves--or on keeping \nthe size of the Federal Government within reasonable bounds.\n  It is a reality that we cannot escape unless we radically reduce the \ngrowth of the largest entitlement programs.\n  What has been our response? The first response was to leave Social \nSecurity ``off the table''. That is a remarkable thing to do--to leave \noff the table an item that is $360 billion a year, and it is now ``off \nthe table.'' Both Republicans and Democrats did that. If one single \nSenator can demonstrate to me that this was the result of substantive \ncritical analysis rather than political positioning, I would be most \nintrigued to hear the rationale. The truth is we all know better--as we \nadmit in a jocular way to each other when the cameras are not rolling.\n  Let me show you Social Security, the one we left off the table, which \nwe are never supposed to talk about. I do like to talk about it. I take \nthese charts to my town meetings to ward off the gray-haired cat in the \nback of the room. When I ask for a final question, I will often say, \n``I will take a final question from the gray-haired gentleman in the \nback.'' Then the fellow will respond, ``I'd rather have my hair turn \ngray than turn loose,'' which is disturbing, when you look at my \nhairline, that I have to take that kind of terrible abuse.\n\n  So then he will say, ``I put in it from the beginning. Simpson, I \nwant it all out, every bit of it. That is the contract.'' I say, ``By \nGeorge, you are right. I agree with you. You put in from the beginning, \ndid you?'' ``Yes, I did.'' ``Great. Let us then review for everybody \nhere in the town meeting how much you put in because, if you put it in \nit from the beginning''--and any 64-year-old, gray-haired cat like me \ncannot escape this because we all put in the same. ``So, if you put it \nin from the beginning, you never put in over 30 bucks a year for the \nfirst 8 years. And then you never put in over 174 bucks a year for the \nnext 18 years, ladies and gentleman.'' Not one of them did.\n  Then, finally you got stuck 300 bucks a year, 800 bucks a year, \n$1,000 a year, $1,500 a year, $2,000 a year, $3,000 a year, and in the \n1980's, $4,000. Now I think I am putting in $5,000 a year, which is my \nMedicare and Social Security.\n  So when I am all finished up with contributions of payroll tax'' if I \nretire next year at 65, I will have put into the Social Security system \nabout $55,000 in an entire lifetime. I will get it all back in 6\\1/2\\ \nyears. Everybody knows that. Everybody knows that. And if you retired \nin the 1980's, the early 1980's, you got everything back you put in, \nplus interest, in only 2\\1/2\\ years. And those are people who still \nshow up at your town meeting.\n  There is no means test of benefits, no affluence test of their COLA, \nand that\n\n[[Page S3780]]\n\nis the way that is. But take a look at this.\n  This is a chart about me, Alan K. Simpson. This is a blow-up of my \nSocial Security earnings record for a lifetime. It started between 1937 \nand 1950. I went to work at the Cody Bakery at the age of 14; got the \nSocial Security card that year. My particular role in that particular \nconfectionery was to place the pink glob in the midst of that white, \ncrusty sugary business on top of the mushy sweet roll. I have never \ntouched one of those since; never will eat another one of those because \nthat was my job--plop, plop, plop. I was paid $583, to which I coughed \nup a real chunk into Social Security--5 bucks that year. The next year \nhe paid me less--for they found what I had been doing with the \nconfectioneries.\n  Then I went off to the University of Wyoming and paid nothing because \nI never earned over $3,600 in a summer. I worked every summer, but I \nnever earned $3,600. Remember, ladies and gentleman, you could make a \nmillion bucks, but you never paid anything over this lid here. So, if \nyou made 40,000 bucks this year, you never paid any Social Security \nover $4,800 in this year. Then they slowly raised that through the \nyears.\n\n  So, anyway, I finished the Army, finished college, went on to \npractice law, and in the first year of practice when my father took all \nthe money and I did all the work, I put in 42 bucks--42 bucks. I made a \nlittle over $1,600.\n  Then, in the most productive years of my life to that point, for 18 \nyears of practicing law, I never put in over 816 bucks a year. Nobody \nelse did either. Not one person in this country put in any more in \nthose years as a self-employed person than 816 bucks a year.\n  That is where we are. And you are telling us that this is \nsustainable? How absurd. But it is ``off the table.'' The biggest \ngorilla in the jungle is now off the table.\n  So, then, finally I came here in 1979, and put 615 bucks into Social \nSecurity that first year. Then the next year, 951. Then, you know. \nThere it is--in 1989. My total contribution was $2,980. So was it for \neverybody else in America; period. So, if you total it all up, over a \nlifetime it is about $55,000.\n  Now here is the slot machine handle. Here is what I will get, and so \nwill anybody else my age. This is my estimate of benefits. This is a \nphotocopy of the document directly from the Social Security \nAdministration. Thank Heaven they are sending this to people now. It is \ngoing out automatically to people. Millions of copies are going out \nthanks again to Senator Moynihan. We owe him a great deal.\n  We owe him a great deal because, do not forget, he was very involved \nin the blue ribbon commission that met in the early 1980's and said to \nus all: We can save Social Security with a deft blend of payroll taxes \nand some other changes, and if we do--and we all voted on it--if we do, \nit will save the Social Security System until the year 2063.\n  Do you remember that? I hope you all do. Because now we are told by \nthe trustees of the system that Social Security can only now be saved \nuntil the year 2029. So from 1983 to 1996, we have compressed the drop \ndead date from 2063 to 2029, and everybody knows it. Everybody knows \nit.\n  So if I were to retire at age 65, I will receive $1,170 a month. But \nif I wait until age 70, I will get $1,555 per month, with a life \nexpectancy of--well, it is cheerful news. My father lived to be 95, my \nmother 94, my grandmother 100. I will be rolling and rolling over in \nit, and it will not matter what my net worth or income is. Then also \nadd to it a COLA every year.\n  Does anybody within the range of my voice believe this is a \nsustainable system? It is not. Senator Kerrey and I are trying to \nrestore long-term solvency to this system, because it will be broke in \nthe year 2029, and will begin to go broke in the year 2012 when we \nstart cashing in the bonds and Treasury securities.\n  Remember, ladies and gentlemen--and please do not lob anything--there \nis no Social Security trust fund. There is no such fund. You know it. I \nknow it. All we have is what Franklin Delano Roosevelt as President and \nthe Congress set for us, which is this: That if there is any surplus, \nany surplus at all in the Social Security funds, it must be invested in \nsecurities of the United States, backed by the full faith and credit of \nthe U.S. Treasury. So when there are reserves, the Treasury purchases T \nbills, savings bonds, whatever. Some of those are purchased by those of \nus in this body. They are purchased by banks. By other Americans. The \ninterest on those securities is not paid out of some kitty called the \nSocial Security trust fund. It is paid out by the General Treasury, \nladies and gentlemen. We all know that. Everybody knows that. We do not \n``steal'' from the Social Security trust fund and in profligate ways \njust poof it on down the street. We do not do that. But we go back to \nthe town meeting and they will say, ``Now, that's what you did. You \nstole from the Social Security trust fund and blew it. You never put it \nback.'' I said, ``My friend, there was nothing there to blow.'' It is a \nseries of IOU's that would stack to the top of this Chamber.\n  It is all good stuff. It is good financial paper, but it is not--it \nis not--some kind of separate fund. If it was a separate fund, it would \nbe, right now, over $220 billion. Do you think we would leave that \nuntouched if we could find our way into it? Of course not.\n\n  The thing about it is that those reserves could reach $2 trillion \nbefore the year 2012, but then when we get to the year 2012, that is \nit. That is it, because there will not be enough revenue coming in to \ntake care of the monthly payments going out--period, nothing.\n  This is a pay-as-you-go system. It has nothing to do with a rolling \ntrust fund or anything else. The people who are paying their Social \nSecurity payroll tax in today, that tax is going right out this month \nto senior citizens regardless of their net worth or their income.\n  Now, that is the way it is, and the sooner we get to dealing quite \nhonestly with what this system is, I think we might have some semblance \nof ability to get out of it.\n  Then came the proposal to reduce the growth in Medicare below \ncatastrophic rates--not ``cut'' it, but to slow the growth in the way \nthat every objective analysis has shown that we must. The President was \nsuggesting slowing the rate of growth when he dealt with his very \ncontroversial health care plan which was defeated. The President then \nlater talked about letting Medicare go up 7.6 percent or 7.8.\n  I admired that. I said that at the time. Republicans are trying to \nlet it to go up 6.4. The President might be at 7 now. We are not that \nfar apart. That gap could be closed very well. We could close that gap \nbecause both the President and the Congress know that we must slow the \ngrowth in Medicare. Because why? Who is telling us all this bizarre \nbusiness? The people telling us this bizarre business are the trustees \nof the Social Security and Medicare Programs. Slowing the growth in the \nway that every objective analysis has shown us that we must.\n  Are we going to get a severe political lesson from that one, an \nexample of what the Washington Post had called ``Medagoguing?'' \nPresident Clinton and too many others of us, Republicans and Democrats, \nhave decided to run for office this November on the assertion that we \nare saving America from ``cuts'' in Medicare while at the same time \n``behind the scenes'' every single one of us agrees somewhat on what \nkind of target needs to be hit to bring Medicare within reasonable \nbounds. We all know that. As a consequence, what have we accomplished? \nNot much on the Medicare front. That spending continues to spiral \nupwards unabated.\n  Get this one. A few weeks ago what were we told? A little \nmiscalculation there. Instead of a surplus of $4.2 billion that month \nin Medicare, we found a $37 million deficit. That is the trustees \ntelling us this too. It was startling to them. So maybe Medicare will \nnot go broke in 2002; it will only go broke in 2001.\n\n  But do not forget this. If the Republicans get away with all these \nterrible tricks and do everything that we have proposed to do to \nbalance the budget in 7 years, and do it, Medicare will not go broke in \n2002; it will go broke in 2010. What a deal. What a deal that we have \n``balanced the budget'' and Medicare will not go broke in 2002; it will \ngo broke in 2010. Everybody knows that. Everybody.\n  So as the spending continues to spiral upwards unabated, the only \nreal accomplishment of the exercise possibly will be to elect some new \nlegislators who have pledged on their highest\n\n[[Page S3781]]\n\nhonor to stop any cruel efforts to ever deal with that silly problem \nagain. Oh no, we will not do that one again, because obviously too many \npeople got beat when they tried to do that.\n  Then I do have this other document here which is worth everyone's \nattention. It is a little yellow booklet entitled, ``Status of the \nSocial Security and Medicare Programs.'' It comes to us from the Board \nof Trustees of Social Security, and those persons are three of the \nPresident's Cabinet, Robert Rubin, Robert Reich, Donna Shalala; and \nShirley Chater, Stanford Ross, and David Walker.\n  Then let me read this from page 11 in the section entitled ``Need For \nAction.'' Remember, these are the trustees of the system, the stewards \nof the system telling us this:\n\n       During the past 5 years, there has been a trend of \n     deterioration in the long-range conditions of the Social \n     Security and Medicare Programs and an acceleration in the \n     projected dates of exhaustion in the related trust funds.\n\n  I paraphrase what the words ``projected dates of exhaustion'' mean--\nthat is, going flat broke is what that means.\n  And further then:\n\n       To some extent, the increasingly adverse projections have \n     come from unforeseen events and from the absence of prompt \n     action in response to clear warnings that changes are \n     necessary. These adverse trends can be expected to continue \n     and indicate the possibility of a future retirement crisis. \n     We urge that concerted action be taken promptly to address \n     the critical public policy issues raised by the financing \n     projection for these programs.\n\n  To repeat the line I found most interesting: This situation arises \n``from the absence of prompt action in response to clear warnings that \nchanges are necessary.''\n  In other words, we know fully that we must act, and yet we refuse, \nout of political fear, to do so. That, to my mind, is well defined as \nirresponsibility, or as akin to chickens, as I have patterned upon my \ntie here. I wore this appropriately today. These are chickens that I \ntry to show to people between 18 and 40, so that they know that they \nwill be picking grit with the chickens when they are 65 and that they \nmust get in this game and figure out what is going to happen to them. \nThat is why I wear this beautifully patterned haberdashery.\n  I could go on, but I can see my colleagues rising and heaving at \ntheir desks. My colleagues have heard me speak on this issue before. \nPerhaps somewhat tiring is the message. But remember this. It will not \nwork to say Simpson is off the rail, or easy for him to say, he is not \nrunning, because I have said these things back in time immemorial, \nevery time I ran. But I assure you I, too, am tiring of the inaction. \nIf we want to be spared the alarm bells that will be coming in this \narea, all we need do is meet our responsibility to our citizenry and \ncast the tough votes to correct these problems. I have heard that one, \ntoo. Do not think I have not cast these politically correct votes, too, \nas a chicken. I have done that. But we will not get there by enacting \ntax cuts. That was something the President wanted, something we wanted. \nI was ready to go for capital gains. I will still go over the cliff, \nbut we will not get there by doing that.\n  We will not get there by increasing the minimum wage. We will not get \nthere with line-item veto. We will not get there by getting rid of \nfraud and abuse. That will not get you there. More of it. The only way \nyou get there is to deal with Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, \nFederal retirement--period. All other is true fiction.\n  And we will not get there by saying we are going to slavishly posture \nto protect Social Security from the balanced budget amendment and thus \nlet it go bankrupt on its own. We will not get there by giving out more \nmoney to employed seniors with no affluence test, and I voted for that \none, too. We will get there only by slowing the growth of spending to \nthe point where revenues can keep the pace, and that is it, \nsubstantively. That is very difficult politically. That is, alone, why \nit does not happen.\n  Finally, I just could not let this go by. I have a new missive from \nthe remarkable group, the National Committee to Preserve Social \nSecurity and Medicare. These people are something, they really are, not \nquite as slick as the AARP, but nearly. Do not forget the AARP is \nsimply a group of 33 million Americans bound tightly together by a \ncommon love of airline discounts and automobile discounts and pharmacy \ndiscounts, and they are really a rugged and remarkable group. They are. \nThey live in poverty downtown here in a building they lease for $17 \nmillion a year--$17 million a year. They have about $345 million in T-\nbills in the bank and rake in about $106 million a year from Prudential \nInsurance Co., getting 3 percent of the premiums on the MediGap \npolicies.\n\n  And guess who helped kill off any reform and helped stall the \nGovernment? Do not miss this one. You remember why we shut down the \nGovernment? One of the reasons is because part B--a totally voluntary \nprogram--premiums in Medicare were going to go up $7 a month. Some \nsaid, ``We cannot have that.'' So the AARP rose in high indignation, \nthen helped kill that off, and, at the same time, they watched the \nincrease in the MediGap monthly insurance policies they placed with \nPrudential go up 31 bucks a month--all while they killed off the \nability for us to say that those who have more should pay more for part \nB premiums--like $7 a month.\n  You have a current situation in America about which every thoughtful \nAmerican must scratch his or her head. Part B premiums are paid, 25 \npercent by the beneficiary and 75 percent by the people working here in \nthe Senate kitchen. Those folks pay 75 percent of the premium for us, \nor for anyone else, regardless of their net worth or their income. And \nwe cannot even change that.\n  So here is AARP, through Prudential raising their own premiums $31 a \nmonth while they are killing off a program in America to raise it $7 a \nmonth on something which is totally voluntary. You do not want anything \nto do with a group like that. Yes, I know people stay in AARP because \nyou can get a room at Westin Hotel for $80 instead of $140--I know \nthose things--and the senior discounts here and there and at the \nmovies. I know those things. I do not want to detract. I am a member. I \nam using some of those.\n  But here is this new one, just this little one from this remarkable \ngroup, regarding the type of political pressure I am talking about. \nThis is the most recent mailing from one of our most intriguing senior \ncitizen organizations, the National Committee to Preserve Social \nSecurity and Medicare. It is labeled as ``The 1996 Benefit Cut Impact \nSurvey.'' Very interesting stuff.\n  Question 1: ``After promising never to touch Social Security, many \npolitical leaders in Washington are discussing proposals that will \nresult in smaller Social Security COLA's, making it impossible for your \nbenefits to keep pace with the real inflation you experience.'' This is \nbest described--in the West, we would have a different term, a \ndifferent, perhaps, appellation for it--it is a lie right off the bat. \nBecause no one is talking about taking COLA's below the true size of \ninflation--nobody, not a soul.\n  Next question, ``Should your congressional representatives pose any \nmeasure that would result in lower Social Security COLA's?''\n\n  Oh, that one should not be too difficult to answer for the citizen \nthat receives it. It is a rather brazen appeal to the recipient's \nfinancial self-interest without any accompanying discussion about the \ncountry as a whole and it skillfully say the seeds for wrath to be \nexpressed subsequently at the ballot box. That is very important, that \nyou do that when these mailings go out.\n  Question 2: ``If such COLA legislation goes through, would you \nsupport your national committee in an all-out campaign to repeal it?''\n  That is pretty easy to understand, I think, pretty easy. Another way \nof saying it is: ``Will this committee be able to bilk you out of more \ncontributed bucks to our organization as compensation for raining \npolitical threats down upon the bald or hirsute domes of those in \nWashington and environs?''\n  Question 4: ``If a balanced budget amendment, one that did not \nprotect the Social Security trust funds, came to a vote in Congress \nthis session, would you urge your elected representatives in Congress \nto oppose it?'' How nice. We have seen that campaign brought to the \nfloor of the Senate several times, the use of the Social Security ``hot \nbutton'' as a means of derailing the balanced budget amendment.\n\n[[Page S3782]]\n\n And it worked. It was also marvelously done when we repealed \ncatastrophic health care. If we had done that 1 year ago, we would not \nbe in this box today. And the AARP, although they say they never did \nhave any official fingerprints on that, I mean, it looked like the \nAbominable Snowman footprint when you got right down underneath it \nall--much more than a fingerprint, a giant track, a gaping hole, a \ncrevasse in the ice. And there they were, then, and it worked, and it \ncontinues to be a source of political agitation to this day and on into \nthe future.\n  So this--and I conclude my remarks--this mailing is but one example \nof the cottage industries which have sprung up all over this country \nwhich aim to drain the Treasury of everything they can get by whipping \ncredulous Americans and senior citizen into a frenzy and scaring \nelected representatives half to death. It matters not that these \nmailings are filled with sophistry and distortion and emotion and \nobfuscation. What matters is that they have a political impact and \nraise big bucks, and too many here are afraid to buck the tide which \nthey produce.\n  By the way, I should note that the final request on page 6 of this \nmissive is for additional bucks, for the poor, ragged committee, a \ncurious way to protect the meager finances of the poor senior citizens, \nis it not? Asking them to give up $10 of their hard-earned Social \nSecurity money for this committee's sake? And one effect of term \nlimits, in its most succinct form, is the one effect it would hopefully \nhave on organizations like this, who are dedicated, apparently, to the \nbankruptcy of our country, is that it is very likely such groups would \nvanish without a trace. And no one would miss them.\n\n  Then lacking any substantive basis for their position and lacking any \nfurther clout stemming from political fear, what reason would still \npersist for their existence? I can bet you that the national committee \nhere is not too excited about term limits legislation. They would find \nit far more effective to frighten legislators, simply continue to do \nit, to do their bidding. What a bunch. Martha and Max should be \nashamed, but I can tell you they are not.\n  So, I am very pleased to support my colleague, Senator Thompson, with \nhis initiative.\n  I, of course, have been forcing my own brand of term limitations this \nyear by retiring from Washington and going on to other work. But it is \nextremely refreshing and like a splash of mountain spring water not to \nhave concerns about November mixed in with one's vote recommendations. \nI can say to you, it is a rare tonic which I recommend in large doses \nto the entirety of the House and the Senate, and I believe if we enact \nthis measure, we will have taken one significant step toward resolving \nsome of the largest, greatest and most serious challenges facing this \ncountry.\n  We all know it, we like these jobs; we want to continue. None of \nthese critical things I describe will be done without a term limit. \nNone. After it kicks in, I can only say one-third of the U.S. Senate \nwill be voting right every time, and the Democrats or Republicans who \nare leading this body at that time will be able to find those other 18 \nto get the 51 votes to do the Nation's business. I think that is a very \nimportant thing to do, is to be about the Nation's business and not \njust continue to be assailed and hammered flat by the groups who are so \nskilled at peddling fear, but ever more skilled at raising bucks, as \nthey terrify the American senior citizens.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I think that I may be the first person \ntoday to speak against this resolution, but let me say, first of all, I \nam delighted to do so. It is, admittedly, a freebie. You can vote for \nit in the absolute certainty that it is going nowhere, and you can send \nout your newsletters and press releases and tell your constituents that \nyou did your best.\n  I have heard a lot of speakers this afternoon say, ``Well, this is \npopular with the American people.'' Slavery was once popular also, but \nI don't hear any of my colleagues arguing that slavery was a good idea.\n  Prohibition was also once popular. Do you know what we got out of \nprohibition because it was popular? Organized crime, and that is all we \ngot out of prohibition. Organized crime is still ensconced as part of \nour society because we voted for a constitutional amendment because it \nwas popular.\n  In my State of Arkansas in 1992 the voters approved term limits, by a \n60-40 margin, for both State and Federal officers. As you know, the \nSupreme Court, by a very narrow vote of 5 to 4, ruled that the people \nof Arkansas did not have the right to limit the terms of Federal \nofficials which had been set by the Constitution. It is still in \neffect.\n  Interestingly, while 60 percent of the voters of Arkansas were voting \nby a 60-percent margin for term limits, they reelected me to a fourth \nterm by a margin of 60 percent. You can only conclude that it is all \nthose other guys who they are wanting to get rid of. I do not quarrel \nwith the popularity of this proposition with the American people. They \nhave a right to favor it. But I also want to say that one of the \nbiggest responsibilities Members of Congress have is to be an educator \nas well as a legislator, and I have never passed up the opportunity at \na Rotary Club or a chamber of commerce banquet to express my \nunalterable opposition to term limits. It is not meant to demean, it is \nmeant to give people a side that they never hear at the coffee shop and \nwhy I think it is a bad idea, why Alexander Hamilton thought it was a \nbad idea, and why the Founding Fathers dismissed it almost summarily.\n  People have a right to believe something is a good idea, but I have \nan obligation, if I happen to disagree with that, to try my very best \nto educate them, at least to an alternative view.\n  This whole idea is based on the assumption that every man and woman \nwho seeks public office does so, not to serve the public good, not to \npromote a national agenda, which is good for our people, but to feather \nhis own nest, to pursue a personal agenda. ``You just cannot trust \nthose people in the U.S. Senate for more than 12 years, because you \ngive them 13 years and they lose all of their integrity, all of their \ninterest in the national good.''\n\n  Unhappily, occasionally somebody around here proves that to be true. \nSomebody proves himself to be dishonest or unethical or just a lousy \nMember of Congress. But I tell you, Mr. President, the vast majority of \nthe 535 Members of Congress are honest, they are ethical, they are hard \nworking and they are fighting for what they believe is in our national \ninterest.\n  Ethics has become a very big issue around here. Most secretaries and \noffice managers keep the Ethics Committee on autodial. So intent are \nthey in complying with arcane rules that a lot of people around here do \nnot understand, and the ethics manual gets thicker and thicker each \nyear.\n  In 1960, 70 percent of the people in this country said they had quite \na bit of confidence in Congress. In 1960, while 70 percent of the \npeople were saying they had quite a bit of confidence in Congress, \nMembers of Congress could take a $100,000 contribution in $100 bills \nand did not have to report it to anybody.\n  Members of Congress could make a speech and take $5,000 in honoraria \nand did not have to report it to anybody. They could practice law. They \ncould take the people who came into their offices soliciting their \nfavors, lobbyists and could refer them to their law firms back home and \nthen share in the profits of that law firm that fall. And 70 percent of \nthe people in this country thought things in Washington were just \nhunky-dory, because they did not know it.\n  Today, the ethics manual grows thicker and thicker, to the point that \npeople are afraid to take an insulated coffee mug from the Rotary Club, \nand you dare not risk allowing anybody to buy you a dinner for fear \nthat it might exceed $50, if you are a Senator, or any amount if you \nare a House Member.\n  Every Member must file an ethics report of what stock he owns, the \nvalue of it, where his income came from last year. It is all there, and \nthe press microscopically examines it every year, and it is \nappropriate. That is the way it ought to be.\n  So today, you have to report every significant contribution made to \nyour campaign and lay bare your own personal net worth. And you cannot \nreceive honoraria for any speeches that you give. And today, 1996, 23 \npercent of\n\n[[Page S3783]]\n\nthe people of this country have quite a bit of confidence in Congress.\n  Can you imagine the people in this Chamber voting aye on this \nresolution, and essentially saying, ``You're right.'' I will be a good, \ndecent, ethical, honest Senator for 12 years. But if you elect me to a \nthird term, look out, I'm going to be uncontrollable. If you allow me 6 \nmore years, don't count on anything.''\n\n  That is what we are saying here. I cannot be trusted with more than \n12 years in this body. What we are engaged in here is the height of \npandering. This is not a serious debate. If it were, why would the \nmanager of the resolution offer immediately seven amendments which are \nidentical to the resolution to make sure that no Senator can offer an \namendment to improve the resolution?\n  That is right. We are going to talk about this resolution until 2:15 \ntomorrow afternoon. We are going to have a cloture vote, and cloture is \ngoing to fail miserably. Everybody here knows it is going to fail \nmiserably. Everybody knows this is a freebie.\n  Do you know something else? Of the 45 Senators that voted for Senator \nAshcroft's resolution in support of term limits last year, 25 of them \nhave been here longer than two terms, which is what this resolution \nwould deal with. Do you know why else they filled the tree? To keep \nanybody from offering an amendment to it, because they knew that \nSenator Leahy or I would offer an amendment to make the term-limits \nresolution apply to terms already served.\n  They did not want any of that retroactive stuff. You have been here \nfive terms, and you are hot for term limits? Of course you do not want \nit to be retroactive so you cannot even run again.\n  I do not mean this personally because I admire him and I like him and \nI consider him my friend. The senior Senator from South Carolina will \nbe eligible for four more terms if this resolution were to pass and it \ntook 7 years for the people of this country to adopt it--four more. He \nwould be 117. I would be eligible for three more terms.\n  Oh, it has all been carefully crafted to take care of those who have. \nWe have a saying in Arkansas ``them what has, gets.'' Oh, it is very \npopular. You know, when you are standing before an audience and there \nis a question: ``Senator, how do you feel about an amendment to the \nConstitution to balance the budget?''\n  ``I'm for that.''\n  ``How do you feel about flag burning?''\n  ``You bet. Count me in.''\n  ``Well, how about term limits?''\n  ``You bet. I'm for term limits.''\n  It is so easy to agree with what you know is popular among the group \nyou happen to be speaking to.\n  I saw a story the other day in the Hill newspaper discussing how the \nRepublicans requested that term limit supporters not punish the junior \nSenator from Kentucky because he is adamantly opposed to this \nresolution. I guess only the Democrat opponents of term limits are \nworthy of criticism.\n  You think about even considering punishing somebody for the courage \nof their convictions. The proponents of term limits say that is the \nreason they want it, so people will be courageous and stand up for what \nthey believe.\n  Mr. President, do you know what a courageous vote is? It is an \nunpopular vote. If it were not unpopular, it would not be courageous. \nSo the people say, ``If we limit them to 12 years, they will be \ncourageous knowing they cannot run again. If we won't let them run \nagain after 12 years, they are going to be statesmen. They will say \nwhat they really believe. And they are going to say courageous things. \nThey are going to be men of principle.''\n  Here is what Alexander Hamilton said about that in Federalist paper \nNo. 72:\n\n       There are few men who would not feel much less zeal in the \n     discharge of a duty when they were conscious that the \n     advantage of the station with which it was connected must be \n     relinquished at a determinant period, than when they were \n     permitted to entertain a hope of obtaining, by meriting, a \n     continuation of them.\n\n  That is right. Let them stand for reelection on the merits of their \npast 6 years' performance. Do not pass some kind of undemocratic \nnonsense saying the people do not have enough sense to know who they \nwant to vote for.\n\n  I daresay, my colleague, Senator Pryor, would probably have run \nwithout opposition this time if he chose to run again. But if he had an \nopponent, I can tell you he would have won overwhelmingly. Do you know \nwhy? Because he has been a man of conviction, he has been a man of \ncourage, he has not jumped under his desk every time the National Rifle \nAssociation issued a press release. He has talked sense to his people. \nAnd they love him for it. And Alexander Hamilton says that is what \nMembers of Congress are supposed to do. Why take away that right of the \npeople to elect whomever they choose?\n  What was the origin of term limits? Let me tell you, I have so many \nfriends on the other side, I do not like to describe them in terms of \npartisanship a lot of times--but I think organizations, many times \nultraconservative organizations, have made up their minds that the \nDemocrats were never, never going to lose control of Congress if we did \nnot have term limits. So it became fashionable.\n  Congress was losing credibility and respect and prestige with the \npeople all along. As I said, down to 23 percent. So they said, ``We \nbelieve we can sell this constitutional amendment to limit people to 12 \nyears in the Senate and 6 or 12 years in the House.'' So what happened? \nThe American people said, we will decide for ourselves. The two \nSenators--one from Tennessee and one from Arizona--are sitting here and \nare the beneficiaries of the American people saying, ``We're tired of \nthe Democrats. We're going to give the Republicans a chance.'' That is \nthe reason those Senators were elected in 1994. That is what is called \nterm limits, allowing the people to vote. They just did it. I \npersonally hope the American people are not happy with their decision, \nbut in any event that is their call, not mine.\n  Mr. President, I think about some of the greatest Senators this body \nhas ever had, who would not even be an asterisk in the history books if \nthey had been limited to 12 years. When I came to the U.S. Senate, Abe \nRibicoff, Jack Javits, Cliff Case, Jim Pearson, Scoop Jackson, Ed \nMuskie, Hubert Humphrey, on and on the list goes of truly great \nSenators, Republican and Democrat, that would be a footnote in the \nhistory books if this thing had been on the books.\n  Finally, let me just close by expressing my utter contempt for trying \nto solve every single problem from whether drinking water ought to be \non the Senator's desk, to term limits, by an amendment to the \nConstitution. There are a few people in this body who apparently feel \nthe Constitution is just a rough draft for them to finish up. I am one \nof those people who believe that Hamilton, Adams, Ben Franklin, James \nMadison, and the other Framers was the greatest assemblage of minds \never under one roof in the history of the world, who produced the \ndocument second only in its powerfulness to the Holy Bible.\n  I do not vote often for constitutional amendments. I am not saying I \nnever would. All this nonsense that comes through this place--``Let's \namend the Constitution,'' think about it. Over 17,000 efforts to amend \nthe Constitution since 1789--17,000, count them. Taking the Bill of \nRights out, the first 10 amendments which were adopted almost as part \nof the Constitution, and the American people, out of those 17,000 \nefforts, have chosen to amend the Constitution 18 times. You take \nprohibition which was ratified in the late 1920's, and the repeal of \nprohibition, take those two out, and the people of this country have \ntinkered with the Constitution 16 times out of 17,000 to 18,000 \nresolutions offered since 1789. There have been 83 amendments \nintroduced in this Congress, and 2,000 since I came to the Senate. How \ncan we conclude that Members of the Congress do not think the \nConstitution is just a rough draft, when they treat it with such \ncontempt?\n  As I said a moment ago, who likes flag burning? I do not. But it is \npresented in political terms. It is not presented the way things were \npresented in Philadelphia 206 years ago. It is always politics.\n  Let me digress just a moment to say I have been reading a book by \nJames Fallows called ``Breaking the News: How the Media is Undermining \nAmerican Democracy,'' and he makes this point, that if you watch ``Face \nthe Nation,'' ``Meet the Press,'' and David\n\n[[Page S3784]]\n\nBrinkley on Sunday morning, you hear how well Medicare or Medicaid is \nworking. Do you hear anything about the environment and how it is \nworking and the new regulations coming out of EPA? No, those are policy \ndecisions. For a writer to write about a policy, that writer has to go \nto the stacks and do some work, find out the history of them. Why do we \nhave Medicaid? Because we do not want elderly people laying in the \nstreets, we do not want children without health care--a policy decision \nthat was debated a very long time here before we adopted Medicaid \npolicy. Why do we have school lunches? So children are not hungry. Why \ndo we have food stamps? So nobody is hungry. We did not do that willy-\nnilly. That was debated in the Senate. We adopted it as a policy, as a \ngreat nation who believes in trying to help people.\n  So when you hear all the gurus on the Sunday morning talk shows: \n``What do you think about block grants? Do you think that will help \nBill Clinton or hurt him? Do you think that will help Bob Dole or hurt \nhim?'' Not a question of whether the States can do a better job \nadministering it. Will they comply with the policy we made that we do \nnot want children to go without health care, we do not want the elderly \nto be lying on the streets, we want them taken care of in nursing \nhomes? No, you do not hear that. It is the politics of this issue. So \nit is with this.\n  What is the politics of it? Well, you do not have to be brilliant to \nknow what the politics of this is. If you want to go home and tell the \ntownhall meeting and the chamber of commerce and Rotary Club, if you \nwant them to stand up and clap, you vote ``aye.'' If you took your oath \nwhen you came here to perfect and defend the Constitution of the United \nStates against all kinds of assaults on it, vote ``no.''\n  I promise you, when the people of this country voted the way they did \nin 1994, they were not saying they wanted to turn their back on the \nenvironment. They were saying they did want the budget balanced, but \nthey did not say they wanted to cut educational funds, because the one \nthing people in this country would still vote taxes for is for the \neducation of their children. They did not say they wanted Medicare \nwhacked, though everybody knows Medicare is going to have to be \nreformed. Be honest about it and talk sense about it.\n\n  Mr. President, this will be the last time we will address term limits \nfor some time to come and get it off the agenda. Everybody knows it is \ngoing nowhere, but everybody can go home and say they did their best. \nBut they did not. They did their worst. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am sorry that my friend from Arkansas \nthinks that this is such a partisan debate. This is my second day in \nthe midst of this debate, and until a few minutes ago I had not known \nit was.\n  If my colleague had been following closely, he would have heard a \ndiscussion by several Members of this body, some of whom are new to the \nbody, some of whom have been here for a while, who are greatly \nconcerned about the future of their country and are struggling for \nmeans and methods to do something about it. He would have heard that \nthe bipartisan commission, which my friend from Arkansas is a member \nof, reported that in 2030 to bring the deficit down to its currents \nlevel, either all Federal taxes would have to be increased by 85 \npercent or all Federal spending programs would have to be cut in half. \nThat by 2012, mandatory spending and interest and entitlements will \nexceed all Federal revenues, leaving no money for the Federal \nGovernment to spend on programs like education, law enforcement, \nresearch and development, national defense, health research and all the \nother programs he mentioned. By 2030, entitlement spending alone is \nexpected to exceed all Federal revenue.\n  That is what this debate is about. I find it unfortunate that certain \nMembers who choose this particular occasion to exhibit courage to stand \nagainst the overwhelming will of the people will not address the true \nnature of this debate and what is happening to this country. It is \nequated with slavery. Term limits, I heard just a few minutes ago on \nthis floor, being equated with slavery. That is how much some Members \nwant to cling to their profession, as professional politicians.\n  I heard that no amendment, no amendment ever is a good idea. I assume \nthat would include the 13th amendment which abolished slavery. I hope \nwe would have all been for that. I wish the strong stands on principle \nhad resulted over the past few decades and some hope for the next \ngeneration, instead of bankruptcy and total loss by the American people \nin the confidence of the legislative branch of Government, which is \nexactly what we have today. It may not go anywhere because everybody is \nhunkered down in their offices, feeling confident that their \ncolleagues, when it comes right down to it, will not vote for term \nlimits.\n  Yes, they can stand in the face of the will of 75 percent of the \nAmerican people, because at a time when we rush to get the American \npeople's opinion on everything and anything that comes across the \nhorizon, in this particular case, we will stand firm against it as a \nmatter of principle. Yes, we can be confident when it comes right down \nto it. We may not have the votes, because there is only one thing worse \nthan risking the wrath of the American people on term limits. It is \njust one issue. That thing is actually putting your career in \njeopardy. That is what it is. That is not what our Founding Fathers \nenvisioned. We can quote Alexander Hamilton, but Alexander Hamilton, \nthat aristocrat, that Federalist, wanted lifetime tenure for Senators. \nSo I can see why some of my colleagues might want to line up with him.\n\n  This is not based on the assumption that Members of Congress and \nMembers of the Senate are only interested in feathering their own \nnests. This is not a get-even strategy, and not something that is mean \nspirited to get at people. We all have Members whom we admire. As I \nsaid earlier, I sat in the lobby and watched, as a boy, what went on in \nthis body. I had the opportunity to serve with Senator Sam Ervin of \nNorth Carolina and Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee as I was counsel \non the Watergate committee many years ago. I did not go through what it \ntook to get here to become a member of a body that I had no respect \nfor. What I am trying to do is to try to help get that body back to the \nlevel of esteem with the American people that the American people once \nhad for that body.\n  When my colleague points out that, once upon a time, we had no ethics \nrules, we could take money and do lectures and all these things; yet, \n70 percent of the people approved of Congress. Now we have all these \nethics rules and nobody approves of Congress. To me, that demonstrates \nthat it is not matters of ethics rules that are concerning the American \npeople. The low esteem they have for us has to do with other things. \nThose other things have to do with the fact that just like Senator \nSimpson said, we are bankrupting the Nation, Mr. President. We are \nbankrupting the Nation, and just because we get used to hearing it \nmakes it no less true.\n  Yet, we hear on and on and on again about these favorite programs \nthat we cannot touch. No, I agree; this is the reason for the abysmal \ndecline of confidence of the American people, barely above, according \nto some surveys, 12 percent approval--only law firms had lower at 11 \npercent approval--by the American people. We want to stand up and be \nproud of these last few decades and all the people who have served, \nproud of what we have done as an institution, and all the people who \nwould not have been able to serve if we had not had the system that we \nhave now.\n  What about those 250 million people who have no hope of serving under \nthe system that we have now? To my colleague, it may be inconsistent \nfor his State to pass term limits and reelect him. To me, it is not. We \nhave a closed system, whereby, regardless of the disgust the American \npeople have with the Congress of the United States, or the distrust \nthey have, or the feeling of revulsion, even, according to some of \nthese surveys, we get reelected at a 90 percent rate. Does that have to \ndo with some schizophrenia in the American people, or does it have to \ndo with the fact that the incumbents get all the money? Most people \nwith good judgment do not even try to break into a system like that. He \nmentioned my colleague from Arizona and myself as being a part of the \nsystem. I believe those were both open seats. If those seats had not \nbeen open and we knew we were going to have to go against a\n\n[[Page S3785]]\n\nwell-entrenched incumbent, the decision might have been different \nbecause the odds are not good.\n  In the 1950's, a vote was taken on who the best five Senators in \nhistory were. Five Members were voted the best, and their portraits \nadorn the reception room of the Senate. These are Webster, Calhoun, \nClay, La Follette, and Taft. Only one of these great Senators served \nmore than two full terms--Senator La Follette.\n  So let us not worry too much about the proposition that it takes 20 \nyears in order to make an impact in this body. We know different. We \nknow different. We heard yesterday from the Senator from Vermont and \ntoday from the Senator from Arkansas. The basic criticism, as I \nunderstand it, of this constitutional amendment--which they vigorously \noppose--is that it does not go far enough. They would be for \nretroactivity; that this is not real term limits. They want real term \nlimits, and they are concerned they are not going to get a vote on \nthat. The reason we filled up the tree, of course, was the fact that \nthe Senator from Arkansas and his colleagues wanted to add amendments \ntotally unrelated to term limits so we would never get a true vote on \nterm limits. Everybody knows that.\n  Mr. President, I just urge, as this debate goes on, hopefully, we can \nshed a little more light on the subject than heat. Hopefully, we can \nkeep it from being a partisan issue. It should not be a partisan issue. \nThose young kids coming up today, and those yet to be born, are going \nto be Democrats and Republicans. It does not matter what party we are a \nmember of or what party they are going to be members of. They are going \nto bear the consequences of the system we have now. We do not have the \npolitical will to do the things that we know we have to do to save this \nNation from bankruptcy. We do not have the political will because, as \nSenator Simpson said, it is fear. It is stark fear of having to do \nsomething else for a living. We are willing to put our own professional \ncareers ahead of the welfare of the next generation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to continue our discussion of \nSenate Resolution 21, a constitutional amendment providing for a limit \nof six terms in the House and two in the Senate. As a freshman Senator \nwho came directly from the private practice of medicine, I believe \nstrongly that Washington would not be out of touch with average \nAmericans if Members of Congress were not permitted to make a career \nout of serving in Congress, and instead came to Washington to serve \nonly for a time, and then return to live under the laws they passed.\n  More than 200 years ago, the Founders of this great Nation fought and \nwon a war that replaced a tyrannical, permanent government in London \nwith a democratic Republic where the people, not an aristocracy, rule. \nJames Madison wrote in Federalist 10 of his concern about the influence \nspecial interests--he called them factions would have if Members of \nCongress were permitted to remain in office for too long. He argued \nthat without the regular rotation of citizens into and out of elected \noffice, those elected would put the interests of the well-connected \nahead of the interests of the country.\n  Mr. President, Madison was right. Unfortunately, the Constitutional \nConvention in 1787 did not adopt Madison's approach. Why? Not because \nthe Convention attendees believed in political careerism--they had just \nfought a war against a permanent government back in England. They did \nnot include term limits on Congress because they felt it was \nunnecessary. Who would want to stay in Congress for year after year, \ntraveling back and forth on horseback to this city, which was literally \nin the middle of a swamp, without a staff, without air conditioning, \nwithout an office, for a tiny salary, with no pension? Very few, Mr. \nPresident. And for more than 150 years, the Founders were right. \nCitizens would often come to Congress, serve a single term, and then \nleave voluntarily. Others would leave after serving only two or three \nterms, either voluntarily or after having been defeated at the ballot \nbox. The era of career politics is a relatively new one in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  Our Founding Fathers believed in a citizen legislature. They \nbelieved, as I do, that for the Congress to accurately reflect the will \nof the people, rather than the factions Madison feared, it must have \nthe frequent and regular rotation of its Members into and out of \nprivate life.\n  Yet today, Mr. President, we have drifted from that principle. No \nlonger do citizens from every walk of life come to Washington to lend \ntheir expertise to the Nation, then return home to live and work under \nthe laws they passed. Over the last 40 years, we have seen the ideal of \nthe citizen legislator displaced by the career politician--and the \nAmerican people are not happy about it.\n  Mr. President, since the end of World War II, the Federal Government \nhas swollen to a point where it now consumes more than $1.6 trillion \nevery single year. We have incurred a total debt of nearly $5 trillion, \na debt that we will shamefully pass on to our children and \ngrandchildren, a debt that threatens the ability of every child born \ntoday to achieve the American dream.\n  In fact, by the year 2012--16 years from now--our entitlement \nprograms Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, retirement, and Social Security \nplus interest, will be greater than all Federal receipts, leaving no \nfunds for spending on other priorities such as our Nation's defense, \nroads and bridges, education, national parks, or the environment. And \nworse yet, last year's debate over the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 \nshowed that reelection politics will continue to thwart any serious \ndebate regarding how to solve the entitlement situation. Unfortunately, \ndemagoguery and scare tactics rendered true reform of unbridled \nentitlement spending impossible.\n  When politicians have careers to protect, there will be politics to \nplay. Washington is a 2-year town, focused on the next election--short-\nterm thinking. It should be a 20-year town, focused on long-term \nthinking and on the true problems facing America. Two weeks ago, one of \nmy constituents told me that he thinks America lacks statesmen. He \nsaid, ``Senator Frist, what we really want are statesmen. People who \nwill put the interest of the country ahead of party and politics and \nself-interest. People who will make the tough calls.'' Mr. President, \nhe's right. I think a vast majority of Americans would like to see so \nmuch more of that in Washington, and term limits is the way to \naccomplish it.\n  Mr. President, we must ask ourselves how we've ended up in this \nposition. And more importantly, what's the solution?\n  The problem lies not with the individual men and women who are \nelected to Congress, but with a system of perpetual incumbency that has \nbecome so entrenched that it shields the Governors from the governed, \nand creates a culture that separates Washington from the rest of \nAmerica. The longer Members serve in Congress the more removed they \nbecome from the rich blend of experience of American life. More \nimportantly, career legislators become ever more risk averse, avoiding \ntough but necessary decisions because of consideration for political \nconstituencies needed for reelection. A true citizen legislature would \nsuffer from neither of these problems.\n\n  Still, the American people know that Members of Congress have a tough \ntime with the issue of term limits. It is, after all, our own jobs that \nare at stake. That's why, beginning in Colorado in 1990, the American \npeople took matters into their own hands and began voting, at the State \nlevel, to enact term limits on their Federal delegations. Twenty-two \nStates followed, Mr. President. From Alaska to California to Florida to \nMassachusetts, and several States in between, more than 25,000,000 \npeople voted for term limits.\n  Mr. President, I think the American people have made their point. \nUnfortunately, in May of last year, the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated \nthe term limits laws of 23 States and made it clear that the only \nremaining course to impose term limits is to enact a constitutional \namendment.\n  So here we are. And the question is what we will do. Will we swallow \nself-interest and career protectionism and do the will of the people? \nOr will we stonewall the will of the people and tell them we know \nbetter here in Washington?\n\n[[Page S3786]]\n\n  There are some who argue that the American people can already decide \nwhen they want new representation by simply voting us out of office at \nthe next election. That claim, Mr. President, assumes that incumbents \nand challengers compete on a relatively level playing field. They \ndon't. Look at the 1994 elections. In 1994, a year of radical political \nchange in America, 92 percent of all Members of the Senate and 90 \npercent of the House Members who sought reelection were returned to \noffice. The power of incumbency is vast.\n  Mr. President, I was the only Member of this body elected in 1994 to \nhave defeated a full-term incumbent Senator. Now, some have said that \nmy election proves it's possible to defeat an incumbent, and they're \nright. But I believe, as do the American people, that it should be more \nthan merely possible for ordinary citizens to be elected to Congress. \nWhat of the ordinary citizens who never even come forward to challenge \nincumbents because of extraordinary odds against them? Surely the \ncurrent system, which gives so much power to incumbents, discourages \nsome of our finest citizens from ever running in the first place, \nclearly depriving the electorate of the widest possible choice of \ncandidates. Every Member of each body should know that there is a date-\ncertain when they will return home to make room for another citizen to \nserve in Congress. That is not a radical idea; it's an idea that is \nembraced by over 80 percent of the American people.\n  And to those who argue that the American public is served well by \nlegislators who have years of experience in Congress, I say that the \nFederal Government should not be so large and complicated that only a \nprofessional class of politicians can possibly understand or oversee \nit. We should restructure, streamline and downsize the Federal \nGovernment so that Americans from all walks of life can serve in \nCongress without having to become professional politicians to master \nits inner workings.\n  President Andrew Jackson who occupied the seat I hold in the Senate \nsaid it well, nearly 170 years ago: ``I can not but believe that more \nis lost by the long continuance of men in office than is generally to \nbe gained by their experience.'' Later Presidents agreed. A former \nMember of this body from Missouri by the name of Harry Truman said in a \nway that only Harry Truman could, that term limits would ``cure both \nsenility and seniority, both terrible legislative diseases.''\n  Mr. President, I do not believe the Constitution should be amended \nany time there is another way of reaching the same legislative goal. \nThat's why the first bill I introduced in this body was the Electoral \nRights Enforcement Act of 1995, a statute that would have given the \nStates and the people additional authority to enact limits on the terms \nof their delegations in Congress. I also believe, as Justice Thomas \nargued in his dissenting opinion in U.S. Term Limits versus Thornton, \nthat the States already have the right to enact term limits under the \n10th amendment to the Constitution, which states that:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are \n     reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.\n\n  Nevertheless, Mr. President, the Supreme Court of the United States \nhas ruled that the only way to implement the American people's demand \nfor term limits on Members of Congress is through a constitutional \namendment. If Tuesday's vote is unsuccessful, I intend to support the \ngrass roots term limits movement that grows ever stronger outside the \nbeltway. This movement will not be quelled with the Senate's failure to \nenact a constitutional amendment this week. In fact, this vote may well \nfuel an even stronger groundswell in favor of a term limits \nconstitutional amendment.\n  For those who oppose the reforms which I consider to be of seminal \nimportance, a term limits constitutional amendment and a balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment, they should take note of article V of \nthe Constitution, which would allow the calling of a Constitutional \nConvention upon a vote of two-thirds of the States. That is only 34 \nStates, Mr. President, and 23 States have already voted in favor of \nterm limits. Term limits activists approach their cause seriously and \ntenaciously, and I support their efforts to enact a term limits \nconstitutional amendment in whatever way is possible. I look forward to \nTuesday's vote, and I hope that each Member of this body will consider \nhis or her vote carefully, with the knowledge that a vote against this \nmeasure is a vote against the will of the people.\n  I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3772-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3786-S3787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE VOID IN MORAL LEADERSHIP--PART 5\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on March 19, I began a series of \nspeeches on this floor. The subject--the common thread in these \nspeeches--has been the void in moral leadership at the White House. \nWhat this means is simply this: The President and the First Lady are \nfailing to set a good example for the American people.\n  These are failures of the most basic principles that Americans expect \nfrom their leaders: Failures like accountability; taking responsibility \nfor one's actions; straightforwardness and candor; the public trust. \nThe breakdown of these principles has eroded the President's ability to \nshow strong leadership. It has undercut his moral authority to lead. \nThe best way to lead is by example. If this is true, then White House \nleadership is truly lacking.\n  In my previous speeches, I gave illustrations of my observations. I \nidentified specific actions from each of Whitewatergate, Travelgate, \nand Cattlegate. And I showed how these illustrations are of great \nsignificance to the average citizen.\n  In my March 22 speech, I referred to a familiar quote from John \nMitchell. He was an Attorney General in the Nixon administration. He's \nremembered as saying, ``You will be better advised to watch what we do \ninstead of what we say.''\n  People all across America now are discovering the secret of \npoliticians who give the profession a bad name. People in this town \nhave known this little secret for a long time. The secret is this: Say \nwhat the public wants to hear, but then do whatever you want. By the \ntime they figure out what you did, you can point the finger at someone \nelse.\n  The governing-industry in Washington has mastered this game.\n  It has created a process designed to avoid accountability. It is \ndesigned to avoid taking responsibility for one's actions. Most data \nare presented in a way that avoids measuring performance. They are \ndesigned to show that everything is always rosy under their watch.\n  Think of how a used car dealer often buffs up a lemon of a car until \nit gleams--to gloss over all the defects. Unless you know about cars \nand what to look for, you might be tempted to buy that pile of junk \nbecause it looks so pretty. A few months later, you suddenly discover \nthat the parts are falling off right there on the highway.\n  This is what our Government is like. They tell the taxpayers all the \ngreat things they are getting in this budget, or that bill. What a \ndeal. And the people buy it. But after a while, all they see are piles \nof debt, a rising tax burden, growing job insecurity, serious social \npathologies, and rampant crime and drug use. Do you see the analogy, \nMr. President?\n  The question is, How can we be told everything is going to be rosy, \nand yet it turns out so bad? The answer is, We listened to what they \nsaid, not what they did. We made the mistake of falling for the ol' \npolitical soft shoe routine, the ol' used car pitch. They did a bait \nand switch on us, and we took the bait. Many of us here in Congress \nhave worked hard to shine a big spotlight on this racket. We have tried \nto expose some of the games played that create the illusions--just like \nDorothy exposed the Wizard of Oz.\n  For instance, by showing systematic bias in budget estimating, we \nwere able to cause the Congressional Budget Office to produce more \nrealistic estimates of Congress' budget decisions. For the lay person, \nall this means is, we can now better estimate how much our income and \noutgo will be. Before that, we were always unjustifiably optimistic. We \nalways assumed we would have a flood of revenues pouring into the \nTreasury.\n  Why? Because that way we could keep the spending faucets on full \nblast.\n\n[[Page S3787]]\n\nThings did not look so expensive as long as we could cook the books and \nshow a rising tide of revenues. The shell game was on, Mr. President. \nIt got us all re-elected, but it also got us in a ton of debt. I call \nthis problem the Narcotic of Optimism.\n  There are other examples of attempts by some of us to expose \nGovernment by illusion. Let me just describe some that I have taken the \nlead on, just to illustrate what I am saying:\n  First, most recently, I and my colleagues in both the House and \nSenate forced the President's AmeriCorps Program to clean up its act. \nIt is a program that was paying $29,000 per volunteer. Imagine the \ntaxpayers paying $29,000 per volunteer. This gave boondoggles at the \nPentagon a real run for their money.\n  We poured through AmeriCorps' documents during a 2-year battle. We \nshined a big spotlight on the program's activities and costs. We showed \nwhere the bulk of the money was going--overhead and bureaucracy. We \nhave now reinvented the program.\n  Before this, the program never lived up to the President's lofty \nrhetoric. Now, it has a chance to do what the President says it will \ndo.\n  Second, I worked hard, with the help of many of my colleagues, on \nprotecting whistleblowers, who are the footsoldiers of the war to \nexpose Government illusions. Every administration waxes poetic about \nhow much they honor whistleblowers. But as soon as our backs are \nturned, Government managers search them out like a heat-seeking \nmissile.\n  That is because whistleblowers, want the truth out; Government does \nnot. Congress has toughened up the laws protecting whistleblowers. And \nwe are always on the vigil.\n  Third, I have worked to pass or bolster initiatives that detect and \nmeasure bureaucratic sleight of hand at the Pentagon. We created an \nindependent office of testing to make sure our troops have fully and \neffectively tested equipment. We were not getting that before.\n  We have also worked on numerous financial reforms that expose cost \nand budget problems. All of these are designed to make it easier for us \nto see what the Pentagon is actually doing, as opposed to what they say \nthey are doing.\n  I have been at this kind of reform since I first joined the Senate in \n1981. Sometimes it is a lonely battle. I often think I can live to be \n100 years old and work on reforms non-stop, but I will still only make \na dent because the problem is so big.\n  That is what Presidents are for. Presidential leadership can make the \nbiggest difference in the world. The credibility of the presidency, as \nleader of the executive branch, can bring leadership to bear on the \nsystem and really shake things up. The President has not just the \nability to do this, but the responsibility to do it as well.\n  In fact, Mr. President, these were the types of things that Bill \nClinton pledged to do as a Presidential candidate in 1992. He would \nexpose and put an end to the illusions game in Washington. That is what \nhe promised. And that would help put on an equal footing those who had \nplayed by the rules, yet had failed to get ahead. And so the American \npeople put their thrust and faith in Bill Clinton to lead the way.\n  After 4 years, however, a different picture has emerged. As I have \nspecifically laid out in my previous speeches, the President has failed \nin such leadership, because he has failed to set the proper example.\n  For instance: How can this President end cronyism and favoritism? He \nfired innocent, low-level public servants in the White House Travel \nOffice, and gave the travel business to a family member and a slick \nHollywood buddy. What kind of example is that for equal treatment and \nfairness?\n  How can this President end the failure in this town to take \nresponsibility for one's actions? When the Travelgate Seven were fired, \nfingers were pointed at others for having made the decision to fire \nthem. What kind of leadership is that? What kind of example is that? \nHow can this White House end the enormous problem in this town of \ncover-up, and lack of candor and straight shooting?\n  The mysterious appearance of the Whitewater documents in the White \nHouse reading room were blamed on the Document Fairy. Whenever the \nFirst Lady or her staff are questioned in either the Whitewatergate or \nTravelgate affairs, no one can recall a thing.\n  In my speech of March 28, I gave an example of this. On March 21, the \nFirst Lady responded to questions from Chairman Clinger of the House \nCommittee on Government Reform and Oversight. The subject matter was, \nwho knew what, when, about the firing of the Travelgate Seven. In 16 \npages of responses, I counted 54 instances of ``I cannot recall;'' \n``vague recollection;'' ``it's hard to remember;'' and so on. Anything \nbut candid, Mr. President. And this from people who are at the very top \nof their profession--the legal profession--in terms of intelligence and \ncompetence. That is kind of hard to swallow.\n  Moral leadership means leading by example. If you are a leader, that \nmeans the people expect you always to be candid in what you say; they \nexpect you to treat everyone fairly and equally; they expect you to be \naccountable and take responsibility for what you do, both good and bad. \nThat is what people expect in their leaders.\n  The American people are not getting that kind of leadership from this \nWhite House, Mr. President. Instead, they are seeing their leaders \ncommit acts of favoritism, cronyism, avoiding responsibility, cover up. \nWhen people who work for such leadership see this, they follow the \nleader. People tend to do what their leaders do. Could this be why \nthere are an unprecedented four independent counsels looking into \nquestionable actions of Clinton cabinet secretaries?\n  We certainly should not be surprised at this record-setting pace for \ninvestigating high-level government officials.\n  I have been searching for an explanation for why an administration \nthat promised to change all this is instead caught up in it, at record \nlevels. I think I may have found a clue. It is a quote from this week's \nTime magazine. The article is called ``Clinton's Stealth Campaign.'' It \nis written by Eric Pooley.\n  Here is what it says:\n\n       Since the Republicans control Congress, he [meaning, \n     President Clinton] opted for an illusion of control, which \n     suits him just fine. In this almost holographic approach, \n     speeches are as important as substance and rhetoric becomes \n     its own reality. For this President, says senior adviser \n     George Stephanopoulos, ``words are actions.''\n\n  Do you see, Mr. President? Here is a senior adviser to the President \nsaying ``words are actions.'' There is no distinction. Either this \nshows a breakdown of leadership, or it reflects very questionable \nleadership from the top down--remember I mentioned that workers tend to \ndo what their leaders do. This practice--as articulated by a White \nHouse senior adviser--turns John Mitchell's adage into something you \nwould read in Kafka, or Orwell. It turns Mitchell's statement on its \nhead. In effect, it is a sly, Washington way of saying ``watch what we \nsay, not what we do.'' It says ``watching what we do is irrelevant; \nonly words are relevant.''\n  This clarifies a lot for me, Mr. President. It reinforces my \nperception of the void in moral leadership in this White House. But it \nalso gives us a glimpse into how the continuing charade of illusions is \nbeing conducted and perpetrated by this White House. It does so \nprecisely because of an absence of leadership.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3786-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE OAK RIDGE BOYS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, as America marks Earth Day 1996, I would \nlike to\n\n[[Page S3788]]\n\nremind my friends across the aisle that the environmental heritage we \nare all so proud of was forged under Republican stewardship. Our \nRepublican environmental heritage stretches back to Ulysses S. Grant, \nwho established Yellowstone as the first of the crown jewels of our \nprecious national parks. President Theodore Roosevelt set up the \nNational Wildlife Refuge System and promoted the value of conservation.\n  It was Republicans, under President Nixon, who created the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and enacted the first Clean Air and \nClean Water Acts. Under Presidents Ford, Reagan, and Bush we enacted \nand implemented the majority of the enabling statutes to protect our \nenvironment. An important Clean Air Act revision in 1990, which \nintroduced new initiatives like using markets to achieve our goals, has \nhelped to set new directions for the future.\n  The progress we have made as a nation over the last 25 years deserves \npraise. We saw problems that needed to be addressed--setting pollution \nstandards to protect public health and dealing with pollution that \ncrosses State and international boundaries. We responded with laws that \nI was proud to support--laws that addressed those problems in the best \nway we knew then.\n  We have learned a lot over these 25 years of environmental experience \nand progress. America's ability to create innovative ways of dealing \nwith environmental protection and, at the same time, have continued \neconomic growth is the envy of the rest of the world. Now we are at a \ncrossroads about how to make further progress. I want to improve the \nsystem so it protects people's health and the environment better with \nless cost and complexity. I want to put more trust in the ability of \nall Americans--at all levels of government--and their desire to do the \nright thing. The old ways won't help much as we face new problems in \nthe future.\n  During the last 25 years, the States have become very knowledgeable \nabout the best way to deal with most environmental problems. The States \nhave become laboratories of innovation on better ways to deal with many \nissues of concern: Welfare and health care reform--and environment as \nwell. California, for example, is leading the way in setting up an \nintegrated approach that calls for simpler permits and dealing with \nair, water, and waste in a coordinated way that goes after the worst \nproblems first. Other States also lead the way.\n  Wisconsin, for example, has a Brownfields program in place which \nallows appropriate clean up for urban areas previously written off for \ndevelopment. That makes good sense and shows a sense of the right \npriorities.\n  Eighteen States--including Kansas, Texas, Indiana, Colorado, and \nOregon--are encouraging their own companies to voluntarily find and fix \nenvironmental problems on their own. This is a partnership that works. \nWe should follow that example and encourage rather than punish our \ncommunities and businesses for trying to do the right thing.\n  The States and localities are leading the way in these and other \nareas. We should use the most appropriate level of Government for the \nproblem at hand. Try the local level first, States next. Try regional \nsolutions when environmental issues involve more than one State. The \nFederal Government should step back when it can and use its expertise \nwhen it is most helpful to the States: To provide scientific or \ntechnical help.\n  Farmers, ranchers, businesspeople, families--all are partners, not \nvillains. We should acknowledge that these people do the right thing \nevery day. Let us measure environmental protection not by the size of a \nFederal bureaucracy or the number of regulations on the books but by \nthe desire of our people to work together to protect the environmental \nvalues that we all treasure.\n  One of the things I have tried to promote this last year was that we \nmust use good science to set environmental priorities, and then we \nshould tackle the most important problems first. We know we could do \nbetter. The Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, for example, estimates \nthat 60,000 lives per year could be saved with the same level of \nspending if we targeted our money at the worst problems.\n  It takes leadership to make choices. We need to be wiser about what \nwe go after and at what level that is done.\n  I want to say one word about individual private property rights, \nwhich are so precious that they are protected by the Constitution. \nOwning property is a right that makes us strong and is a powerful force \nfor the environment. If the Government takes someone's property for a \npublic purpose, that person should be compensated. If we as a society \nbelieve that that person's property is needed for an important purpose, \nlet us make that choice as a nation and ensure that we are not \ndiminishing our citizens' rights.\n  I am proud of what we have done this year on the farm bill. It is the \nmost environmentally sensitive farm bill ever. The conservation title \nof the farm bill reflects a commonsense approach. The bill continues \nthe Conservation Reserve Program, expands the Wetlands Reserve Program, \nmaking this program the Nation's biggest and most successful \nenvironmental efforts. In addition, we provided $300 million to restore \nthe Everglades. This was an immediate response to a need identified by \nthe people of Florida.\n\n  The farm bill provides a good example of what we can do in other \nareas: Injecting simplicity, common sense, and flexibility, and lifting \nthe heavy hand of the Government. These goals were also met in the Safe \nDrinking Water Act and resulted in a bipartisan bill that passed the \nSenate 99 to 0. We have set the same goals for Superfund reform, to get \nthe lawyers out and get sites cleaned up. Yet today, no Democrats have \njoined us in this effort. We can get things done when we focus on the \ngoals and not the rhetoric.\n  Today I received a letter from my Democrat colleagues. I share their \nenvironmental goals. But there are better ways to achieve these goals. \nNo one is interested in repealing or weakening environmental \nprotections. Years ago, we accomplished our work by using typewriters. \nToday our offices are run by computers. Were we rolling back our desire \nto communicate efficiently by moving from typewriters to computers? I \nthink not. Let's take the same approach on the environment.\n  That proud tradition and the strong Republican values of personal \nstewardship, good science, trust in the people, and respect for the \nStates and localities will be used to build a better environmental \nfuture for our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3787-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. \nThe data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to \nthe society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today \nwill see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both \ninstructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment \nof ``til death us do part'' seriously, demonstrating successfully the \ntimeless principles of love, honor, and\n\n[[Page S3789]]\n\nfidelity. These characteristics make our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Mr. Robert A. and \nMrs. Clara Belle McWorkman of West Plains, MO, who on May 30 will \ncelebrate their 60th wedding anniversary.

Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. \nThe data is undeniable: individuals from strong families contribute to \nthe society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today \nwill see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both \ninstructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment \nof ``till death us do part'' seriously, demonstrating successfully the \ntimeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics \nmake our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Paul and Thelma \nShannon of St. Peters, MO, who on June 8, 1996 will celebrate their \n50th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day \nwe can celebrate a similar milestone.

Mr. President, I recently returned from a trip to the \nPeople's Republic of China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan over the April recess \nin my capacity as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on East Asian and \nPacific Affairs. While I would like at some time to share my \nobservations of that trip with my colleagues, some confusion has arisen \nin the Asian press over a remark I made on that trip which I feel I \nneed to correct sooner rather than later.\n  On April 3, I was privileged to have an hour-long meeting with \nChinese President Jiang Zemin at Zhongnanhai in Beijing. A central \nfocus of our discussion was the tense situation in the Taiwan Straits \nand strained relations between the PRC and Taiwan. When the \nconversation turned toward what President Jiang perceived to be the \nthen-current situation and prospects for a return to a more stable \ncross-strait relationship, he replied paraphrasing a Chinese saying to \nillustrate his position. The President said, ``When the wind blows \nthrough the pavilion, it means the rains will come,'' or, in Chinese, \n``Shan yu yu lai feng man lou di xing shi si hu yi jing guo qu le.'' \nAfter a brief pause, he then added, ``But in this case, I think the \nrain is over.'' I took this to be an encouraging sign that, perhaps \nwith the conclusion of Taiwan's presidential election and the PRC's \nsomewhat worrisome military exercises in the Strait, the situation \nmight be calming down and the two sides might be ready to resume cross-\nstrait contacts through the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan \nStrait and the Straits Exchange Foundation, the two semi official \nbodies set up to handle that relationship.\n  After visiting other cities in China and then Hong Kong, I spent a \nday in Taipei, Taiwan, on the way back to the United States. There I \nmet with Foreign Minister Chen and President Lee Teng-hui, both of whom \nI told of my conversation with President Jiang, and Jiang's statement \nabout the ``rain being over.'' They found the statement to be \nencouraging, just as I had. In meetings with the Taiwan press during my \nstay, I made it clear that I was not delivering a message from the \ngovernment of the PRC to the Government of Taiwan; I had simply relayed \nthe particulars of my conversation with President Jiang to Chen and \nLee. This is where the confusion arose.\n  One of the Taipei newspapers, on hearing that President Jiang had \nsaid ``the rain is over'' incorrectly assumed that he had cited another \nChinese saying: ``the rain is over and the sun is shinning''--in \nChinese ``yu guo tian qing.'' The Taiwan press sometimes tends to shoot \nfirst and ask questions later, and other papers were soon picking up \nthe inaccurate statement. As a result, by the next day papers island-\nwide were reporting that Jiang had made statements that were much more \nrosy than what was actually said. Not only were the newspaper reports \ninaccurate, but they missed the entire gist of Jiang's statement. By \nreferring to the saying ``the rain is over * * *'' but leaving off the \npart of the saying ``* * * the sky is blue,'' President Jiang was \nmaking the specific point that while the storm had passed things were \nstill far from ``sunny.''\n  Anyway, Mr. President, soon other newspapers in Asia were repeating \nthe inaccurate Taiwanese reports. As a result, the Chinese Government, \nthrough two newspapers in Hong Kong known to be directed by Beijing--\nMing Pao and Wen Wei Po--began to publish articles denying--correctly \nof course--that Jiang had made the statement attributed to him by me as \nreported by Taiwan's press.\n  I became aware of the confusion when I returned to Washington last \nweek, and issued a press release to several Asian papers in an effort \nto correct the inaccuracies. Although many papers ran articles \ncorrectly reflecting the actual comments made by President Jiang, the \nconfusion still persists.\n  So, Mr. President, I come to the floor today to publicly set the \nrecord straight once and for all in the hopes of removing the last \nvestiges of confusion. I did not travel to Taipei to deliver a specific \nmessage from the PRC to Taiwan; I simply reported to the Taiwan \nGovernment the details of my conversation with President Jiang. In that \nconversation, President Jiang said, ``When the wind blows through the \npavilion, it means the rains will come. But in this case, I think the \nrains are over''--no more, no less. I hope this will lay the issue to \nrest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3789-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE PASSING OF COMMERCE SECRETARY RON BROWN\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to note the passing of our \nCommerce Secretary, Ron Brown, in a plane crash outside Dubrovnik, \nBosnia. This tragic accident took with it a vast amount of talent and \nexpertise in the persons of numerous American business people, and \nspecifically in the person of Secretary Brown. A dedicated member of \nhis party and this administration, Secretary Brown fought hard for the \nideals and programs in which he believed. His commitment to the \nCommerce Department he led was shown by his willingness to brave the \ndangers of Bosnia, business leaders in tow, in pursuit of opportunities \nto help rebuild that war-torn country.\n  Secretary Brown also was a committed family man, and I know that his \ndeath is a great loss to his wife, his family, his friends, and his \nneighbors. I extend my condolences to his family in particular and hope \nthat they can find solace in the knowledge of God's grace and in \nmemories of the life they had with Ron Brown.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3789-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3789-S3790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMEMORATING SECRETARY OF COMMERCE RON BROWN\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, it is always painful when death \ncomes too soon. It is even more so when the circumstances are so \noverwhelmingly dramatic and tragic as the airplane crash in Bosnia that \ntook the life of our Nation's Secretary of Commerce, Ron Brown, and 34 \nothers.\n  Ron Brown was a dear and personal friend. His loss was compounded by \nmy personal friendship with four other people who died that day. The \nshock of it still resonates.\n  His family, and the families of the others who died with him in the \nservice of their country feel the pain most directly. There is no \nsubstitute for the love and the loss of a husband, a father, and \nrelative. I want to offer them my sincere condolences and prayers at \nthis sad time.\n  His colleagues in the Government and in the private sector will miss \nhim and his leadership. Ron Brown not only energized the Democratic \nParty, but the Department of Commerce as well.\n\n[[Page S3790]]\n\nThe result of his efforts ranged from the creation of jobs for hundreds \nof thousands of American workers, to a special job for a singular \nAmerican, Bill Clinton, now President of the United States.\n  Ron Brown's legacy of achievement is a beacon of hope to all \nAmericans, precisely because he exemplified the possibilities when the \nhigher angels of the American character prevail. He overcame potential \nlimitations, and turned liabilities into assets by dint of commitment, \neffort, and talent. His was the essential American success story. But \nhis was also a success story for all humanity. Ron Brown was not a \nselfish person. His life was dedicated to reaching out to others in \npursuit of the common good. That legacy is no more poignantly \ndemonstrated than in the young people to whom he gave opportunity and \nguidance and a chance. Ron Brown did not pull the ladder of success up \nbehind him.\n  I count myself among the fortunate proteges of Ron Brown. He helped \nmake my history-making election to the U.S. Senate possible. I was only \none of many of his students. Several others died with him that day.\n  Ron Brown's passing has been publicly mourned by millions, and \ncreated an opportunity for a public expression of gratitude for his \npublic service. I hope the families of those who perished with him will \ntake some measure of that expression as gratitude in mourning for the \nlost ones: Ron Brown, Kathryn Hoffman; Duane Christian; Carol Hamilton; \nBill Morton; Chuck Meissner; Gail Dobert; Lawrence Payne; Adam Darling; \nSteve Kaminski; Naomi Warbasse; Kathy Kellogg; Jim Lewek; Lee Jackson; \nDragica Lendic Bebek; Niksa Antonini; Nathaniel Nash; Barry Conrad; \nPaul Cushman; Robert Donovan; Claudio Elia; Leonard Pieroni; John \nScoville; Donald Terner; Stuart Tholan; David Ford; Frank Maier; Walter \nMurphy; Robert Whittaker; Ashley Davis; Tim Schafer; Gerald Aldrich; \nRobert Farrington, Jr.; Cheryl Turnage; Shelly Kelly.\n  We will, as a community, have to close ranks to go forward without \nthem, but with God's grace the mark they made in service to us all will \ncarry on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3789-4", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO ``CHIEF'' CHARLES ALFRED ANDERSON, FATHER OF BLACK \nAVIATION\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, one of the great pioneers of aviation \npassed away on Saturday, April 13, at the age of 89 at his home in \nTuskegee, AL. Charles Alfred Anderson, who as a young boy dreamed of \nsoaring through the skies as a pilot, leaves a legacy of breaking down \nracial barriers in the field of aviation. He did this by training a \nfamed unit of black fighter pilots during World War II, known since as \nthe Tuskegee Airmen.\n  Among the members of Chief Anderson's unit were Coleman Young, who \nlater became the mayor of Detroit; Gen. Daniel ``Chappie'' James, the \nNation's first four-star black general; and William Coleman, \nTransportation Secretary under former President Ford. The inspirational \nstory of the 332d Fighter Group was told in a 1995 movie, ``The \nTuskegee Airmen.''\n  In 1939, a decade after obtaining his own flying license, Charles \nAnderson began a civilian pilot training program at Alabama's Tuskegee \nInstitute, now Tuskegee University. In 1940, First Lady Eleanor \nRoosevelt visited the campus and decided to take a plane ride. At that \ntime, an erroneously-held view was that blacks could not fly planes. \nMrs. Roosevelt brushed aside the nervous warnings of her Secret Service \ndetail and went on a long ride with Anderson, landing safely nearly an \nhour later.\n  Soon after, Tuskegee Institute was chosen for an experimental Army \nAir Corps Program designed to determine whether black men could be \nsuccessful pilots. The participants, many of whom came from small towns \nall across America, passed rigorous tests to join what became the 332d \nFighter Group. Anderson was the chief flight instructor, thus earning \nhim the nickname ``Chief,'' by which he was widely known throughout the \nrest of his life.\n  The Tuskegee Airmen overcame extreme prejudice to win combat status, \nallegedly only after Mrs. Roosevelt pressed their case with her \nhusband. The unit escorted American bombers over Europe and North \nAfrica, providing a virtually impenetrable shield while downing \nhundreds of German fighters. After the war, Anderson managed an \naircraft-sales business and continued to give flight instruction at \nTuskegee. By this time, he had earned the title of ``Father of Black \nAviation.''\n  Chief Anderson borrowed $2,500 from friends and relatives and bought \na used airplane when he was only 22. He learned to fly by reading books \nand getting tips from the white pilots who were willing to be \ncooperative. He eventually became the first black pilot to hold an air \ntransport license. He flew a round trip transcontinental flight in 1933 \nand is believed to have flown the first land plane to the Bahamas in \n1934. He flew up until a few years ago, still willing to teach anyone \nwho wanted to learn.\n  Chief Charles Anderson was a great American and an outstanding, \ncommitted teacher who will forever be remembered as someone who \novercame unfair barriers and prejudice to change the course of history. \nI extend my sincerest condolences to his family in the wake of this \ntremendous loss and share their enormous pride in all that he \naccomplished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3790-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO ``CHIEF'' CHARLES ALFRED ANDERSON, FATHER OF BLACK \nAVIATION\n  Mr. HEFLIN.

He graduated from Deshler High School in 1930 and \nwent on to obtain his bachelor's degree in psychology at Birmingham-\nSouthern, my alma mater. He later earned his master's degree in \nsociology at Ohio State University. During World War II, he served in \nthe U.S. Army Air Corps, rising to the rank of major, with service in \nthe Asiatic-Pacific theater. He was awarded a Bronze Star for his \nbravery and remained in the Reserves until 1972.\n  He was first elected to the U.S. Congress in 1946, serving four \nconsecutive terms from 1947 until 1955.

Mr. President, the tragic plane crash in Croatia on \nApril 3 that took the life of Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown also took \nthe lives of 34 other men and women of great talent, promise, and \ndedication, including 11 other employees of the Department of Commerce.\n  Since that tragedy, many eloquent words have been spoken and written \nabout all of the victims. In two of the most eloquent articles I have \nseen. Michael Wilbon wrote extremely movingly in the Washington Post on \nApril 5 about his friend Kathryn Hoffman, and Cindy Loose wrote equally \nmovingly in the Post yesterday about the\n\n[[Page S3791]]\n\nlife of Gail Dobert. Sadly, these two lives of great promise have been \nsuddenly and tragically cut short. I know that many others will be \ninterested to learn more about the lives of these two dedicated \nemployees, and I ask unanimous consent that the articles be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 5, 1996]\n\n                   The Death of My Friend Is Our Loss\n\n                          (By Michael Wilbon)\n\n       One of my dearest friends, Kathryn Hoffman, was on that \n     plane. I have no idea of her official Commerce Department \n     title, but I do know she was Ron Brown's right hand, his \n     scheduler. When he went to Africa, she went with him. When he \n     went to Asia, she went with him. I have her postcards from \n     South America and Eastern Europe and other corners of the \n     world in a kitchen drawer.\n       Kathryn was the girl you dreamed about meeting as a little \n     boy: stunningly pretty, smart, quick with a comeback, and a \n     sports enthusiast. Okay, she wasn't perfect; she was a Knicks \n     fan. But Boys Night Out often was amended to Boys & Kathryn. \n     Never Kathy. Kathryn. I called her from the 1988 Summer \n     Olympics in Seoul and made her give me play-by-play on the \n     fourth quarter of a Bears game, and she was seamless. Another \n     time we drove from Chicago to Capital Centre in 10 hours, \n     just in time to see Tyson knock out Spinks in the first round \n     on closed circuit. She used to say I had the greatest, most \n     glamorous job--traveling the world in search of games, but \n     last week there was this late-night phone call. I was going \n     to the Final Four; she was going to France, then Bosnia. I \n     told her I couldn't believe a basketball fan such as Ron \n     Brown was leaving during the Final Four, and she laughed.\n       She had taken her dogs, Max and Bo, to Fredericksburg to \n     the breeder where they stay when she's traveling. She had a \n     house now and a four-wheel drive vehicle and a garden, for \n     crying out loud, and I couldn't help but ask if finally, \n     having seen the entire world and then some, if she still \n     thought this life of hopping planes was so glamorous. And \n     she said, no, not anymore, but there are people who love \n     their work and are addicted to excitement in a way no desk \n     job can satisfy. It's the truth. We made the promise we \n     always made about getting more balance in our lives, about \n     traveling less. We planned dinner for Saturday--tomorrow \n     night.\n       Most of us who live our lives this way don't think about \n     dying on a plane, not when you're single and 35 has yet to \n     come and the career--in Kathryn's case, public service--keeps \n     you on a high. You get on the plane and read, work, go to \n     sleep. It becomes, perversely enough, the place you can \n     relax. I never, not for one split second, thought a U.S. \n     military jet would fail to bring her back alive.\n       Four of my closest friends have worked for Ron Brown at \n     Commerce, which made the moments immediately following the \n     news of the crash, well, numbing. Through them, I got to \n     know. ``The Secretary'' (as they'd call him) a little bit and \n     to admire him a lot. His death, and the recent deaths of \n     Arthur Ashe and entrepreneur Reginald Lewis, depress me to \n     the point of despair, not just because inspired and \n     productive men were snatched from earth in the primes of \n     their lives, but because they were the hedge against \n     hopelessness. They were the healers, the men who could \n     negotiate any situation--men who looked at bigots and fools \n     and laughed inside while brushing them aside. It's sick, \n     debating whether Michael Irvin or Mike Tyson is a role \n     model when Ron Brown was on TV every night, dressed up, \n     looking good, sounding even better, jetting hither and \n     yon, networking with world leaders and businessmen to do \n     work that mattered, helping save the Democratic Party from \n     itself, being a patriot. No, you couldn't find him on \n     ``SportsCenter,'' and he didn't have stats or a trading \n     card, but he was a role model. He defined it.\n       I wonder, in the wake of his death, how many Division I \n     scholarship football and basketball players (outside of \n     Washington) can tell you what Ron Brown did for a living, why \n     he needed to go to Dubrovnik and why his death has caused so \n     much anguish among people who never met him. No Ashe, no \n     Lewis, no Brown. Sports, business and government. Are there \n     people in the ranks like them? Can we be certain the \n     intellect and relentless work they provided will be \n     replenished in the near future? Perhaps the worst thing about \n     the crash is that it deprived us not only of the general, but \n     of his lieutenants such as Carol Hamilton and Bill Morton and \n     Kathryn Hoffman, people who had made public service their \n     lives, their passion. We have to hope there's no shortage of \n     worthy candidates to take up their missions.\n       This was to be a festive weekend, and not just because of \n     Easter. For the first time since last August, just about all \n     the members of the crew going to be off the road, off the \n     planes and out of the hotels. Many of us made plans here in \n     Washington. Age 35, which Kathryn would have been in August, \n     is about the time you start to realize life isn't \n     everlasting, when you become more serious and consistent \n     about those silent prayers for your friends in flight, when \n     it first hits you that just because you planned dinner \n     doesn't mean everybody's going to be there.\n       I joined a couple of my friends from Commerce late last \n     night because sleep wasn't coming, and misery needs company \n     most when nobody's got any answers. I tried to think of all \n     the safe, productive trips abroad that Kathryn made with The \n     Secretary, all the trade and business their missions helped \n     generate, all the goodwill their junkets created for the \n     country. But the head is never any match for the heart, and \n     that didn't change last night. What I wanted was another \n     postcard in the mailbox, one from Singapore or Venezuela that \n     let me know she was safe, one signed, like so many others, \n     ``Be home soon, Love, Kathryn.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 15, 1996]\n\n                            (By Cindy Loose)\n\n  After Funeral, a Celebration of a Rich Life--Birthday Party Becomes \n                       Tribute to Croatia Victim\n\n       Gail Dobert was always up to something. She was the one to \n     organize the beach house rental at Rehoboth Beach, Del., \n     every summer, inviting so many people that you never got your \n     own room--and felt lucky if you got a bed.\n       She could get tickets to anything and persuade her friends \n     to go anywhere, even a business dinner. ``I have to go talk \n     to a Bonsai tree woman,'' she once told her friend Krista \n     Pages. ``Come on, you'll have a great time.'' Believe it or \n     not, it turned out to be fun, Pages said.\n       If she could have been at her 35th birthday party, which \n     she organized before leaving for Bosnia with Commerce \n     Secretary Ronald H. Brown, she would have loved it.\n       The barbecue and keg party took place Saturday, just as she \n     had planned, a few hours after her burial in a Maryland \n     cemetery. Dobert, the acting director of the Commerce \n     Department's Office of Business Liaison, was among the 35 \n     people who died when Brown's airplane crashed into a Croatian \n     hillside. Like her, several of the victims were young and \n     most were in the middle ranks of government service.\n       Her friends and family memorialized her in all the \n     traditional ways. On Friday, the anniversary of her birth, a \n     funeral was held in her home town on Long Island. On Saturday \n     morning, hundreds gathered at St. Peter's Church on Capitol \n     Hill to eulogize her, then followed the hearse for a \n     graveside service.\n       It might seem strange to follow that with a party, conceded \n     her friend Chris Wilson. But if you knew Gail Dobert, he \n     said, it would not seem that extraordinary. She was, he \n     explained, a festive, life-loving person who would have \n     wanted her family and friends--well in excess of 100, it \n     turned out--to hold the party she had planned for them.\n       Besides, they couldn't just all go home alone. What else, \n     then, could they do? ``This party has got to be the beginning \n     of getting better--her death has been so hard, it just has to \n     be,'' Wilson said.\n       Despite working grueling hours at the Commerce Department, \n     Dobert was always the life of the party. If anyone could \n     persuade a shy person to sing along at a karaoke bar, belting \n     out, ``These boots were made for walking,'' it would be \n     Dobert.\n       ``There is so much to celebrate about Gail's life and so \n     many fun things to remember,'' Pages said. ``For her to live \n     on, you have to talk about the good times.''\n       So there they were, eating and drinking and sharing \n     pictures in the Alexandria home and back yard of Chip \n     Gardiner, a congressional aide.\n       ``This is such a tribute these young people are paying our \n     Gail,'' said Dobert's mother, Maureen. ``When people think of \n     Washington, they think of a huge bureaucracy. I wish they \n     knew how many idealistic, hard-working young people there \n     are. The politics in the halls of Congress may be the engine, \n     but the train is run by them.''\n       ``She made us very proud,'' said Dobert's father, Ken. ``We \n     always said that if parents got paid, we'd have to take half \n     pay because she and her brother made our job so easy.'' \n     Dobert's brother, Ray, turned 33 the day of his sister's \n     burial. There was a cake for him at her birthday party, just \n     as she had intended.\n       Small groups at various times surrounded photo albums, \n     laughing. ``There's the famous raincoat,'' someone said, \n     pointing at a photo snapped at a wedding reception as the \n     band played ``It's Raining Men.'' No one was dancing until \n     Dobert decided to enliven things by hopping on the dance \n     floor with a tambourine and the bright pink and iridescent \n     yellow coat.\n       Eileen Parise had a picture from the time she got Dobert \n     and two other friends tickets to the Baltimore reception Vice \n     President Gore gave in honor of Pope John Paul II. As \n     happened not infrequently, Dobert's battered car broke down, \n     this time on Route 50 near the Baltimore airport.\n       ``The other people in the car were praying and saying Hail \n     Marys,'' Parise said. ``Gail starts schmoozing the state \n     trooper that came by. He not only had the car towed but then \n     drove everyone to the reception.''\n       From inside, someone shouted, ``Here's Gail,'' and about a \n     dozen people, expecting to see a vacation videotape from \n     Rehobeth, ran inside. Instead, it turned out to be the \n     evening news, with a snippet of Dobert's memorial service \n     that day. The clip went by quickly, segueing into another \n     memorial for another crash victim. There was pained silence. \n     Then someone moved to turn off the television, and another \n     guest arrived.\n       ``We brought a semi-good bottle of wine,'' the new guest \n     told Gardiner.\n       ``You can drop the semi--it's full isn't it?'' Wilson \n     asked. ``Hey, it even has a cork.''\n\n[[Page S3792]]\n\n       The celebration and jocularity were real, but so were the \n     moments of pain expressed on every face at some point. \n     Maureen Dobert sang along when a birthday cake was brought \n     out for her son and another guest with an April 13 birthday. \n     But she confided that she was using her public face. The \n     private one, she said, gives into grief sometimes.\n       ``You know, one day they go to kindergarten, and you have \n     to let them go,'' she said. ``Then they want to ride their \n     bike around the corner, and you tell them to be careful and \n     let them go. Before you know it, they're adults and you say, \n     okay, I'm going to let them go.\n       ``But this is the hardest letting go you ever have to do. I \n     wanted her longer, but it's not going to work. It's the \n     hardest letting go, but somehow you have to do it.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3790-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3792-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessage from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3792-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 1995, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on April 19, 1996, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 3034.

Madam President, the farm bill enacted 2 weeks ago \nhas changed the Farm Service Agency's loan eligibility rules for \nthousands of producers only a few weeks from planting. It has become \nvery clear that the effective date of the new loan eligibility \nprovisions is causing hardship for producers in the midst of \nimplementing farm and ranch plans for the year. Farmers and ranchers \nare being informed that, although their loan applications were \napproved, the Secretary is now prohibited from providing the loan funds \nto the farmer under\n\n[[Page S3793]]\n\nthe new farm bill. Thousands of farmers will be forced to cancel seed, \nfertilizer, machinery, and land contracts with local, main street \nbusinesses. Many businesses have already delivered seed and fertilizer \nbased on the Government loan commitment. Many farmers who expected to \nplant a crop this year when prices are high will simply have to move to \ntown and look for other work. This is not sensible policymaking. My \nlegislation will delay the effective date of some of the loan \neligibility provisions to give farmers and ranchers, and the \nbusinessmen who depend on doing business with the farmers and ranchers, \ntime to adjust to the new loan eligibility law.\n  Section 648(b) of the credit title of the farm bill was made \neffective on the date of enactment. My bill will change the effective \ndate of section 648(b) to make the provisions effective 90 days after \nenactment, or July 5, 1996. It is my hope that my colleagues will \nsupport this legislation.\n  During conference, I and many of my colleagues hoped that section \n648(b)'s effective date would be deferred to allow farmers some warning \nof the new restrictions and avoid the problems farmers are now \nexperiencing. However, the majority insisted on making the provisions \nof section 648(b) effective upon enactment. As a result, the Secretary \nis prohibited from allocating funds and making those loans, even if \nthere were pending applications or approved applications or borrowers \nwho had relied on approved applications to their detriment. The \nimmediate and harsh effect of this provision was part of the reason I \nopposed the farm bill conference report.\n  It is my opinion that the entire farm bill should be revisited and \ncorrected. However, the case for correcting the harsh effective date of \nsection 648(b) is particularly compelling and that is why I am \nintroducing this legislation today.\n  It is April 1996 and no one can argue that many farmers and ranchers, \nwho are now prohibited from borrowing under section 648(b), have relied \nto their detriment on approved applications for ownership loans, \noperating loans, and emergency disaster loans. It is also too late in \nthe season to provide these farmers and ranchers with time to obtain \nsome other form of financing.\n  During my time in the Senate and on the Agriculture Committee, I have \nsupported measures to make the Federal Government a more responsible \nand practical agricultural lender. I have worked to reduce and \neliminate the amount of debt the Farm Service Agency carries on its \nbooks. By introducing this legislation, I am not encouraging the Farm \nService Agency to make risky loans. However, for those farmers who have \nbeen approved for loans, have relied on that approval to their \ndetriment, and find themselves days away from planting, it is just too \nlate to secure other forms of financing. The timing of the immediate \neffective date in the Farm Bill is plain mean-spirited. I hope my \ncolleagues support this bill to give farmers and ranchers 90 days to \nadjust to the Farm Bill's new restrictions.\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am pleased to join in \nintroducing legislation establishing a transition period to help our \nfarmers who are attempting to obtain financing under the Consolidated \nFarm and Rural Development Act. The comprehensive farm bill that was \nsigned into law earlier this month made a number of significant reforms \nto our Federal agriculture policy. Among these reforms was a change in \nhow the U.S. Department of Agriculture extends credit to certain types \nof borrowers. This new policy is necessary to ensure the sound \ninvestment of taxpayer dollars.\n  Specifically, section 373 of the act prohibits the Secretary of \nAgriculture from making or guaranteeing loans to borrowers who have \nreceived debt forgiveness in the past. Debt forgiveness is defined as a \nwriteoff or reduction of a direct or guaranteed loan or discharge of \ndebt through bankruptcy.\n  Although I was not on the Agriculture Committee last summer when the \ncredit title was marked up, it is my understanding that no member from \neither side of the aisle objected to this provision. Also, this section \nwas not subject to amendment during the floor debate in February.\n  So we are not necessarily arguing with the policy of this section. \nBut there are farmers who had applied for their annual operating loans \nin February or March, who expected to receive this financial \nassistance. They have been caught in the pipeline, so to speak, through \nno fault of their own. This group of farmers were eligible for these \nloans when they applied. But under the new farm bill they are \nineligible.\n  It is only fair to give these farmers a period to adjust to the new \nrules. That is all this bill does. It does not change the reform-minded \npolicy put in place by section 373. It merely moves back the \nimplementation date of the section to allow the Farm Service Agency to \nprocess these loan applications and release the money to these \nborrowers. More importantly, this bill gives the farmers subject to \nthis section an opportunity to adjust to a significant change in policy \nthat could adversely affect their business.\n  This Congress passed a revolutionary farm bill, characterized by \nlong-needed reforms. But we must remember that these changes affect \nreal people, like family farmers. Therefore, it is necessary that \nsufficient transition time be given so that farmers can adjust and \nmodify their business practices accordingly.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, now that the farm bill is in place, \nfarmers are doing their spring planting for the 1996 crops, or soon \nwill begin. However, an unintended glitch has been discovered in the \nimplementation of the new farm bill. Certain sections of the credit \ntitle of the new farm bill are being implemented to the detriment of \nfarmers who have had any debts forgiven by the Government in the past.\n  This has come as quite a surprise to many farmers in South Dakota and \nother parts of the Nation. I have heard from several farmers who had \napplied for operating or emergency disaster loans who are now being \ntold they are ineligible because of past debt forgiveness. That is not \nright. That is not what Congress intended. Most important, this is the \nlast thing a farmer needs to hear, especially when he needs a loan to \nget this year's crop in. In some cases, Mr. President, I have learned \nthat farmers who had approved loans that had not been disbursed by \nApril 4, are also now being told they are no longer eligible. Again, \nthis is not what Congress intended.\n  You can imagine how a farmer would feel when, after having his loan \napproved and a date set for disbursement, he's told the check's no \nlonger in the mail.\n  Mr. President, already Members of Congress are seeking to correct his \nunintended development. The chairmen of the Senate and House \nAgriculture Committees have written to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, \nDan Glickman, to express their concerns about this implementation. It \nis clear we need legislation to ensure pending and future loans can go \nthrough. Therefore, today we are introducing a bill that would delay \nthe implementation of section 373 of the Consolidated Farm and Rural \nDevelopment Act, until July 5, 1996. This would provide the time for \nUSDA to disburse loans to farmers for this year's spring planting.\n  I am pleased to undertake this corrective effort along with Senator \nGrassley and others. Similar legislation has been introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives and I urge congressional adoption of these \nmeasures as soon as possible. Time is running out and we must act.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Conrad for \nintroducing this legislation to correct a provision in the newly passed \nfarm bill that threatens to leave thousands of farm families in the \nlurch as they attempt to get a crop in the ground this spring. This \nfeature of the new farm bill hits especially hard farmers, such as \nthose in parts of Iowa, who are trying to recover from the hardships \ncaused by disaster situations beyond their control. It is my \nunderstanding that some 30 to 40 percent of the approximately 8,000 \nUSDA borrowers in Iowa are likely to be adversely affected by this \nprovision.\n  The provision involved here prohibits USDA from making any type of \noperating, farm ownership, or emergency loan to a person who has at any \ntime received any debt forgiveness from USDA on such a loan in the \npast. This provision was by clear terms made effective immediately upon \nenactment of the\n\n[[Page S3794]]\n\nnew farm bill, which was signed into law on April 4 of this year. As a \nconsequence, many farmers who were in the process of having loans \napproved are cut off at the very last moment from credit that they were \nfully justified in counting on for planting this year's crop. Farm \nfamilies have enough to worry about during planting season without \nhaving Congress create a whole new set of unanticipated problems and \nworries for them.\n  The consequence of this provision of the farm bill is that no matter \nhow small the amount forgiven, no matter whether the forgiveness was \ndue to reasons entirely beyond the control of the borrower, no new \ncredit may be provided even if the farmer is now a sound credit risk--\nexcept for limited circumstances in the case of annual operating loans \nfor borrowers whose debt was restructured under section 353. For \nexample, even if a portion of interest, but no principal, was forgiven \non a loan during the farm crisis a decade or more ago, for reasons \nbeyond the control of the borrower, this provision says no more loans.\n  There may be reasonable arguments over the fairness of that policy, \nbut clearly the harshest aspect of the new farm bill's loan \nineligibility provision is that it kicked into effect on the date the \nbill became law, with little or no warning to farmers whose loans were \nin the process of being approved. The farm bill was long overdue by the \ntime it passed Congress, and the problems caused by the lateness of the \nbill were compounded by the specific preclusion of any grace period for \nthe new prohibition against loans to borrowers receiving past loan \nforgiveness. Farmers were left with virtually nowhere to turn because \nit was too late in the season to have a realistic chance to arrange \nother financing.\n  There has been some discussion whether USDA has misinterpreted the \nlanguage of the bill or the legislative intent as to the effect of the \nnew ineligibility provision, but the language of the bill is quite \nclear. Moreover, the matter of a reasonable grace period was \nspecifically discussed during conference, but was rejected by the \nmajority conferees.\n  I believe USDA should be careful in lending money, but the new farm \nbill is too extreme and too harsh.\n  This bill is a limited remedy for the harshness of the new \nineligibility provision in the farm bill and the serious hardship it is \ncausing. I am hopeful that legislation can be passed yet this week to \naddress this very unfair situation created by the new farm bill.\n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 1691. A bill to provide for a minimum presence of INS agents in \neach State; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                The Immigration Control Enforcement Act\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, much of the debate on this floor is \nfocused on how to strengthen our immigration laws. But whatever we pass \nwill not mean much if we do not make sure that our States have the \ntools and support they need to enforce those laws in the first place.\n  That is why I rise today to offer this bill that would require the \nAttorney General to provide at least 10 full-time active duty agents of \nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service in each State. These can be \neither new agents or existing agents shifted from other States.\n  In America today, immigration is not simply a California issue or a \nNew York issue or a Texas or Florida issue. I can tell you that it is a \nreal issue--and a real challenge--in my own State.\n  But today there are three States--including Iowa--that have no \npermanent INS presence to combat illegal immigration or to assist legal \nimmigrants. In fact, in Iowa every other Federal law enforcement agency \nis represented except the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n  This is a commonsense amendment. Ten agents is a modest level \ncompared to agents in other States. According to INS current staffing \nlevels, Missouri has 92 agents, Minnesota has 281 agents, and the State \nof Washingon has 440. And Iowa, West Virginia, and South Dakota have \nzero. This just does not make any sense.\n  Clearly every State needs a minimum INS presence to meet basic needs. \nMy bill would ensure that need is met. It would affect 10 States and \nonly require 61 agents which is less than 0.3 percent of the current \n19,780 INS agents nationwide.\n  Let me speak briefly about the situation in my own State. Currently, \nIowa shares an INS office located in Omaha, NE. In its February report, \nthe Omaha INS office reported that they apprehended a total of 704 \nillegal aliens last year for the two-State area. This number is up by \n52 percent from 1994.\n  The irony here is that in 1995, the INS office in Omaha was operating \nat a 33-percent reduction in manpower from 1994 staff levels. Yet the \nnumber of illegal aliens apprehended increased by 52 percent that year.\n  This same report states that there are about 550 criminal aliens \nbeing detained or serving sentences in Iowa and Nebraska city/county \njails. Many of these aliens were arrested for controlled substance \nviolations and drug trafficking crimes.\n  A little law enforcement relief is on its way to Iowa. The Justice \nDepartment announced that it will establish an INS office in Cedar \nRapids with four law enforcement agents. That is a good step. And it is \nfour more agents then we had before.\n  But we need additional INS enforcement to assist Iowa's law \nenforcement in the central and western parts our State.\n  In fact, the Omaha district office assessed in their initial report \nto the Justice Department that at least eight INS enforcement agents \nare needed simply to handle the issue of illegal immigration in Iowa.\n  Mr. President, in the immigration reform legislation before the \nSenate this week, the Attorney General will be mandated to increase the \nnumber of Border Patrol agents by 1,000 every year for the next 4 \nyears. Yet for Iowa, the Justice Department can only spare four law \nenforcement agents and no agents to perform examinations or inspections \nfunctions.\n  By providing each State with its own INS office, the Justice \nDepartment will save taxpayer dollars by reducing not only travel time \nbut also jail time per alien, since a permanent INS presence would \nsubstantially speed up deportation proceedings.\n  There is also a growing need to assist legal immigrants and to speed \nup document processing. The Omaha INS office reported that based on its \nfirst quarter totals for this year the examinations process for legal \nimmigrants applying for citizenship or adjusting their status went up \n45 percent from last year. Even though, once again, the manpower for \nthe Omaha INS office is down by one-third.\n  I have recommended that a permanent INS office in Des Moines be \nlocated in free office space that would be provided by the Des Moines \nInternational Airport. Placing the office in the Des Moines \nInternational Airport would benefit Iowa in three ways. First, it would \ncut costs and save taxpayers money. Second, it would generate economic \nbenefits for Iowa because the airport could then process international \narrivals and advance Iowa's goal of becoming increasingly more \ncompetitive in the global market. Third, the office would be able to \nprocess legal immigrants living in Iowa.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in support of my bill. It is common \nsense, it is modest, and it sends a clear message to our States that we \nare committed to enforcing our immigration laws and giving them the \ntools they need to do it.\n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 1692. A bill to bar Federal agencies from procuring goods and \nservices from employees of illegal aliens; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n                   The Illegal Worker Prevention Act\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the chief magnet drawing illegal \nimmigrants into the United States and enabling them to stay--is jobs. \nBorder control is an effective strategy against illegal immigration but \nthe lure of jobs will continue to attract illegal workers. We must \nreduce the job magnet that draws illegal immigrants to this country and \ndeprives American workers of their livelihood.\n  For years, illegal aliens entering the United States have found \nemployers ready and willing to hire them, often for wages which were \nsubstandard and under conditions which ranged from improper to illegal \nand inhumane. We passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 \nwhich made it illegal to hire undocumented workers. We have recently \nbeefed up enforcement of\n\n[[Page S3795]]\n\nthis legislation but must continue to do more.\n  Today I am introducing legislation to keep Federal contracts from \ngoing to businesses who knowingly hire illegal workers. My legislation \nmakes permanent, President Clinton's February 13 Executive order. \nEmployers who knowingly hire illegal workers should not benefit from \nGovernment business and tax dollars.\n  Consider the following two incidents which occurred at work sites in \nMaryland in March of this year. On March 21, INS agents arrested four \nillegal immigrants working on Fort Meade Army base. They were building \nGovernment town homes under a $24 million Federal contract. A week \nlater, INS agents arrested 12 illegal immigrants removing asbestos from \nthe Fallon Federal Building in downtown Baltimore.\n  Benedict Ferro, INS Director for the Maryland district, noted, ``* * \n* there is a willingness by employers to hire them. Without that \nwillingness, we wouldn't have this problem. It hurts, these are not \njobs that permanent residents of the United States wouldn't want. These \nare jobs that could be filled by the unemployed in Maryland.''\n  These are examples of the employers we need to focus our efforts on. \nMost employers want to comply with the law but for the few that spoil \nit for everyone, we have to have a tough strategy.\n  Any effort to stem the flow of illegal immigration into our country \ncannot succeed if the lure of U.S. jobs remains. American jobs belong \nto lawful workers. A strong worksite enforcement policy discourages \nillegal workers from crossing the border into the United States in \naddition to supporting American jobs for citizens and other legal \nworkers.\n  Curbing illegal immigration by enforcing worker protection laws has a \ndirect, if too seldom noted, policy connection. Illegal immigrants are \nfrequently subjected to subminimum wages, dangerous workplaces, long \nhours, and other poor working conditions because they are desperate for \nwork and in a weak position to insist on their rights. Knowingly hiring \nillegal immigrants both reveals, and rewards, an employer's willingness \nto break the law, and undermine wages and working conditions for legal \nworkers. My legislation would ensure that the Federal Government does \nnot reward such conduct with U.S. tax dollars.\n  Labor law enforcement not only helps ensure fairness and minimally \nacceptable employment standards in the workplace, but also helps to \nfoster a level competitive playing field for employers. Businesses who \nknowingly hire illegal workers at substandard wages and working \nconditions have an advantage over employers who do not exploit their \nworkers. INS agents note that companies are willing to hire illegal \nworkers to slash costs and increase profits. This is blatantly against \nthe law and not only unfair to American workers who need the jobs but \nto other employers who abide by the law and do not boost profits by \nexploiting their labor.\n  At the same time, by introducing this legislation, I want to make \nclear that employment discrimination will not be tolerated. Existing \nFederal laws prohibit employers from discriminating against employees \non the basis of national origin or race. Enforcement of this \nlegislation will not undermine antidiscrimination protection for legal \nworkers.\n  From its beginning, our Nation has been a land of immigrants--people \nfrom the world over seeking refuge, opportunity, and a better life for \nthemselves and their families. Like my mother, who came to Iowa from \nSlovenia. America is the land of opportunity, but America is also a \nland of responsibility. I remain adamantly opposed to discrimination at \nthe workplace but feel that we must do more to crack down on illegal \nimmigration and those who violate our laws at the expense of American \nworkers.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. \n        Craig):\n  S.J. Res. 52. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to protect the rights of victims of \ncrimes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            rights of crime victims constitutional amendment\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, April 21-27 is National Crime Victims' Rights \nWeek.\n  To ensure that crime victims are treated with fairness, dignity, and \nrespect, I rise--along with my colleague Senator Feinstein--to \nintroduce a joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment to \nestablish and protect the rights of crime victims.\n  Representative Henry Hyde will introduce a companion joint resolution \nin the House. The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a full committee \nhearing on the resolution tomorrow, Tuesday, April 23. And I would like \nto thank Senator Hatch for recognizing the importance of this issue and \nmoving so quickly to hold hearings. This should be a signal to my \ncolleagues and to all America that the time for justice for crime \nvictims is at hand.\n  The proposed constitutional amendment will give victims fundamental \nrights to be informed, present, and heard at critical stages throughout \ntheir case, and the rights to a speedy trial, reasonable protection, \nand full restitution from the convicted offender--the least the system \nowes to those it failed to protect.\n  The text of the amendment is clear and straightforward. It reads:\n\n       Section 1. To ensure that the victim is treated with \n     fairness, dignity, and respect, from the occurrence of a \n     crime of violence and other crimes as may be defined by law \n     pursuant to section 2 of this article, and throughout the \n     criminal, military, and juvenile justice processes, as a \n     matter of fundamental rights to liberty, justice, and due \n     process, the victim shall have the following rights: to be \n     informed of and given the opportunity to be present at every \n     proceeding in which those rights are extended to the accused \n     or convicted offender; to be heard at any proceeding \n     involving sentencing, including the right to object to a \n     previously negotiated plea, or release from custody; to be \n     informed of any release or escape; and to a speedy trial, a \n     final conclusion free from unreasonable delay, full \n     restitution from the convicted offender, reasonable measures \n     to protect the victim from violence or intimidation by the \n     accused or convicted offender, and notice of the victim's \n     rights.\n       Section 2. The several States, with respect to a proceeding \n     in a State forum, and the Congress with respect to a \n     proceeding in a United States forum, shall have the power to \n     implement further the rights established in this article by \n     appropriate legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, these simple words will help to restore justice to a \nsystem fraught with injustice.\n\n\n                                Support\n\n  The amendment is supported by major national victims' rights groups: \nParents of Murdered Children, Mothers Against Drunk Driving [MADD], the \nNational Organization for Victim Assistance, the National Victim \nCenter, the National Victims' Constitutional Amendment Network, the \nVictim Assistance Legal Organization, and the Doris Tate Crime Victims \nBureau.\n\n\n     Need to Protect victims' rights--scales of justice imbalanced\n\n  There is a need to protect victims' rights because the scales of \njustice are imbalanced.\n  Those accused of crime have many constitutionally protected rights; \nThey are innocent until proven guilty; they have the right to due \nprocess; right to confront witnesses; right against self-incrimination; \nright to a jury trial; right to a speedy trial; right to counsel; right \nto be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.\n  Yet, despite rights for the accused, the U.S. Constitution, our \nhighest law, does not protect the rights of crime victims.\n  The recognized symbol of justice is a figure holding a balanced set \nof scales, but in reality the scales are heavily weighed on the side of \nthe accused. These protections are sadly one-sided. My proposal will \nnot deny or infringe any constitutional right of any person accused or \nconvicted of a crime. But it will add to the body of rights we all \nenjoy as Americans.\n  Each year, about 43 million Americans are victims of serious crime. \nThese victims have no constitutional rights. They are often treated as \nmere inconveniences, forced to view the process from the sidelines. \nDefendants can be present through their entire trial because they have \na constitutional right to be there. But in many trials, victims are \nordered to leave the courtroom.\n  Victims often are not informed of critical proceedings, such as \nhearings to consider releasing a defendant on bail or allowing him to \nplea bargain to a reduced charge. Even when victims find out about \nthese proceedings, they\n\n[[Page S3796]]\n\nfrequently have no opportunity to speak.\n  Today, victims have no right to reasonable finality. It is not \nuncommon for cases to last years and years after the jury verdict, \nwhile courts again and again review the same issue. These lengthy \ndelays cause terrible suffering for crime victims, especially the loved \nones of homicide victims. What others consider as a mere inconvenience \ncan be an endless nightmare for the victim.\n\n\n                            Patricia Pollard\n\n  Consider the case of Patricia Pollard--a woman from my home State of \nArizona. In July 1974, on a road just outside of Flagstaff, AZ, \nPatricia Pollard was silenced--first by an attacker, and then by the \njudicial system. Eric Mageary used the jagged edge of a ripped beer can \nto inflict deep slash wounds in her body. He broke her ribs and her \njaw. He choked her into unconsciousness and left her for dead by the \nside of the road.\n  Patricia survived. Mageary was convicted and sent to prison. Ten \nyears short of serving his minimum sentence, he was paroled. No notice \nwas given to Patricia. If given the opportunity, Patricia would have \nwanted to tell the judge about the crime, about how dangerous Mageary \nwas, and how a long prison sentence was needed to protect the community \nfrom this vicious criminal. But the law gave Patricia no right to be \nheard, and society paid for its silencing of her. Mageary's parole was \nsoon revoked for serious narcotics violations, and he was back in \nprison.\n  In 1990, the people of Arizona amended their State constitution to \nadd a victims' bill of rights, which established the right of victims \nto be informed, present, and heard at every critical stage in their \ncase.\n  Incredibly, in 1993, in direct violation of Patricia's new \nconstitutional rights, the parole board voted to release Mageary--again \nwithout hearing from Patricia.\n  But this time there was a remedy for this injustice. An action was \nfiled to stop the release and force the board to hold another hearing \nin which Patricia's rights would be protected. The Arizona Court of \nAppeals acted swiftly and stopped the release. The second time around, \nafter the board took the time to hear directly about the horrible \nnature of the crime, they voted for public safety and for Patricia, and \nkept Mageary behind bars. Without constitutional rights for Patricia, \nthe safety of the community would have been jeopardized again.\n\n  Constitutional rights restored Patricia's voice. Not all Americans \nhave these rights, and even those that exist are not protected by the \nsupreme law of the land, the U.S. Constitution. That is why today, \nduring National Crime Victims' Rights Week, Senator Feinstein and I are \nintroducing a victims' bill of rights to the U.S. Constitution to \nextend to victims throughout the country a threshold of basic fairness. \nVictims must be given a voice--not a veto, but a real opportunity to \nstand and speak for justice and the law abiding in our communities.\n\n\n                               statistics\n\n  Patricia Pollard is not an isolated example. As I noted earlier, each \nyear 43 million Americans are victims of serious crime, according to \nthe Department of Justice.\n  According to DOJ statistics released last week, during 1994 there \nwere 10.9 million violent crimes, 6.6 million simple assaults, 2.5 \nmillion aggravated assaults, 1.3 million robberies, and 430,000 rapes \nor other types of sexual assault. Also, one of every nine persons from \n12 through 15 years old was a violent crime victim during 1994.\n  And just this week the Clinton administration reported that crime \ncosts Americans at least $450 billion a year.\n  These numbers are staggering and sobering. And they demonstrate the \nenormous burden that crime forces its victims to carry.\n  The breakdown of social order and the crisis of crime that accompany \nit, have swelled the ranks of criminals, and those who suffer at their \nhands, to proportions that astonish us, that break our hearts, and that \ndemand collective action. And the process of detecting, prosecuting, \nand punishing criminals continues, in too many places in America, to \nignore the rights of victims to fundamental justice.\n\n\n              twenty states have constitutional amendments\n\n  The need for a constitutional amendment was first recognized in 1982 \nby a President's Task Force on Victims of Crime, which concluded that \nthe criminal justice system has lost its essential balance. Since then, \n20 States have adopted victims' amendments.\n  The average electoral support for these amendments was 78 percent. In \n1994, six States approved constitutional amendments--all by landslides: \nAlabama, 80 percent; Alaska, 87 percent; Idaho, 79 percent; Maryland, \n92 percent; Ohio, 77 percent; and Utah, 68 percent.\n  But this patchwork of State constitutional amendments is inadequate. \nA Federal amendment would establish a basic floor of victims' rights--a \nfloor below which States could not go.\n\n\n            victims need rights in the federal constitution\n\n  Some may say, ``I'm all for victims' rights but they don't need to be \nin the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution is too hard to change. All \nwe need to do is pass some good statutes to make sure that victims are \ntreated fairly.''\n  But statutes have not worked to restore balance and fairness for \nvictims. The Federal Government has well-written statutes that were \nintended to establish rights for victims in Federal proceedings. Yet \nthe promise of those statutes lies largely unfulfilled. The whole \nhistory of our country teaches us that constitutions are needed to \nprotect the basic rights of the people. The original Bill of Rights was \nadopted to guarantee that the Federal Government would never infringe \non inalienable rights enjoyed by the people--neither at the hands of an \noverreaching executive nor an inflamed majority in Congress. Some \nargued that because the Federal Government did not possess the power in \nthe Constitution to infringe these rights, the express protection of \nthem in the Constitution was unnecessary. History soon taught us the \nwisdom of including the Bill of Rights.\n  Who would be comfortable now if the right to free speech, or a free \npress, or to peaceably assemble, or any of our other rights were \nsubject to the whims of changing legislative or court majorities? When \nthe rights to vote were extended to all regardless of race, and to \nwomen, were they simply put into a statute? Who would dare stand before \na crowd of people anywhere in our country and say that a defendant's \nrights to a lawyer, a speedy public trial, due process, to be informed \nof the charges, to confront witnesses, to remain silent, or any of the \nother constitutional protections are important, but don't need to be in \nthe Constitution?\n\n  Such a position would be rightly subject to ridicule. Yet that is \nprecisely what critics of the victims' bill of rights would tell crime \nvictims. Victims of crime will never be treated fairly by a system that \npermits the defendant's constitutional rights always to trump the \nprotections given to victims. Such a system forever would make victims \nsecond-class citizens. It is precisely because the Constitution is hard \nto change that basic rights for victims need to be protected in it.\n  Our criminal justice system needs the kind of fundamental reform that \ncan only be accomplished through changes in our fundamental law. Today \nwe have a system of justice that accommodates the interests of its \nprofessionals fairly well, but it all too often treats its citizens, \nits victims, with hostility, and almost always with indifference. \nAttitudes will not change without a constitutional reform that \nrecognizes the rights of victims as a core value.\n\n\n      Amending the constitution is a big step, but a necessary one\n\n  Amending the Constitution is, of course, a big step--one which I do \nnot take lightly--but, on this issue, it is a necessary one.\n  As Thomas Jefferson once said:\n\n       I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and \n     constitutions, but laws and institutions must go hand in hand \n     with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more \n     developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new \n     truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the \n     change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to \n     keep pace with the times.\n\n\n                               Conlcusion\n\n  In closing, I would like to thank Senator Dianne Feinstein for her \nhard work on this amendment and for her tireless efforts on behalf of \ncrime victims.\n  Mr. President, for far too long, the criminal justice system has \nignored\n\n[[Page S3797]]\n\ncrime victims who deserve to be treated with fairness, dignity, and \nrespect. Our criminal justice system will never be truly just as long \nas criminals have rights and victims have none. We need a new \ndefinition of justice--one that includes the victim.\n  Today, as we begin National Victims' Rights Week, in courtrooms \nacross America, victims will be forced to sit outside while their \nattackers are tried. Today and every day, critical proceedings will be \nheld in criminal cases and victims will not be informed of those \nproceedings or given the opportunity for their voices to be heard. \nToday, and every day, victims will be forced to endure endless delays.\n  Mr. President, with this joint resolution, we can cure this \ninjustice. Victims groups across America support this effort and are \nwatching to see if Congress has the will to make this Victims' Rights \nWeek truly a celebration for crime victims.\n\n

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nnovel approach one business in my State has undertaken to educate the \npublic about the high Federal tax burden suffered by working families \nin our country.\n  The Lockwood Companies, based in Bingham Farms, are a group of seven \nconstruction, housing-material procurement, and development services \nfirms. In the past 50 years, Lockwood has built more than $1.25 billion \nof housing in Michigan, including affordable and luxury multifamily \nhousing, as well as independent living, assisted, and skilled care \ncommunities. In the previous 2 years, Lockwood has been Michigan's \nleading apartment builder.\n  In early 1995, Lockwood management was discussing the high, unfair \ntax burden imposed upon average employees. Someone observed a major \nproblem in our country is the general lack of public awareness as to \nhow high our tax rates actually have risen. A suggestion was given that \nsome sort of creative effort be made to highlight Tax Freedom Day.\n  Tax Freedom Day is determined each year by the Tax Foundation, a \nnonpartisan, nonprofit, public policy research group based in \nWashington, DC. Tax Freedom Day is estimated to be the day average \nAmericans must work to from January 1 just to pay their Federal, State, \nand local taxes for that year.\n  To exemplify just how much taxes have risen over the years, I point \nout that in 1944, the year Lockwood was founded, Tax Freedom Day would \nhave been March 30. In 1995, Tax Freedom Day was May 7, more than 5 \nweeks later.\n  To draw attention to this situation, Lockwood management devised the \nidea of an employee strike on Tax Freedom Day, and declared it a paid \ncompany holiday. Lockwood's protest last year drew significant media \ncoverage, both local and national.\n  Encouraged by the positive response, Lockwood will again this year \npublicize Tax Freedom Day giving its employees a paid day off. Among \nthe other Michigan companies that have been persuaded to join in this \nyear's protest and do likewise are Sartech Distribution & Building \nSupply, Jordan Oliver Building Systems, and Schneider & Smith \nArchitects.\n  In announcing Lockwood's repeat observance of Tax Freedom Day, \nPresident Rodney Lockwood said his firm has, ``helped start more than \n10 new woman- and minority-owned companies by awarding them contracts, \nsupplying funding, or training their workers . . . If the tax situation \nwere more favorable, we could help even more companies because we'd \nhave more money available for that kind of discretionary spending.''\n  Undoubtedly, countless other job providers in Michigan and the rest \nof the country would appreciate tax relief that would allow them to \nassist fledgling small businesses as well.\n  The Lockwood Companies' unique manner of protesting high levels of \ntaxation deserves to be recognized. Increased awareness of the \noppressive tax burden on American families can only yield positive \nresults. The Lockwood Companies, and those who will strike alongside \nwith them this year, are providing an invaluable public education, and \nI commend their efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3798-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3798-S3801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CHINA: WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I recently delivered a speech \nto the World Affairs Council of Los Angeles. I took the opportunity to \nlay out some of the areas in which I believe the United States needs to \nimprove its policy toward the People's Republic of China. I thought my \ncolleagues would find this speech to be of interest. I ask that the \nfull text of the speech be printed in the Record.\n  The speech follows:\n\n                    China: Where Do We Go From Here?\n\n  (Remarks of U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein to World Affairs Council, \n                            April 11, 1996)\n\n       It is a great pleasure to be in the City of Los Angeles. \n     And it is my honor to be introduced by such a distinguished \n     resident of this great city.\n       I'm delighted to be at the World Affairs Council, I've had \n     the privilege of speaking at the World Affairs Council in San \n     Francisco on several occasions, but never in this major \n     capital city, so I'm delighted to be here.\n       I want to share with you today some candid thoughts that I \n     have about what I believe to be one of the most important \n     issues for peace and stability in the world today: The\n\n[[Page S3799]]\n\n     current crisis in negotiations on Sino-American relations, \n     and to discuss for a moment how we can forge a new, and \n     better, era in this important relationship.\n       One hundred years from now, I have no doubt that when \n     historians look back, the remarkable rise of China as a world \n     power will be considered one of the most important \n     international events of the latter half of the twentieth \n     century.\n       More than the tragic war in Bosnia, more than the unsteady \n     march toward peace in the Middle East, more even than the \n     collapse of the Soviet Union, China's ascendence as a great \n     power--and the content and quality of U.S.-Chinese \n     relations--will shape the direction of global history in the \n     Pacific Century.\n       Following what the Chinese view as a ``century of \n     humiliation'' at the hands of western imperial powers, and \n     fifty years of war-lord rivalries, revolution, and economic \n     stagnation, China today is poised at the brink of a \n     remarkable renaissance.\n       For close to two decades the Chinese economy has grown by a \n     staggering 10% a year. China is now the world's 11th largest \n     exporter--that's where Japan was in 1980--and moving up fast. \n     By most estimates, by early in the next century China will \n     have the world's largest economy.\n       In a little more than a decade, U.S. trade with China has \n     grown from some $1.2 billion to over $50 billion per year. \n     China has emerged as a major presence on the world stage.\n       It is a shame that we do not have the benefit of the \n     hindsight that our children and grandchildren will have, \n     because I believe that most Americans--including many \n     policymakers--do not understand the magnitude or breadth of \n     the changes currently underway in China and what they mean \n     for the future peace and stability of Asia and, yes, the \n     world.\n\n\n                          U.S. Policy Missteps\n\n       This fundamental lack of understanding is unfortunate--and \n     could turn out to be tragic--because how we manage our \n     relationship with China will have a greater effect on \n     stability in Asia and peace in the world than nearly anything \n     else we do.\n       In recent months U.S.-China relations have reached perhaps \n     their lowest level since President Nixon's historic trip to \n     China in 1972. Our relationship is plagued by tensions in \n     nearly every area in which we interact: a large trade \n     imbalance; China's failure to curb pirating of U.S. \n     intellectual property; China's transfers of sensitive \n     weapons, nuclear materials and technology to Pakistan, Iran, \n     and others; clashing visions of human rights; most \n     importantly, U.S. concerns about Taiwan, Hong Kong, and \n     Tibet, these are perceived as deep threats to Chinese \n     sovereignty.\n       This situation is made even more complicated by domestic \n     politics in both countries.\n       In the U.S., the relationship between China and the U.S. \n     has been buffeted by the vicissitudes of a Presidential \n     election year and provocative Congressional actions. For \n     example, the recent Department of State Authorization \n     Conference Bill contains ill-advised policy mandates, \n     including an invitation for a 1996 visit by Lee Teng-hui to \n     the U.S. ``with all appropriate courtesies,'' and an \n     elevation of the Taiwan office in Washington.\n       In China, the lingering of Deng Xiaoping has prevented, in \n     a sense, the cementing of new leadership, resulting in \n     jockeying and in-fighting among China's political hierarchy. \n     It is difficult for any Chinese leader to take bold action to \n     improve relations with the United States for fear of being \n     accused of weakness.\n       Fundamental to the worsening of relations between our two \n     countries is the lack of any conceptual framework or long-\n     term strategy on the part of the U.S. policy with respect to \n     China--a strategy which sets specific goals for the \n     relationship five and ten years down the road.\n       Instead, U.S. policy has been reactive and ``event-\n     driven,'' responding to whatever happens to be the current \n     revelation, which generally concerns human rights. This calls \n     into question our entire relationship with China each time we \n     lurch from crisis to crisis.\n       A whole host of events have contributed to the current \n     downward spiral in our relations: Tiananmen Square, the sale \n     of F-16's to Taiwan, Congressional opposition to China's bid \n     for the Olympics, U.S. opposition to the construction of \n     Three Gorges Dam project, and Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui's \n     visit to the United States last year.\n       Each of these events has helped create the current \n     atmosphere. Let me say a few words about why these events \n     were so important.\n       Americans were understandably horrified by the globally-\n     televised scenes of Chinese tanks advancing on unarmed \n     civilians at Tiananmen Square in 1989. Unfortunately, those \n     images have come to color our perception of nearly every \n     aspect of the U.S. relationship with China. For most \n     Americans Tiananmen Square is all they know of the China of \n     today.\n       In the wake of Tiananmen, the U.S. made a number of policy \n     decisions that further antagonized China. In 1992, for \n     example, President Bush, who understands China better than \n     most Americans, made what, I believe, was an unfortunate \n     decision to sell 150 F-16 aircraft to Taiwan.\n       The sale, announced during an election campaign, was made \n     without strong evidence that Taiwan faced a significantly \n     enhanced threat from China that made these advanced military \n     planes necessary. For China, the sale was a violation of the \n     ``One China'' policy which has been the bedrock of Sino-\n     American relations since 1972.\n       China put forth an extensive effort to host the Summer \n     Olympic games in 2000: they built a large stadium, apartments \n     and several other facilities, and made a strong pitch to the \n     International Olympic Committee. This was going to be China's \n     introduction to the world--a moment of great national pride.\n       But, the U.S. reaction was distinctly negative. The House \n     of Representatives passed a resolution urging the IOC not to \n     give the games to Beijing and a majority of U.S. Senators \n     sent a letter urging denial to the IOC. The IOC decided, by \n     one vote, to give the games to Sydney, Australia, and, again, \n     China felt the sting of humiliation.\n       Another American effort to thwart Chinese development, from \n     China's perspective, has been our reaction to the Three \n     Gorges Dam project. This massive undertaking, designed to \n     generate power for the enormous Chinese market, is considered \n     a critical step in China's economic development program.\n       Anyone that has been to Beijing has seen the choking clouds \n     of high sulfur coal dust and lacking sufficient power for the \n     basic necessities of life for millions of its people, the \n     Three Gorges Dam represents an important national priority \n     for the Chinese. But the United States has criticized the \n     project, on environmental grounds and last year the \n     Administration indicated it would oppose multilateral and \n     U.S. financing of Three Gorges.\n       The current crisis in U.S.-China relations came to a head \n     last year with the U.S. decision to allow Taiwanese President \n     Lee Teng-hui to visit the United States last summer to \n     receive an honorary degree at Cornell University.\n       The Administration had told the Chinese--as late as May of \n     last year--that allowing the visit would be inconsistent with \n     the United States' longstanding ``One China'' policy. \n     Congress then voted overwhelmingly--myself included--to allow \n     this ``private'' visit, and the Administration changed its \n     policy about the visa.\n       The Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, learned of the decision \n     by reading it in the newspaper, as he told me when I visited \n     him in August. You can imagine what the impact was.\n       President Lee's visit, although billed as a private visit, \n     turned out to be much more than that. Members of the Senate \n     met him, he spoke at Cornell and spoke about opportunity for \n     representation in the United Nations. Again generating a deep \n     visceral reaction within the Chinese leadership, not only \n     within the leadership, and this is what Americans must come \n     to understand, but within the Chinese people itself. And this \n     gave rise to a new wave of nationalism among its people. The \n     Chinese showed their anger by overreaction-- engaging in \n     missile tests and live ammunition war games in the Taiwan \n     Straits just prior to the Taiwanese elections.\n       These provocative and unneccessary actions prompted \n     President Clinton to place two carrier groups in the \n     immediate area, sending a clear message that the U.S. would \n     not tolerate military action against Taiwan.\n       It is clear that none of us fully understood the depth to \n     which Taiwan presents a deep and fundamental sovereign \n     imperative to China. We must understand this if we are to \n     deal directly with China.\n       These events, occurring against a background of little \n     dialogue between our two nations and constant criticisms in \n     the American press, added to the strain and distance.\n       The Chinese, for their part, have contributed to the \n     downward spiral in our relations by failing to carry out \n     commitments made. For example, China's failure to carry out \n     last year's Intellectual Property Rights agreement signed \n     last May has cost American copyright-holders over $2 billion \n     in 1995, and less than full compliance with nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation and violations of missile reduction treaties \n     are areas which have drawn considerable and legitimate U.S. \n     concern.\n\n\n                       The Costs of U.S. Missteps\n\n       The consequence of this confused and reactive relationship \n     is that --precisely at the time when we should be doing \n     everything we can to strengthen and encourage reform in China \n     by increasing relations with the West--some in China believe \n     that the U.S. is intentionally encouraging China's increasing \n     hardline attitudes with the purpose of pushing China toward \n     an adversarial posture reminiscent of Cold War years with the \n     Soviet Union.\n       As you know, a long, drawn-out leadership struggle has been \n     going on in China for the past several years as the elderly \n     Deng Xiaoping has disappeared from public life. Although a \n     new leadership is in place, competitive forces within that \n     leadership appear to be growing stronger. Hardline actions \n     are more prevalent.\n       For example,\n       China's provocative war games in the Taiwan Straits leading \n     up to the Taiwanese election.\n       China's continued provision of sensitive nuclear and \n     missile technology to Pakistan.\n       The increasingly strong rhetoric toward Hong Kong, such as \n     announcing that the elected Legislative Council will be \n     dissolved and that Hong Kong civil servants will be required \n     to take an oath of loyalty to Beijing.\n       And just last week, when Chinese police tried to stop \n     fundraising for Chinese orphanages at a dinner attended by \n     U.S. Ambassador James Sasser and prevented Chinese-American \n     author Amy Tan from delivering a speech.\n\n[[Page S3800]]\n\n       Additionally, U.S. policy has not enabled those within the \n     Chinese leadership who favor greater cooperation with the \n     West to advance their program. In my conversations with \n     President Jiang Zemin and Executive Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, \n     I have become convinced of their genuine desire to reach out \n     to the United States and build a much more cooperative \n     relationship. In fact, Deng Xiaoping himself, empowered Jiang \n     Zemin to be in charge of American relations and this was \n     ratified by the 14th People's Congress.\n       But to do that, they need our help. They need to be able to \n     engage in a genuine dialogue with U.S. leaders, at the very \n     highest levels. Our President and the President of China need \n     to be able to sit and talk face-to-face, and to pick up the \n     phone and call one another on a regular basis. But they do \n     not yet have that kind of relationship.\n       When the Administration decided not to invite President \n     Jiang Zemin to Washington for a state visit, I believe we \n     lost a valuable opportunity to give ``face'' and support to a \n     moderate, pro-Western leader, thereby enabling the Chinese to \n     see greater value in increased ties and pro-Western views.\n\n\n                       Most-Favored Nation Status\n\n       In approximately two months, Congress will consider whether \n     to grant the President's request to renew China's Most-\n     Favored Nation trading status. I believe this issue will \n     spark a definitive debate in the Congress on the future of \n     the United States' China policy.\n       The political implications of revoking MFN for China are \n     great, and dangerous. Revoking MFN would be seen, I believe, \n     as a complete break in U.S.-Chinese cooperation.\n       For a country such as China, where face and respect are \n     such central issues, revoking MFN--a trading status the U.S. \n     grants to all but a handful of rogue nations--would be seen \n     as tantamount to the United States telling China that we no \n     longer accept them as a member of the family of nations. More \n     importantly, thousands of businesses and millions of jobs in \n     this country and in China who are now dependent on MFN status \n     would be lost. To deny it would be shooting ourselves in the \n     foot. Also, our ability to work with the Chinese on other \n     trade issues, on Asian security, on non-proliferation, on \n     Taiwan, and on human rights would be severely diminished, if \n     not incapacitated.\n\n\n                       Where Do We Go From Here?\n\n       Many of you may be wondering if there is anything we can do \n     to repair a relationship that many feel has already been \n     irreparably harmed. As a Chinese proverb goes, ``Laughter \n     cannot bring back what anger has driven away.'' But there is \n     another Chinese proverb that is perhaps more relevant--``By \n     hard work one can succeed in moving two mountains to open a \n     road.''\n       First, we must elevate the importance of the relationship \n     with China. President Clinton, Secretary Christopher and high \n     officials must become much more directly involved. With \n     China, in many cases, the messenger is as important as the \n     message.\n       Most Americans know little of China and less about the \n     importance of this relationship. The President must speak to \n     Americans directly of the importance of this relationship and \n     make the case for an improved relationship to the American \n     people. He has not done so thus far. It must be done.\n       Secondly, Secretary Christopher who has visited China only \n     once, must devote to this relationship the same time and \n     energy as he has so effectively applied in the Middle East.\n       Third, we must realize that despite recent tensions, China \n     and the United States have many more common interests than is \n     generally realized, and we must build on those common \n     interests.\n       Four areas in which our shared interests outweigh our \n     differences include: Taiwan, trade, security and nuclear non-\n     proliferation, and improving the quality of life for people.\n       Taiwan: The role of the United States in constructing a \n     relationship between China and Taiwan must, by necessity, be \n     supportive. We should not attempt to impose a solution on \n     either party. The United States can, however, provide the \n     underlying stability for Chinese-Taiwanese cooperation by \n     continually and publicly reaffirming our commitment to a \n     ``One China'' policy.\n       We must also continue to encourage China to refrain from \n     aggressive military actions and rhetoric. The key to a \n     solution remains peaceful reunification. How and when that \n     takes place is up to the two parties involved. Our interest \n     must be to see that peace is maintained, to encourage the two \n     sides to talk, to be an honest broker.\n       Both Taiwan and China should be encouraged to restart the \n     Cross-Strait Initiative that was conducted by China's \n     Association for Relations across the Taiwan Strait and \n     Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation. This dialogue showed \n     much promise until it was derailed last summer. Even at the \n     nadir of relations earlier this year, Chinese Prime Minister \n     Li Peng renewed President Jiang Zemin's offer from last year \n     for a Taiwan-China summit. And the Chinese offer to begin \n     direct air, sea, and postal service with Taiwan can only be \n     beneficial.\n       Trade: Trade issues have all too often become flashpoints \n     in U.S.-China relations, with blame to be shared by both \n     sides.\n       This past January, while I was in Beijing, Executive Vice \n     Premier Zhu Rongji, who is in charge of Central Economic \n     Planning, told us that, effective this month, China will \n     lower tariffs by 34% across the board and bring its tariff \n     rate schedule in line with the average of developing \n     countries within two years.\n       Our Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, told me that he is \n     now reviewing this proposed schedule. The U.S. should work \n     with China to increase U.S. exports to China, now growing at \n     a rate of 17% per year. China states it wants to increase \n     U.S. exports, and this would lower our trade deficit with \n     China. The U.S. should also review provisions of our laws \n     which restrict high value exports.\n       At the same time, the United States should continue to \n     insist that China live up to fair trade policies, in \n     particular, its agreements to protect U.S. intellectual \n     property rights. For example China must prevent the illegal \n     production of pirated CDS, CD-ROMs, and Lds.\n       The best way to accomplish this goal is the development of \n     joint ventures between U.S. copyright holders and Chinese \n     manufacturers, which could transform factories from illegal \n     to legal operations with little job cost. In January, I \n     presented to both the President, the Executive Vice Premier \n     and to the Trade Minister, a letter from the Recording \n     Industries of America containing a proposal that six major \n     American copyright holders are prepared to enter into such \n     joint agreements.\n       As I left China and was in Hong Kong, I noted that a \n     Chinese representative said, ``but we already have these \n     joint ventures.'' And that is exactly the key, the joint \n     ventures are not with the copyright holders, and in order to \n     carry out the intent of the law the venture must be with the \n     U.S. copyright holder.\n       As the world's 11th largest exporter and moving up fast, \n     China's entry into the World Trade Organization is strongly \n     in the United States' interests and holds the best promise \n     for preventing trade disputes from escalating into major \n     conflicts. Although it will take time, we need to continue to \n     work with China to help them develop the commercial legal \n     structure and fair trade policies that are necessary for \n     their membership in that organization.\n       Security: It is vital that China be engaged in a new \n     security partnership, one that is cooperative rather than \n     confrontational. With more than a fifth of the world's \n     population, a permanent seat on the United Nations Security \n     Council, and an arsenal of nuclear weapons and \n     intercontinental ballistic missiles, isolating China is a \n     very dangerous course.\n       Such a partnership suggests that China be encouraged to \n     become an active and responsible party to international \n     organizations, treaties, and regimes. As such, China should \n     be granted an equal say in setting the ``rules of the game.'' \n     The corollary of this, of course, is that China must agree to \n     abide by those rules.\n       One area that immediately suggests itself as a testing \n     ground for this type of partnership is the threat of nuclear \n     proliferation in South Asia. China was helpful in preventing \n     nuclear proliferation in North Korea, a situation that still \n     remains problematic.\n       It is also clearly in the interests of both China and the \n     United States to ensure that tensions are de-escalated in the \n     highly unstable India-Pakistan relationship. Both India and \n     Pakistan have the ability to launch 10 to 20 kiloton nuclear \n     devices, that is twice the size of Hiroshima, in a matter of \n     weeks. Both countries are on China's Southern border, and \n     both suffer from major internal instability. Acting alongside \n     other local and regional powers, the United States and China \n     must work together to de-escalate growing tensions between \n     these two countries.\n       Quality of Life: Finally, despite the bad press that China \n     has received in this country of late regarding human rights, \n     I believe that here too there is opportunity for progress. \n     However, to believe that China will change its ways merely to \n     please America is naive. The real key to change is convincing \n     China that it is in China's interests to change.\n       We have tried lecturing China on individual human rights \n     cases, and have found that method to be unsuccessful. A more \n     productive approach would be to work with China to develop an \n     independent judicial system that can guarantee due process \n     and the rule of law--an area in which China has asked for our \n     help.\n       By engaging China in a larger dialogue about good \n     governance, through exchange programs, assistance in the \n     drafting of criminal and commercial codes, and in \n     establishing an independent judiciary with due process of \n     law, we will do much more to advance the cause of human \n     rights in China in the long run than through constant \n     castigation.\n       Even without our help, China is moving in this direction. \n     Last month, the National People's Congress enacted \n     legislation that provides individuals greater protection from \n     arbitrary punishment by police and government agencies, which \n     sets stricter standards on government agencies for imposing \n     fines and fees, and which requires the ruling State Council \n     to secure the approval of the People's Congress before \n     declaring martial law.\n       Evidence of the past twenty years suggests that China is \n     changing. You must remember back to the 1960's, when 10-15 \n     million people were harmed or lost their lives. When I first \n     went to China in 1979, it was impossible to have an open \n     political discussion. People were simply too afraid.\n       Last month, international journalists openly interviewed \n     ordinary Chinese citizens\n\n[[Page S3801]]\n\n     on the street about their views of the Taiwanese elections. \n     Some supported the government's response, others did not. \n     This change should not be underestimated. It is the \n     unavoidable result of improving conditions and interaction \n     with the West.\n       One has but to look back at the Cultural Revolution of 35 \n     years ago to see the contrast and improvement in freedoms, in \n     the increasing standard of living, wages and savings, and \n     better education of the people, to know that things are \n     changing and improving. As Minister of Trade Wu Yi said to \n     me, ``It isn't easy to go from a China which has been ruled \n     by man for 5000 years to a China ruled by law.'' And that is \n     what is happening.\n       With the Taiwan elections behind us, we now have the \n     opportunity to move past some of the events that soured Sino-\n     American relations earlier this year.\n       To do this, President Clinton must immerse himself fully in \n     the details of this most delicate and critical of American \n     relations. In the final analysis, the goal of American policy \n     must be to encourage China toward a full and active \n     relationship with the West and to work together toward a \n     China that is able to take its role as a stable leader of \n     peace and security in Asia, and an America that can be her \n     ally.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3798-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY TRIBUTE TO PRESIDENT LEE TENG-HUI, \n                   PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to call my \ncolleagues' attention to a recent event hosted by the National \nEndowment for Democracy honoring the first popularly elected President \nof the Republic of China, Lee Teng-hui. I was honored to serve as a \ncosponsor of this event with Senator Lieberman.\n  It is entirely appropriate that this reception was organized by the \nNational Endowment for Democracy [NED]. The recent direct, free and \nfair multiparty election for President in Taiwan is a model example of \nthe activities supported by NED. I want to use this occasion to \ncongratulate the NED for its continued involvement in encouraging free \nand democratic institutions throughout the world through private sector \ninitiatives. A copy of the National Endowment for Democracy's tribute \nto President Lee is included at the end of my statement.\n  Americans everywhere should congratulate the people of Taiwan in \ncasting ballots to complete their transition to a democracy during \ntrying times--the first such transition in Chinese history. It is a \ntribute to the people's spirit and determination that bullets did not \ndeter people from casting their ballots. And President Lee, who \nreceived 54 percent of the vote, can proudly take credit for having led \nTaiwan to this important juncture. He has set an example in leading his \ncountrymen in deciding that the leadership of Taiwan will forever more \nbe settled at the ballot box.\n  His victory on March 23 culminated a series of reforms--including \nlifting martial law, deregulating the media, legalizing opposition \nparties, and holding popular elections for all parliamentary seats--\nthat have taken place in a peaceful and prosperous environment. This is \nan accomplishment for which all the free world should be proud.\n  President Lee deserves not only our well-wishes, but also our \ncontinued support as he now moves forward to map out Taiwan's destiny. \nAs Taiwan continues to emerge as a force for democracy, freedom, and \nstability in Asia, I believe the United States should encourage their \nefforts to be represented in international organizations such as the \nWorld Trade Organization. The United States should also do what it can \nto encourage dialog between Taiwan and Beijing, and to contribute to \npeace and stability in the region.\n  I join my many friends in Taiwan in celebrating President Lee's \ntriumph as Taiwan marks a milestone in civilization's march down the \nroad of self-determination leading to liberty, human dignity, and \npersonal and societal fulfillment.\n  I ask that a statement from the National Endowment for Democracy be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The statement follows:\n\n                   Tribute to President Lee Teng-hui\n\n       (By the National Endowment for Democracy, April 16, 1996)\n\n       The election of Lee Teng-hui on March 23, 1996, as the \n     first popularly elected President of the Republic of China \n     was the culmination of a 10-year process of transition which \n     The Encyclopedia of Democracy has called ``a political \n     miracle in twentieth-century Chinese politics, making Taiwan \n     the first Chinese democracy.'' President Lee was the central \n     figure and driving force behind this remarkable political \n     transformation.\n       From the moment he assumed the presidency on January 13, \n     1988, becoming the first native-born Taiwanese to hold this \n     office, he devoted himself entirely to the historic task of \n     democratic transformation launched by his predecessor Chiang \n     Ching-kuo. The process was at once swift and methodical, with \n     each bold step coming in the proper sequence, laying the \n     foundation for each subsequent advance.\n       Acting in the Confucian tradition of governance through \n     consensus, he initiated the process with a conference on \n     national affairs that achieved a political reconciliation \n     between his own Nationalist Part and the opposition \n     Democratic Progressive Party. There followed an agreement to \n     establish a memorial and pay compensation to the victims of \n     the uprising of February 1947; the elaboration of an approach \n     to the issue of unification which became the basis for a new, \n     pragmatic policy toward the People's Republic; the election \n     of a new National Assembly representing only the voters of \n     Taiwan that amended the constitution, preparing the way for \n     the popular election of the president and vice-president by \n     1996; the voluntary retirement from the government of the \n     party elders from the generation of Chiang Ching-kuo; and the \n     first election for provincial governor and for mayors of \n     Kaohsiung and Taipei, the race in Tapei being won by a member \n     of the DPP who was a former political dissident.\n       This stunning process of change, leading ultimately to \n     President Lee's election and the establishment of the first \n     Chinese democracy, was all the more significant because it \n     took place against a background of mounting threats from the \n     mainland--which fears a Chinese model of democracy--and \n     skepticism emanating from some capitals to the effect that \n     democracy is a Western system unsuited to Asian cultures.\n       But it is precisely on this point, having to do with the \n     roots of Chinese democracy in Confucian culture, that \n     President Lee has spoken with unusual power and eloquence. At \n     the conference on third wave democracy sponsored last August \n     by the Endowment and the Institute for National Policy \n     Research, President Lee expressed his confidence that ``by \n     injecting into our modern democratic order the political \n     precepts long inherent in Chinese culture--of exalting the \n     people's will and claiming that the government and the people \n     form a unity--we can infuse democracy with a new vitality.''\n       Lee Teng-hui is thus a unique figure in Chinese history, an \n     individual with the wisdom to understand the need to \n     integrate the two competing camps of contemporary Chinese \n     political thought: the Confucianists and the advocates of \n     Westernization. In so doing, he has embodied the Confucian \n     ideal of ren. described in the entry on Confucianism in The \n     Encyclopedia of Democracy as ``cultivating benevolence, \n     developing one's faculties, sublimating one's personality, \n     and upholding the right to education, the right to \n     subsistence, and the right to social and political mobility \n     without distinction according to class.'' Ren, according to \n     the Encyclopedia, represents ``a new democratic ideal of \n     society,''\n       It is this ideal which President Lee Teng-hui has sought \n     for his country and for the Chinese people. The National \n     Endowment for Democracy is therefore proud to honor President \n     Lee by presenting him with an embossed four-volume set of The \n     Encyclopedia of Democracy, which recognizes his extraordinary \n     contribution and confirms his philosophical vision. We do so \n     in the belief that his message of democracy and \n     reconciliation, rooted in Chinese history and culture, have \n     an enduring relevance for China's future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3801-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3801-S3802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CITIZENSHIP U.S.A. DAY IN CHICAGO\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, our Nation's immigrant heritage is \nexemplified best in the city of Chicago. Generations of immigrants, \nfrom Europe, Latin America, and more recently Asia and Africa have \nchosen to come to Chicago and have contributed immensely to the \nvitality and fabric that makes it such a great city.\n  Recently, the city of Chicago sponsored a naturalization ceremony for \n1,200 new citizens at historic Navy Pier with the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service Chicago District Office.\n  To help immigrants fully integrate into our city and our society, \nMayor Richard M. Daley established a citizenship assistance council to \nhelp thousands of immigrants complete the often complicated \nnaturalization process. The council has attracted leaders from various \nethnic communities and corporate leaders from Fannie Mae, United \nAirlines, and First Chicago. Through the citizenship council, Mayor \nDaley has committed to sponsor several large scale citizenship \nceremonies with INS in the coming months.\n  The naturalization program in the city of Chicago is truly a joint \neffort between the Federal and local government. I applaud Mayor \nDaley's effort\n\n[[Page S3802]]\n\nand ask that his speech welcoming the new U.S. citizens on March 18, \n1996, and his proclamation declaring the day to be Citizenship U.S.A. \nDay in Chicago be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n   Mayor Richard M. Daley's Remarks, Chicago Citizenship Assistance \n           Council--Naturalization Ceremony, March  18, 1996\n\n       I want to begin by congratulating everyone here on becoming \n     United States citizens.\n       As Mayor, I attend many events--but swearing-in ceremonies \n     are always very special.\n       Two years ago, I formed Chicago's Citizenship Assistance \n     Council to coordinate the efforts of community groups that \n     help immigrants become citizens. Today's ceremony is made \n     possible thanks to a strong partnership among the Citizenship \n     Assistance Council, the federal government, and the private \n     sector.\n       Together, we are working to help the INS relieve the \n     backlog of over 50,000 citizenship applications in the \n     Chicago area. People have been waiting for as long as 17 \n     months to be sworn in as citizens.\n       Throughout the year, we will work with the INS to increase \n     the number of swearing-in ceremonies to help speed up the \n     process.\n       We will conduct several large-scale citizenship ceremonies \n     in the summer and fall.\n       Our corporate leaders on the Council include Fannie Mae, \n     United Airlines, and First Chicago.\n       They will provide assistance in finding the necessary \n     facilities and help to cover associated costs.\n       This is a wonderful example of how local and federal \n     government can work with the private sector to get the job \n     done.\n       Immigrants built Chicago and our country. And the business \n     community understands this better than anyone.\n       America has always been strong because we have been a \n     beacon for people who want to work hard, make something of \n     their lives, and become Americans. We lose part of our \n     national character when we shut ourselves off to different \n     cultures.\n       Some politicians are trying to use immigrants as \n     scapegoats. They have gone beyond blaming illegal immigrants \n     for our problems--now they are even calling for more \n     restrictions on legal immigration.\n       Legislation now pending before Congress would keep U.S. \n     citizens from bringing their parents or children to this \n     country.\n       This is wrong and unfair because it tears families apart \n     and it sends the wrong message.\n       Proposed restrictions on employment-related immigration \n     will also damage our country.\n       A flexible legal immigration system is essential to our \n     economic growth and well-being.\n       Until last week, these restrictions were found in one piece \n     of legislation that dealt with all aspects of immigration.\n       I want to thank Senator Paul Simon for helping to \n     restructure that legislation into two bills--so that they \n     address legal and illegal immigration separately.\n       And, I want to encourage the members of the House to do the \n     same thing when the issue comes up for debate.\n       Immigrants help build this country--and they are still \n     making us strong. We can't turn our backs on them now.\n       I urge Congress to keep this in mind as they debate \n     restrictions on immigration.\n       Now, I'd like to read a proclamation designating March 18th \n     as ``Citizenship U.S.A. Day'' in Chicago.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              Office of the Mayor,\n\n\n                                              City of Chicago,\n\n                                      Chicago, IL, March 14, 1996.\n\n                              Proclamation\n\n       Whereas, thousands of people have left their homes in other \n     lands to come and live in America; and\n       Whereas, these immigrants have contributed their dreams, \n     labor, and talents to making America a great country filled \n     with opportunity and freedom; and\n       Whereas, these same people wish to show their commitment to \n     their new country by pledging allegiance as new citizens; and\n       Whereas, today, we acknowledge the dedication of \n     Commissioner Doris Meissner and the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service in assisting immigrants through the \n     naturalization process; and\n       Whereas, Commissioner Meissner has made citizenship a \n     priority, and has charged the Immigration Service to make \n     major improvements in the processing of applications, working \n     side by side with local governments and community \n     organizations:\n       Now, Therefore, I, Richard M. Daley, Mayor of the City of \n     Chicago, do hereby proclaim March 18, 1996, to be Citizenship \n     U.S.A.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nUniversity of Michigan ice hockey team on winning the 1995-96 NCAA \nMen's Division I Championship. With their 3-to-2 victory over Colorado \nCollege on March 30, the Wolverines captured the school's eighth NCAA \nNational Championship, and first since the 1963-64 season.\n  The win was especially significant for head coach Gordon ``Red'' \nBerenson. After 12 seasons in Ann Arbor, Berenson, already the \nwinningest coach in school history, celebrated his 300th career victory \nwith the national championship. In the past 6 seasons, the Wolverines \nhave won at least 30 games each year, the only team in college hockey \nto do so.\n  The Wolverine's accomplishments this season are certainly deserving \nof recognition. In addition to compiling an impressive 34 wins, tying a \nteam record, the Wolverines were also the CCHA Playoff Champions, CCHA \nregular season cochampions, and Great Lakes Invitational champions. In \nthe postseason, U-M's play was brilliant as well, managing three one-\ngoal victories and one shutout in three different buildings in three \ndifferent weekends on their road to the championship.\n  The 1995-96 University of Michigan men's hockey team has represented \ntheir school and themselves with distinction. Our State has every \nreason to be proud of these student-athletes, and we salute their \ndedication and excellence.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3802-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3802-S3803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the U.N. Human Rights Commission is \npreparing to consider a resolution that expresses the concern of the \ninternational community over human rights abuses in the People's \nRepublic of China. As has been well-documented over the last year by \nthe State Department, U.N. officials, and numerous human rights \norganizations, the Government of China has been responsible for an \nalarming number of human rights violations. In particular, there have \nbeen reports of arbitrary arrests and detention, torture, persecution \nof religious and ethnic minorities--particularly in Tibet, and \ncensorship of expression. The evidence clearly demonstrates a \ndeterioration in the human rights situation in China.\n  Despite this overwhelming evidence, apparently some of the members of \nthe Human Rights Commission are reluctant to support a resolution that \ncriticizes China. Unfortunately, this seems to be a response to \nintensive diplomatic pressure from Beijing. In fact, the Chinese \ndiplomatic pressure began even before a resolution was introduced at \nthe U.N. Commission.\n  At the end of March, I learned from the State Department that some \nmembers of the European Union [EU] were reconsidering their commitment \nto introduce a resolution on China at the Commission meeting this \nspring. I strongly believe that multilateral efforts, in institutions \nsuch as the Human Rights Commission, are potentially the most effective \ntool for pressuring China to improve its human rights record. \nTherefore, I authored a letter, signed by 10 of my colleagues from the \nForeign Relations Committee, urging the Europeans to maintain their \ncommitment to introduce a resolution on China at the Human Rights \nCommission. I am pleased that the EU members ultimately decided to \nintroduce this resolution, and I hope that our letter encouraged this \ndecision.\n  The European initiative, however, will be in vain if the Commission \ndoes not act upon the resolution. This is an important and opportune \nmoment for the members of the Commission to join together in a \nmultilateral effort to persuade China to improve its human rights \nrecord. I urge all member states to support the resolution. Even more \nimportantly, we must reaffirm the prerogative of the Commission to \nconsider any country's human rights record and to hold a vote on any \nresolution that is offered. That prerogative is being challenged by \nChina, which is attempting to prevent the Commission from even \nconsidering the European resolution.\n  On December 10, 1948, the U.N. General Assembly adopted the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights. For the first time in history, the \ncountries of\n\n[[Page S3803]]\n\nthe world made a commitment to recognizing international human rights. \nMotivated by a conviction to prevent future atrocities, such as those \ncommitted during World War II, this declaration defined the human \nrights basic to every human being and pledged an international effort \nto protect these rights. Since the adoption of that declaration, many \nother international conventions have been signed and ratified by the \ninternational community. These conventions address a variety of \ninternationally recognized human rights, including political and civil \nrights, the right to be free from torture or religious or ethnic \npersecution, the rights of refugees, and the rights of the child.\n  Why has the international community taken these steps to codify \ninternational human rights law? Because all societies around the world \nhave recognized these principles as standards that should govern every \nstate's behavior toward its own and other citizens. When a country \nviolates the human rights of its citizens, it should be censured by the \nentire international community. We cannot allow any country--no matter \nhow powerful or wealthy--to ignore the international legal norms of \nhuman rights. The United States has always supported the right of the \ninternational community to raise concerns over human rights violations \nin any country. In fact, last year the Government of Cuba introduced a \nresolution in the U.N. Commission on Human Rights condemning the United \nStates for human rights violations. While this resolution was obviously \nridiculous, the United States did not block a vote and the members of \nthe Commission voted against Cuba's proposal. The important message \nhere is that the United States recognizes the right of the \ninternational community to review every country's human rights record.\n  It is therefore all the more outrageous that China seeks to prevent \ninternational consideration of its own dismal human rights record. \nWhether or not countries support the resolution, which I fervently hope \nthey do, all members should reject China's effort to prevent the \nCommission from carrying out its mission of calling attention to and \ncensuring human rights violations wherever they occur around the world.\n  Mr. President, I urge all member states of the Human Rights \nCommission to vote against China's motion to prevent a vote and to \nsupport the resolution criticizing China's human rights record. It is \nonly if the international community continues to work together \nmultilaterally that we will be able to compel all countries--\nparticularly China--to uphold internationally recognized human rights \nstandards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/22/senate-section/article/S3802-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, APRIL 23, 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
