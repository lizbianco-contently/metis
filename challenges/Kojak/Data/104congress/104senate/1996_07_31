The Chair lays before the Senate \nS. 1936, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1936) to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of \n     1982.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5055\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 5055 which is \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5055.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this amendment will solve a pressing \nenvironmental problem, a major environmental problem in our Nation, a \nproblem that is looming as a liability to the taxpayers, and this will \nend an era of irresponsible delay.\n  This major environmental issue is simple to understand. That is, do \nwe want 80 nuclear waste dumps in 41 States serving 110 commercial \nreactors and defense sites across the country--near our neighbors, our \nschools and populated cities? Or do we want just one in the remote, \nunpopulated Nevada desert where we tested and exploded nuclear weapons \nfor decades?\n  Mr. President, I am going to yield some time on the amendment to the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina, the Senate President pro \ntempore, Senator Thurmond, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I thank the able Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. \n1936, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996. In 1982, Congress passed \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which directed the Department of Energy \nto develop a permanent repository for highly radioactive waste from \nnuclear powerplants and defense facilities. This act was amended in \n1987 to limit DOE's repository development activities to a single site \nat Yucca Mountain, NV. Since 1983, electric consumers have been taxed \nalmost $12 billion to finance the development of a permanent storage \nsite. Despite DOE's obligation to take title to spent nuclear fuel in \n1998, a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain will not be ready to \naccept this waste until the year 2010, at the earliest.\n  Mr. President, a July 16, 1996, Washington Post editorial states that \nthe nuclear waste storage situation is not\n\n[[Page S9210]]\n\nyet a fully urgent problem. I believe that it is a fully urgent \nproblem. Currently, nuclear waste is stored in 41 States at facilities \nthat were never intended for long-term storage. At least 23 nuclear \nreactors are nearing full storage capacity for their spent fuel. \nAccording to a Washington Post article from December 31, 1995, every \nday, 6 more tons of high-level radioactive waste pile up at the \nNation's 109 nuclear powerplants, a total of some 30,000 tons of spent \nfuel rods so far. If it were all shaped into midsize cars, it would \nfill every parking space at the Pentagon--twice over--with material \nthat will be dangerous for centuries. And there's nowhere for it to go.\n  On July 23, 1996, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit correctly ruled that DOE must begin disposing of this \nwaste by 1998. Unless we designate an appropriate storage site soon, \nDOE will be unable to safely fulfill this obligation. Without a central \ninterim site, DOE may be forced to use existing DOE facilities that are \nunsuitable for waste storage. Or, if DOE continues to evade its \nobligation to store waste by 1998, facility operators may then have to \nexpand onsite storage at an additional cost to ratepayers. Powerplants \nmay have to close down, adversely affecting the reliability of electric \nservices and depleting funding for the Federal disposal program. \nBecause DOE will fail to provide an appropriate facility for this waste \non time, we must designate a temporary central storage site \nimmediately. Anything less would be irresponsible and dangerous to the \nenvironment.\n  The most logical location for an interim site is Yucca Mountain. \nTransportation of spent nuclear fuel is a delicate undertaking, so it \nis sensible to locate an interim facility as near to the likely \npermanent facility as is possible. We have already spent 13 years and \n$6 billion to find a permanent repository site and conduct development \nactivities at Yucca Mountain. Designating a central interim storage \nfacility and continuing to develop a permanent repository at Yucca \nMountain is our most reasonable course of action.\n  S. 1936 provides a safe, efficient, and responsible means for \nreaching this objective. I would like to commend Senator Craig and \nSenator Murkowski for their excellent work on this bill, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of final passage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. Again, I thank the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair and I thank my good friend and \ncolleague for his support in addressing once and for all the issue of \nhigh-level nuclear waste in this country.\n  Mr. President, I think it is significant to reflect that at last we \nhave in our extended debate with our good friends from Nevada basically \nbroken the filibuster on this issue. Today the Senate is going to have \nthe chance to debate the issue and reach conclusions. We are \ndemonstrating, I think, that we do have the courage to address this \ndifficult problem, recognizing that it is one of the major \nenvironmental issues before the U.S. Senate.\n  Two weeks ago Senator Craig, Senator Johnston, and I stood on this \nfloor and said the Government had an obligation to take this spent \nfuel. Of course, some disagreed with us. Some argued that the \nGovernment had no such obligation. But a curious thing happened last \nweek. A Federal appeals court unanimously ruled the Government does, \nindeed, have an obligation to take the spent fuel; as a matter of fact, \na statutory obligation.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a landmark decision, because it makes it \nimperative for us to pass this bill today. The situation has radically \nchanged since our last vote.\n  I appeal to my colleagues, if you did not vote with us last time, \nthere is a good reason to vote with us today. That reason is very \nsimple: The court unanimously ruled that the Government does have an \nobligation to take the spent fuel. Again, Mr. President, that is a \nstatutory obligation. The courts have confirmed our contention that the \nFederal Government has the obligation to take spent commercial fuel.\n  Failure to pass this bill and build an interim repository means the \nGovernment will have to take the fuel and put it somewhere else, or \nsimply pay the damages. The court has not specified the amount of the \ndamages yet because, technically, the Government has not yet broken its \npromise. But the damages could run into the billions of dollars if the \nGovernment reneges on its obligation. If we do not build an interim \nrepository in Nevada, the Government might have to store the fuel at \nother Federal facilities around the Nation.\n  The interesting thing about this problem, Mr. President, you simply \ncannot just throw spent fuel up in the air and defer the decision about \nwhere to store it. It has to come down somewhere. It has to be stored \nsomewhere. Perhaps it will be the naval fuel storage facility in \nConnecticut, or maybe Rocky Flats or Fort St. Vrain in Colorado, or \nmaybe the Pinellas plant in Florida, or maybe in Ohio, Portsmouth, \nMound or Fernald, or maybe West Valley in New York, or perhaps Paducah \nin Kentucky, or perhaps it will be in Hanford on the Columbia River, \nwhich flows through Oregon and Washington.\n  Therefore, Senators, I appeal to you, those from Connecticut, \nColorado, Florida, Ohio, New York, Kentucky, Oregon, those who did not \nvote with us for cloture on the motion to proceed, you might want to \nreexamine your position in light of the recent court decision, which \nsimply states the Federal Government has to take it. The court has said \nthe Government must take the spent fuel. As I have said, it has to go \nsomewhere. If you are saying no to Nevada, you may be saying yes to \nyour own State. You are certainly saying yes to someplace else.\n  Last night I received a letter from Secretary of Energy O'Leary that \ncriticizes Senate bill 1936 because it provides for the Department of \nEnergy to begin accepting waste in 1999 and not 1998. I repeat, Mr. \nPresident, last night we did receive a letter from the Secretary \ncriticizing Senate bill 1936 because it provides for the DOE to begin \naccepting waste in 1999, not 1998. This criticism is almost humorous in \nlight of the fact that the current administration would not provide for \nthe acceptance of waste at a central facility until the year 2010 at \nthe earliest. Even under the most optimistic scenario, the Department \nof Energy would be in breach of its contract for 12 years.\n  Further, the letter is inconsistent on its face because it then \nproceeds to criticize Senate bill 1936 for providing unrealistic \nschedules. It seems the administration believes our bill would provide \nan interim storage facility both too late or perhaps too soon.\n  Senate bill 1936 provides a valid, realistic plan for the \nconstruction of a safe, centralized interim storage facility. I have \npersonally sent over four letters to the President over the last 18 \nmonths asking for his plan if he opposed any legislation pending before \nthis body. I have received only support for the status quo.\n  Again, I repeat, if you were not with us before, you have reason to \nbe with us today. The court's decision has made it clear that the \nstatus quo is not an acceptable option.\n  Now, Mr. President, I make a few comments for the benefit of those \nSenators who did not vote with us 2 weeks ago. That is, very \nrealistically, the ratepayers in your State are getting ripped off. \nThey paid for something, and they are not getting anything in return. \nInstead of saving more for their children's college fund or saving for \ntheir dream home, consumers paid into the nuclear waste fund through \ntheir individual electric bill. They paid somewhere in the neighborhood \nof almost $12 billion. They have paid this money with the expectation \nthat the Government would live up to their part of the bargain and \nremove the waste as it promised. But the Government simply has not \nperformed. The waste is still there. It is near the homes, near the \nschools, it is near the neighborhoods. The opponents of this \nlegislation are working to keep the status quo, and to keep the waste \nwhere it is.\n\n  I want to again run down the list of States where those Senators did \nnot vote with us, or at least one of the Senators did, and repeat how \nmuch the consumers of those States have spent for the nuclear waste \nfund. The State of Arkansas has contributed $266 million into that \nfund, and they receive 33\n\n[[Page S9211]]\n\npercent of their electric power from nuclear energy; California, $645 \nmillion has been paid by the ratepayers, they receive 26 percent of \ntheir electricity from nuclear power; Connecticut, $429 million paid \nin, and they receive 73 percent of their power from nuclear energy.\n  It is rather interesting, as well, because I was reminded by my \nfriend from Idaho that we build various submarines in Connecticut; \nafter they are decommissioned they are cut up, and various parts of the \nreactors go to Hanford, where they are buried, and the fuel goes to \nIdaho, where they are currently stored. The point is, Mr. President, we \nall have an interest in this issue of what to do with nuclear waste.\n  Florida, $557 million from ratepayers, for receiving 18 percent on \nnuclear energy; Massachusetts, $319 million paid by the ratepayers, 14 \npercent dependent on nuclear energy; Maryland, $257 million, 24 percent \nof their power is nuclear; New York, $734 million ratepayers in New \nYork have paid into the fund and they are 28 percent dependent on \nnuclear energy; Ohio, $253 million has been paid in, 7 percent \ndependent on nuclear energy; Wisconsin, $336 million paid by the \nratepayer, 23 percent of their energy comes from nuclear.\n  There are other States with no nuclear plants that, nevertheless, \ndepend on nuclear power from neighboring States, and they have also \npaid into that fund. Those States are: Delaware, $29 million; Indiana, \n$288 million; Iowa, $192 million; Kentucky, $81 million; New Mexico, \n$32 million; North Dakota, $11 million; Rhode Island, $8 million. Mr. \nPresident, that adds up to a total of $4.537 billion. That is a lot of \nmoney to throw away without results. That is not our money, Mr. \nPresident; that was money collected from Americans to deal with nuclear \nwaste.\n  Do we really want to tell consumers from those States that after \nallowing this money to be taken from their electric bills, we are not \ngoing to use that money to solve the nuclear waste problem? Do we want \nto tell consumers that we are going to make them pay, once again, for \nadditional waste storage at reactor sites, or that we will expose them \nand all taxpayers to tremendous liabilities arising out of the court \ncases I mentioned earlier? The extent of these liabilities are very \ndifficult to estimate, but we know they are going to be high.\n\n  There are yet other reasons to join us in supporting this amendment, \nand I appeal to my colleagues. After the 65-to-34 cloture vote on the \nmotion to proceed to Senate bill 1936 2 weeks ago, we received many \nconstructive suggestions for improving the bill.\n  Amendment No. 5055 would replace the text of Senate bill 1936 with \nnew language and incorporate these changes. The most important of the \nchanges are as follows:\n  A role for the EPA. The amendment provides that the Environmental \nProtection Agency shall issue standards for the protection of the \npublic from releases of radioactive materials from a permanent nuclear \nwaste repository. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is required to base \nits licensing determination on whether the repository can be operated \nin accordance with EPA's radiation protection standards.\n  Another issue was transportation routing. The amendment includes the \nlanguage of an amendment that was filed by Senator Moseley-Braun, which \nprovides for further assurance of the safe transportation of these \nmaterials by requiring the Secretary of Energy to use routes that \nminimize, to the maximum practical extent, transportation through \npopulated and sensitive environmental areas.\n  Elimination of civil service exemption. As requested by Senator \nGlenn, the amendment strikes the provisions in title VII that would \nhave exempted the nuclear waste program from civil service laws and \nregulations.\n  Elimination of train inspection limitation. The amendment includes \nlanguage provided by Senator Pressler that strikes any reference to who \nshall perform inspections of trains. This is to address concerns that \nthe language in Senate bill 1936 would change existing law with regard \nto train inspections.\n  Clarify scope of the Department of Transportation training standards. \nThe amendment clarifies that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has \nprimary authority for the training of workers in nuclear-related \nactivities. However, the Department of Transportation is authorized to \npromulgate worker safety training standards for removal and \ntransportation of spent fuel if it finds that there are gaps in the NRC \nregulations.\n  Next, Mr. President, is elimination of permanent disposal research \nprovisions. This amendment eliminates the section requiring the \nDepartment of Energy to establish an office to study new technologies \nfor the disposal of nuclear waste.\n  Elimination of budget priorities. This amendment eliminates a section \nproviding that the Secretary must prioritize funds appropriated to the \nnuclear waste program to the construction of the interim storage \nfacility. This provision, obviously, is no longer needed in light of \nDOE's reevaluation of its budget requirements for the program.\n  Elimination of direct reference to Chalk Mountain route. The \namendment eliminates the reference to the map outlining the heavy haul \nroute through Nellis Air Force Base. The amendment simply provides that \nthe DOE must use heavy haul to transport casks from the intermodal \ntransfer facility at Caliente, NV, and does not specify any particular \nroute.\n  Remove failure to finalize viability assessment as a trigger for \nraising size of phase 2. Senate bill 1936 provides that phase 2 of the \ninterim storage facility will be no larger than the 40,000 metric tons \nof spent fuel, but provides a series of triggers that will allow the \nDepartment of Energy to expand the facility to 60,000 metric tons.\n  The amendment eliminates DOE's failure to complete a viability \nassessment of the permanent repository in 1998 as a trigger, making the \nfirst trigger the license application for the permanent repository in \nthe year 2002.\n  Limitation and clarification of ``preliminary decisionmaking'' \nlanguage. The amendment clarifies that the prelicensing construction \nactivities authorized by 203(e)(1) are the only construction activities \nthat will be considered to be ``preliminary decisionmaking'' \nactivities.\n\n  Further, the amendment corrects this section by indicating that the \nuse of the existing E-Mad facility at the interim storage site for \nemergency fuel handling in phase 1 is considered to be a preliminary \ndecisionmaking activity. Senate bill 1936 mistakenly refers to use of \nfacilities use authorized another section, which was the entire interim \nstorage facility.\n  Mr. President, we believe these changes, in addition to those already \nmade in Senate bill 1936, provide additional assurance that the \nconstruction and the operation of an integrated management system will \nbe carried out with the utmost sensitivity to environmental and safety \nconcerns.\n  However, Senate bill 1936 will still allow the Department of Energy \nto resolve this urgent environmental problem by meeting its obligation \nto store and dispose of spent fuel and nuclear waste in a timely \nmanner.\n  Obviously, I urge my colleagues to consider the merits of this \namendment and support final passage of Senate bill 1936.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I understand that there may be some \nambiguity in the unanimous-consent request and that it may give 4 hours \nto the distinguished Senator from Alaska and 4 hours to the less \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana. I think that would really be a \ngood way to do it, but, unfortunately, my friends from Nevada are \ninsistent that they be granted equal time.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that, to the extent there is ambiguity, \nthe Senator from Alaska have his 4 hours, and the other 4 hours be \nunder the control of the distinguished senior Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe it would be appropriate to \ndefer to our colleagues from Nevada at this time.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 36 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am sure that my friend from Louisiana, as well as \nSenator Craig, would like to be heard from. But I think we should \nperhaps go to the other side at this time.\n\n[[Page S9212]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada, [Mr. Reid] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Chair advise the Senator from Nevada when he has \nused 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the substitute is nothing more than a \nregurgitation of S. 1936. It changes absolutely nothing. It is just a \nrearranging of words. That is all it is. There are no constructive \nsuggestions. It answers none of the questions that have been propounded \nby a number of Senators on this issue.\n  There has been the term used that the ratepayers are being ripped \noff. Mr. President, the only rip-off occurring to the taxpayers of this \ncountry would be if this travesty, S. 1936, is allowed to pass.\n  The substitute offered by my friend from Alaska does not address any \nof the substantive problems regarding the underlying legislation. This \nis still bad legislation, unnecessary legislation, and still very \ndangerous legislation. This is effectively at least the third \nsubstitute for the original bill, S. 1271. We went from S. 1271 to S. \n1936 to the chairman's substitute, and now to this substitute \namendment. They are all the same. There are no changes. Changing the \nnumber of the legislation will not help the substantive aspect of this \nlegislation.\n  As each of the earlier versions were shown to be seriously flawed, a \ncosmetic substitute was offered. This amendment contains that same \nfailed strategy--change the number and talk about the great changes in \nthe bill. A loose examination--not a close examination--a loose \nexamination indicates that there are literally no changes. None of \nthese substitutes have addressed the fundamental flaws of the proposed \nlegislation.\n\n  This version, as well as the previous one, tramples on our \nenvironment, our safety, and our health laws. There has been nothing \ndone to answer why this legislation is necessary. It is not. There has \nbeen nothing to indicate why the risk standard is 400 percent higher \nthan any other risk standard. There is nothing to answer why we preempt \nFederal law. There is nothing to answer how you are going to handle the \ndifficult transportation problems. There is nothing to answer the \nmost--and it is so interesting that there is never a word from the \nproponents of this legislation about the report to Congress from the \nSecretary of Energy that was filed this year by the Nuclear Waste \nTechnical Review Board where they said, ``Is there urgent technical \nneed for centralized storage of commercial spent fuel?'' And the answer \nis clearly no. The board ``sees no compelling technical or safety \nreason to move spent fuel to a centralized storage facility. The \nmethods now used to store spent fuel at reactor sites are safe and will \nremain safe for decades to come.''\n  There has never been a response to this except legislate them out of \nbusiness. That is what this legislation does. If you do not agree with \nthe proponents of the powerful nuclear lobby, then legislate them out \nof business. That is what they have done here.\n  It is also quite interesting that they have done nothing to address \nthe results of a court case last year. They come and talk about a spin. \nThey should sign on to one of the Presidential campaigns. The court \ncase does not help their case. The court case settles the contractual \ndispute between Michigan-Indiana Power and the Department of Energy. We \nwill talk about that later.\n  But in the briefs filed by the power utilities they did not even seek \nto relieve these people who gave the decision. There is nothing wrong \nwith the decision. We have an amendment that is going to incorporate \nthe results of that opinion into this legislation--but anything to \nconfuse and to get the ideas of the powerful nuclear lobby in the eyes \nof the public with full-page ads in newspapers all over the country. \nWho pays for that?\n  Mr. President, I think that we should recognize that every \nenvironmental group in America--not those that are to the left nor \nthose to the right--every environmental group in America is opposed to \nthis legislation; is opposed to this amendment.\n  Public Citizen yesterday came out because it was a letter sent to \nSenators by the other side saying we should pass this nuclear waste \nbill because EPA's authority has been restored. Wrong again--false \nadvertising. And it explains why.\n  Another group, National Resources Defense Council:\n\n       On behalf of the quarter million members of the National \n     Resources Defense Council, I am writing you to urge you to \n     oppose 1936 and the amendment. It would curtail a broad range \n     of environmental health and safety laws. It would quadruple \n     allowable radiation standards for waste storage. It would \n     exacerbate the risk of transportation of nuclear waste \n     throughout the country. Please vote no on 1936.\n\n  Before turning this over to my colleague from Nevada, Mr. President, \nI want to refer to part of a letter that was sent to all Senators last \nweek. Here is part of the language from it.\n\n       S. 1936 is a bill only a polluter could love. The measure \n     attacks the Environmental Protection Agency, curtails Federal \n     environmental regulations, preempts State laws . . .\n\n  And I should have a little editorial ``exempts Federal laws.\n\n       . . . and sets a repository standard that allows four times \n     the radiation exposure of current regulations. Oppose S. \n     1936.\n\n  That says it all.\n  I yield to my colleague from Nevada. I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 6 \nminutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, this may be the last bill that I will floor manage as \na U.S. Senator. It happens to be on a subject matter that it has fallen \nmy lot to deal with for some 20 years now--dealing with nuclear waste. \nIt is a lot that has fallen to me because of jurisdictions on the \ncommittees of which I have been involved.\n  I have not enjoyed being in opposition to my friends from Nevada who \nhave done an absolutely marvelous job with an absolutely bankrupt case \nin my view which means that the people of Nevada to the extent they \nagree with their Nevada Senators ought to be greatly appreciative of \nthe excellent job they have done, as I say, with a weak case. When I \nsay a weak case, Mr. President, the amazing thing to me is that Nevada \ncan be so opposed to having a nuclear waste site when at the same time \nthey have been so anxious to have a nuclear test site for exploding \nnuclear bombs because with nuclear bombs all they did was dig a hole \nand shoot the bombs underground--some even as low as the water table--\nhundreds of these nuclear tests that involved all of the radioactivity \nmaterials that are present in nuclear waste: Thorium, cesium 137, \nstrontium 90, plutonium--all of these daughter elements of a nuclear \nexplosion, the same thing as you have in nuclear wastes. Nevada was not \nonly willing to have these nuclear tests but anxious to have the \nnuclear tests.\n  As chairman of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee I sit \nshoulder to shoulder with my friends from Nevada, the Senators from \nNevada, in seeking more nuclear tests. My motive was that I thought we \nought to have reliability and safety in our nuclear arsenal and, \ntherefore, a few years ago I proposed that. My friends from Nevada \nargued the same thing and also argued the economy of Nevada in seeking \nadditional tests.\n  Mr. President, when you have these explosions which leave a cavity in \nthe ground with all of these--cesium, strontium, et cetera--in the \ncavity, it is not sealed over by a waste package. We hope and we \nbelieve that these waste packages may be good for 10,000 years, even if \nthey were thrown somewhere where they had exposure to the water. We \nthink that the waste package itself is going to be sufficient. And, \nmoreover, in Yucca Mountain the waste packages will be buried some 200 \nmeters above the water table. So it is many times better, if you are \nconcerned about the contamination of the ground and the water, it is \nmany times better to have a nuclear waste site such as Yucca Mountain \nthan it is to have a test site.\n  That is common sense--absolutely common sense--because, on the one \nhand, you have the explosion, some in the water table, and hundreds of \nthese explosions. On the other hand, you have a Yucca Mountain which is \n200 meters that is more than 600 feet above the water table in one of \nthe driest places on the face of the Earth.\n\n[[Page S9213]]\n\n  So we start with that, Mr. President. That is why I say my colleagues \nfrom Nevada have an exceedingly weak case.\n  On the question of the pending amendment, to say that it eviscerates \nthe role of EPA is just not correct. We set the standard at 100 \nmillirems which is the same standard that you have for the \nInternational Commission on Radiological Protection, the National \nCouncil on Radiation Protection and Measurements, the United States \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, and \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency. That is where we get the 100 \nmillirems.\n  What we say is, if EPA believes that poses an unreasonable risk to \nhealth and safety, we give to EPA the right, the duty, and the mandate \nto set it at such level as they think will protect health and safety.\n  So, Mr. President, that argument simply does not hold water.\n  Moreover, I would say, Mr. President, that, again to compare it to \nthe nuclear test site, it is exceedingly more safe than the nuclear \ntest site.\n  We have upwards of 40,000 metric tons of nuclear waste in some 70 \nsites around the country. If we do not put away this waste in an \ninterim storage facility, then it will take, according to testimony \nbefore the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, some $5 billion to \nbuild what we call dry cask storage, which, according to the Court of \nAppeals of the District of Columbia in a decision just last week, is \nthe responsibility of the Federal Government. So what we are dealing \nwith on this interim storage facility is a $5 billion bill to the \nUnited States of America.\n  We are told in letters from the administration that if we build this \ninterim storage facility, we may have to move the waste twice.\n  Not so, Mr. President. The present legislation on which we will vote \nvery clearly states that you may not begin construction on the interim \nfacility until and unless the repository, that is, the underground \nfacility, is declared to be suitable, or I think the word is viable, \nwhich is a defined word in the legislation. So that not until 1998, \nwhen the nuclear waste administrator says he can and will make that \ndecision, may you begin construction on the interim facility. So by \nthat time we will know whether or not this is a suitable facility for \nthe repository.\n  Why do we say pick the facility now and begin construction? Simply \nbecause we have about 2\\1/2\\ or 3 years of what we call long-lead-time \nitems which are necessary before you begin construction--such things as \nthe environmental impact statement, the design, picking the routes of \ntransportation. Those things can and should be done at this point so as \nto save the billions of dollars that are involved.\n  We urge Senators to vote for the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, recognizing there is time on the other \nside, I anticipate a vote on the pending amendment at the conclusion of \nthe Senators from Nevada speaking on this amendment, because I think \nour time has just about expired.\n  How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Time has expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. So all Senators should be advised \nthat will be--I guess the Senators from Nevada can give us a better \nidea, but I would imagine 15 or 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. May I inquire of the Chair as to how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators from Nevada have 24 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me just make a couple of preliminary observations.\n  Our good friend, the distinguished senior Senator from South \nCarolina, rose this morning to express his strong support for this \nlegislation. I say with great affection and great respect that the \nirony of his position could not have been more acute. In this morning's \nEnergy Daily, we read that the State of South Carolina, the State that \nhe has so ably represented and defended since 1954, has filed suit \nagainst the Department of Energy because they are concerned about \nsafety standards as it relates to the shipment of foreign nuclear fuel \ninto the State of South Carolina.\n  I guess I would have to repeat, Mr. President, an old expression that \nI think would be understood down home: ``What's sauce for the goose \nought to be sauce for the gander.'' I respect and greatly admire the \nSenator's concern about the health and safety of his own State. I just \nwish he shared that same perspective in terms of the health and safety \nof the entire Nation, because that is one of the principal objections \nwe have to this piece of legislation.\n  Let me in the time that I have try to address the issues that were so \nfundamental to the debate in S. 1936, because, as my senior colleague \nhas pointed out, with respect to the core issues nothing has changed. \nThere has been some language that has been massaged, but nothing has \nbeen changed.\n  Let me take my colleagues for a great leap through the bill itself. \nWe have expressed strong opposition, not on behalf of Nevada but on \nbehalf of the Nation, to a piece of legislation that would effectively \nemasculate major pieces of the environmental legislation that affects \nall Americans. The National Environmental Policy Act provides the \nframework for making major policy decisions that affect the \nenvironment, and nobody denies that the legislation before us, the \nsiting of an interim storage facility, has profound implications in \nterms of its impact.\n  So here is what we have in the act itself under section 204. OK, \nfirst of all, and I paraphrase, it says, ``The National Environmental \nPolicy Act shall apply.'' That is like saying the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights shall apply. And then it goes on to say that such \nenvironmental impact statements shall not consider the need for interim \nstorage, the time of the initial availability of interim storage, any \nalternatives to the storage, any alternatives to design criteria, the \nenvironmental impacts of the storage beyond the initial term.\n\n  We are talking about something that lasts tens of thousands of years, \nand they are talking about something that would be limited to the \ninitial term of the license, which is a matter of years.\n  Then they go on to deprive the court of jurisdiction to review the \nenvironmental impact statement as it is being developed, and then goes \non to say, in what is the height of arrogance--our colleagues have \nrailed against the costs that have been incurred over the years in \nseeking a solution to the disposition of high-level nuclear waste. Much \nof those costs have been incurred as a result of unrealistic time lines \ngenerated by the zeal of the nuclear utility industry in America. The \nstorage of interim waste has been for more than 30 years their Holy \nGrail. That is what they want, and the only reason we are having this \ndebate today is because the nuclear utilities want interim storage. But \nthe irony and the ultimate travesty that I refer to is, after talking \nabout the environmental policy act, it goes on to say none of the \nactivities carried out pursuant to this paragraph shall delay or \notherwise affect the development or construction, licensing or \noperation.\n  So, yes, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights by way of analogy \nwould apply, but the amendments that all of us rely upon for our \nprotection, by way of analogy, would not apply here.\n  So far as the contention has been made that there has been an effort \nto address environmental concerns, that is simply false. And I will not \ntake the time at this point, but we will discuss it in more detail.\n  The letter sent by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency makes a very compelling argument. So for the purposes of this \nact, we, in effect, wipe out the National Environmental Policy Act.\n  Let me go on and talk about the standards because we have talked a \ngood bit about that.\n  The standards that we are concerned about are the radioactive \nexposure standards. Nowhere in the world, for no other project on the \nface of the Earth is a radiation standard--if I could get that chart--\nno other place in the world do we have a radiation standard that \nproposes 100 millirems from a single source. No place.\n\n[[Page S9214]]\n\n  The EPA safe drinking water standard is 4; the WIPP standard is 15. \nLet me refresh my colleague's memory. In this Congress, this year, our \ndistinguished colleague from New Mexico got up, and properly so, \nexpressed concern about EPA's ability to establish standards for the \nWIPP facility, the repository for transuranic waste.\n  The National Academy of Sciences has recommended between 10 and 30 \nmillirems of exposure. What do we have in Nevada? Mr. President, 100 \nmillirems. That is just simply unconscionable. That is simply \nunconscionable.\n  Oh, yes, they say, the EPA is brought back into the process. Not as \none would expect it. That is the standard unless they are able to \ndisprove that 100 millirems would have no adverse impact on health and \nsafety, another concern raised by the EPA, which makes no equivocation \nat all about the fact that that presents a public health risk. Every \nMember in this body, whatever his or her view is on an interim storage \nfacility, should be concerned as Americans about what is being done \nwith respect to this provision.\n  Moreover, the EPA is restricted and the NRC is restricted in terms of \nhow to apply the standards. We will talk a little bit more about that \nduring the course of this debate. The National Academy of Sciences has \nindicated, as one example, that there are health and safety concerns \nfor 10,000 years and beyond. The statute we are being asked to consider \nin this very amendment would limit the ability to consider this only to \nthe first 1,000 years. That is not the most critical time. It is after \n1,000 years that the canisters are supposed to fail and then it \nmigrates into the underground repository itself.\n  I could go on and on. We have talked about the preemption. Make no \nmistake, I say to my colleagues, this amendment in effect preempts the \nenvironmental laws of America, all of these provisions here. I will not \ntake time to read all of them because we are under some time \nconstraints on this amendment. Look at them: Federal Land Policy Act, \nRCRA, clean air, clean water, Superfund. None of those apply if they \nare in conflict with the provisions of this act, none. This is simply \nan outrage, whatever one's view is about transporting nuclear waste \nacross the country, and much more will be said about that later.\n  The fiscal impact of this has been discussed. I want to comment \nbriefly on this. It has been clear since the very beginning of the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, that the fundamental premise of that \nact, as contained in all the provisions, indicates the first and \nprimary responsibility from a financial point of view will be the \nutilities' themselves. That is the first and foremost responsibility. \nThis amendment very cleverly changes that.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BRYAN. It very cleverly changes that. Remember the premise in the \n1982 Nuclear Policy Act itself was the responsibility will be that of \nthe utilities, in terms of the financial responsibility. Repeatedly--\nover and over again.\n  The responsibility goes far beyond the initial licensing period. We \nare talking about something that lasts for tens of thousands of years. \nBut this is why this is the nuclear industry bailout or relief act. \nWhat they have done is limited the liability of the utility by saying, \nuntil 2002, the maximum amount that can be contributed into the nuclear \nwaste fund, a fund that is generated by a 1 mill levy on each kilowatt \nhour of energy generated, will be 1 mill.\n\n  The people who have looked at that, the General Accounting Office and \nothers, have concluded that the fund currently is underfunded between \n$4 and $8 billion. It gets better. After the year 2002, the utilities' \nliability is further limited to the amount of the annual appropriation. \nSo there is nothing that is being done with respect to the long-term \nimplications of this piece of legislation, in terms of the storage of \nnuclear wastes.\n  Let me be clear that by the year 2033, for the utilities, nuclear \nutilities that are currently licensed, those licensing periods expire. \nWhat this means is that the American taxpayer, people who have never \nreceived 1 kilowatt of nuclear-generated power, will pick up the \nbalance. Let me be clear on that. Historically, since the establishment \nof the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, it has been the financial \nresponsibility of the utilities to handle the storage, the financial \nresponsibility. This now changes dramatically and there are \nlimitations--the 1 mill limitation and, after the year 2002, only the \namount that is appropriated. This year, for example, that would have \nbeen roughly one-third of a mill. The balance all shifts to the \ntaxpayer. So, you talk about an unfunded mandate on the American \ntaxpayer, this is it.\n  Let me respond briefly to a couple of comments that were made, and I \nknow our time will conclude. First of all, our friend from Louisiana \nmakes the point that Nevada has hosted the Nevada test site and nuclear \ndetonations have occurred there for many years. I hope none of us is \ngoing to be penalized because Nevada, as part of the national defense \neffort beginning during the height of the cold war in the 1950's, \nagreed to accept the Nevada test site. That was part of our national \ndefense effort and Nevadans assumed that responsibility, and proudly \nso.\n  Now, with respect to the amount of radioactivity generated, all the \ntests conducted out there would amount to less than 1 ton. That would \nbe the cumulative impact of all of that radioactivity. What we are \ntalking about----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. You are speaking of the radioactivity released to the \nair at this point, are you not?\n  Mr. BRYAN. No. We are referring to the total volume of radioactivity, \nunderground as well.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. It amounts to how much?\n  Mr. BRYAN. One ton.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. One ton?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Yes.\n  The point I am trying to make is, by way of comparison, we are \ntalking about tens of thousands of metric tons, so the degree of risk \nis immeasurably greater as a result.\n  Let me turn next to the question of the lawsuit. Much has been made \nof the lawsuit. The lawsuit changes absolutely nothing, as my colleague \npointed out. In point of fact, what the lawsuit said is there is an \nobligation on the part of the Department of Energy, and we look to the \nprovisions of the contract to determine how that liability will be \nascertained. At no time--and I emphasize--at no time was it contended \nby the utilities that there would be a need to commence some type of \ntransportation on February 1, 1988. In point of fact, in the briefs, \nthe legal briefs filed by the utilities, they make it very clear that \nthey do not assert that there should be a mandatory injunction \nrequiring the transfer of anything, or the movement of anything on \nJanuary 31, 1998. What they say, and our amendment that we will offer \nlater indicates that, is that becomes a matter of contract \nadjudication, depending upon the nature of the delay. I believe it is \nfair to point out the Secretary of Energy makes that point in her \nletter, that the lawsuit changes nothing. It is a smokescreen. The \nutilities did not seek nor does the lawsuit decision require the \ntransport of anything on January 31, 1988. At most it would require an \nadjustment of the fees paid by utilities into the nuclear waste fund, \nto the extent that they incur additional costs to expand that storage.\n\n  I might say, parenthetically, the Senators from Nevada have \nintroduced legislation to that effect for the last 7 years. So the \nlawsuit means absolutely nothing.\n  It is plain the ratepayers are not getting what they paid for. Let me \nsay that certainly is not the fault of the citizens of Nevada. Frankly, \nit is the fault of the way the nuclear utilities themselves have \nconstantly tried to jam unrealistic deadlines, to make politics rather \nthan science the determiner of this program. The original program \nsuggested we should search the country, find the best site, send three \nsites, after they have been studied, to the President of the United \nStates, and have the President make the determination. That did not \noccur. Politics--politics intervened, nuclear politics. The folks in \nthe Northeast, and understandably, said we do not want granite in the \nstudy, so they were taken out of the equation.\n\n[[Page S9215]]\n\n  The folks in the Southeast, I can understand, said, ``My gosh, we \ndon't want salt domes.'' So what happened in 1987--and no scientist \nworthy of the description of scientist would ever contend that from a \nscientific point of view, forcing all of the study to occur at a single \nsite is the best from a scientific perspective, and the fact they have \nencountered technical problems dealing with health and safety certainly \nis not the fault of Nevadans.\n  Frankly, the decision to embark upon nuclear energy carried with it \ncertain risks for the utilities, and part of that risk is the financial \nresponsibility of dealing with the waste.\n  So I simply say to my colleagues that none of the provisions that \nrelate to the heart and core of our concerns--the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, the preemption provisions, the standards or \nthe fiscal impact for the American taxpayers--not a single provision in \nthis new amendment changes the impact from the debate that we had in S. \n1936, and none of my colleagues should be misled as a result.\n  May I inquire as to how much time I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator has 5 minutes 53 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada, [Mr. Reid], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there has been a suggestion by my friend, \nthe senior Senator from Louisiana, that this is a bankrupt case, the \ndefense of S. 1936, the opposition to S. 1936. Mr. President, the exact \nopposite is true. For example, the opposition to S. 1936 is supported \nby the President of the United States. He has done it vocally and in \nwriting. The case is supported by the Secretary of Energy. There is a \nletter that will be entered into the Record where she vehemently \ndisagrees with not only the underlying legislation but the amendment. \nNo one can ever think that the Secretary of Energy would do anything to \nassist this Senator from Nevada. This Senator and the Secretary of \nEnergy have been in a longstanding dispute over various issues, but her \nletter is direct and to the point that not only is the legislation bad, \nbut the amendment is bad.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency Administrator sent a letter that \nis succinct, to the point, that outlines why the legislation is bad and \nwhy the amendment is bad.\n  The Council for Environmental Quality opposes this legislation. The \nNuclear Waste Technical Review Board is opposed to what they are trying \nto do, and, as we talked about before, all environmental organizations.\n  Mr. President, let me say that the only case for S. 1936 is a \npowerful nuclear industry. They are the only supporters of this \nlegislation.\n  The Senators from Nevada have indicated that we would not require a \nrollcall vote on this amendment. We have been told that the advocates \nof this amendment want a vote on it. I can only speak for this Senator, \nbut this amendment does not help anything. I say to all my colleagues, \nit does not help anything in the underlying legislation, and it does \nnot hurt it. It is just as bad after you adopt it as before.\n  My colleagues can go ahead and vote for this if they want. It makes \nabsolutely no difference, because the ultimate test of this legislation \nwill come on final passage when we will determine whether or not the \nPresident of the United States is going to have to oppose this \nlegislation by veto and whether the request, the pleas by the \nPresident, the Secretary of Energy, the Vice President of the United \nStates, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Council for \nEnvironmental Quality, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board and all \nenvironmental organizations are going to land on deaf ears.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of our time on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators from Nevada still have 2 minutes \n56 seconds. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. I reserve the 2 minutes 56 seconds to the underlying bill.\n  Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Can we reserve the time on the \nother amendments on the bill itself?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will state to the Senator the time \nwill continue to roll unless the Senator seeks unanimous consent to \nstop the time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be no \nlonger counted against the opponents of this amendment and that, if \nthere is going to be a rollcall, we have it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is fine. We would like a rollcall vote. I have \nasked for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 5055. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. \nGregg] is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a \nquorum call, which I am going to suggest, and that the time not run \nagainst either the proponents or the opponents of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I object. I ask that the time run \nequally.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I commend the Senators who are working on \nthis very important legislation. They have been doing an excellent job. \nI have the impression they are going to make good progress today. I \nthank, again, the Nevada Senators for their reasonableness in a very \ndifficult situation.\n  The sooner we can finish this legislation, the better, so that we can \nmove on to very important issues that are pending, such as the \ntransportation appropriations and the VA/HUD appropriations bill. \nConference reports are beginning to come back now.\n  I thank the Democratic leader for his cooperation in bringing this \nissue to this point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9209-6", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S9216]]\n\n\n\n              PROVIDING FOR THE ADJOURNMENT OF BOTH HOUSES\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, most of the time that I am on the floor \nI do not really use notes, or at least I do not use notes extensively. \nI think today what I want to try to do is read what I think is a kind \nof brief that I want to argue for this amendment.\n  Most of the debate on S. 1936 will be about the environmental policy \nramifications of the bill. I know we will learn a great deal about that \ntoday. While these are important points--I view them as very important \npoints--there is another very significant part of this debate. I am \nreferring to the implications of this bill for the taxpayers, \nparticularly future taxpayers.\n  I hope that if my colleagues are not able to listen to the statement, \nthat their staffs will and that these words will be given serious \nconsideration.\n  As you will soon see, this bill would perpetuate a flawed policy that \nhas set up the future taxpayers of America, I fear, for a potentially \ninfinite liability.\n  Mr. President, section 302 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, \nsubsection (a), paragraph 4, states what has long been accepted as \nnuclear waste policy, that nuclear utilities shall pay a fee into a \nfund to ``ensure full cost recovery'' for costs associated with the \nnuclear waste program. Indeed, an earlier version of this very bill, \nintroduced as S. 1271, recited in its findings section the same basic \npremise: ``While the Federal Government has the responsibility to \nprovide for the centralized interim storage and permanent disposal of \nspent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste to protect the \npublic health and safety and the environment''--I agree with that--\n``the cost of such storage and disposal should be the responsibility of \nthe generators and owners of such waste and spent fuels.''\n  Mr. President, once you understand that simple basic and longstanding \npremise, you cannot help but be confused by the policy we have been \npursuing for years and which is strengthened in the bill before us. \nThat policy is to provide for the transfer of title to high-level \nnuclear waste from the utility to the taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, could I have order in the Chamber? I would appreciate \nit if you would ask the discussion to be off the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All discussions will be taken into the \ncloakroom.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me explain. As I have already \ndescribed, the full cost of the waste disposal program is to be borne \nby the generators of that waste. To implement this idea, Congress \ncreated the nuclear waste fund in the Treasury. The nuclear waste fund \nis supplied by a fee paid by the nuclear utilities, which is really the \nratepayer. That fee is specified in the 1982 act to be equal to ``one \nmill,'' which is one-tenth of one cent per kilowatt-hour of electricity \ngenerated.\n  The 1982 act further gave the Secretary of Energy the authority to \nadjust the fee if she or he found it necessary to ``ensure full cost \nrecovery.'' As you can readily see, when a commercial nuclear \npowerplant ceases to generate electricity, it ceases to pay into the \nnuclear waste fund. In the next 15 to 20 years, as our current nuclear \nplants age, more and more of these plants will stop generating power, \nand the flow of money into the nuclear waste fund will begin to dry up. \nWhen no more money is flowing into the fund in the form of fees, we \nwill know how much money we will have to pay for the full cost of the \ndisposal program.\n\n  Now, we must ask the question: Will we have enough money? Will all \nthose fees aggregated in the nuclear waste fund, plus interest paid out \nas necessary to meet the actual progress of the program, be sufficient \nto cover all the actual costs of storing high-level nuclear waste until \nit is no longer a threat to public health and safety and the \nenvironment, perhaps as long as 10,000 years? Are we going to be able \nto cover the cost?\n  I will share with you the opinions of the experts on that question in \na moment, but first let me tell you who is stuck with the tab if the \nnuclear waste fund is not sufficient. Because our nuclear waste policy \nprovides for title to the waste to transfer from the utility to the \nFederal Government, which translates into taxpayers--it is you and me, \nor at least our families in the future--who are going to be stuck with\n\n[[Page S9217]]\n\nthe bill. You see, it is the transfer of the tab which the nuclear \nutilities are really working for.\n  Moving the waste in Nevada is important to them, but I am not sure \nthat is the real prize. What they really want is to be free and clear \nof the stuff because they know that there is a fair chance that \ndisposal costs will be greater than what they are currently saying it \nwill be. When their plants are shut down and they no longer pay the fee \ninto the fund, they want to make sure that the taxpayer cannot come \nback to them to pony up some more. If the Department of Energy holds \ntitle, the waste is no longer the utility's problem, but it is the \ntaxpayers' problem, and it is a potentially huge one.\n  Let us see if this is a real problem. After all, Mr. President, if \neverybody agrees that the fund will be adequate, then there will not be \nany taxpayer liability to worry about.\n  Mr. President, could I have order, please, on the floor, and could I \nask my colleagues to please cease discussion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the question then becomes whether there \nwill be a real problem. After all, if everybody agrees that the fund \nwill be adequate, the question is whether there is going to be any \ntaxpayer liability to worry about. The Nuclear Waste Technical Review \nBoard in its March 1996 report to the Congress states:\n\n       In a discussion of costs, however, the board believes a \n     more important question is whether the nuclear waste fund is \n     adequate to pay the cost of disposal as well as previously \n     unanticipated long-term storage. Although the Department of \n     Energy has not yet made a new formal determination of the \n     fund's adequacy, in a presentation before this board, \n     analysts who conducted an independent function and management \n     review of the Yucca Mountain project suggested that the \n     nuclear waste fund as currently projected would be deficient \n     by $3 to $5 billion.\n\n  In a June 1990 report, the General Accounting Office estimated, \ndepending on varying inflation rates and numbers of repositories \nneeded, a potentially huge shortfall--up to $77 billion. The report \nstates:\n\n       Unless careful attention is given to its financial \n     condition, the nuclear waste program is susceptible to future \n     budget shortfalls. Without a fee increase, the civilian waste \n     part of the program may already be underfunded by at least \n     $2.4 billion in discounted 1998 dollars.\n\n  That is the GAO report of 1990.\n  Now, Mr. President, in fairness--and I am trying to present a \nrigorous analysis for my colleagues--there is no consensus on whether \nthe fund will be adequate. The Department of Energy believes that it \nwill be. The nuclear industry likewise is quite adamant that the fund \nwill be sufficient. But, of course, estimating fund adequacy is a very \ncomplicated matter, and reasonable people can have different views.\n  There are two basic elements to determine if the fund will be \nadequate. First, there is a total lifetime cost estimate for the \ndisposal program. Depending on how far out you wish to run it, this \ncould require making estimates for thousands of years. DOE's latest \nlife cycle cost estimate--this is September 1995 --estimates costs for \nonly 88 years, from the beginning of the program in 1983 through the \nexpected end year of the program, which is 2071, when the repository is \ndecommissioned. This, of course, assumes that the repository is built, \nloaded, and closed on schedule, I might add, a very questionable \nassumption.\n  Cost estimates also depend on the elements of the program, including \nwhether there will be both an interim facility and a permanent \nrepository. In the Department of Energy's 1995 estimate, it is assumed \nthat the program will only include a permanent repository. They were \nnot even talking about the interim storage facility.\n  The second element to determine fund sufficiency has to do with the \nsupply side of the question: how much money will be put into the fund \nthrough fees. Because the fees are based on generation of electricity, \nthis estimate is inextricably tied up with the life expectancies of \nexistent nuclear powerplants and their level of electricity generation. \nWhat if the plants do not get relicensed? What if they shut down \nprematurely because of economic considerations or safety issues \nassociated with aging reactors? So far, no plant has lasted to the end \nof its license. That is a point worth emphasizing. What if the plants \nhave long outages and thus generate less power? The Department of \nEnergy assumes all plants operate for their full 40-year license with \nno renewal and that their generating efficiency improves over time.\n  In the end, Mr. President, I think we all have to realize that any \nestimate of fund adequacy is tentative at best. As Daniel Dreyfus, \nDirector of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management of DOE, \nput it last April, addressing the adequacy of the fee to ensure a \nsufficient fund:\n\n       Any such fee adequacy analysis must, of course, be based \n     upon a number of assumptions about the near and long term \n     future. Some of the most important are the projected rate of \n     expenditure from the fund which in turn impacts the interest \n     credits accruing from the unspent balance, the assumed future \n     rates of interest and inflation, and the assumed number of \n     kilowatts of nuclear power still to be generated and sold. \n     Significant deviations from these could result in errors in \n     either direction that would warrant changes in the fee.\n\n  Mr. President, what my amendment would do--we now have established \nthat the fund, which is the utility companies' fund, may not be \nsufficient, and some believe we are headed for a significant shortfall. \nThe evidence is irrefutable on that point.\n  Here is where we get to the crux of my amendment. If there is a \nshortfall, who is going to pay for it? The answer is that the owner of \nthe waste, the title holder, will pay for the shortfall. If title \ntransfers to the Department of Energy, the taxpayers in this country \nare going to be on the hook. It is the taxpayers who are going to end \nup having to pay the costs.\n  The amendment I offer today would protect the taxpayer from such an \nuncertain fate. My amendment would simply prevent the Department of \nEnergy from accepting title to the waste unless accepting title was \nnecessary to protect the public health and safety and the environment. \nFor people concerned about liability for damage from an accident caused \nby DOE once the waste is in the Government's possession, my amendment \nwould ensure that the DOE is, indeed, liable for such damages.\n  All this amendment does is protect taxpayers from shouldering the \nburden of waste disposal costs after the fund runs out. That burden \nshould remain with the utilities. That was the intention and that is \nthe way it ought to be. We do not know the cost over 10,000 years, and \nthis transfer of title through the sleight of hand transfers a huge \npotential unfunded liability to taxpayers in this country.\n  I have heard my colleagues argue that ratepayers and taxpayers are \nindistinguishable. That is not true. In other words, some folks seem to \nbelieve that changing the law to make sure that the utilities pay for \nthe outyear liability is pretty much the same as if the taxpayer is \ndirectly on the hook for it as current law and this bill would have it.\n  That is simply not so. Ratepayers are people who currently use \nnuclear-generated power. Taxpayers are everybody. All ratepayers are \ntaxpayers but not all taxpayers currently use nuclear-generated power. \nRatepayers are a subset of taxpayers. Ask people in northern Minnesota \nwhether they ought to be held as liable for a fund shortfall as, for \nexample, somebody in the Twin Cities. Ask somebody in Montana if they \nfeel they should pay as much for waste disposal as somebody in a more \nheavily nuclear State.\n  Mr. President, this bill, as I have stated already, would provide for \ntitle to transfer to the taxpayer. That is what this bill is about. I \nthink that is a very flawed premise in this bill. While that is also \npart of the current law, the bill throws in a new twist. Under S. 1936, \ntitle transfers even sooner than under current law. Current law has \ntitle transferring when DOE accepts the waste for permanent disposal. \nIn other words, title does not transfer until we actually have \na permanent place to put it. S. 1936, however, does not wait. This bill \nputs the taxpayer on the hook as soon as the Department of Energy takes \nit off the utility's hands for interim storage.\n\n  That is what this is about. As I have already indicated, the level of \nthe fee is integral to any estimate of fund sufficiency. Current law \nallows the Secretary of Energy to adjust that fee, if necessary, to \nensure fund sufficiency.\n\n[[Page S9218]]\n\n Despite the General Accounting Office and other estimates, this bill \nwould remove that authority, effectively freezing the one-mill fee, \nwhich has never been changed or pegged to inflation in statutory \nlanguage. Thus, even if the Department of Energy does ultimately \nestimate that the fund will experience a shortfall, the Secretary \ncannot even act to prevent it to protect taxpayers from accepting the \nliability.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this bill would require a significant up-\nfront expenditure from the fund to pay for construction of an interim \nstorage facility, something that was not considered by the DOE in its \nlatest assessments of fund sufficiency. As has already been explained, \ninterest buildup from the unspent fund balances is a key component \nensuring fund sufficiency. With large early expenditures, there will \nobviously be less interest accumulated and the fund will be less able \nto cover long-term costs.\n\n  This amendment is all about responsibility. It is all about making \nsure that costs are allocated to those who should bear them. It is all \nabout deciding who should be on the hook when shaky estimates of costs \nwell into the next century and beyond prove, as they invariably do, to \nbe off the mark. We do not know what the costs are going to be. The \nestimates are very shaky. Yet what we are doing through this bill is \nessentially transferring all of the liability to taxpayers in this \ncountry.\n  Less than a month ago, in discussing this issue on the floor of the \nSenate, one of the chief sponsors of the bill, the Senator from Idaho, \nsaid, ``It is irresponsible to shirk our responsibility to protect the \nenvironment and the future for our children and grandchildren.'' I \ncould not agree with him more. But protecting our children and \ngrandchildren also means protecting their wallets, as I am sure he \nwould agree. We have spent an enormous amount of time and effort in the \npast few years cutting the deficit and moving toward a balanced budget, \nin large part to protect future generations. Let us have some \nconsistency. Let us keep that goal in mind. Let us not stick future \ngenerations of taxpayers with a potentially enormous liability. Let the \ntitle to nuclear waste stay with those who generate it. That is what \nthis amendment says.\n  It is simple. It is straightforward.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes and 11 seconds.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 5037, as Modified\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I may reserve the remainder of my time \nbut, before I do, if I could, I ask my amendment be modified to effect \nthe changes in page and line at the desk, necessary because of the \nadoption of the amendment of Senator Murkowski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5037), as modified, as follows:\n\n       On page 52 of the bill, as amended by Murkowski amendment \n     No. 5055, strike lines 15 through 16 and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following:\n       ``(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act \n     (except subsection (b) of this section) or contract as \n     defined in section 2 of this Act, the Secretary shall not \n     accept title to spent nuclear fuel or high-level nuclear \n     waste generated by a commercial nuclear power reactor unless \n     the Secretary determines that accepting title to the fuel or \n     waste is necessary to enable the Secretary to protect \n     adequately the public health or safety, or the environment. \n     To the extent that the Federal Government is responsible for \n     personal or property damages arising from such fuel or waste \n     while in the Federal Government's possession, such liability \n     shall be borne by the Federal Government.''\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I believe we have a half hour on our side, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is my intention to yield to the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana 15 minutes and the Senator from Minnesota 5, the \nSenator from Idaho 5, and I will use the other 5 at the conclusion. And \nthat takes care of our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, the amendment of the Senator from \nMinnesota is based upon two profoundly wrong assumptions. The first \nassumption is that the Federal Government, acting through this \nCongress, has the right to take away vested rights of American citizens \nor American corporations. It is such an item of Hornbook law--and I \nmight add fundamental fairness--that vested rights are enforceable in \nthe courts, that it hardly seems worthwhile to argue that. \nNevertheless, having said it is not worthwhile to argue it, let me just \nquote from the Winstar decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, decided July \n1, 1996, in which it says:\n\n       The Federal Government, as sovereign, has the power to \n     enter contracts that confer vested rights, and the \n     concomitant duty to honor those rights. . ..\n       If we allowed the government to break its contractual \n     promises without having to pay compensation, such a policy \n     would come at a high cost in terms of increased default \n     premiums in future government contracts and increased \n     disenchantment with the government generally.\n\n  I could quote other equally persuasive language from this decision.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield just for a moment?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. First of all, if the industry and DOE are correct, and \nthe fund is sufficient, there would be no shortfall and there would be \nno damages; is that correct? The estimates of the industry is that the \nfund is sufficient, and if that is the case, there would be no \nshortfall and therefore there would be no damages.\n  If, in fact, there were damages--let me just ask the Senator to \nrespond to the first question.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No, the Senator is wrong. First of all, damages would \nnot be paid from the nuclear waste fund. Damages would have to be paid \nfrom the judgment fund, provided elsewhere.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. But Senator, by the very estimates you have made, by \nthe very estimates that the utility companies have made, there would be \nno damages because you have said that the fund is sufficient. So there \nwould be no damages.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I have not said the fund is sufficient. DOE has said \nthe fund is sufficient. And many nuclear utilities do not believe it is \nsufficient. But the sufficiency of the fund has nothing to do with the \ndamages to which a utility would be entitled. The fund could be more \nthan sufficient and a utility would be entitled to damages based upon \nwhether the Government had violated a vested right.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Would the Senator agree with me, first of all, the \nGovernment has no right to violate a vested right of the utilities?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My response would be, if it was decided by the courts \nthat this amendment improperly breaches preexisting contracts, then \npresumably the utilities would be able to recover damages from the \nGovernment. However, I want to point out one more time that if the \nindustry and the DOE are correct, that the fund is sufficient, there \nwould be no shortfall and therefore there would be no damages. That \nwould be up to the courts to decide.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Let us take this one at a time. You agree with me the \nGovernment has no right to take away vested rights, and would be liable \nfor the violation?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have said, unless they pay damages. But I have also \nmade it clear the courts would decide that and I have also made it \nclear that by the very estimates of the utility industry, this is the \nvery question that is in doubt, that there would be no damages because \nthere would be no shortfall.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, the Senator has answered my first \nquestion, which I think there is only one answer to, and that is the \nGovernment cannot violate contractual rights.\n  The second question is what is the duty of the Federal Government \nwith respect to nuclear waste? It so happens that the Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia has decided that very question \ndefinitively and clearly on July 23, 1996. Here is what they have said. \nI hope the Senator from Minnesota will not leave. What the decision \nsaid, and it is very clear:\n\n       Thus we hold that section 302(a)(5)(B) creates an \n     obligation in DOE, reciprocal to the utilities' obligation to \n     pay, to start disposing of spent nuclear fuel no later than \n     January 31, 1998.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       . . . we hold that the Nuclear Waste Policy Act creates an \n     obligation in DOE . . . to start disposing of the spent \n     nuclear fuel no later than January 31, 1998.\n\n\n[[Page S9219]]\n\n\n  What the decision does is delineates between the duty of the Federal \nGovernment to accept title, which the court clearly says is dependent \nupon the completion of a nuclear repository, and the duty to dispose of \nthe spent nuclear fuel on January 31, 1998, which is an absolute duty.\n  So, come January 31, 1998, the Federal Government must dispose of \nthis nuclear waste, whether or not the facility is complete. And, if \nthe amendment of the Senator from Minnesota were agreed to, it would \nhave nothing to do with the obligation of the Federal Government to pay \ndamages. The obligation of the Federal Government to pay damages and \nthe sufficiency of the nuclear waste fund are two separate things. If, \non January 31, 1998, the repository is not complete, and it will not be \ncomplete, and there are utilities which must build their own dry cask \nstorage at their own expense, I believe it is clear, based on this \ndecision of the court of appeals, that the Federal Government would \nhave to pay damages. Where they would pay the damages from--I believe \nit would have to come from the damage fund and not from this, the \nnuclear waste fund, but that would be a separate item for the court to \ndecide.\n  But the point is, it is very clear that this amendment cannot succeed \nin doing what the Senator from Minnesota says. The Senator from \nMinnesota says that this amendment takes the burden off the taxpayers--\noff the ratepayers, and puts it on the utilities.\n  Mr. President, that cannot be. The utilities have vested rights, \nrecognized by the Supreme Court as late as July of this year. This very \nmonth, the Supreme Court has reiterated a very longstanding principle \nof law, which is that vested rights cannot be taken away by this \nCongress or by the courts. The utilities have a vested right to have \nthe Federal Government dispose of their waste by January 31, 1998. You \nsimply cannot take away that duty.\n  I ask the distinguished Senator from Minnesota if he agrees with my \ninterpretation of the court of appeals' decision rendered last week in \nthat the Federal Government has an unqualified duty ``to start \ndisposing of the spent nuclear fuel no later than January 31, 1998\"? \nDoes the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The court decision only deals with the statute, and we \nare changing law. I was out during part of the Senator's presentation, \nand I think the part of the finding of the court that you did not read \nI will read when I have time. So I will come back to it.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I am reading right here:\n\n       Thus, we hold that the Nuclear Waste Policy Act creates an \n     obligation in DOE to start disposing of the spent nuclear \n     fuel no later than January 31, 1998.\n\n  Is there any disagreement with what I read in the decision?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I don't disagree with that.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. And the Senator would not disagree you can't take away \nthat right legislatively, can you?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. This doesn't take away this right legislatively.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Then how in the world can the Senator say they are \ntransferring the duty of disposing of nuclear waste from the Federal \nGovernment or the taxpayers and giving that to the utilities?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. There is a basic distinction. You are talking about \npossession, and I am talking about title. I did not say there wasn't a \ncommitment to change this in terms of possession. I read the findings \nof the original legislation, and I am telling you that when we had the \noriginal findings, the original bill, it was made very clear that, in \nfact, when it comes to title and when it comes to the actual liability \nof paying for this, this should be paid for by people who benefit from \nnuclear power, not by taxpayers across the country. Period.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The decision of the court of appeals makes clear that \nthey have a vested right to the title passing as of the time that the \nnuclear repository is built and not until that time, but they have the \nduty to dispose of the waste January 31, 1998.\n  Is the Senator saying that their duty to dispose of the waste does \nnot involve any responsibility, any duty to pay damages?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me just read from the decision to put this to rest \nand the part you did not read:\n\n       In addition, contrary to DOE's assertions, it is not \n     illogical for DOE to begin to dispose of SNF by the 1998 \n     deadline and, yet, not take title to the SNF until a later \n     date.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. What is the difference in liability between having the \nduty to dispose of and in taking title?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Dispose of has to do with possession, and title has to \ndo with who pays for it. As a matter of fact, let me read for you, as \nlong as this is on your time and not on my time, let me read for you--\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Well, I don't want--\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The original findings of the bill that you wrote.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I have limited time remaining. Mr. President, what the \nSenator is saying is so illogical. We have established that the Federal \nGovernment has the duty to dispose of spent nuclear fuel, and the \nSenator is saying that that duty carries with it no responsibility to \npay damages, no financial responsibility; that that somehow stays with \nthe title.\n  Mr. President, that is just not so. What the court said in the court \nof appeals' decision is that they are withholding the remedy until \nJanuary 31, 1998, because the Federal Government would not have \ndefaulted until that time. That is when the duty of the Federal \nGovernment to dispose of the waste ripens, January 31, 1998.\n  We cannot come in here and say, ``Well, we're going to pass that duty \non to the utilities because they are somehow at fault.'' Mr. President, \nthat is just so clearly not the law. I believe that it is simply not an \nargument that bears any weight at all.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield 1 minute?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I will yield on your time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. On your time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is right, for 1 minute. This does not say the \nFederal Government does not have the responsibility to take the waste. \nThat is not this amendment. The Senator mischaracterizes this \namendment. That is a straw-man or straw-person argument. This amendment \ndeals with the whole question of liability.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No; it does not----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. In the very court decision the Senator cited, the \ncourt did not find this to be illogical; they made that distinction. I \nam not arguing the Federal Government should not take responsibility. I \nbelieve we should live up to that responsibility. This is a question of \nwhether or not taxpayers should have to pay for the liability of it.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. First of all, the Senator's amendment does not mention \nliability.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. This is not on my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Or the taxpayers. It simply says who has title and the \nfact that title and responsibility are not the same thing. I reserve \nthe remainder of my time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Grams from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to follow up on what the Senator \nfrom Louisiana was saying.\n  Just last week, the courts reaffirmed what the Congress and also the \nNation's taxpayers have known since 1982 when this contract, this \nagreement was worked out, and that is, the Department of Energy has the \nlegal obligation to begin accepting nuclear waste by January 31, 1998.\n  This ruling by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the second highest \ncourt in the land, marked a historic transformation in the nuclear \nwaste debate. We are no longer discussing whether or not DOE has a \nresponsibility to accept the waste, but how quickly we can move toward \nthe final disposal solution.\n\n  As my colleagues know, the roadblocks have not been environmental or \ntechnological, only political. After nearly 15 years, and at a cost to \nthe Nation's electric consumers of $12 billion, the courts appear to \nhave finally cleared that path.\n  So why are some of our colleagues still trying to raise new \nobstacles? Is it because they are opposed to finding a real resolution \nto this environmental crisis?\n\n[[Page S9220]]\n\n  I cannot believe anyone would want to see nuclear waste continue to \npile up in some 35 States, 41 if you include waste produced by the \nGovernment. Many of those States' utility commissioners argue that the \nratepayer had paid for the waste to be removed and stored at a single \npermanent site. It was the DOE's failure to live up to its end of the \nbargain that led to the highly publicized lawsuit against DOE.\n  The three circuit court judges concurred with the States' opinion and \nrejected the DOE's attempt to ``rewrite the law.'' Even so, some of our \ncolleagues want to rewrite that law today. Such amendments reject the \nmandatory obligation of the DOE to take title to the spent fuel in \n1998. They are merely an attempt to rewrite the law under the guise \nthat somehow ratepayers are different than taxpayers.\n  By vilifying those customers who are served by nuclear power \nfacilities, the opponents of nuclear power hope to refocus the debate. \nHiding behind the cloak of so-called taxpayer protection, they refuse \nto acknowledge the fact that moving forward with a permanent disposable \nprogram is the best way to avoid a taxpayer bailout.\n  In fact, entities as diverse as the National Association of \nRegulatory Utility Commissioners and the utilities themselves have \ncalculated that enactment of S. 1936 would save $5 billion to $10 \nbillion to the U.S. taxpayers/ratepayers.\n  What I find most disturbing is this false differentiation of electric \ncustomers served by nuclear utilities from the rest of the public. The \nidea that somehow these Americans reaped the benefit of low-cost power \nfor years and are now somehow trying to get out of their obligation to \npay for the waste is an affront to the citizens of this country.\n  Over the last decade and a half, Minnesotans have paid nearly $250 \nmillion in exchange for the unmet promises that the DOE would \npermanently store our State's nuclear waste. Again, the Nation has paid \n$12 billion, nationwide, into the nuclear waste trust fund. I believe \nthe ratepayers have now lived up to their end of the bargain and met \ntheir financial obligation. It is the DOE that has not.\n  But what about those who have benefited indirectly from nuclear \npower? I am referring to the customers served by utilities that \nthemselves do not own nuclear generating stations but that from time to \ntime do purchase the low-cost nuclear power. Aren't these the same \ntaxpayers that opponents of this bill are seeking to protect? Yet don't \nthese individuals share some of the responsibility? This issue is \nclearly explained in the letter that I received from Minnesota \nDepartment of Public Service Commissioner Kris Sanda. Commissioner \nSanda wrote:\n\n       For reliability reasons, our Nation's electrical grid is \n     divided into several regional power pools. The Mid-Continent \n     Power Pool serves our home state [of Minnesota, as well as] \n     North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, portions of Montana \n     and Wisconsin . . .\n       In addition to ensuring the reliable delivery of electrical \n     energy, MAPP [as it is called] serves as a clearinghouse for \n     spot and intermediate term market for energy and capacity \n     transactions . . .\n       There are certain times of day and seasons of the year when \n     energy from those plants is sold by [a nuclear generating \n     facility] to other utilities in MAPP . . .\n\n  So in other words, other areas of the country receive this power.\n\n       It is without question . . . that all Minnesotans benefit \n     from [NSP's] nuclear facilities, regardless of which utility \n     provides their power . . .\n       The same is true for virtually all consumers across the \n     country, even those whose primary utility does not use \n     nuclear fuel to generate electricity.\n\n  Therefore, responsibility for funding a permanent storage site is \nclearly shared by all of the Nation's power consumers. And Congress has \nthe responsibility for ensuring that DOE builds an environmentally \nsound facility.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I think it is important that our vote to \nreject this amendment will send a clear message that we reject these \nattempts by the antinuclear forces to portray as villains the electric \nconsumers served by nuclear generating stations. I urge my colleagues \nto support final passage of S. 1936.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Does the Senator from Minnesota wish to----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. A quick response to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. This is on the time of the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct. I will take my 11 minutes now, if it \nis all right.\n  First, a quick response. This amendment has nothing to do with the \nFederal Government living up to its commitment to take the waste. I am \nin favor of that. This amendment has to do with who pays the cost over \n10,000 years; it has to do with tax liability. You cannot mix apples \nand oranges.\n\n  Let me just yield to the Senator from Nevada for 1 minute, please.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator.\n  I call my colleagues' attention to this. Under the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act, the Department of Energy and the utilities entered into a \ncontract. It is the contractual liability that becomes the issue as a \nresult of the court's decision that the senior Senator from Louisiana \nreferenced.\n  Under the contract provision, the remedy is spelled out. If the \ndelays are unavoidable, there is no liability in a financial sense. The \nschedule for receiving shipment is adjusted accordingly. If it is \ndetermined that the Department of Energy has been responsible for the \ndelay, an adjustment is made with respect to the fees that are paid \ninto the nuclear waste trust fund. So those are the remedies that are \nprovided. I thank the Senator from Minnesota for yielding me time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. How much time is remaining for this Senator?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Idaho, Senator \nCraig.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my chairman for yielding, and let \nme thank him for the work he has done on this legislation and the \neffort that has been put forth by the senior Senator from the State of \nLouisiana, to bring us to where we are at this moment.\n  I do not oftentimes do this, but I think it is time to speak to the \ncitizens of Minnesota, because their Senator has produced an amendment \nthat in my opinion reverses a longstanding Government policy. This \namendment purports to release the Government from its obligation to \ntake the waste.\n  The Senator from Minnesota calls this a taxpayers' protection \namendment. What he does not tell us is that it would nail the \nratepayer, the ratepayers of his State. For instance, it would force \nthe people of Minnesota who have already paid over $229 million into \nthe waste fund to pay millions more to build more storage sites at \ntheir reactors. Minnesotans have already paid twice. I believe the \nWellstone amendment, if the courts upheld it, would force Minnesotans, \nwho get 31 percent of their electricity from nuclear power, to pay \nagain and again and again.\n  Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that DOE has an \nobligation, and that has been thoroughly debated by the Senator from \nMinnesota and the Senator from Louisiana. It is very clear what the \ncourt said. The obligation exists. We will decide when the time comes \nthat you have the responsibility to take it how you will take it.\n  This amendment, in my opinion, is unfair and it changes the rules in \nthe middle of the game. It damages tremendously the citizens of the \nState of Minnesota who have already invested heavily in what they \nbelieved was the Government's role in taking care of this waste issue. \nIn fact, the courts held that the Congress cannot change the \ncontractual obligations of the Government, precisely because it would \nnot be fair. If we were to be able to do something like this, no one \nwould ever sign a contract with the Federal Government. Let me repeat: \nNo one would ever sign a contract with the Federal Government if the \nCongress could come along, willy-nilly after the fact, and change the \nrules.\n  This amendment is little more than an effort to kill the bill--I do \nnot think there is any doubt about it--that is the source of 22 percent \nof our Nation's electrical power and 31 percent of the electrical power \nfor the State of Minnesota. That would be, in my opinion, one of the \nworst environmental votes we could make.\n\n[[Page S9221]]\n\n  Minnesota nuclear power plants have reduced Minnesota's carbon \ndioxide emissions by 3 million metric tons in 1995, and by 55 million \nmetric tons from 1973 to today. Last year, nuclear power in Minnesota \ndisplaced 118,000 tons of sulfur dioxide and 53,000 tons of nitrogen \noxide.\n  Following Senator Wellstone's prescription, if that is what the \nCongress chooses to do and what becomes law, could result in more \nemissions of acid rain and more carbon emissions than the climate could \ntolerate.\n  Somehow we have to also talk about the tremendous advantage the \ncitizens of Minnesota have received from the clean source of power, 31 \npercent of their power, the electrical power. Now, today, we are \ninsisting by this legislation, a process that allows us to adhere to \nwhat the courts have said is our contractual relationship with the \nratepayers of our country who receive the benefits of nuclear power, \nand to do something positive for the environment, to do something that \nwill say this country is going to be responsible in the management of \nhigh-level nuclear waste in a way that is optimum science, in a way \nthat maximizes our pledge and our responsibility to the citizens of \nthis country.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will vote with me in tabling the Wellstone \namendment. We need not kill the process. We need not stick the citizens \nof Minnesota with additional millions and millions of dollars where \nthey are going to be forced to either build additional storage \nfacilities or turn their lights out.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I speak, too, to the people of \nMinnesota, but will speak first of all to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. How much time is left on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 2 minutes, the \nSenator from Alaska has 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will take 1 minute to respond.\n  The Senator wants it both ways. First he says the utility companies \nare absolutely right, the fund is sufficient to cover the costs. Now he \nis saying the ratepayers of Minnesota will have to pay all this \nadditional money with his scare stories.\n  First the utility companies say this fund is sufficient to pay the \ncost. So, if that is the case, Senator, there will be no additional \ncost. But if the fund is not sufficient, over 10,000 years, then, Mr. \nPresident, the question is, who pays the costs? People in Minnesota \nbelieve that, as a matter of fact, the people who benefit pay the cost.\n  I come from a State with a standard of fairness. Nobody wants to see \nan unfunded liability transferred by sleight of hand to taxpayers \neverywhere all across this country, period.\n  As far as the environment is concerned, Senator, since you were a bit \npersonal and I will not be too personal, I would be pleased to match my \nenvironmental record with your environmental record for the citizens of \nMinnesota to look at any day.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield 1 minute?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Louisiana and 1 \nminute to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Minnesota has \nanother fundamental misconception and that is the question of the \nsufficiency of the fund.\n  DOE has said they believe the fund is sufficient to build the \nrepository. To quote them, ``The preliminary assessment which is still \nunder management review, indicates the fee is adequate to ensure total \ncost recovery.'' That means for building the repository. That is what \nDOE says. I, frankly, think it is probably not going to be sufficient, \nin my own view, but that is what they say.\n  No one has said that the fund is sufficient to cover both the cost of \ndamages to Northern States of power and other utilities all around the \ncountry and to also build the repository. That is paying twice--paying \nto the utilities for their own, what we call dry cask storage, and also \nbuilding the repository at Yucca Mountain or wherever in the country \nthey decide to build it.\n\n  That is the fundamental misconception, Mr. President. If you have \nthese damages caused by the delay that Congress puts in, then clearly \nthe fund will not be sufficient to pay for that.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield to the Senator from Idaho.\n  How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes remains.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield 2 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my chairman for yielding.\n  This is not a question of whether the fund is sufficient. I agree \nwith the Senator from Louisiana. I have spent an awful lot of time \nstudying, and when push comes to shove, obviously the amendment that \nthe Senator from Minnesota would inject into it, the question becomes, \nis it sufficient or not?\n  What I am talking about are utilities in Minnesota who no longer have \nstorage facilities and had relied on the Government to take the high-\nlevel waste that they were paying for. My guess is that if this \nSenator's amendment passes, that comes into question.\n  Do you turn the power off or do you build additional storage \nfacility?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. No, I will not yield. The Senator has his own time.\n  My point is simply this: If you have changed the contractual \nrelationship, then you have changed the obligations. If you do that, \nsomebody else has to pay. Who has been paying in Minnesota? The \nratepayers. Who would pay under the amendment of the Senator from \nMinnesota? The ratepayers. That is what I believe thorough study of \nthis amendment would cause if it were to become law.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think it is important to recognize we \nhad a very clear understanding. A deal was made, the ratepayers would \npay a fee and the Government would take title of the waste, period. \nThat was the arrangement.\n  We cannot and we should not at this time revisit this decision in an \nattempt to retroactively change the deal. That is basically the basis \nfor the amendment from my friend from Minnesota.\n  Mr. President, the decision that the Government would undertake the \nobligation to take title was made in a previous Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct and is part of the contract. The utility ratepayers have paid the \nfees under the contract, and again the Government simply has to live up \nto its end of the bargain.\n  The Government already has title to large amounts, large amounts of \nspent fuel and waste that will be stored in these facilities. As a \npractical matter, the Government will be the deep pocket for liability \nfor these facilities, even if did not take title to civilian fuel.\n  We have competition and the realization that competition brings \nincreased uncertainty to the electrical industry. That is just a fact \nof business. The utilities are the corporate entities and they cease to \nexist. That is the reason why the Government agreed, wanted and felt \ncompelled to take title to spent fuel in the first place. The \nGovernment will own and operate these facilities. It is unfair now for \nthe utility ratepayers to be on the hook for a liability for facilities \nthat they have simply no control over.\n\n  So I, again, suggest to the Senator from Minnesota that the Minnesota \nratepayers have already paid twice. The Wellstone amendment, if the \nCourt upheld it, would force Minnesotans who get, I might add, 31 \npercent of their electric energy from nuclear power, to pay again and \nagain and again.\n  If Minnesota were to lose its dependence on nuclear energy, what \nwould be the alternative? I think the Senator from Idaho indicated \nthat, last year, nuclear power in Minnesota displaced 118,000 tons of \nsulfur dioxide, 53,000 tons of nitrogen oxide, and there is simply no \nother alternative, if Minnesota were to lose its dependence on nuclear \nenergy, other than to generate power from fossil fuel.\n  It is fair to say that, again, Minnesota nuclear power plants have \nreduced Minnesota's carbon dioxide emissions by 3 million metric tons \nby 1995 and, I think, 55 million metric tons since 1973. What is the \nalternative to this if we don't have the nuclear capability that so \nmany--roughly a third--Minnesota residents depend on?\n  Mr. President, has all time expired on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator\n\n[[Page S9222]]\n\nfrom Minnesota has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Has the Senator completed his remarks?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment has nothing to do with \nthe Government's obligation to take possession of the waste. I think \nthe Government should. But if the fund is insufficient, somebody will \nhave to pay for that shortfall, and that somebody is the person who \nholds title to the waste. DOE will have possession under my amendment, \nbut the utilities will retain the title.\n  My colleagues have confused this. Of course, DOE will have \npossession. But the utilities will pay the title. This is not, \nMinnesotans and all the people across the country, about turning the \nlights off. That is not what this amendment is about, and my colleagues \nknow it. It is about making sure that taxpayers don't get stuck with \nthis unfunded liability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to table the pending amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone].\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft).

The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5051\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I call up an amendment, No. 5051, which \nis at the desk. I ask it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5051.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 501 and insert in lieu thereof the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 501. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS.\n\n       ``If the requirements of any Federal, State, or local law \n     (including a requirement imposed by regulation or by any \n     other means under such a law) are inconsistent with or \n     duplicative of the requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of \n     1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.) or of this Act, the Secretary \n     shall comply only with the requirements of the Atomic Energy \n     Act of 1954 and of this Act in implementing the integrated \n     management system.''.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this amendment contains the language \npreviously filed by Senator Chafee as amendment No. 4834. This \namendment originally suggested by Senator Chafee would soften the \nexisting preemption language in the bill to clarify that only when \nanother Federal, State, or local law is inconsistent, that is, when \nanother Federal, State, or local law is inconsistent or duplicative \nwith this act, then this act will govern. Otherwise, all previous \napplications of both State and Federal environmental or safety statutes \ncontinue to apply.\n  What we have attempted to do here is craft an amendment to ensure \nthat there will be adequate oversight of all Federal and State and \nlocal laws, unless they are an obstacle to carrying out the act, \nbecause the act itself stipulates that there shall be an interim \nstorage site at Yucca Mountain under specific conditions. Some have \nexpressed concern that this language could be interpreted to provide \npreemption of other laws in cases where complying with those laws were \nsimply inconvenient or impractical. That is not the case, and it does, \nI think, strain the interpretation of the bill.\n  However, in order to address these questions, we are offering this \namendment that was suggested by Senator Chafee. This language provides \nthe Department of Energy must comply--they must comply--again, with all \nFederal, State, and local laws unless those laws are inconsistent with \nor duplicative of the requirements of S. 1936. There is an effort to, \nif you will, disguise by generalities the intent of this bill. But it \nmandates compliance, again, with all Federal, State, and local laws \nunless they are inconsistent or duplicative, duplicate the \nrequirements.\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996 contains a carefully crafted \nregulatory scheme that applies to this one unique nuclear waste storage \nfacility. Think about that: This is consistent because there is no \nother such facility in the country. So the policy act contains words \ncrafted relative to the regulatory proposal that applies to only this \none, unique, nuclear waste storage facility. Since we have no other, \nthis is designed specifically for this facility. So there is no \napplicability to any other facility.\n  Our general Federal, State and local laws are intended to apply to \nevery situation generically. So it is only appropriate that we clarify \nthat where those general laws conflict with this very specific law that \nwe are designing for this interim storage site, that we have carefully \ndrafted, with the input of many concerned people, the provisions of \nthis law, of this act, will control the process.\n  The vast majority of other laws will certainly not be subject to \nbeing superseded and will be complied with. A suggestion that the \nDepartment of Energy should be forced to attempt to comply with laws \nthat conflict with this act will simply open it up to spending years of \nlitigation on which provisions apply and is simply a recipe, Mr. \nPresident, for unnecessary delays at the ratepayers' and taxpayers' \nexpense and I think would provide full employment for a significant \nnumber of lawyers in this country.\n  So I think as we attempt to address the merits of this amendment, we \nrecognize that this is designed to address concerns that somehow this \nlegislation, as crafted, will not cover adequately all Federal, State \nand local laws of an environmental nature that are, obviously, designed \nfor the protection of the public.\n  Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time and ask if my good \nfriends from Nevada would like to have some time running. If there is \nany other Senator here who would like to be heard on this amendment, I \nwould appreciate it if they will advise the staff, and we will attempt \nto accommodate them on time.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I believe it will be helpful for our colleagues and \nstaffs listening in, because these two amendments have been described \nin the abstract. I acknowledge and confess that it has been a number of \nyears since I attended law school, but I must say,\n\n[[Page S9223]]\n\nnot even a flyspeck lawyer could make a meaningful distinction between \nthese two provisions.\n  Let me read them, because they are quite simple. Under the language \nof the amendment that was offered earlier today and was approved by the \nbody, section 501 deals with compliance with other laws. So here is the \npresent state of the legislation as we debate it. It is only a couple \nof paragraphs, so I think it important it be understood:\n\n       If the requirements of any law are inconsistent with or \n     duplicative of the requirements of the Atomic Energy Act and \n     this Act, the Secretary shall comply only with the \n     requirements of the Atomic Energy Act and this Act in \n     implementing the integrated management system.\n       Any requirement of a State or political subdivision of a \n     State is preempted (1) if complying with such requirement and \n     a requirement of this Act is impossible; (2) that such \n     requirement, as applied or enforced, is an obstacle to \n     accomplishing or carrying out this Act or regulation under \n     this Act.\n\n  So, in effect, what the bill currently does is it bifurcates, it \nmakes reference to Federal laws and then it talks about State \npreemption. But the operative language with respect to Federal law \nunder the current state of the bill is that if any requirement of any \nlaw is inconsistent with the provisions of this act, it shall not \napply.\n  By any plain reading of the language that is contained, \nany reasonable interpretation, that is, in point of fact, a Federal \npreemption.\n\n  The second part of the existing bill deals specifically with State \npreemption and has those two provisions. If it is impossible, then you \ndon't have to comply with it and, second, if it is an obstacle to \naccomplishing or carrying out the act, you don't have to comply with \nit.\n  Here is the so-called amendment that changes all of that, that solves \nit that deals with the issue. Section 501, which is the amendment \noffered by our friend from Alaska, says as follows:\n\n       If the requirement of any Federal, State or local law, \n     including a requirement imposed by regulation or by any other \n     means under such law, are inconsistent with or duplicative to \n     the requirements of the Atomic Energy Act or of this Act, the \n     Secretary shall comply only with the requirements of the \n     Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and this Act in implementing the \n     integrated management system.\n\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, it could not be clearer. One \ndoes not have to go to law school to understand that if any other \nprovision of the law is inconsistent with this bill, it does not apply.\n  What provisions are we talking about? We are talking about the entire \nframework of the environmental laws in America that have been enacted \nsince the early 1970's. And lest this debate be deemed to be of a \npartisan nature--and I assure my colleagues it is not--many of those \nprovisions were enacted under the Presidency of Richard Nixon.\n  Here is what we wipe out: If, for example, the Clean Air Act is \ninconsistent with the bill that we are going to be asked to vote on for \nfinal passage later on today, the entire Clean Air Act does not apply.\n  If the Clean Water Act has any provision that is inconsistent with \nthe provisions of this act, it does not apply.\n  If the Superfund law has any provision inconsistent with the \nprovisions of the bill that we are being asked to vote on, it does not \napply.\n  If the National Environmental Policy Act contains any provision that \nis inconsistent with the provisions of the bill that we are going to be \nasked to vote on, it does not apply.\n  If FLPMA, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, has any \nprovision inconsistent with this bill, it does not apply.\n  Think about that for a moment. This is truly a nuclear utility's \ndream. In effect, these provisions that are the framework of our \nenvironmental policy in America, most of which have been enacted over \nthe past two decades, that none of these, not a one, not one has any \nforce of law whatsoever if it is deemed to be in conflict with the \nprovisions of this act.\n  I know that a number of my colleagues have been persuaded, and I \nregret that fact, that there is a great urgency and imperative to move \nnuclear waste. This is all, in my opinion, part of a fabricated, as the \nWashington Post concluded, contrived argument. They have been at this \nnow for 16 years.\n  If we were looking at the Congressional Record of this very week in \n1980, my colleagues, I think, would be surprised, because the thrust of \nthe argument is identical: ``Hey, we've got to have this, we've got to \nhave it right away. Waive the acts, waive the laws, we have to get this \ngoing.''\n  In point of fact, I call this to my colleagues' attention. \nCongressional Record, July 28, 1980, 16 years ago:\n       Mr. President, this bill deals comprehensively with the \n     problem of civilian nuclear waste.\n\n  That sounds familiar.\n\n       It is an urgent problem--\n\n  That kind of sounds familiar, too, doesn't it?\n\n     Mr. President, for this Nation. It is urgent, first, because \n     we are running out of reactor space at reactors for storage \n     of the fuel, and if we do not build what we call away-from-\n     reactor storage--\n\n  That is a little different. We call it interim storage now, but away-\nfrom-reactor storage is the same basic concept--\n\n     and begin that soon, we could begin shutting down civilian \n     nuclear reactors in this country as soon as 1983, those \n     predictions coming from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and \n     the Department of Energy.\n\n  That is 1980.\n  As of 1983, 13 years ago, not a single nuclear utility in America has \nshut down because it has run out of space. So when we use ``contrived'' \nand ``fabricated,'' that is precisely the language to describe it.\n  That is why every environmental organization in America that I am \naware of has examined the preemption sections and have concluded that \nit would be bad, bad public policy. From the Sierra Club to public-\ninterest groups to Citizen Awareness to the League of Conservation \nVoters, and many, many more.\n  So I hear my colleagues often talk about this, the proponents of this \nbill, that this is an important piece of environmental legislation. Let \nme be clear. This is an important piece of environmental legislation, \nyes, because it would be a disaster repealing, by implication and by \nexpressed language, all of the provisions that have been enacted for \nmore than a quarter of a century as it relates to this process.\n  So that is why in a letter that has been sent to the Democratic \nleader, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Ms. \nBrowner, has specifically referenced the fact that this would be a \npreemption.\n  I quote her letter when she indicates:\n\n       EPA is also concerned with provisions of S. 1936 and the \n     substitute amendments--\n\n  The one that we are addressing right now--\n\n       which preempt the environmental protections provided by \n     other environmental statutes. Section 501 in the bill and \n     amendment preempts all Federal, state, and local \n     environmental laws applicable to the Yucca Mountain facility \n     if they are inconsistent with or duplicative of the [specific \n     piece of legislation we are talking about].\n\n  So I think that the colleagues who want to say to themselves, well, \nin this debate who has more credibility with respect to whether or not \nthis is preemption? The agency under the law, the Environmental \nProtection Agency's Administrator has been very clear. It is clearly a \npreemption. The environmental organizations in America who have looked \nat this all have concluded that it is a preemption and, for that \nreason, would be an environmental disaster.\n  But may I say, just plain ordinary English, just read it. It could \nnot be clearer. ``If the requirements of any Federal, State, or local \nlaw (including a requirement imposed by regulation or by any other \nmeans under such a law) are inconsistent with or duplicative of the \nrequirements of the Atomic Energy Act * * * or of this Act, the \nSecretary shall comply only''--only--``with the requirements of the \nAtomic Energy Act * * * and of this Act * * *.''\n  So, Mr. President, I think it is beyond refutation, beyond argument. \nWhy is that important? My colleague from Nevada, in a moment, will \nexpand upon one aspect of that, and that is the transportation issue.\n  Let me just say, to give a little flavor of this, that it is \ncontemplated, under this piece of legislation that would create an \ninterim storage facility, that 85,000 metric tons of fuel would be \nshipped from existing commercial reactors and transported to the Nevada \ntest site in Nevada. That is about 6,200 shipments by truck, about \n9,400 by rail. Some have indicated those numbers understate the amount.\n\n[[Page S9224]]\n\n  Each truck cask weighs 25 tons, each rail cask up to 125 tons. Each \nrail cask--that is the one that is 125 tons--contains the radiological \nequivalent, in terms of long-life radiation, of 200 Hiroshima bombs. So \nwhen we refer to this as a ``mobile Chernobyl,'' this nuclear waste is \nrolling through your community. My colleague will address that in more \ndetail. Fifty-one million Americans live within 1 mile of one of the \nrail or highway transportation routes that would be involved in the \ntransshipment of these 85,000 metric tons.\n\n  I may say that my friend from a previous life--the distinguished \noccupant of the chair--his State knows well the circumstance because \nhis predecessors, in the aftermath of Three Mile Island, were very much \ninvolved in a debate because much of that waste would have gone through \nthe St. Louis metropolitan area.\n  I just say that the transportation route which I know my friend fully \nunderstands contemplates 6,000 shipments that will move through St. \nLouis, just to cite one particular State and a large metropolitan area \nthat would be exposed to this risk. Let me just repeat, before yielding \nto my colleague, that each one of those rail casks, 125 tons, with the \nradioactive equivalent of 200 Hiroshima-sized bombs--now, admittedly, \nthe truck casks are slightly different; they are 25 tons--so let us say \nthat each one of those shipments roughly would contain the equivalent \nof 40 Hiroshima-sized bombs in terms of the amount of long-lived \nnuclear radiation that would be involved.\n  So when we are talking about preempting all of these laws, this is \nnot just a law school or academic or esoteric issue. This is something \nthat has been designed by Democrats and Republicans alike over a \nquarter of a century and is designed to protect Americans everywhere--\neverywhere. We are talking about 43 States that would be involved in \nthis transportation route. So I know that many of our colleagues have \nheard our arguments and are perhaps weary of them.\n  But let me urge them to look at these preemption provisions. They are \nantienvironment. They are opposed by every environmental organization \nin America. We are not just talking about some technical, abstract \nproposition. We are talking about the full panoply of environmental \nlaws designed to protect all Americans. Very clearly, what the \namendment offered by the Senator from Alaska would do, it would do the \nsame, in my view, as the language in the present bill and simply say \nthat, if any of these provisions conflict in any way with the \nprovisions of this act, they simply are to be ignored and set aside.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We have one-half hour remaining. Senator Johnston has \nindicated that he would like to respond very briefly for 2 minutes, and \nthen I intend to recognize the Senator from North Carolina for \napproximately 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 24 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  I want to briefly reply to a statement that was made a little earlier \nby the Senator from Nevada, quoting me a few years back saying that \nnuclear powerplants were running out of space. The fact of the matter \nis, that statement was true.\n  What has happened since that time is two things. First, there has \nbeen a regulatory and technological change in allowing what is called \nreracking or a greater density of nuclear rods in the swimming pools, \nusing more boron and a change in licensing.\n  The change in licensing, obviously, was not under the control of the \nutilities, and they have allowed that. I might say that is now at its \nmaximum. Some would say that the NRC is flirting with the safety \nquestion by allowing such density of reracking.\n  But, in addition to that, Mr. President, some utilities have been \nforced to buy their own dry cask storage at great expense. The Surry VA \nnuclear plant has been required to do so, the Calvert Cliffs plant in \nMaryland has been required to do so, and Northern States Power in \nMinnesota has been required to do so.\n  As mentioned earlier, according to the decision just rendered by the \nD.C. Court of Appeals, that will become, on January 31, 1998, the \nresponsibility of the Federal Government to pay for. That is really \nwhat is at issue here in the interim storage. That is, if we do not \nbuild interim storage, then the Federal Government is going to have to \npay for the dry cask storage on site for a host of utilities, not just \nthe three which have it now, but for a host of utilities all around the \ncountry.\n  So, ratepayers and taxpayers will be paying twice, first, with the \nnuclear waste fee, and, second, with the damages which will be assessed \nto the Federal Government to pay for the dry cask storage. That $5 \nbillion additional fee for damages to the Federal Government can and \nshould be avoided. That is what we seek to do in this legislation. I \nthank my colleague.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, if ever we have had a commonsense \nsolution to a complex problem come through the Senate, it is S. 1936. \nIt is a sensible way to deal with the high-level radioactive waste that \nhas been accumulating in 110 commercial nuclear units throughout the \ncountry.\n  Regrettably, Mr. President, this bill has been met with wave after \nwave of opposition based on emotion and ulterior motives rather than \nthe true scientific facts of what we are dealing with.\n  It is now time for this Senate to stand up and make workable \ndecisions using the facts, those facts that we know and have been \nproven, and ignoring the conflicting rhetoric, no matter how loudly it \nis expressed.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Clean Air, Wetlands, Private \nProperty and Nuclear Safety, I am fully confident S. 1936 is a proper \napproach that will ensure the storage, disposal, and transportation of \nspent nuclear fuel and will be accomplished under all necessary safety \nrequirements.\n  Mr. President, it has been brought up that safety is not really the \nissue here. Opponents wish to use safety as a stalking horse, because \nby keeping spent fuel in a state of uncertainty, they can argue that no \nmore nuclear plants should be built and current plants should be \nclosed.\n  The strategy is very simple: Confuse the debate when you do not have \na legitimate argument. This is really not about disposal of spent fuel. \nWhat we are really talking about here is the future of nuclear energy \nas a generator of power in this Nation. The Federal Government has a \nlegal responsibility to take the utilities' spent fuel. This is a legal \nresponsibility.\n  Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \ncited the Department of Energy must begin accepting this waste by \nJanuary 1, 1998, an obvious ruling considering the clear requirements \nof the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. It seems that just about \neverybody understands this except the Department of Energy.\n  Taxpayers are not paying for spent fuel disposal. Fulfilling their \npart of the bargain, electric utility customers have contributed $12 \nbillion into the nuclear waste fund, $344 million from North Carolina \nalone. Now, it is time for the Federal Government to live up to its \npart of the bargain.\n  Utilities do not have enough onsite spent fuel storage space to \npermit electrical production to continue for the entire life of their \nplants, which is 40 years, and possibly many, many more. The Federal \nGovernment has to fulfill its responsibility and start taking the spent \nfuel.\n  If we continue to accept delays, inexcusable delays that have plagued \nthis program, the same utility customers will be forced to pay twice \nand finance the expansion of new construction at existing plants to \nstore spent fuel. Those who advocate delaying centralized storage \nbelieve it is better, instead, to store spent fuel at 110 nuclear units \naround the country than in one area. If ever there was a false idea as \nto the safety of storing it, it is to have it in 110 different \nlocations.\n  Mr. President, let me address the concern that has been raised about \nthe transportation of nuclear fuel. The Federal Government currently \ntransports spent fuel from foreign research reactors in the name of \nreducing the risk of proliferation. We do it very well. The Navy moves \nspent fuel for temporary storage in Idaho, and utilities transport fuel \nbetween stations. Transporting and storing fuel is one of the few \nthings we do very well.\n\n[[Page S9225]]\n\n  There is absolutely no reason for any further delay, and there are \nmany compelling reasons to move forward. There is absolutely no reason \nto delay any further. There are many compelling reasons we need to move \nforward. We must pass S. 1936 to demonstrate fiscal responsibility and \nto fulfill the promises made by the U.S. Government on which, in good \nfaith, the Nation's electrical utility customers have relied.\n  Once again, let me repeat, this is not about the waste. It is not \nabout the disposal of nuclear waste. It is about the future of nuclear \nenergy in this country. That is what the opposition is fighting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho controls 15 minutes and \n45 seconds, and the other side has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if anyone has any question about where the \nmoney is on this issue, where the big lobbyists stand, all we need to \ndo is walk out this set of doors to my right prior to the next vote \nbeing called and you will find a sea of lobbyists. This is one of the \nheaviest lobbying jobs we have ever seen.\n  There are always promises about this bill, through the various \nincarnations of the legislation, that it is going to get better. Mr. \nPresident, 1271 was introduced. They said it was not quite good enough \nand tried to make it better. Thereafter, 1936 was introduced and they \nsaid it was a better bill. Now we have a number of substitutes that \nallegedly will make it better. None of them make it better.\n  I have been a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee my \nentire time in the Senate. I love working on that committee. I have \nserved as chairman of the subcommittee that dealt with chemicals and \npesticides. We held significant hearings on a drug called Alar, put on \napples, grapes, cherries, to prolong their lifetime. It was poisonous. \nIt made people sick, we believed, and is no longer used. We had \nhearings on lawn chemicals, fungicides.\n  Mr. President, I am, almost for lack of a better word, offended by \nsomeone saying that this amendment will ease the environmental laws. \nThe environmental laws are preempted. They take away all the Federal \nlaws, laws we have worked on. I cannot imagine, for example, the \nchairman of the full committee thinking that legislation like this is \ngood, legislation that I know he has fought for on a bipartisan basis, \nincluding the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, \nSuperfund--these laws are all preempted by S.1936.\n  My colleague, the Senator from Nevada, did a good job of explaining \nwhy this does not answer the problems. It is as bad with this amendment \nas without the amendment.\n  We have talked about this legislation being unnecessary, and it is \nunnecessary. The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board is not biased \ntoward either side. A group of 12 scientists, eminent scientists, said \nthat transportation of nuclear waste at this time is unnecessary and \nwrong. Their conclusions were driven by careful and objective \nexaminations of all the issues. They concluded that centralization of \nspent nuclear fuel, high-level nuclear waste, makes no technical sense, \nno safety sense, or financial sense.\n\n  They found that there is no need for off-site interim storage. They \nalso decided that transportation under this bill is extremely risky. \nWhy do they say that? They say it because it doesn't permit what is \nabsolutely necessary--that is, planning and preparation to make sure \nthat the public health and safety is protected during this massive \nundertaking.\n  Mr. President, we are not talking only about the people of Nevada, we \nare talking about the residents of 43 States. Nobody ever responds to \nthe transportation issue. People are concerned in this Chamber about \ngarbage being hauled across State lines. I don't know how many sponsors \nthere are on the legislation, but I am one of those that think there \nshould be some rules about transporting garbage. Well, this is real \ngarbage. This is real garbage. This is worse than any plastics, or \npaper, or hazardous waste that you might throw in the garbage. This is \nreal garbage.\n  In the past, we have had roughly 100 shipments per year of nuclear \nwaste, but they have gone short distances, and most of these were \nbetween various places in the eastern part of the United States in \nreprocessing facilities.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is a concern to people all over the \ncountry. I received in my office a letter from someone in St. Louis, \nMO. I did not ask for the letter. I got it in the mail. A resident of \nSt. Louis, MO, sent to me in the mail a newspaper from St. Louis. It is \ndated the middle of June. This newspaper is the Riverfront Times. One \nof the lead stories in this publication is ``Gateway to the Waste, Not \nto the West.''\n  This article says a number of things. One of the things it says is \nthis:\n\n       No matter how slim the odds of an accident, the potential \n     consequences of such a move are cataclysmic. Under the plan, \n     tons of radioactive materials would likely pass through the \n     St. Louis area by either truck or rail a few times a week for \n     the next 30 years.\n\n  We guess about 6,000 truck and train loads would pass through this \nsite.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Each cask would contain the radiological equivalent of 200 \n     Hiroshima bombs. Altogether, the nuclear dunnage would be \n     enough to kill everybody on earth.\n\n  That is why people all over the country are concerned about this \nnuclear poison. ``Safety last'' is the hallmark of this legislation. \nThis is not a Nevada issue; it is a national issue. Why? It is a \nnational issue because we have train wrecks that have occurred all over \nthe United States.\n  Look at these pictures. Here is one in Ledger, MT. If you want to \ntalk about a wreck, this is a real wreck. This is a mutilated train \noutside Ledger, MT. We also had one thousands of miles away, a recent \ntrain wreck that occurred in Corona, CA. This closed down I-15 for \nabout 4 days, off and on, which is the main road between Los Angeles, \nCA, and Las Vegas, NV. Fire burned for a long period of time.\n  Also, Mr. President, we had a train wreck that occurred in Alabama a \nlittle over a year ago. Some of the people watching this will remember. \nA barge, in effect, nicked this train trestle, and the next time the \ntrain went through, it did not go all the way through. It dumped people \nin the river, killed people.\n  People are concerned about transportation, and they should be \nconcerned about transportation, because we have been told by those who \nknow that we should not be transporting nuclear waste. There is no need \nto do it. The Nuclear Technical Review Board said there is no reason to \ndo it. They are 12 nonpartisan scientists who are trying to do the best \nthing for the country.\n  Mr. President, this spent nuclear fuel--we talk about Nevada, but it \noriginates someplace. We have here a chart that we will talk about \nlater. It shows the funnel effect of transportation. Thousands, tens of \nthousands of loads of spent nuclear fuel will be shipped and eventually \nwind up in a tiny spot in Nevada. But in the process of getting there, \nthese thousands of shipments will go into 43 different States.\n\n  Mr. President, these shipments start somewhere. They don't start in \nNevada. We don't have nuclear fuel. This is a risk to all States of the \nUnited States, not just Nevada. The industry and the sponsors of this \nbill would like you to believe that transportation is risk free. Well, \nit isn't. There have been truck and train accidents involving all kinds \nof things, including nuclear waste. We have been fortunate that there \nhas not been a great dispersion of this nuclear poison. There will be \nmore accidents because there will be tens of thousands of more loads of \nthis.\n  The industry will tell you that the probability of an accident is not \ngreat. Well, probabilities have an inevitable result, and if you push \nthem long enough, the adverse will occur. The day before Chernobyl, the \nprobability of such an accident was extremely low. The accident \nhappened and the consequences were enormous. Now, the probability of \nanother one is much more significant than it was. The same potential \nexists here.\n  Mr. President, under this legislation, as the Nuclear Technical \nReview Board said, we have not made the necessary investments to assure \ncapable responses to accidents. I talked about a few of these train \nwrecks. We know that if they are moved, they are subject to terrible \nviolation. We know that the casks have been developed to be protective \nof fire. Yes, fire for 30 minutes.\n\n[[Page S9226]]\n\n  We know that recently--in fact, last year--we had a train that burned \nfor 4 days. What will a cask do that is safe for 30 minutes of exposure \nto fire at temperatures of 1475 degrees? Well, it is pretty tough to \nunderstand that when we know that diesel fuel burns at an average \ntemperature of 1800 degrees.\n  Most of the trucks and trains use diesel fuel. Diesel fuel has had \noccurrences where the heat was 3200 degrees Fahrenheit. So why only 30 \nminutes? Why 1475 degrees? It simply will not protect us, Mr. \nPresident. They also say, well, you can get in a wreck--they have a \nlittle film in the industry, which they will show you. You will see \nthis truck firing down and the cask shoots off of it. Well, the casks \nare safe if the accident occurs if you are only going 30 miles an hour. \nIf you are going faster, you have big problems. The cask will break, \nand you are in trouble.\n  I don't know how many would think that this train accident here \noccurred when the train was going 30 miles an hour. The damage to this \nvehicle had to have occurred at more than 30 miles an hour. We all \nknow--because we have watched trains go by--that trains do go 30 miles \nan hour once in a while, but not very often. So having protection at 30 \nmiles an hour simply doesn't do the trick.\n  We have residents, Mr. President, along this route--over 50 million \nof them--within a mile of where this poison is going to be carried. The \nterm ``mobile Chernobyl'' has been coined for this legislation, and \nrightfully so. A trainload of waste may not contain the potential that \nChernobyl provided--with death and destruction in its wake, and people \nare still dying from that --but the risk is still there.\n  People know the risk of this poison. This is something that we have \ntalked about early on, about people waiting after one of these \naccidents to find out what dreaded disease they are going to get. The \nodds are that they will get something. We have had that experience in \nNevada. We know that the above-ground nuclear tests made a lot of \npeople sick, Mr. President. Most of the downwinders were in east-\ncentral Nevada and southern Utah. They got real sick. So transportation \nis something that has not been answered, it has not been responded to, \nand it should, because transportation of nuclear waste is something \nthat we simply do not know how to do yet.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho, [Mr. Craig] is \nrecognized. The Senator from Idaho has 15 minutes 16 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. What remains on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 2 minutes 11 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, will you signal me when I have spoken for \n10 minutes?\n  Mr. President, we have heard a series of statements by my colleague \nfrom Nevada that I think the least you could say about is that they \nwere subtly inflammatory. The worst you can say about them is that they \nare shocking; alarming. The only problem is, if they were true, they \nmight be that. But they are not true. Science argues it, the law argues \nit, and the facts argue it. There is nothing worse than a picture of a \ntrain wreck which my colleague from Nevada has put forth; very \ndramatic.\n  If there had been a cask of spent nuclear fuel in the middle of that \ntrain wreck, it would still be there and it would be whole and it would \nbe unbreached. That is the evidence. While my colleague from Nevada \nwould argue that these tests are at 30 miles an hour, what it shows is \nthat, in speeds in excess of 150 miles an hour, there might be a \npotential of breach. My colleague from Nevada is right. You rarely see \na train that moves less than 30, although I have never seen one moving \nat 150.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield for a question; a question, not a \nstatement, or I will take my time back. Thank you.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator inform me and the rest of the Senate where \nthe 150 miles an hour information comes from?\n  Mr. CRAIG. The 150 miles an hour we talk about in relation to the \nscience that was developed to an ``unyielding surface.'' I believe that \nis the term that is used in the test. That was the result of the \ncalculation which was a product of Sandia National Laboratory, so, I \nguess I could say, from the best engineers in the country who know how \nto look at the science and the engineering involved and come up with \nthose calculations.\n  The most I can say--and I think my colleagues deserve to hear this--\nis that the language that has been offered and the statements that have \nbeen offered this afternoon by my colleague from Nevada as it relates \nto transportation are simply misleading.\n  By the way, when you talk of Chernobyl or you talk of Hiroshima and \nyou talk of explosions, casks do not explode, period. There is no one \nin the scientific field today who would make that argument. If they \nwere breached, they would release radioactivity, but they do not \nexplode, and it is unfair to in any way paint the verbal picture that \nthat kind of risk would be involved.\n  What the paper from Missouri did not say was that waste now traffics \nthrough St. Louis, MO, and it has for a good number of years in its \nroute across the country to the State of Idaho, or to other States \nwhere the waste ultimately finds a temporary storage destination.\n  So for this to be something new in the city of St. Louis is not true. \nWhat is important to say about it is that in all the years that it has \nbeen trafficked by our Federal Government, there have been no accidents \nthat resulted in any radioactive spill. That is what is important to \nunderstand here. I think that is the issue that is so critical as we \ndebate this.\n\n  The amendment we have before us is very clear. It says that DOE must \ncomply with all Federal, State, and local laws unless they are \ninconsistent, or duplicative with the requirements of S. 1936.\n  My colleagues from Nevada could list all of the Federal laws in the \ncountry; every one of them. You can just pick and pull. The point is \nthat, if they are duplicative, then we have already met the test. Why \nask somebody to repeat and repeat again only for the exercise, the \nfutility, if you have already made the determination? Would we list all \nof the defense laws in the country? Pick any law you want. That is not \nthe issue.\n  The issue is the question of compliance being responsible, being \nenvironmentally safe, and humanly safe. I must say that, based on the \nrecord that we have already demonstrated in this country by the \ntransporting of the high-level waste of the Defense Department, we have \na spotless record.\n  So it is impossible to argue unless you really wish to only \ncharacterize this for the purposes of a motion.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I have no more time to yield. Thank you.\n  In this issue, emotion sometimes works and scare sometimes works, and \nI understand that. I have no concern about that. The citizens of my \nState are very frustrated, as I know the citizens of the State of \nNevada are. But what the citizens of Idaho have to admit is that in the \nyears that nuclear waste has been transported to Idaho or through Idaho \nthere has never been a spill. It has been transported safely. Idaho has \nbeen concerned about it and has repeatedly checked on it, and as a \nresult of all of that, it has been done in a very safe way.\n  The Hazardous Materials Transportation Act that S. 1936 complies to, \nthe responsibility that States and authorities have under that act and \nthat the local communities have under that act to assure the safest of \ntransportation, is exactly what we are achieving here. It is my intent, \nand it is the intent of the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from \nLouisiana, to assure this Senate that within the capacity of the law \nand in the capacity of science and engineering today, this is safe. \nHistory proves it to be safe. There is no way to argue an example where \nit has failed or has been unsafe.\n  At this time, I would like to yield 1 minute to my colleague from \nLouisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank my colleague for yielding, Mr. President.\n  I simply wanted to quote from the Nuclear Waste Technical Review \nBoard\n\n[[Page S9227]]\n\nof March 1996 on the question of transportation risk. The Technical \nReview Board has been quoted by both sides here today, but this bears \ndirectly on the question. It says:\n\n       The Nation has more than three decades of experience \n     transporting both civilian and DOE-owned spent fuel. In 1997, \n     471 shipments were made, 444 of which were by truck. In the \n     1980's, 100 to 200 such shipments were typically made each \n     year. Numerous analyses have been performed in recent years \n     concerning the transportation risks associated with shipping \n     spent fuel. The result of these analyses all show very low \n     levels of risk under both normal and accident conditions. The \n     safety record has been very good and corroborates the low \n     risks estimated analytically. In fact, during the decades \n     that spent fuel has been shipped, no accident has caused a \n     radioactive release.\n\n  Again, from the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board of March 1996.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 6 minutes, and the \nother side has 1 minute left.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will make a relatively short statement.\n  Mr. President, again I would like to refer specifically to what this \namendment does and what it does not do.\n  The amendment simply states that if there are provisions of law that \nare inconsistent with specific terms of this bill, then this bill is \napplicable. This bill will govern.\n  Now, the Senators from Nevada would ask that the Department of Energy \nattempt to comply with inconsistent laws.\n  I can only assume that they ask this because they know it is \nimpossible to do. That is a catch-22. That is simply a recipe for \ndelay, a recipe for additional expense, a recipe for additional \nlitigation and full employment for a lot of lawyers. Instead, we offer \na responsible provision which clarifies that while the Department of \nEnergy will comply with this act, if any Federal, State, or local law \nis not in conflict with this act, those laws will be complied with.\n  I reiterate--this is a unique, one-of-a-kind facility. That is why we \nare here today. We are designing laws to fit this facility. That is why \nwe are debating this legislation. It is not designed to do anything \nmore than address this facility. Other laws are designed for a broad \nbreadth of activities. This is unique. It contains a carefully crafted \nregulatory program, as I have said, governing this facility only. The \nposition of the Senators from Nevada, I think, results in confusion and \nattempts to thwart the will of Congress as expressed in this very \nunique piece of legislation designed for one thing.\n  Let me just mention the transportation aspect because I have had an \nopportunity to observe transportation of high-level nuclear waste in \nGreat Britain, in France, and Sweden. To suggest that American \ntechnology cannot safely develop a system and casks necessary to \ntransport this waste is simply unrealistic. It is moving by rail in \nFrance. One can go into a nuclear plant and see cars on the sidings \nthat were designed to carry the casks. It is moved in Scandinavia by \nspecial ships that have been built that traverse the shores of Sweden \nunescorted. They are in casks. They are specially crewed from the \nstandpoint of the training, but it is not Government employees, it is a \nshipping line, and they have a proven record of safety.\n  We have seen this high-level nuclear waste moved in Europe by highway \nin casks with appropriate measures. If Members will recall, there was a \nthought given a few years ago to the utilization of a Boeing 747-400 to \nmove high-level waste from the Orient to Europe, primarily because the \nJapanese were interested in bringing their waste back to France for \nreprocessing. So you would be basically moving waste that contains \nplutonium. The question quite legitimately came up, can you design a \ncask to withstand a free fall at 30,000 feet? And the answer was, yes, \nit can be done. It will cost a good deal of money.\n  What we are talking about here is a realization that we have moved \nthis material for an extended period of time throughout Europe. We have \nmoved it in the United States to a lesser degree. But if we adopt this \nlegislation and if Yucca is the interim site for a repository, to \nsuggest that we cannot move it safely defies realism, defies the \nexperience that other countries have had, and I think it sells American \ntechnology short.\n  I see no other Senator at this time who desires to speak, and I \nreserve the remainder of my time pending the disposition of the pending \namendment.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from Nevada [Mr. \nBryan] is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator.\n  Let me respond briefly. The Senator from Idaho was unable to respond \nto my question because of time limitations, but he was going on at some \nlength as to why the Senators from Nevada would insist that there, in \neffect, be a duplicative experience when the law already covered it.\n  A point I want to make very emphatically is the Senator from Idaho is \nquoting from only a part of the preemption language. The preemption \nlanguage, in effect, says that if the requirements of any Federal, \nState, or local law are inconsistent with--inconsistent with--or \nduplicative. So the point I made, I think, is a telling one and one \nthat is irrefutable, in my opinion, namely that all of these \nenvironmental laws that we talked about, if there is a conflict, do not \napply.\n\n  I must say that in terms of public policy, putting aside one's view \nfor the moment of how you feel about nuclear waste and any urgency that \nmay or may not be present, what a disastrous public policy it is to \nwipe out the environmental laws, and that is why every environmental \norganization has opposed this language and that is why the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency has strongly resisted it.\n  Let me talk a moment about the casks, and we will talk a lot more \nabout transportation later on in this debate. The senior Senator from \nLouisiana cites the numbers that have been shipped around the country. \nI am sure he is absolutely accurate. But we are talking about something \nof a scale and dimension unprecedented anywhere in the world--85,000 \nmetric tons, 16,000 shipments. We are not talking about 100. We are \ntalking about 16,000 shipments. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nclaims that the cask design will fail in 6 of every 1,000 rail \naccidents. Built into this, the laws of probability tell us that with \nthe heightened and elevated volume, you are going to have an accident \nand a failure.\n  Finally, I would just like to say with respect to the casks, what has \ndriven this entire debate about nuclear waste over the years is how to \ndo it cheaper, how to do it faster. That is where the nuclear utilities \nare coming from. And so the new casks that are going to be used to \nstore this have not yet been designed and they will be less expensive \nand subject to less rigorous standards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators' time has expired.\n  The Senator from Alaska has 1 minute and 6 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time of the Senators from Nevada has \nexpired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I say to my friend relative to his reference to an \nunprecedented scale which he suggests will occur, that factually is \njust not so. As a matter of fact, the French alone have moved 30,000 \nmetric tons of spent fuel--that is spent nuclear fuel. This is the same \namount we currently have, or approximately the same amount we have in \nthe United States today.\n  I remind my colleagues of one other thing. While it is true we do not \nhave support from the environmental movement in this country, the \nreality is that most of those groups are opposed to the generation of \npower by nuclear energy. What they do not do is recognize the \nobligation that since we are nearly 22 percent dependent on nuclear \nenergy, we are going to have to meet the demand with something else. \nNuclear power opponents want to terminate the industry, by not allowing \nthe States to have the availability of storage under State licenses. So \nwhen one looks at the environmental concern, you have to recognize the \nenvironmentalists are not really meeting their obligation, and that is \nto come up with an alternative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  All time has expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it would be my intention to ask for a \nvoice vote on this amendment unless there is an objection.\n\n[[Page S9228]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection? If not, the question \noccurs on agreeing to Murkowski amendment No. 5051.\n  The amendment (No. 5051) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5048\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I call up amendment numbered 5048 which \nis at the desk and ask that it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr.Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5048.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike subsections (h) through (i) of section 201 and \n     insert in lieu thereof the following--\n       ``(h) Benefits Agreement.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall offer to enter into \n     an agreement with the City of Caliente and Lincoln County, \n     Nevada concerning the integrated management system.\n       ``(2) Agreement content.--Any agreement shall contain such \n     terms and conditions, including such financial and \n     institutional arrangements, as the Secretary and agreement \n     entity determine to be reasonable and appropriate and shall \n     contain such provisions as are necessary to preserve any \n     right to participation or compensation of the City of \n     Caliente and Lincoln County, Nevada.\n       ``(3) Amendment.--An agreement entered into under this \n     subsection may be amended only with the mutual consent of the \n     parties to the amendment and terminated only in accordance \n     with paragraph (4).\n       ``(4) Termination.--The Secretary shall terminate the \n     agreement under this subsection if any major element of the \n     integrated management system may not be completed.\n       ``(5) Limitation.--Only 1 agreement may be in effect at any \n     one time.\n       ``(6) Judicial review.--Decisions of the Secretary under \n     this section are not subject to judicial review.\n       ``(i) Content of Agreement.--\n       ``(1) Schedule.--In addition to the benefits to which the \n     City of Caliente and Lincoln County is entitled to under this \n     title, the Secretary shall make payments under the benefits \n     agreement in accordance with the following schedule:\n\n                            BENEFITS SCHEDULE                           \n                          [Amounts in millions]                         \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                            Event                               Payment \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(A) Annual payments prior to first receipt of spent fuel.....       $2.5\n(B) Annual payments beginning upon first spent fuel receipt..          5\n(C) Payment upon closure of the intermodal transfer facility.          5\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       ``(2) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, the \n     term--\n       ``(A) `spent fuel' means high-level radioactive waste or \n     spent nuclear fuel; and\n       ``(B) `first spent fuel receipt' does not include receipt \n     of spent fuel or high-level radioactive waste for purposes of \n     testing or operational demonstration.\n       ``(3) Annual payments.--Annual payments prior to first \n     spent fuel receipt under paragraph (1)(A) shall be made on \n     the date of execution of the benefits agreement and \n     thereafter on the anniversary date of such execution.

Mr. President, this amendment is an effort to clarify \nthe issue of consideration to be provided to Lincoln County, NV. \nSpecifically, it clarifies that assistance money provided to Lincoln \nCounty, NV, may be provided to the city of Caliente, NV. Caliente is \nwithin Lincoln County and is the actual site of the intermodal transfer \nfacility authorized by the bill. The intermodal transfer facility is \nwhere the cask containing spent nuclear fuel would be offloaded from \nthe trains and placed upon the heavy-haul trucks for the final leg of \ntransport to the interim storage facility at the Nevada site. These can \nbe the off highway type, heavy rigs that operate on very, very large \ntires and make virtually no footprint. That technology is well known. \nThat equipment, off highway, is used in large mineral excavations and \nvarious other large commercial earth moving activities that are of an \noff-highway nature.\n  Caliente is northeast of the Nevada test site. The reason for it \nbeing selected as the intermodal transfer is that point avoids the \ntransportation of casks through the Las Vegas area.\n  The elected officials of the city of Caliente, in Lincoln County, \nhave taken what I consider to be a very reasonable, very practical \napproach, a conservative approach to the storage of this nuclear waste \nin Nevada. I think they recognize the inevitability. In spite of the \ndifficulty with our concerns of our friends from Nevada, this waste has \nto go somewhere. You just cannot throw it up in the air and expect it \nto stay there. Nevada is the preferred site, it is a site where we have \nhad over 50 years of nuclear testing of various types, where it has \nbeen expressed on this floor we have had test nuclear explosions that \nhave taken place actually below the water table. So clearly, as we look \nat the alternative, the Nevada test site is the logical site for the \ninterim repository.\n  So I think what we see here is that Lincoln County, the city of \nCaliente, has recognized the inevitability of this and they have simply \nattempted to ensure that the interests of their citizens are protected, \nand I think that is an obligation that we have. They have maintained, \nthroughout the process, that disposition, despite a series of legal \nattacks, some rather harsh, on their right to represent their citizens \nand their freedom of speech by the State of Nevada.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of a petition, signed by 286 \ncitizens of the city of Caliente, Lincoln County, supporting this \nposition be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the petition was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n       We the undersigned, support recommendations for maximizing \n     benefits and minimizing risks as outlined in the City of \n     Caliente/Lincoln County Nevada Joint Resolution 1-95. As \n     residents of the State of Nevada, the United States \n     Constitution provides that if the Nuclear Waste Policy Act is \n     going to be amended to allow transportation of spent fuel \n     rods through Lincoln County and the City of Caliente, we are \n     entitled to provide input to any such proposals. Such input \n     would request oversight of safety issues and receipt of \n     benefits that may be associated to any transportation and/or \n     storage facilities located within Lincoln County.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I was going to read, ``We the undersigned support \nrecommendations'' and the rest of the statement, but it is cut off by \nthe Xerox machine, so we will try to get that and enter it into the \nRecord. I appreciate the President's willingness to have that printed \nin the Record.\n  In conclusion, I certainly commend the citizens of Caliente and \nLincoln County as a whole. I urge the pending amendment be adopted. I \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Nevada [Mr. \nBryan] is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, let me respond. It is true some citizens of Caliente \nembraced this. From the time of the Old Testament, there are some who \nare prepared to forfeit their birthright for a pottage of lentils. I \nmust say, I believe my friends and neighbors in Caliente, those who \nhave advocated this project, are misled and misadvised.\n  I simply point out if 286 becomes the standard, I am sure we could \nget 286 Alaskans or Louisianians or others to embrace this. It is part \nof the nuclear energy industry's attempt to, in effect, buy it. \nCaliente is a wonderful community. It has endured tremendous hardship \nin recent years. When I was Governor they wanted to have an incinerator \nand import hazardous wastes to be incinerated. These are folks who are\n\n[[Page S9229]]\n\nabsolutely desperate. I vetoed that legislation. The present Governor \nhas done similarly.\n  I understand and sympathize with the economic plight of my fellow \nNevadans who live in Caliente, but I must say they have been used and \nbadly used by the nuclear industry with this promise about putting a \nlittle money out. For my senior colleague and I, this is not about \nmoney, this is about public health and safety of 1.8 million people, \nand there can be no compromise on that issue. That represents the broad \npublic view in Nevada.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, in \nMarch 1996, recognized the problems with transportation. They \nrecognized, as the senior Senator from Louisiana indicated, that there \nhave been small loads of nuclear waste that traveled very short \ndistances. But they go on to say--and that is the whole point, that \nthey are in effect legislated out of business, because they said, ``the \nBoard sees no technical or safety reason to move spent fuel to a \ncentralized storage facility.''\n  Caliente of course means hot. It is not because it is hot weather. It \nis because they have hot water in the ground there. That is how this \ntown got its name. The city of Caliente represents 0.05 percent of the \npeople of the State of Nevada, 0.05 percent. They are desperate. We \nhave 17 counties in Nevada. There is no county that is in more \ndesperate economic condition.\n  Their mineral abilities are gone. Their agricultural interests are \nvery sparse. A lot of land is owned by the Federal Government. And they \nhave really struggled. Caliente was a railroad town. The railroad, in \neffect, has moved out on them. It does not stop there anymore. People \nwho used to work for the railroads do not work there anymore. It is in \ndeep, deep economic depression.\n  Senator Bryan talked about one thing they wanted. They also wanted to \nstart a cyanide plant there. They will take anything, I am sorry to \nsay, they are so desperate for money.\n  Caliente represents, I think, a subject we want to talk about here. \nCaliente is remote. It is about 150 miles from Las Vegas. Nevada is, \nsurprisingly, the most urban State in America. Mr. President, 90 \npercent of the people, approximately, live in urban areas, the Reno-Las \nVegas areas. Only about 10 percent of the people live in rural Nevada, \nas we remember it. We have a lot of areas in Nevada that are lonely.\n  We have the loneliest road in America in Nevada. But Nevada is not \nthe only place that has remote areas. Utah, eastern Utah is extremely \nremote. I have driven through parts of Colorado that are as remote as \nany place in Nevada ever was, as are parts of Arizona and New Mexico. \nThe reason I mention that is we need to understand that not only is \ntransportation a problem for the safety of carrying these canisters--\nand I say to my friend from Idaho, the 150 mile an hour--they may have \nrun a test at 150 miles an hour, I do not know about that. But I do \nknow the canisters have been certified by the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission to this point for 30 miles an hour and for burning for 30 \nminutes. That is fact. So the 150 miles an hour, I do not know where \nthat came from. They may have run some tests. But certification is for \nburning at 1,475 degrees for 30 minutes and speeds of 30 miles an hour.\n  We are concerned about unforeseeable accidents. We have pictures of \ntrain wrecks, Ledger, MT, Vernon, CA, Alabama. All over the country \nthey have about 600 train wrecks a year. Most of them, thank Heavens, \nare not bad, but some are disastrous, like the one that burned for 4 \ndays last year, like the one that closed the freeway between Las Vegas \nand Los Angeles for 4 days. So we have bad train wrecks.\n  I am not talking about what I am going to say in just a few minutes, \nbecause of what took place with TWA, and what took place in Atlanta \nwith the bomb.\n  I talked about this 3 weeks ago prior to these horrible incidents. I \nwant the Record to show I spoke earlier about these and other threats \nbefore these tragic event at the Olympics and TWA incident off the \ncoast of New York.\n  No one wants to exploit the pain, the suffering, and the anguish of \nthose people. Those of us who serve in the Congress, especially serve \nthe western part of the United States, we seemingly live on airplanes. \nSo, when these accidents happen, we all look inward.\n  But I must speak to the threat of terrorism, because the nationwide \ntransport of spent nuclear fuel will provide targets of inconceivable \nattraction to terrorists, both foreign and, I am sorry to say, \ndomestic; we have people who are terrorists within our own country, as \nindicated in the Oklahoma City bombing and probably in the Atlanta \nOlympic bombing.\n  We have enemies and they are not all outside the boundaries of this \ncountry. For whatever reason, though, these enemies detest parts of our \ncountry, and the foreign operations detest what our country stands for \nand its values. Our very freedoms are threatened. They dwell on hitting \npoints of interest to the American public. That is why the White House \nis such a target. That is why this building is such a target. That is \nwhy we have a police force of almost 2,000 men and women who protect \nthe people who work in these buildings and the tourists who come to \nthis Capitol complex. That is why the Capitol Police have animals that \nsniff out explosives, animals that are around at all times looking at \ncars that come in and out, sniffing to find out if there are \nexplosives. We have bomb detection units. We have bomb disassembly \nunits. All over this Capitol complex, there are plainclothes officers \nprotecting the people who come into this building.\n  There are people who would do anything to cause terror to this \ncountry. So, Mr. President, we have to eliminate whatever we can that \nallows them targets.\n  There are many clandestine foreign interests. We know that. Some are \nled by leaders of countries. They want to publicize their existence and \npromote their goals through outrageous acts of blatant terror and \ndestruction. What better stage could be set for any of these enemies of \nour country than a trainload or a truckload of the most hazardous \nsubstance known to man, clearly and predictably moving through our free \nand open society?\n  You cannot move a 125-ton object on a train that is full of nuclear \nwaste without having it marked and without notifying people it is \ncoming through. These shipments, of necessity, must pass through our \nmost populated centers, which provides opportunity for a successful \nattack for a terrorist to strike terror and public confidence in our \nform of Government.\n  Earlier today, I talked about something I received in the mail from \nSt. Louis. It is a newspaper called Gateway to the Waste. It talks \nabout how in St. Louis they are afraid of nuclear shipments there.\n  Each cask would contain a radiological equivalent of 200 Hiroshima \nbombs. All together the nuclear tonnage would be enough to kill \neverybody on Earth. These shipments would not only pass through \npopulated centers but through remote and inaccessible territory. \nRemember, I say to my colleagues of the Senate, that the accident that \noccurred in Arizona occurred in a very remote area. A person went out \nthere undetected and simply took some tools and took the track apart. \nWhen the train came over, the tracks spread and death and destruction \nwas in its wake.\n  The opportunity to inflict widespread contamination to engender real \nhealth risk to millions of Americans is apparent. And people say, ``Oh, \nno one would do that.''\n  What happened in Japan? Sarin gas was collected and dispersed. They \ndid not do a very good job. They only wound up killing dozens of people \nand causing respiratory problems and other forms of illness to hundreds \nand hundreds of people. That was a failure, even though they caused \ndeath and destruction to that many people. If they had done it right, \nit would have killed thousands.\n\n  We must prepare for the realities accompanying a massive \ntransportation campaign that would be required to consolidate nuclear \nwaste at a repository site. We must deter our enemies through readiness \nand competent response before we undertake this dangerous program.\n  One of the things the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board said is we \nare\n\n[[Page S9230]]\n\nnot ready for this. The Governors' Association hired some people to \nconduct a test to see how the State of Nevada--this was not done by the \nState of Nevada, but the Governors' Association did it to find out how \nNevada is prepared--now remember, Nevada has dealt with things nuclear \nbefore with aboveground and underground nuclear testing--how we would \ndeal with nuclear waste transportation through Nevada if something went \nwrong. We are not ready, not even close. If we are not ready, you can \nimagine how other States are. We must assure our citizens we only have \nto undertake this dangerous venture once. It is paramount we do it \nright the first time.\n  There is a growing danger in this country from both domestic and \ninternational terrorism. Exposure of this substance can lead to \nimmediate sickness. It is much worse than sarin gas. Early death, and \nfor less acute exposure, to years of anxiety and uncertainty as the \nexposed populations wait helplessly for the first onset of thyroid \ncancer, bone cancer, leukemia, liver and kidney cancer, and on and on.\n  We know that we must be prepared, and we are not prepared. The \ncomprehensive assessment of its capacity to respond and manage a \nradiological incident in Nevada did not work out well. That is the way \nit is all over the country.\n  Mr. President, why are we concerned about terrorist incidents? We \nhave weapons that are almost unbelievable. Most of us in this Chamber \nhave gone shooting with a shotgun. We know how big a shotgun shell is.\n  Here we have a shell not even double the size of a shotgun shell, and \nthis is a shaped charge warhead terrorist tool. it is 1\\1/2\\ inches in \ndiameter and 4 inches long and, as described by scientists, it kind of \nworks like a watermelon. When you squeeze the seed of a watermelon it \nsqueezes the liner material and squirts out. This will pierce 5 inches \nof steel. That is what this chart shows.\n  Mr. President, if the Presiding Officer wanted to buy a weapon to \nspread terrorism around the United States, he could do it. It might \ntake you a week, 2 weeks, but if you have money, you can buy from an \narms dealer. I have pictured one weapon. We have lots of other weapons \nwe can show, but this one weapon is a Russian version of a portable \nantitank weapon. This weapon is pretty accurate. At 330 yards, you can \nhit a target the size of my fingers here. It weighs 15 pounds. That is \nall it weighs. This weapon is a little more powerful than the one I \njust showed you, because this will fire 330 yards. It will go through \n16 inches of steel.\n  The typical rail canister of nuclear waste is about 4 inches of steel \nplus some lead and some water. A piece of cake for this weapon that I \njust showed you.\n\n  But, Mr. President, weapons are all over, easy to pick up and \npurchase, weapons weighing 16 pounds, 22 pounds, penetrating up to 3 \nfeet of steel.\n  You might say, no one could afford this. These weapons you can buy \nfor $5,000, $10,000. That is all they cost. Buy a few shells with them. \nThese are antiarmor weapons.\n  The reason, Mr. President, we should be concerned about this is that \nall nuclear waste is funneled into one small part of our country. It \nstarts out this big with tens of thousands of shipments, but the more \nit goes, by the time it gets to Colorado, the circle is that big, and \nall through these parts of the country, Mr. President, you keep \nnarrowing the scope. It is becoming easier and easier the farther west \nyou go, the more remote it becomes, and the more concentrated volume of \nnuclear waste will be shipped there.\n  If I were a terrorist organization, this would be a piece of cake. \nThese weapons will fire up to 300 to 400 yards. They are in very remote \nareas. You can go places in Nevada, Arizona, and Colorado where people \ndo not go for days. Along those railroad tracks, you can be out there, \ncamp, and all you are going to be interrupted by are the trains coming \nby. That is why they have been unable to catch the person in Arizona \nbecause he could have been gone for a day before the tracks separated, \nor longer.\n  So what are we going to do? I think what we should do is do what the \nNuclear Waste Technical Review Board did and say, let us not subject \nthe world and the country to the spread of this nuclear poison. We have \nnot invested in the transportation planning. And the preparations are \nabsolutely necessary for the safe transportation of this dangerous \nmaterial through our heartland.\n  We have not addressed the spectrum of threats to safe transportation \nand not developed a transportation process that guards against these \nthreats and are not ready to meet the emergencies that could develop \nbecause of a nuclear accident or a terrorist act. The Nuclear Waste \nTechnical Review Board recognizes our lack of readiness. That is one of \nthe reasons they argued against the transportation program proposed by \nthis legislation. The lack of readiness, preparedness and careful \nplanning is one of the main reasons I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst this ill-conceived, unnecessary and premature approach to \nmanaging nuclear waste for our country.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about a substance that is the most \npoisonous substance known to man. We have been told by preeminent \nscientists, Dr. John E. Cantlon, Michigan State University; Dr. \nClarence R. Allen, California Institute of Technology; John Arendt, of \nArendt Associates; Dr. Gary Brewer, University of Michigan; Dr. Jared \nCohon, Yale University; Dr. Edward Cording, University of Illinois, and \non and on.\n  These people, 12 in number, are eminent scientists with no political \nagenda, scientists saying we are not ready to move this stuff. It is \nsafe to leave it where it is. Leave it where it is. So we should leave \nit where it is.\n  This legislation is unnecessary. It is being pushed by the nuclear \nlobby. That is why it is being done, to save the nuclear industry money \nand pass the expense off to American taxpayers.\n  They are always in a rush--always in a rush. It took us many years \nbefore the permanent repository. We got it where science would control \nwhat went on. Lawsuits had to be filed. Legislation had to be passed. \nBut that is not fast enough for them. Now they do not want to wait for \nscience, which will come back and tell us in 1998 how the Yucca site is \ngoing to be. They are unwilling to wait for that because they want to \nsave a buck.\n  They want to save a buck by passing the responsibility off to the \nFederal Government way ahead of time and, in the process, making this \ncountry vulnerable to accident by rail or car, and opening our country \nto more terrorist acts. The terror we have known in the past pales any \ntime we think about what could happen if a terrorist was able to \npenetrate one of these nuclear shipments.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  I would like to comment about the remarks made by my good friend from \nNevada relative to the concern we all have, the legitimate concern we \nhave over terrorism. He makes the case that, you know, there is a \nterrorist threat and therefore we ought to leave it where it is.\n  Let us look at where it is, Mr. President. The chart behind me shows \nit is in 41 States. There are 81 sites out there. Is it logical to \nassume that we are better off to leave it there where it is exposed in \n41 States at 81 sites or put it in one place--one place--out in the \nNevada desert, where we have had over a period of some 50 years \nextensive nuclear tests, time and time again, an area where it is \nconcentrated and can be supervised and guarded, namely, the one site in \nNevada?\n  It just does not make sense if you are going to argue the merits of \nterrorism to have it all over the country, as I have indicated on this \nchart--41 States, 81 sites--or put it in one place where you can \nmonitor, you can control it, you can guard it. You can take the \nnecessary steps to ensure that the threat from terrorism is at a \nminimum.\n  I do not know an awful lot about ballistics, Mr. President, but I \nknow something about a shotgun because I hunt ducks. I cannot \ncomprehend a type of a shotgun that can go 300 yards and pierce through \n5 inches of steel. What I do know is what the Department of Energy has \nsupplied us with. They have done eight sabotage studies.\n  One of those included a 4,000-pound ammonium nitrate bomb that was\n\n[[Page S9231]]\n\nsimilar in size, same makeup of what was used in the Oklahoma Federal \nbuilding. They placed it in a container to see if they could pierce the \ncask. It was not breached, Mr. President.\n  Another test--unfortunately, they are not able to disclose this type \nof technology because it is a black program, but they stated that this \ndevice was 30 times larger than an antitank weapon. Although this \nweapon made a small hole in the container, there was no significant \nrelease of radioactivity. Make no mistake about it, if there is a \npuncture, it is not going to blow up.\n  The suggestion was made, you are going to have the equivalent of so \nmany times of Hiroshima; if you are going to penetrate that cask, the \nradioactive material can come out. But it is very, very heavy. As a \nconsequence, its tendency is to remain in the immediate area. But the \npoint is, these casks are designed to withstand, if you will, the \nexposures associated with an accident, whether it be a railroad, \nwhether it be a ship, or whether it be a highway.\n  I would like to turn a little bit to attitudes prevailing in Nevada. \nAs I indicated earlier, we have some 268 signatures from Caliente. I \nhave been able to obtain the completed Xerox of the one that I started \non earlier, Mr. President, and was cut off. I think it is important to \nread what these people said, and that has been inserted in the Record.\n\n       We the undersigned, support recommendations for maximizing \n     benefits and minimizing risks as outlined in the city of \n     Caliente/Lincoln County Nevada joint resolution 1-95. As \n     residents of the State of Nevada, the United States \n     Constitution provides that, if the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \n     is going to be amended to allow transportation of spent fuel \n     rods through Lincoln County and the city of Caliente, we are \n     entitled to provide input to any such proposals. Such input \n     would request oversight of safety issues and receipt of \n     benefits that may be associated to any transportation and/or \n     storage facility located within Lincoln County.\n\n  That is the point of this amendment, Mr. President, to provide that \nassistance.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nInternational Association of Fire Chiefs, dated July 26, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      International Association of\n\n\n                                                  Fire Chiefs,\n\n                                       Fairfax, VA, July 26, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Energy and Natural Resources Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Murkowski: The International Association of \n     Fire Chiefs (IAFC) fully supports S. 1936 and urges its \n     prompt passage.\n       Nuclear fuel has been accumulating and temporarily \n     stockpiled since 1982 at numerous staging locations \n     throughout the United States. The stockpiling of nuclear \n     waste in so many removed locales renders them most vulnerable \n     to potential sabotage and terrorist attacks. A plan to remove \n     this nuclear fuel and coordinate its transport to a single \n     secure designated interim storage facility at Yucca Flat, NV, \n     in accordance with prudent planning, training, and \n     preparation can be a safe, logical and acceptable \n     alternative.\n       S. 1936 offers a plan to remove this spent fuel and \n     coordinate its transport to a single secure interim storage \n     facility. With proper planning, training and preparation, \n     this spent fuel can be transported safely and efficiently \n     over the nation's railways and highways.\n       We appreciate your leadership on this difficult but \n     important issue.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                    Alan Caldwell,\n                                   Director, Government Relations.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It states:.\n\n       Dear Chairman Murkowski: The International Association of \n     Fire Chiefs (IAFC) fully supports S. 1936 and urges its \n     prompt passage.\n       Nuclear fuel has been accumulating and temporarily \n     stockpiled since 1982 at numerous staging locations \n     throughout the United States. The stockpiling of nuclear \n     waste in so many removed locales renders them most vulnerable \n     to potential sabotage and terrorist attacks.\n\n  That is what I said before. Do you want it over here in the 41 States \nin over 80 sites? The fire chiefs say, no, put it in one site.\n\n       A plan [they further say] to remove this nuclear fuel and \n     coordinate its transport to a single secure designated \n     interim storage facility at Yucca Flat, NV, in accordance \n     with prudent planning, training, and preparation can be a \n     safe, logical and acceptable alternative. Senate bill 1936 \n     offers a plan to remove this spent fuel, coordinate its \n     transport to a single secure interim storage facility. With \n     proper planning, training and preparation, this spent fuel \n     can be transported safely and efficiently over the Nation's \n     railways and highways.\n\n  It is signed by Alan Caldwell, director, government relations, from \nthe International Association of Fire Chiefs.\n  Here is a petition, Mr. President, to the President of the United \nStates, signed by 600 workers associated with the Nevada test site. I \npreviously entered the specific petition and narrative in the Record, \nbut let me read what it says. This is signed by over 600 workers at the \nNevada test site.\n\n       We who have signed this petition live in the State of \n     Nevada. Many of us work at the Nevada Test Site. Some of us \n     work on the Yucca Mountain project.\n       The [Nevada Test Site], an area larger than the State of \n     Rhode Island, was chosen as a nuclear weapons testing site by \n     President Truman. Its dry climate and remote location made it \n     ideal for weapons testing 45 years ago. Those same factors \n     make the NTS ideal for storing high level nuclear waste and \n     spent nuclear fuel. There is now, in southern Nevada, a \n     resident work force that is well trained and experienced in \n     dealing with nuclear materials. We, who are part of that work \n     force, believe the NTS presents a solution for the United \n     States for the temporary and permanent storage of high level \n     nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel. It is a well secured \n     site, it is remote, it has already been utilized for nuclear \n     purposes, it has an experienced and well-trained work force \n     and we as Nevada workers, want it.\n       We urge you to work with Congress to make the NTS the \n     solution to this Nation's nuclear waste dilemma.\n\n  There you have it, Mr. President.\n  How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 17 minutes 8 \nseconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I read the following letter from the Southern Nevada \nBuilding & Construction Trade Council, dated July 23, a letter to \nSenator Carl Levin.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I am writing to thank you for your \n     support of Senate Bill 1936 and I urge you to continue that \n     support.\n       I am a representative of the many working men and women of \n     Nevada who strongly support the passage of S. 1936.\n       Although we more often than not support the positions of \n     Senator Harry Reid and Senator Richard Bryan, our views on \n     this particular issue differ significantly from theirs. On \n     behalf of my members I urge you to continue your support of \n     S. 1936, as reflected by your recent vote in favor of \n     cloture. We sincerely thank you for your position.\n       As way of introduction, I am President of the Southern \n     Nevada Building and Construction Trades Council, Vice \n     President of the Nevada AFL-CIO, and serve as an appointee of \n     Nevada Governor Bob Miller to the Nevada Commission on \n     Nuclear Projects. I have followed the nuclear waste issue in \n     Nevada for many years. My years of experience at the Nevada \n     Test Site goes back to a time when Nevada elected officials \n     actually sought the opportunity to store high-level waste at \n     the Test Site.\n       The 18,000 craftsmen that I represent, as well as over \n     100,000 members of the Nevada AFL-CIO, feel strongly that the \n     Yucca Mountain Project is safe and can be good for Nevada. We \n     recognize, perhaps better than most, the importance of health \n     and safety in dealing with high-level waste and nuclear \n     materials. We have dealt with it for many years and as the \n     workers handling this material we have the most to lose if \n     this program is not safely run. Based upon our past \n     experience in Nevada, we have a great deal of confidence that \n     this facility will be safe.\n       Nevadans are pragmatic people and I believe that, contrary \n     to statements made by some Nevada officials, many if not most \n     Nevadans would not contest the location of this facility in \n     Nevada. Remember that we have tested over 900 nuclear devices \n     in the Nevada desert with little local opposition. Like the \n     nuclear weapons testing program the nuclear waste program is \n     essentially a non-issue among rank and file Nevadans. We find \n     it extremely difficult to imagine that you could possibly \n     find a more willing political climate anywhere else in the \n     United States for this type of facility.\n       We understand that you may have been asked, by members of \n     the Nevada delegation, to oppose legislative efforts to move \n     the nuclear material storage program forward. An immense \n     amount of scientific study has been conducted at Yucca \n     Mountain and it has conclusively found the location to be a \n     superior one for this type of facility. Some officials from \n     Nevada have made a concerted effort, using every conceivable \n     means, to thwart this scientific and environmental program.\n       Enclosed you will find petitions signed by many Nevadans \n     who support passage of this legislation. We intend to meet \n     with the White House shortly to express our position and to \n     transmit the petitions. Our message to the President will be: \n     Move this program forward--do not allow partisan politics to \n     stand in the way of a solution to this problem. Any other \n     approach would be both bad politics and bad public policy.\n       As a fellow American, a fellow Democrat, and as a \n     representative of the working men and women of Nevada, I urge \n     your continued support of S. 1936.\n\n\n[[Page S9232]]\n\n\n  It is signed by Frank Caine, president of the Southern Nevada \nBuilding Construction & Trade Council.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I do not attempt to speak, obviously, for the people \nin Nevada. That is the job of the Senators from Nevada. I do think it \nrepresents a significant voice to be heard and to be brought to the \nfloor.\n  I yield on the Senator's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has no time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield very briefly for a question if it is on my \ntime because we are running short.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have been increasingly concerned about the notion of \nthe terrorist threat, and I am very interested in the answer of the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  It strikes this Senator, when you are talking about 100 different \nlocations in the shipment of nuclear fuel from around the country to a \nsingle spot, that the risk of a terrorist threat increases \ndramatically; I just ask the Senator from Alaska, in talking to \nsecurity people--in fact, I talked to Secret Service people about when \nthe President is most vulnerable, and they told me they believe the \nPresident or anybody that they are guarding is most vulnerable when \nthey are in transit. In fact, they feel they are most vulnerable when \nthey are getting in or out of the vehicle.\n  I was thinking how that relates to the circumstances we face here. We \nsaw that with President Reagan and the assassination attempt when he \nwas getting into a vehicle. Rabin was assassinated when he was getting \ninto a limousine, because you know where a person is, you know where \nthey will be, that is when they are most vulnerable.\n  It strikes me that the same thing may be the case with respect to the \ntransporting of these materials, and I am interested in the reaction of \nthe Senator from Alaska to that.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond to the Senator from North Dakota, \nthat is the very point we are talking about. Terrorism is a threat, but \nwe have this currently in 41 States at 81 sites, and the ability to \nsecure those sites from terrorism in its current form is much more \ndifficult than having it in one central spot, because that is where it \nwill be permanently stored, either until Yucca Mountain has a permanent \nrepository or, during the interim, until the permanent repository is \nset.\n  What we are looking at here is one site, one storage capability, one \nset of experienced personnel to guard against terrorist activity, as \nopposed to the chart, which I will again leave for the Senator to view, \n41 States and 81 sites.\n  It just simply makes sense. The Senator from North Dakota was not \nhere when I entered into the Record a letter from the International \nAssociation of Fire Chiefs which simply says:\n\n       . . . so many removed locales renders them most vulnerable \n     to potential sabotage and terrorists attacks. A plan to \n     remove this nuclear fuel and coordinate its transport to a \n     single secure designated interim storage facility at Yucca \n     Flat, NV, in accordance with prudent planning, training, and \n     preparation can be a safe, logical and acceptable \n     alternative.\n\n  So this is the very concern we are talking about. Obviously, you are \nnot going to store in these sites forever. That is a given. You have to \ntake it out of these sites at some point in time. The Federal \nGovernment has collected almost $12 billion from the ratepayers. It has \nentered into a contractual agreement. We are talking about reneging on \nthe agreement, basically, if we don't go ahead with it, and leaving it \nwhere it is for an undetermined period of time until then you decide to \nmove it. It is inevitable that you are going to move it. We are talking \nabout here--once you move it, the threat of terrorist activities \nassociated with it are much reduced because you don't have that number \nof sites in that exposure in the 41 States.\n  So the logic, I think, speaks for itself. I think, from the \nstandpoint of terrorism, exposure is less dramatic if you have it at \none site where it is easier to secure.\n  I think my time has about expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator has 8 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Might I ask my colleague to yield me some time so I might \npursue this?\n  Mr. BRYAN. How much time does my friend require?\n  Mr. CONRAD. A couple of minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. How much time remains on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 9 minutes 50 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I can understand, with respect to a \nterrorist threat, that if you had it at one site, it is easier to guard \nand secure than at 81 sites. What really raises questions, at least in \nmy mind, is when this material is in transit, because now you are not \ntalking about 81 sites, you are talking about an infinite number of \nplaces where you are vulnerable to some kind of terrorist threat. So, \nto me, it is not a question of 81 sites versus 1 site, it is a question \nof being in transit from 81 sites to 1 known place. If I were trying to \nput myself in the position of a terrorist, and I knew that all this \nmaterial has to go through a series of locations to arrive at one \ndestination, that makes it very vulnerable to a terrorist attack. So \nthe question I really have is, aren't you most vulnerable when this \nmaterial is in transit?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I respond by asking my friend from North Dakota, is it \nnot inevitable that at some point in time, in order to meet the \ncontractual commitment, you are going to have to move this anyway?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. So it is still going to be vulnerable to terrorist \nattacks.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think, without question, my own view is that, \nobviously, this material is going to have to be moved at some point. \nBut, on the other hand, perhaps the technology will be developed that \nwould allow you to deal with this material at those locations and not \nhave to be transporting it to a single site in one place in the \ncountry, where you are vulnerable. It would seem that it would be easy \nfor a terrorist to look at the map and say, ``Here are the sites it is \ncoming from, and here is the one place on the map it is going to.'' You \ncould draw a series of sequential rings and, with a high degree of \nconfidence, know this material is going to pass through there, and you \nare, in that way, highly vulnerable to a terrorist threat.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, the Senator from----\n  Mr. BRYAN. On whose time is the Senator from Alaska responding?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. On my own time. First of all, the Senator from North \nDakota is suggesting that we dispose of it on-site somehow through \nadvanced technology. That suggests reprocessing, which we don't allow. \nSo that is basically a nonalternative. Some people suggest that is \nsomewhat unfortunate because, in France, they do reprocess, reinject. \nThey don't bury the plutonium like we do. They put it back in the \nreactors and burn it.\n\n  Now, the inevitability of the question of whether or not you leave it \nwhere it is and subject yourself to the potential terrorist exposure in \n41 States and 81 sites--that suggests that you are not going to have \nthe same degree of security and experience in all these sites because \nyou cannot possibly cover that many sites. So you put it at the one \nsite in Nevada where you can provide the security. So the terrorism \nexposure in Nevada is, for all practical purposes, eliminated. Your \nexposure is shipping them, granted. That is why the casks are designed \nas they are designed.\n  As I said in an earlier statement, the Army has tested a device 30 \ntimes larger than an antitank weapon, and although it made a small hole \nin the cask, there was no release of radioactivity. So you can't \neliminate the entire risk, but you can eliminate, to a large degree, \nthe technical design--this is a heavy thing; the terrorists are not \ngoing to run off with it. They have to do something very significant. \nObviously, there is going to be security associated with the movement. \nI think we are talking about 10,000 casks. I defer to the Senator from \nLouisiana who, I think, wants to address the Senate.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, I appreciate my colleague yielding to \nme. They have done studies on these shippings, and what they have found \nis that upward of 10,000 to 20,000 shipments have already been made. \nThey say numerous analyses have been performed in recent years \nconcerning transportation risks associated with shipping spent fuel. \nThe results of\n\n[[Page S9233]]\n\nthese analyses all show very little risk under both normal and accident \nconditions. The safety record has been very good in corroboration of \nthe low-risk estimate analytically. In fact, during the decades that \nspent fuel has been shipped, no accident has caused a radioactive \nrelease. What they have done is they have made models both on the \ncomputer and they have done actual tests. For example, there was a \nchart up there that showed that they hit a cask at 80 miles an hour \nwith a train, and they dropped them from buildings and all that. In \nnone of these was there a risk.\n  I might add that we ship nuclear warheads all the time. We don't ship \nthose actually in these kind of casks. Frankly, I don't know how they \nship them, but they are not sealed off as these casks are. They have \ngone to the extent--in one instance, they said a shipping cask has been \nsubjected to attack by explosives to evaluate the cask and spent fuel \nresponse to a device 30 times larger than an antitank weapon. They \nattacked one of these with a weapon 30 times larger than an antitank \nweapon. The device would carve approximately a 3-inch diameter hole \nthrough the cask wall that contained spent fuel, and it was estimated \nto cause a release of about one-third of an ounce. ``No \ntransportation''--this is a quote--``can be identified that would \nimpose anywhere near the energy per unit volume caused by this \nexplosive attack.''\n  So even if you get a weapon 30 times larger than an antitank weapon \nand attack the cask with it, all it does is have a release of about \none-third of an ounce. So I submit to my colleague that, I guess you \ncan postulate some accident where some meteorite might come down and \nhappen to hit a railroad train in just the right way and somehow that \ncould harm somebody. But they have postulated about every conceivable \nrisk, including a weapon 30 times larger than an antitank weapon, and \nthey postulate only one-third of an ounce of release--that, plus the \nfact that there has never been a release of radioactivity in 4 decades \nof these transportations, from 10,000 to 20,000 shipments in this \ncountry alone, not to mention those around the world.\n  I would say there are things to worry about. But I honestly do not \nbelieve that transportation is one of them.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me ask my colleague.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I would be happy to yield to my friend, \nbut I want to respond directly to the statements made by the Senator \nfrom Louisiana.\n  This is pure doubletalk. The fact of the matter is that the weapon \nthat they used to test was a device designed to destroy reinforced \nconcrete pillars and piers. The weapon was not designed to destroy a \nstructure like a nuclear waste canister. In fact, the weapon used for \ntesting performed its military mission so poorly that our military \nforces abandoned this device for a better design. The weapon used, even \nthough it was not much good, did perforate the canister. The hole is \nsmall, and there was leakage, but it was not a great deal of leakage.\n  But everyone looking at this knows that the weapon that has been \nused--any of the weapons that I have on this chart are manufactured all \nover the world--would perforate this thing like that--16 inches of \nsteel, 36 inches of steel, 28 inches of steel.\n  This is, in all due respect to the Senator from Louisiana, who is a \ntremendous advocate for the nuclear industry, part of their doubletalk. \nThey have not been willing to test these canisters the way they should \nbe tested, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has said to this point \nthat all they have to do is to be able to withstand a maximum of 30 \nmiles an hour and a fire for 30 minutes. That is totally inadequate not \nonly for accidents, but for terrorist activities.\n  I yield now to my friend from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank my friend from Nevada.\n  I just go back to this question. It does strike me, given the rise of \nterrorist activity not only in this country but around the world, that \nwhen you put in motion from 80 different sites around the country, from \n41 States, thousands of these casks headed for one location, that if \nyou were a terrorist organization--it would take very little \ncalculation to figure out where this is most vulnerable--you would have \nthe potential here for a terrorist organization when this stuff is most \nvulnerable, when it is in motion, when it is in transit, to attack \neither a train or a truck and get possession of this material and \nthereby be able to threaten dozens of cities in America.\n  I must say, when I have talked to security people--again, I talked to \na person who was in the Secret Service--with respect to when they think \nsomething that they are guarding is most vulnerable, they said without \nquestion it is when it is in transit, when it is on the move. That is \nwhen it is the most vulnerable.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is the Senator suggesting that we leave it permanently \nat the 70-plus sites around the country?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No. This Senator is suggesting that maybe we ought to \nrevisit the question of reprocessing in this country. That is an \nalternative. Maybe we ought to consider various other technological \nalternatives that may present themselves. I am just raising the \nquestion. With what is going on in terms of terrorist threats abroad \nand in this country, are we doing a wise thing by setting up a \ncircumstance in which this material starts to move from 80 sites around \nthe country to one defined location in America? That troubles me.\n  I really am struggling myself with the question of how to respond to \nthat. I must say it has made me rethink the whole question of \nreprocessing. I wonder sometimes if we have made wise choices in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If I may answer that, because the Senator is a very \nthoughtful Senator and it is a fair question.\n  First of all, let me say, on the issue of reprocessing, you would \nneed a central facility for reprocessing anyway. So that does not solve \nthe transportation problem.\n  Second, I would say to my friend that the studies that have been \ndone--and you have four decades of experience with transportation of \nthis fuel with never a radioactive release, plus you have a lot of \npostulated accidents. For example, they have taken actual accidents and \nmade the studies of what that would have done to nuclear waste had it \nbeen involved. In one, in April 1982, there was a three-vehicle \ncollision involving a gasoline truck trailer, a bus, and an automobile \nwhich occurred in a tunnel in which 88,000 gallons of gasoline caught \nfire and burned for 2 hours and 42 minutes. For 40 minutes the fire was \nat 1,900 degrees Fahrenheit. If a nuclear waste canister had been \ninvolved in this accident, it would have suffered no significant impact \ndamage, and the fire would not have breached the canister. There would \nhave been no radiological hazard. The spent fuel in the canister would \nnot have reached temperatures high enough to cause fuel cladding to \nfail.\n\n  We go on here to other postulated accidents. A train containing both \nvinyl chloride and petroleum--the tanker cars derailed and caught fire. \nThe fire burned for several days and moved over a large area. There \nwere two explosions. Had nuclear waste canisters been on the train, \nthey would not have sustained any damage from the explosion. They might \nhave been exposed to the petroleum fire for a period ranging from 82 \nhours to 4 days. Even so, the canisters themselves would not have been \nbreached.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Madam President, we have just a little time left.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would like to conclude with this question.\n  My understanding is that those are accident scenarios. What concerns \nthis Senator is a terrorist scenario when terrorists launch an attack \non these materials when they are in transit and most vulnerable. I must \nsay that I think it is something that we have to be concerned about.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The point is this, though: They have tested it with \nweapons 30 times bigger than antitank weapons with direct hits. That \ncaused a breach. Only a third of an ounce comes out. There are many, \nmany much more lucrative targets, by orders of magnitude more lucrative \nfor terrorists, everything from chemicals that travel throughout the \ncountry every day, from LP gas to others which are many, many times \neasier to breach and\n\n[[Page S9234]]\n\nwould cause a much bigger problem. The essential thing is that nuclear \nwaste is not a volatile matter.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Madam President, I say to my colleague that this is on my \ntime.\n  How much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. If the Senator uses his own time, I have no problem with \nit. But I am not prepared to yield any more time.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I would be finished in just a moment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nother side have 2 more minutes total and that we may have 1 minute on \nthis side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, nuclear waste traveling the country \nis, first of all, solid in form. It is sealed in a cask that, as I say, \nif you get a direct hit by something 30 times more powerful than an \nantitank weapon, what do you get? You get a third of an ounce of \nrelease. What does that do? It does not explode. It is not gaseous. It \ndoes not get down to the water supply. It is, as these matters go, \nrelatively benign. And, even so, you cannot imagine a situation other \nthan a terrorist attack where there is any release at all.\n  So I submit that there are a lot of things to worry about, but \ntransportation is not one of them.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may, Madam President, take the last 30 seconds in \nresponse to the Senator from North Dakota, we have seen in Europe the \nmovement of over 30,000 tons of high-level nuclear waste in countries \nthat are exposed to terrorism at a far greater theoretical sense than \nthe United States. There has never been one instance of a terrorist \nactivity associated with movement by rail, highway, or ship. Terrorists \nare not going to necessarily look at terrorizing a shipment when they \ncan move into nerve gas and weapons disposals that are moving across \nthis country--all types of material that are associated with weapons --\nwhere they can create an incident of tremendous annihilation on a \npopulation.\n  This is very difficult because it is secure, in a cask; it is \nguarded; and it has been proven it has moved through other countries, \nparticularly Great Britain, France, in Scandinavia, and to some extent \nstarting in Japan. So there is a risk associated with everything. But \nwe have not had terrorist activity in this area because there are other \nmore suitable sites.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the statement of the senior Senator from \nNorth Dakota, his expression of concern about the vulnerability that we \nhave to terrorism. It is a fact of life in 20th century America. All of \nus apprehend, lament, and regret it, but it is a very real fact. I must \nsay, just as the bad guys in the Old West always knew where the \nstagecoach was most vulnerable--it was not when it was at the office; \nit was not when it was being unloaded at the bank--it was out on the \nroad, so too when we are talking about thousands and thousands of miles \nof rail and highway shipments. There are so many places that a \nterrorist could find a point of vulnerability. The concerns that my \ncolleague from North Dakota mentioned I believe are very real and very \ngenuine, so I thank him very much for his explanation.\n  Let me just make one other point here. It is something we constantly \nhear about, that this bill will result automatically in not 109 sites \nbut 1 site. Mr. President, that is just absolutely false, absolutely \nfalse. Each of the nuclear reactors that are currently generating power \nhave spent fuel rods contained in the pools. They remain there at least \nfor 5 years. If we assume that every reactor in the country is going to \nclose, which is certainly not the predicate of the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, under the current existing licenses some nuclear utilities \nwould remain open at least until the year 2033. So all this bill would \ndo in terms of concentrating storage would add not 109 but you would \nhave 110 sites, namely the new facility that they have proposed to \nconstruct at the Nevada test site for interim storage.\n  So this ad, I know, the nuclear utilities love. They spend millions \nof dollars in advertisements in magazines and publications that give \none the impression, wow, if we just opened up this facility at the \nNevada test site there will not be nuclear waste stored any place in \nthe country.\n  That is wrong.\n  May I inquire as to how much more time the Senator from Nevada has?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Helms). All time has expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask for a voice vote on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 5048 offered by the Senator from Alaska.\n  The amendment (No. 5048) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there further amendments to the bill?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could just confer for a few minutes \nwith my friend from Alaska and inform the rest of the Senate, what we \nare trying to work out now--and we do not know we can do it, but we are \ntrying to--on this side we have three amendments. We want to vote on \none of those amendments, a recorded vote. We would like that, if it is \nOK--we have a Democratic conference that is starting at 4. We would \nlike to do that at 3:30 and then have final passage at approximately 5 \no'clock and dispose of the other amendments in the interim by voice \nvote.\n  I have spoken to the Senator from Alaska. I know he has to confer \nwith others to see if that can be worked out. Otherwise, we can do \nsomething else. In the meantime, we will go ahead and offer an \namendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I conferred with the Senator from \nNevada and my colleague, Senator Johnston, and I want to check with our \nleadership.\n  It is my understanding the next amendment will be offered by the \nSenators from Nevada, and they would want a rollcall vote on that \namendment?\n  Mr. REID. No, the next amendment, we will offer and talk about it a \nlittle bit and have a voice vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Voice vote. The one after that you would like--\n  Mr. REID. The one after that we would--\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Might I ask whether the Senators intend to use their \nfull 30 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. We would be willing to work out something after this so the \ntime is equally balanced.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will entertain then the amendment that is about to \nbe offered that would require simply a voice vote, and that will give \nme an opportunity to check with the leadership on this side and then \nrespond to the Senators concerning their proposal.\n  I thank the Chair and yield to my colleague from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5075\n\n  (Purpose: To specify contractual obligations between DOE and waste \n                              generators)\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. I send an amendment numbered 5075 to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may interrupt, I assume there is acknowledgement \nthat the Senators contemplate a voice vote prevailing on our side?\n  Mr. BRYAN. That is correct. We are not requesting that a rollcall \nvote occur with respect to amendment 5075.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The voice vote that the Senators are proposing, they \nare assuming we would prevail?\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend from Alaska, he has not heard the \nargument yet. He may be persuaded.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will take my chances.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S9235]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5075.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     ``SEC.   . CONTRACT DELAYS.\n\n       ``(a) Unavoidable Delays by Contract Holder or \n     Department.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     neither the Department nor the contract holder shall be \n     liable under a contract executed under Section 302(a) of the \n     Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 for damages caused by \n     failure to perform its obligations thereunder, if such \n     failure arises out of causes beyond the control and without \n     the fault or negligence of the party failing to perform. In \n     the event circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the \n     contract holder or the Department--such as acts of God, or of \n     the public enemy, acts of Government in either its sovereign \n     or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine \n     restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes and unusually severe \n     weather--cause delay in scheduled delivery, acceptance or \n     transport of spent nuclear fuel and/or high-level radioactive \n     waste, the party experiencing the delay will notify the other \n     party as soon as possible after such delay is ascertained and \n     the parties will readjust their schedules, as appropriate, to \n     accommodate such delay.\n       ``(b) Avoidable Delays by Contract Holder or Department.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, in the event \n     of any delay in the delivery, acceptance or transport of \n     spent nuclear fuel and/or high-level nuclear waste to or by \n     the Department under contracts executed under Section 302(a) \n     of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 caused by \n     circumstances within the reasonable control of either the \n     contract holder or the Department or their respective \n     contractors or suppliers, the charges and schedules specified \n     by this contract will be equitably adjusted to reflect any \n     estimated additional costs incurred by the party not \n     responsible for or contributing to the delay.\n       ``(c) Remedy.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this \n     Section shall constitute the only remedy available to \n     contract holders or the Department for failure to perform \n     under a contract executed under Section 302(a) of the Nuclear \n     Waste Policy Act of 1982.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me just take a moment because this deals with a \nprovision that we believe clarifies the situation in light of the court \ndecision over which most comment has been had.\n  What this amendment does is simply incorporate into the bill \nprovisions that exist in the contract. My colleagues will recall that \nunder the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the Department of Energy \nwas directed to enter into contracts with the various utilities that \nwere involved in generating high-level nuclear waste, and so what we \nhave done, my colleague and I from Nevada, is to have incorporated \nverbatim other than perhaps in the context there may be some \ngrammatical changes, but verbatim the remedies that are provided in \nthose contracts. They are found in article 9 of the contract, and the \ncontract provides what occurs if a delay, referring to the delay of the \nopening of the repository, is unavoidable delay, and subparagraph (b) \ndeals with avoidable delays.\n  So there has been talk that somehow this court case now casts a \ndifferent light on everything, and as the Secretary of Energy indicated \nin her letter to each of us, that case absolutely has no impact on the \ndebate. It is true that the court indicated there was an obligation on \nthe Department of Energy but refrained from determining what the remedy \nwas, and it is our view that the remedy is contained in the contract \nthat the parties entered into. So we offer the amendment in that \nspirit.\n  I must say that I believe one of the biggest scams being perpetrated \nupon us in this bill is the provision which deals with the shifting of \nliability from the utilities to the general taxpayer. Mr. President, \n1982 is the genesis of our current nuclear waste policy. It was \nabsolutely clear at the time that law was enacted that the financial \nresponsibility for the disposal of nuclear waste rested upon the \nutilities, those that generated it. ``Generators, owners of high-level \nradioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel have the primary \nresponsibility to provide for and the responsibility to pay the costs \nof interim storage of such waste and spent fuel until such time as the \nfuel is accepted by the Secretary of Energy.'' And then it goes on to \ntalk about a number of instances throughout this particular act that it \nis the primary responsibility of the industry, the utilities.\n  Mr. President, this bill that has been introduced turns that concept \nupside down, totally upside down. Here is what is done under section \n501 of the amendment that we are debating currently. It says that until \nthe year 2002--I beg your pardon. I misquoted. I cited 501. It is \nsection 401. It says until the year 2002, the maximum that can be \nassessed against the utilities, which is done on the basis of kilowatt-\nhours generated --one mill currently is the assessment for each \nkilowatt-hour. It says under this bill by statute now the maximum that \ncan be levied against utilities is one mill. The General Accounting \nOffice and others have concluded that even if no interim storage is \nadded to the agenda or the responsibility of the Department of Energy, \nwe are currently underfunded to the extent of about $4 billion a year.\n  In plain and simple terms, that means the American taxpayer is going \nto pick up that liability, that responsibility, and that is \nfundamentally wrong. However you feel about nuclear energy, however you \nfeel about how nuclear waste ought to be disposed of, it ought not to \nbe cast upon the American taxpayer. These utilities are private sector \nutilities. They make a substantial amount of money. That is their \nright. But it ought not to be shifted on us. So I think that needs to \nbe pointed out, No. 1.\n\n  No. 2, it gets even more clever. After the year 2002, the only amount \nthat can be assessed against each utility is whatever their \nproportionate cost is, to the total amount of money that is \nappropriated by the Congress for nuclear waste. If we use the current \nyear, for example, we would be talking about a third of a mill. That is \nsomething that is just, in my view, unconscionable. Not only has the \nGeneral Accounting Office concluded there is a shortfall, but in a \nrecent study that was commissioned by the Department called A Special \nManagement and Financial Review, a report that came out in 1995, they \npoint out that there is a shortfall, depending on whether you take a \nconservative or more expansive view, of anywhere from $4 to $15 \nbillion.\n  So what is being done here is changing fundamentally who pays for \nthis disposal of nuclear waste. Is it the utilities? That was the \noriginal premise of the law in 1982. These are private utilities, \ngenerating profits for their investors and shareholders. Or is that \nliability now to be shifted to the general taxpayer? That is what this \nbill does, it shifts that liability because it is clear, even if you \ntake the length of time without renewal at all, these utilities will \nultimately, by the year 2033, if the licenses are not extended, those \nutilities will cease generating electrical power. Therefore they will \ncease contributing into the fund. But the problem of the storage of \nhigh-level nuclear waste continues.\n  It is, to some extent, a crude analogy to the situation we have with \nour Social Security fund. Currently, more money is coming into that \nfund than is necessary to pay the recipients of Social Security. We all \nknow sometime after the turn of the century, because of changing \ndemographics, that changes rather dramatically. So, too, with this \nnuclear waste fund because, as these utilities go off line, some of \nthem are scheduled, if they do not get an extension of their license, \nto cease operation in the year 2000, others in the year 2006 and, \nintermediately to the year 2033--but the waste just does not disappear. \nIt becomes a financial responsibility for someone and that is why it is \nnecessary to generate surpluses in the nuclear waste fund in order to \ndeal with the storage problem later on. So I think my colleagues need \nto look at the budget implications of this. Because, in effect, we \ncreate an unfunded liability for the Federal taxpayers the way this \nbill is currently drafted.\n  Let me return to the specifics of the amendment just one more time \nbefore reserving my time and yielding whatever time my colleague may \ntake to comment on this issue. That is to say, what we are saying \namplifies the decision of the court, simply specifying what the remedy \nis. The remedy is that the delay is unavoidable. They simply have to \nreschedule the shipments. If\n\n[[Page S9236]]\n\nthe delay is deemed avoidable, that is if there is some culpability, \nthen there is readjustment on the amount of fees the nuclear utilities \npay into the trust fund. I must say I believe that is fair.\n  My colleague and I, from Nevada, have long recognized that, indeed, \nif the high-level nuclear waste repository is not available by the year \n1998, if additional on-site storage is necessitated, then, indeed, the \nutilities would be entitled to a credit against any additional costs \nfor interim storage that they would incur, and that is the thrust of \nthis amendment.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Murkowski I yield \nmyself 5 minutes.\n  This is sort of a version 2 of the Wellstone amendment, in that it \nseeks to take the rights of utilities and, secondarily, the rights of \nratepayers of utilities, and abolish those by legislative fiat--which \nsimply cannot be done. The rights of utilities and, indeed, the rights \nof the ratepayers of those utilities, have been fixed by the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act of 1982 as amended by amendments in 1987 and by \ncontracts between the utilities and the Department of Energy. The \ncontracts between the utilities and the Department of Energy contain \ntwo provisions in article IX which relate to delays: A, involve \nunavoidable delay by purchaser or DOE, and, B, involve avoidable delays \nby purchaser or DOE. And those sections, A, and B, are part of the \ncontracts between the utilities and DOE, set out, in part, the relative \nrights in the event of those delays.\n  What the Senator from Nevada would attempt to do is take those two \nexisting provisions of contracts and state that those are the exclusive \nremedies, thereby leaving out another provision of those same \ncontracts. Another provision of those same contracts in article XI \nsays:\n\n       Nothing in this contract shall be construed to preclude \n     either party from asserting its rights and remedies under the \n     contract or at law.\n\n  In other words, the present contracts in article XI state that \nnothing precludes the assertion of the rights both under the contract \nand at law. What they would do is take that provision out and say that \nthose sections, A and B, that I just read, are the exclusive remedies.\n  Mr. President, that is clever, but what the court has said last week \nis that ``We hold that the Nuclear Waste Policy Act creates an \nobligation in DOE to start disposing of the spent nuclear fuel no later \nthan January 31, 1998.''\n  That is the law, decided only last week. And what the Senator from \nNevada would say, that notwithstanding what the court has said we are \ngoing to write that out of this, and the exclusive remedy is that which \nhe has just stated in his amendment, which is only part of what the \ncontract says, I repeat--it is absolutely settled law that this \nCongress, under our Constitution, may not take away vested rights. When \nsomeone has a right under the law, the Congress cannot come in and take \nit away without subjecting themselves to damages.\n  Again, quoting from the Winstar case, and this is from July 1996, \nthis very month, the Supreme Court says:\n\n       Congress may not simply abrogate a statutory provision \n     obligating performance without breaching the contract and \n     rendering itself liable for damages. Damages are always the \n     default remedy for breach of contract.\n\n  They go on to quote in a footnote:\n\n       Every breach of contract gives the injured party a right to \n     damages against the party in breach unless the parties by \n     agreement vary the rules. The award of damages is the common \n     form of relief for breach of contract. Virtually any breach \n     gives the injured party a claim for damages.\n\n  Mr. President, this is not a surprising new precedent of the Court. \nIt is a principle of law as old as John Marshall and the Supreme Court \nand the Constitution. So for my friends from Nevada to come along and \nsay the exclusive remedy is subsections (A) and (B) of his amendment, I \nwill not say it is ludicrous, Mr. President, out of respect for my \ncolleagues, but let's say that the argument does not have any weight \nand is totally contrary to that which is settled law of the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I yield 5 minutes, or such time as the \nSenator from Washington requires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, there are some occasions in this body in \nwhich a bit of institutional memory is truly of value. And, in my case, \nI have a memory which has been reinforced by reading the Congressional \nRecord of the creation of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.\n  Interestingly enough, the managers on both sides of the party aisle \nhere were Members of that Congress. But the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana, I believe, was perhaps the most knowledgeable Member of the \nbody at that time, as he is today, on this particular subject.\n  More than 14 years ago, in April 1982 when this bill was being \ndebated, this is what the Senator from Louisiana said:\n\n       The bill before the Senate today requires the Federal \n     Government to undertake definitive and specific actions to \n     assume the responsibility for nuclear waste disposal which \n     existing law reserves to it. We can attempt to avoid this \n     responsibility in the context of this particular Congress, \n     but we will never finally escape the necessity of enacting \n     legislation very similar to this bill. It is a task that no \n     one but Congress can perform.\n\n  The Senator from Louisiana went on to say:\n\n       The aim of this bill is to provide congressional support \n     which will force the executive branch to place before \n     Congress and the public real solutions to our nuclear waste \n     management problems. A schedule for Federal actions which \n     could lead to a site specific application for a license for \n     the disposition of nuclear waste in deep geologic formations \n     is established in title IV.\n\n  The Senator from Louisiana was, obviously, an optimist at that point, \nas were all of those who overwhelmingly supported him in passing that \nbill, this Senator included.\n  I cannot imagine that the Senator from Louisiana, whose bill included \nthis deadline referred to by the District of Columbia Circuit Court of \nAppeals last week ``beginning not later than January 31, 1998, the \nFederal Government will dispose of the high-level radioactive waste or \nspent nuclear fuel involved,'' I cannot imagine the Senator from \nLouisiana anticipated that we would have made so little progress by the \ndate upon which we are debating this bill. He was convinced, and we \nwere convinced, that by this year, we would certainly know what we were \ngoing to do with this nuclear waste on a temporary basis and be much \nfurther along the road to finding a long-term solution for the problem.\n\n  As a consequence of an overoptimistic view of what might happen then, \nwe have collected from utilities of the United States some $12 billion. \nWe have spent close to $6 billion of that attempting to characterize a \npermanent nuclear waste repository in Nevada, but we are certainly \nnowhere near as close to reaching a conclusion to this challenge as we \nexpected to be in 1982 when we passed this bill, and we spent more \nmoney on it, money that comes out of the pockets of American citizens \nin their utility bills.\n  Given that degree of frustration, given the almost infinite ability \nof those who oppose any major decision of this nature to delay that \ndecision through bureaucratic requirements, through court tests and the \nlike, we now have been faced with the necessity of finding at least a \ntemporary repository for this nuclear waste to meet the very \nrequirements that we laid down in 1982. That, obviously, is what this \nbill is designed to do.\n  In fact, by saying that we ought to begin by December 31 of 1998, \neven the sponsors of the bill already have let some time slip by. But, \nMr. President, at this point, with the failure to meet the schedule \nthat we wanted to meet in 1982, with the expenditure of literally \nbillions of dollars, with this nuclear waste piling up in various \nplants in 34 States, with the real challenge of what to do with our \ndefense nuclear waste, it is simply time to reach at least an interim \ndecision.\n  I expect that the Senators from Nevada, and many other Senators as \nwell, are firm in the belief that wherever the temporary storage site \nis located will end up being the permanent storage site. I suspect that \nmay very well be true, but I do believe that we are far enough along \nthis road that it is appropriate for the Congress to make that decision \nand to make that decision now.\n\n[[Page S9237]]\n\n  The waste is there, the environmental threat is there, the physical \ndangers are there, the necessity to gather it together in one place is \nthere. We know enough now about the policy to be able to make that \ndecision to be there. We are simply carrying out under the leadership \nof the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Louisiana the very \npolicies that this Congress and a former President of the United States \nfelt to be appropriate policies in 1982, and in doing so, we will save \nthe taxpayers money, we will help the environment, we will help our \noverall safety, and we will, one hopes, allow the Senator from \nLouisiana to retire, as he has regrettably chosen to do, from the \nSenate knowing that he has completed the job that he started in 1982 or \nearlier.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has control of 17 \nminutes; the Senators from Nevada have control of 20 minutes, 39 \nseconds.\n  Mr. REID. I am wondering if we could have a vote on this amendment \nand go to something else?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would be very pleased to. Is that the wish of the \nSenator from Nevada?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. REID. That is, on this amendment that is true.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Both sides are willing to yield back the remainder of \ntheir time and ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. With all time being yielded back on the \namendment, the question now is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5075) was rejected.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Alaska has the \nunanimous consent agreement that was being typed up for our submission?\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. On behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe vote occur on or in relation to the amendment number 5073 at 3:30 \np.m. today, and notwithstanding the agreement of July 24, the vote \noccur on final passage of S. 1936 at 4:55, and that paragraph 4 of rule \nXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my colleagues from Nevada for expediting the \nprocess.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Alaska, I think it would be \nappropriate the time would be equally divided between now and 3:30 on \nthe amendment offered by the Senators from Nevada. I ask unanimous \nconsent that that be the case.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is agreeable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5073\n\n  (Purpose: To specify contractual obligations between DOE and waste \n                              generators)\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I send amendment No. 5073 to the desk and \nask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan] proposes amendment \n     numbered 5073.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new provisions:\n\n     ``SEC.   . COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS.\n\n       ``Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the \n     Secretary shall comply with all Federal laws and regulations \n     in developing and implementing the integrated management \n     system.\n\n     ``SEC.   . COMPLIANCE WITH NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT.\n\n       ``(a) National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the \n     Secretary shall comply with all requirements of the National \n     Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) in \n     developing and implementing the integrated management system.\n       ``(b) Judicial Review.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of this Act, any agency action relating to the development or \n     implementation of the integrated management system shall be \n     subject to judicial review.''\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, much has been said over the past few hours \ntoday and earlier during the course of our discussion of S. 1936 about \nwhat I consider one of the most serious defects of this piece of \nlegislation in that it emasculates the environmental protections that \nhave been drafted for more than a quarter of a century, most of which \nwith bipartisan support and in effect says with respect to this \nparticular issue they shall not apply.\n  So what we are doing is we are giving people an opportunity, our \ncolleagues an opportunity, to express themselves on the environmental \nissue, very, very simple.\n  The first part of this amendment says:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the \n     Secretary shall comply with all Federal laws and regulations \n     in developing and implementing the integrated management \n     system.\n\n  My colleagues will recall the section 501 under the current \nprovisions, as amended, is very convoluted and says:\n\n       If the requirements of any Federal, State, or local law \n     (including a requirement imposed by regulation or by any \n     other means under such a law) are inconsistent with or \n     duplicative of the requirements of the Atomic Energy Act . . \n     . or of this Act, the Secretary shall comply only with the \n     requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and of this \n     Act. . . .\n\n  This Mr. President, makes it very, very clear. If you do not want all \nof these environmental laws preempted, this is the way to correct it. \nStraightforward, no ifs, ands, or buts: Notwithstanding any other \nprovision of this act, the Secretary shall comply with all Federal laws \nand regulations in developing and implementing the integrated \nmanagement system.\n  I note for my colleagues, because the two Senators from Nevada have \nbeen involved in this issue now for the last 14 years, we made a policy \njudgment not to include State law so it could not be asserted that this \nwas an indirect effort to allow the Nevada legislature to implement \nsome type of barrier that would make this impossible.\n  So this is straightforward. It does not get any cleaner, it does not \nget any clearer, and does not get any easier to understand. If you are \ntruly opposed to preempting all of these laws, this is the amendment \nthat does it.\n  If you also believe that there is a purpose in America for the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, this amendment provides for the full \napplication and judicial review. Under the current bill the provisions \nsay on the one hand that the Environmental Policy Act will apply, and \nthen go on to say at some considerable length, but it shall not apply \nto the various citing alternatives. I will provide that.\n  Section 204, subsection (f) says the National Environmental Policy \nAct shall apply. Then you get down into subsection (B).\n\n       Such Environmental Impact Statement shall not consider --\n       (i) the need for interim storage. . .\n       (ii) the time of the initial availability of the interim \n     storage. . .\n       (iii) any alternatives to the storage of [nuclear waste].\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       (v) any alternatives to the design criteria. . .\n       (vi) the environmental impacts of the storage [beyond the \n     period of initial licensure].\n\n  You will recall the National Academy of Sciences said those should \nconsider 10,000 years and beyond.\n  This bill would limit it to just the period of time of the initial \nlicensure. And so, Mr. President, this is a clean, straightforward \nattempt to say that the full array of provisions under the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act shall apply.\n\n[[Page S9238]]\n\n  Let me just say that the Council on Environmental Quality--that is \nthe council that was established when Congress passed the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act in 1969-- went on to say--and I quote from the \nletter. ``S. 1936''--that is essentially what we are dealing with:\n\n       S. 1936 renders the NEPA process meaningless by precluding \n     the incorporation of NEPA's core values which are necessary \n     for making informed and timely decisions essential for \n     protecting public health, safety and environmental quality. \n     Consequently, the bill all but locks into place both interim \n     and permanent storage sites by giving decisionmakers no \n     reasonable options * * *\n\n  It is that same rationale that has caused the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, to point out that in effect we do not \nhave the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act under the \nprovisions of the bill as now constituted.\n  So, Mr. President, I think we can make this very clear and very \nsimple. If Senators want these environmental laws to apply, if they \nbelieve that the Environmental Policy Act ought to be applicable to \nthis very critical decision, in which we all agree that we are dealing \nwith material that is not just kind of messy, kind of unpleasant, to be \na little bit difficult and inconvenient to clean up, we are talking \nabout stuff that is deadly for tens of thousands of years, the highest \nkind of risk to public health and safety. Yet, the nuclear industry, \nand its supporters, have the audacity to emasculate the application of \nthe environmental laws and in effect try to reduce the impact of the \nNational Environmental Policy Act to a hollow and pale facsimile of \nwhat the law provides in terms of protections for various policy \ninitiatives, et cetera. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my \ntime and yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we now have how much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 16\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is my intention to speak for about 4 minutes and \ngive the Senator from Louisiana about 8 minutes, and then reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. President, this is another innocuous-sounding amendment which, in \nreality, is a bonanza for lawyers, and there are a lot of lawyers in \nthis country. We have general laws in this country to cover situations \nthat Congress did not specifically consider. The courts understand \nthat. So when there is a conflict between a general law and a specific \nlaw enacted with a particular facility or purpose in mind, the court \nfollows the specific law.\n  With this act we are considering, the specific conditions to apply to \nspecific nuclear waste repositories--an interim repository and a \npermanent repository. What the amendment of the Senator from Nevada \nattempts to do is to provide broadly written, general laws with the \nsame standing as the specific directions we are providing in this bill. \nTheirs is an amendment, Mr. President, carefully crafted to confuse the \ncourts, confound the legal process, and enrich the lawyers.\n  This amendment is going to delay the process leading to a responsible \nsolution to the nuclear waste problem. I implore my colleagues to avoid \nthis trap. That is what it is. This is an antienvironmental amendment.\n  Let me repeat that, Mr. President. This is an antienvironmental \namendment. It does not address, obviously, the problem we have with the \nnuclear waste. If you want to solve a huge environmental problem in \nthis country, you want to oppose this amendment.\n  If this amendment prevails, Mr. President, the Department of Energy \nis going to be mired in litigation. It will be mired in red tape. It \nwill be mired in delay. We are simply not going to be able to get there \nfrom here with a responsible answer to this problem. Taxpayer dollars \nare going to be squandered in litigation if this amendment is adopted. \nThe problem of nuclear waste will continue to persist, and, as a \nconsequence, we will be right back to zero.\n  I retain the balance of my time and yield 7 or 8 minutes to the \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. Mr. \nPresident, if you want to frustrate any ability to have a nuclear waste \nrepository, vote for this amendment, because, to be sure, this would \nmake it impossible to build.\n  Now, Mr. President, this has been advertised as an attempt only to \nmake this subject to the same environmental laws that every other \nprocess has. Not so, Mr. President. Under the present Administrative \nProcedures Act, there is an appeal to the courts only for a final \nagency action. That is section 704 of the Administrative Procedures \nAct.\n  What this amendment would do is to say that any agency action related \nto the development or implementation of the management system shall be \nsubject to judicial review--any agency action.\n  So, Mr. President, I guess anything that the agency does, whether it \nis a major Federal action or not, whether it is a final agency action, \nwould be subject to judicial review. They would be able to go to court. \nIf you wake up in the morning and purchase a cup of coffee, I guess \nthat is some kind of agency action, not final, but subject to judicial \nreview. It would mean it would be impossible to do anything under this \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, much has been made of the fact that environmental \nimpact statements have been waived here. The fact of the matter is, Mr. \nPresident, existing legislation presently calls for a waiver of \nvirtually every provision already contained herein. For example, Mr. \nPresident, we state that such environmental impact statement shall not \nconsider any alternatives to the storage of spent nuclear fuel at the \ninterim storage facility.\n  Now, why did we put that in the initial legislation back in 1982? Why \ndid we bring it forward in 1987? And why do we have it here? Because, \nMr. President, there are endless alternatives to storage of spent \nnuclear fuel.\n\n  You can shoot it into space and into the sun. That has been seriously \nsuggested. You can send it down to the ocean bottom and bury it in the \ndeep mud down there. You can have detonation underground in caverns. \nYou can reprocess in light-water reactors, you can reprocess in liquid \nlight-water reactors, you can have other space launches, deep bore \nholes in the Earth. Mr. President, all of these alternatives. But this \nlanguage would have to be evaluated under the National Environmental \nPolicy Act, notwithstanding the fact that Congress has spoken very \nclearly on the need for a nuclear waste repository.\n  Mr. President, this would endlessly delay this matter by having to do \nvery expensive studies on matters which have already been rejected by \nthe Congress. Another provision on which the law already provides no \nneed for a NEPA statement is an alternative to the site of the facility \nas designated by the Secretary. The site here is Yucca Mountain.\n  Now, the Congress has clearly spoken in naming Yucca Mountain. That \nis why we have said in previous legislation that you did not need to do \nan alternative NEPA statement to examine, for example, the granite in \nMaine or the different kind of geologic formations in Washington, for \nexample, or the salt domes in Mississippi. There are potential sites \nall over this country and, but for the waiver of a NEPA statement, you \nwould have to go and revisit each of these facilities all over the \ncountry, each of these locations. That is, in each of these cases, the \nlaw already provides for a waiver of the NEPA statement to consider \nthese various alternatives.\n  The same is true for the alternatives to the design. The same is true \nfor the need for the interim storage facility.\n  Mr. President, rather than bring forward some new series of waivers, \nwe are really bringing forward what existing law provides and has \nalready been waived as part of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.\n  Mr. President, it is not too much to say that if we adopted this \namendment you would never be able to build a repository in the United \nStates or an interim facility because you would put on endless \nrequirements for NEPA statements on matters to examine sites all over \nthe United States, to examine alternatives to repository disposal and \ninterim disposal, on matters that would be very expensive to \ninvestigate and very difficult to prove, and would take many, many \nyears to determine.\n  Most especially, Mr. President, by providing that there would be \nappeal from any agency action as opposed to\n\n[[Page S9239]]\n\nfinal agency action, final agency action appeals are provided in this \nlegislation, but interim agency actions are not. If you made all agency \nactions appealable, it would simply be impossible to have a repository.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Chair advise the Senator from Nevada how much \ntime we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's side has 12 minutes, and the \nother side has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I want to yield to my friend from California, but prior to \nthat, I want to discuss a number of things.\n  First, this is a good deal for the proponents of this bill. They want \nto waive all the environmental laws, and they are saying the reason is \nbecause people might want to appeal, they might be protecting their \nrights, which is what you can do in this country.\n  That is why we have NEPA. That is why we have all the laws set forth \nin the chart behind us.\n  I also want to drop back a few minutes, Mr. President. The senior \nSenator from North Dakota was here. He was concerned about terrorism, \nbut because we were running out of time on an amendment, we could not \nrespond to his concern. I want to take a few minutes to respond to him. \nI hope if the Senator is not listening, his staff is, because this is, \nI think, extremely important to the question he asked.\n  We have here a letter from the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense \nLeague. Among other things, they say in this letter, dated July 29, \n1996--what they are basically explaining is that nuclear waste is \ndangerous and terrorists will get to the nuclear shipments, and they \nproved it.\n\n       Two shipments arrived at the Military Ocean Terminal at \n     Sunny Point in North Carolina, were loaded onto rail cars, \n     and then transported overland to SRS. We were able to track \n     both of these shipments from their ports of origin in \n     Denmark, Greece, France, and Sweden across the Atlantic to \n     North Carolina to SRS.\n\n  These shipments cannot be kept secret so long as we live in a free \nsociety.\n\n       Our actions were peaceful, but we proved that determined \n     individuals, on a shoestring budget, can precisely track \n     international and domestic shipments of strategic materials. \n     In the wake of Oklahoma City and Atlanta, the dangers posed \n     by domestic or international terrorists armed with explosives \n     makes the transport of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel \n     too dangerous to contemplate for the foreseeable future.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter dated July 29 from the Blue \nRidge Environmental Defense League be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          Blue Ridge Environmental\n\n\n                                               Defense League,\n\n                                      Marshall, NC, July 29, 1996.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996 (S. \n     1936) would place in jeopardy the lives of millions of \n     American citizens by transporting 15,638 casks of highly \n     radioactive material over railways and highways of this \n     nation. This attempt at a quick-fix for the nuclear waste \n     dilemma would cause more problems than it attempts to solve. \n     The people who would bear the greatest burden would be the \n     172 million Americans who live nearest the transportation \n     corridors. S. 1936 is a legislative short-circuit that will \n     make us less secure as a nation and which will dump the costs \n     of emergency response on the states and local governments.\n       The Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League began in 1984: \n     our work takes us throughout the southeast. Since 1994 we \n     have observed the international shipments of spent nuclear \n     fuel (SNF) from foreign research reactors (FRR) to a disposal \n     site at the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina. Two \n     shipments arrived at the Military Ocean Terminal at Sunny \n     Point (MOTSU) in North Carolina, were loaded onto rail cars, \n     and then transported overland to SRS. We were able to track \n     both of these shipments from their ports of origin in \n     Denmark, Greece, France, and Sweden across the Atlantic to \n     North Carolina to SRS. We observed the fuel shipment when \n     they arrived at MOTSU. We watched the SNF transfer from ship \n     to train and followed it through the countryside of coastal \n     North and South Carolina. Our reason for doing this was to \n     alert people along the transport route about the shipments \n     through their communities. We rented a light plane and flew \n     out over the SNF ships when they reached the three-mile \n     limit. Television news cameras accompanied us and transmitted \n     pictures for broadcast on the evening news. If we can track \n     such shipments, anyone can. These shipments cannot be kept \n     secret so long as we live in a free society. Our actions were \n     peaceful but we proved that determined individuals on a \n     shoestring budget can precisely track international and \n     domestic shipments of strategic materials. In the wake of \n     Oklahoma City and Atlanta the dangers posed by domestic or \n     international terrorists armed with explosives make the \n     transport of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel too \n     dangerous to contemplate for the foreseeable future.\n       Our work in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia takes \n     us to many rural communities. Emergency management personnel \n     in these areas are dedicated volunteers, but they are \n     unprepared for nuclear waste. Volunteer fire departments in \n     rural counties are very good at putting out house fires and \n     brush fires. While serving as a volunteer fire fighter in \n     Madison County, NC, I had the privilege of working with these \n     men and women. We took special training to handle propane \n     tank emergencies utilizing locally-built water pumper trucks. \n     More sophisticated training or equipment was prohibitively \n     expensive and beyond our financial means. Traffic control is \n     a consideration at an emergency scene. Any fire or accident \n     tends to draw a crowd. Onlookers arrive as soon as the fire \n     department--sometimes sooner in remote areas. There are \n     always traffic jams reducing traffic flow to a one-lane crawl \n     day or night, fair weather or foul. The remote river valleys \n     and steep grades of Appalachia are legendary. At Saluda, NC \n     the steepest standard gauge mainline railroad grade in the \n     United States drops 253 feet/mile (4.8% grade). The CSX and \n     Norfolk Southern lines trace the French Broad River Valley \n     and the Nolichucky Gorge west through the Appalachian \n     Mountains along remote stretches of rivers famous among \n     whitewater rafters for their steep drops and their distance \n     from civilization. The Norfolk Southern RR crosses the French \n     Broad River at Deep Water Bridge where the mountains rise \n     2,200 feet above the river. These are the transport routes \n     through western North Carolina that will be used for high \n     level nuclear waste transport as soon as 1998 according to S. \n     1936.\n       County emergency management personnel are entrusted with \n     early response to hazards to the public in western North \n     Carolina communities. When we asked about their readiness to \n     respond to a nuclear transport accident, they answered \n     professionally saying, ``We'll just go out there and keep \n     people away until state or federal officials arrive.'' This \n     may be the best that can be done while a fire burns or \n     radiation leaks from a damaged cask. In a recent interview, \n     one western NC emergency coordinator said, ``There is no \n     response team anywhere in this part of the state and, for the \n     foreseeable future, there is no money in local budgets to \n     equip us with any first response to radioactive spills.''\n       The concerns of local officials reflect their on-the-scene \n     responsibility while state officials, faced with limited \n     budgets and staff, make plans based on current bureaucratic \n     realities. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act and Amendments of \n     1982 and 1987 place large-scale nuclear transportation \n     scenarios decades in the future. This fact and the limited \n     resources of existing emergency planning departments make the \n     timeline for preparation for nuclear accident response \n     completely inadequate for shipments beginning as soon as \n     1998. In North Carolina's Division of Emergency Management, \n     the lead REP planner has four staffers and a whole state to \n     cover. It is not possible under these circumstances, to be \n     ready with credible emergency response plans, training, and \n     equipment in two years.\n       I am asking you to oppose this expensive and dangerous \n     legislation which would place an unfair and unnecessary \n     financial burden on communities and which would place at risk \n     the health and safety of millions of American citizens.\n           Respectfully,\n\n                                                   Louis Zeller.  \n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we also know that they are running roughshod \nover environmental laws in this country--``they'' being the proponents \nof this legislation. We have here a statement from Public Citizen, \nwhich says, ``If you believe in environmental standards, don't vote for \nS. 1936. S. 1936 severely weakens environmental standards by carving \nloopholes in the National Environmental Policy Act''--that is what we \ncall NEPA--``eliminating licensing standards, forbidding the EPA from \nraising radiation release standards.''\n  Mr. President, we received from the President of the United States \noffice late last night a reiteration of why he believes this \nlegislation is bad and why it should be voted down. Among other things \nsaid in this letter from John Hilly, assistant to the President of the \nUnited States, it says:\n\n       The bill undermines environmental laws and processes. \n     Americans deserve full public health protection. Yet, this \n     bill renders the National Environmental Policy Act \n     meaningless, undermines EPA and the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission regulatory process for public protection from \n     radiation exposure.\n\n\n[[Page S9240]]\n\n\n  It is a good deal the proponents have--just wipe out the \nenvironmental laws and say we have to get rid of nuclear waste. The \npowerful nuclear lobby has been willing to run roughshod over the lives \nof Americans for too many years. It is time we stopped it. There is a \npermanent repository being characterized in Nevada. The only reason \nthey want to go with the interim storage is to save money. It is not \ngoing fast enough for them. They don't care about environmental laws. \nThey care about the bottom line, the dollar amount. They are making \ntons of money.\n  Mr. President, on this chart are the companies pushing this. Look, \nMr. President, at the percent of net income relative to revenue: 20 \npercent of their revenues come from nuclear power. Here is 17.25 \npercent, 17.7 percent, 20.5 percent, 22.75 percent, and 25 percent. \nThey are raking in the money. But it is not enough. They want to make \nmore. They don't care about the rights and liberties of Americans that \nare protected with the laws called Clean Air, Clean Water, Superfund, \nand other such laws.\n  I understand my friend from California has a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I do. I would like to address a couple of questions. \nFirst, I want to thank both of you for your courage. I think Senator \nReid has shown us that there is a lot of power behind this particular \nbill--economic power--and it is always difficult to stand up against \nthat. So my thanks to you for doing that. That is why we need people \nlike you in the U.S. Senate. Your team leadership has been noticed by \nmany throughout this great country.\n  I want to also thank Senator Conrad and Senator Reid for talking \nabout the issue of terrorism, because having to close our eyes to the \nterrorist threat after what we have been through is--I can't even \nfathom it. I think Senator Conrad was correct to bring this up. The \nanswer from Senator Reid, I found, to be very illuminating.\n  This is my basic question: Did we not have in this Senate, over many \nyears, a lot of struggles and fights to win passage of the very \nlegislation that would be waived in this act, and wasn't that struggle \nand that fight a bipartisan one, where we came together, from different \nparties sometimes, and sometimes with different viewpoints, to pass the \nClean Air Act and the Clean Water Act?\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my friend from California that most of this \nlegislation began during the period of Richard Nixon.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Take clean water. The reason the Clean Water Act was \ninitiated is because the Cuyahoga River in Ohio caught fire, not once, \nbut three times. After the third fire, people around the country \nstarted saying, ``Maybe we should do something about this.'' I respond \nto my friend from California that when the Clean Water Act was \ninitiated, 80 percent of the rivers and streams in America were \npolluted. Now, some 25 years later, those numbers have almost reversed. \nApproximately 80 percent of the streams and rivers in America--you can \nswim in them and drink out of them. They are in pretty good shape. It \nis not perfect. We have a long way to go, but we have done pretty well.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me say that I have the honor and privilege of serving \nwith my friend, Senator Reid, on the Environment Committee, and that is \nwhat brought me to the floor today.\n  I ask Senator Bryan this question: Is it not true that the waste that \nwill be moved throughout this country and placed in this repository is \ndangerous waste that could last between thousands of years to even a \nmillion years or millions of years?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from California is correct. This is among the \nmost dangerous material on the face of the Earth. We are talking not \nabout something that would be a problem for 5, 10, 15, 20 years, even 2 \nor 3 lifetimes. The whole thrust of the bill that is before us is to \ncut corners, try to save a few bucks here, to impose artificial \ndeadlines that can never be met, all to the disadvantage of public \nhealth and safety.\n  Very seldom do you hear the nuclear utilities talk about doing \nsomething to protect public health and safety. It is always, ``This \ncosts too much,'' ``Delay this a little bit,'' ``It would be \ninconvenient or difficult.'' The whole thrust of these laws is a \nbalancing of public health and safety, and the fact that it may take a \nlittle longer, it may be a little more difficult, was a bipartisan \nconsensus, as my senior colleague pointed out, during the term of \nRichard Nixon. NEPA was enacted in 1969, the first year he served as \nPresident. It was a bipartisan consensus in America. This legislation \nwould shatter that and subject those who would be affected by this \ndecision--at least 51 million people along the transportation routes--\nto a lower standard of protection for public health and safety.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The point of my question is that here we have the most \ndangerous elements known to humankind. And of all the things we should \nbe doing, it seems to me, when we decide on a repository, is to make \nsure that every one of those acts is complied with--Clean Air, Clean \nWater, National Environmental Policy Act, Community Right to Know, Safe \nDrinking Water Act--and that is why I am so strongly supportive of the \nSenators' amendment.\n  All of the response about being duplicative and inconsistent--I \nrespect my friends on the other side of the debate, but we have a \ndifference in the way we view the public interest. I have nothing but \nrespect for those who hold a different view. But I say this: If it is \nduplicative and there is even one question about it, why not vote for \nthis amendment and be doubly sure, if you will, that our people are \nprotected from the most harmful elements known to humankind? I thank my \ncolleague for yielding, and I yield back my time to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises that all the time of the \nSenator from Nevada has expired. There are 8 minutes remaining on the \nother side.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. I observe, for the benefit of my \nfriend from California, for whom I have the utmost and fondest regard, \nthat accepting this amendment means her State gets considered as a \npossible alternative for interim storage. The State of California \ncurrently has approximately 1,319 metric tons of high-level nuclear \nwaste that is stored in California. It is estimated that, by the year \n2010, there will be 2,639 metric tons.\n  So the point is, if we leave it where it is, which is what we will do \nwith the amendment offered by my friends from Nevada, waste is simply \ngoing to stay where it is. As a consequence, at some point in time \nsomebody will have to do something with it. To do something with it \nimplies you have to move it. We have heard fear, fear, fear. We move \nmoney in armored cars. We used to move it in stagecoaches. We protected \nit. We protect it in armored cars. We will protect waste, if you will, \nin casks. This movement is not just helter-skelter.\n  They have moved, in Europe, 30,000 metric tons of high-level nuclear \nwaste. They moved it safely. That does not mean an accident could not \nhappen or that a terrorist activity could not happen. But they have \nmoved it. It has not been designed, if you will, to be easily lifted. \nIt is very, very heavy and very difficult. The containers are built to \nmaintain a degree of security unknown in any other type of engineering \ndevice.\n  So while there is a risk associated with all aspects of this, there \nis also a reality of inconsistency in this amendment because the \nSenator from Nevada indicated that by permitting one repository in \nNevada as a permanent repository, he has acknowledged that the material \nhas to get there somehow.\n  So you have the potential risk, if you will, if you simply say we are \ngoing for a permanent repository and we are not going to consider an \ninterim repository. The stuff has to move anyhow. There is a risk \nassociated with movement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am sorry. I have a limited time, in all due respect \nto my friend from California.\n  Adopting a NEPA process open to alternatives opens up new areas for \nconsideration.\n  There is behind us the map showing all of the places other than a \nNevada test site that could be used for an interim central storage \nfacility. You can\n\n[[Page S9241]]\n\nsee them. They are all over the country.\n  If you say yes to this amendment, you may be saying yes to nuclear \nwaste storage in your State or near your State. The possibilities \ninclude New York, Hawaii, Connecticut, Washington, Maine, Iowa, \nCalifornia, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Arkansas, Wisconsin, \nOregon, and others. There are potential locations in 40 other States of \nabout 605,000 square miles; 20 percent of the continental United \nStates. You have to put it somewhere.\n  So what we have here is an effort by the Senators from Nevada that \nmay sound reasonable at first glance but it sets this whole process \nback 15 or 20 years. It allows all the decisions we are making today to \nbe reconsidered. It allows them all to be challenged in the courts. It \nguarantees further delay, further gridlock, further stalemate, and it \nwill, therefore, force the ratepayers in all of these States not to pay \nonce but to pay twice, to continue to pay into the nuclear waste fund \nand to build new interim reactor storage sites because some of them are \nfull at this time.\n  This is a giant loophole for the Government to use in avoiding its \npromise to store and handle waste. It is an effort to derail the \nprocess.\n  Senate bill 1936 does not--and I emphasize ``does not''--exempt the \nestablishment of an interim or final repository for NEPA. Instead, it \nrequires an EIS for both the interim and permanent repository. We \nrequire it.\n  Furthermore, S. 1936 is consistent with NEPA and the Executive Order \n12114 which implements NEPA. NEPA and the Executive order clearly \nanticipates the situation we have here. There are some decisions of \npolicy that are within the agency's power to affect. There are others \nthat are not. Congress may properly reserve some decisions for itself \nand allow other decisions to be considered in the NEPA process. \nOtherwise, we would never get anything done around here.\n  Senate bill 1936 identifies six decisions that are appropriate for \ncongressional consideration only. These six decisions involve whether \nwe need a repository, when we need a repository, and where the \nrepository should be built. So it is whether, when, and where. These \nare fundamental decisions of policy.\n  I say to my colleagues that there are some things that we have the \nresponsibility to decide and decisions that we are paid to make. These \nare some policies that we alone must determine, and that is our job.\n  If we adopt this amendment, we are being irresponsible because it \nwill simply put off the process, put into the courts and delay beyond \nthis administration to sometime in the future, and we will never \naddress it.\n  What this amendment would do is to throw all of the cards back up in \nthe air again as if to say Congress has made the tough decisions and \ncast the tough votes, but we are going to ignore all of that and \nrevisit all of these decisions that we have already made.\n  Mr. President, if we are going to allow the agencies to revisit all \nof the decisions of Congress, either through NEPA or some other means, \nthen there is no need for us to be here. We might as well go home \nbecause there is nothing for us to do.\n  So do not be fooled by this amendment. This is an amendment designed \nto derail responsible action to address nuclear waste in a repository. \nIt looks reasonable at first glance, but it merely is a means to upset \nthe applecart and put us back to where we were in 1980.\n  Mr. President, I yield all of my remaining time.\n  I move to table the pending amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Alaska to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Nevada. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 73, nays 27, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 258 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--73\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Frahm\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kyl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Robb\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--27\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Chafee\n     Daschle\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Harkin\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Lieberman\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 5073) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to \nlay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I supported the motion to table the Bryan \namendment to S. 1936 not because it included a requirement that the \nDepartment of Energy comply with the National Environmental Policy Act \n[NEPA] in the establishment of an interim storage facility at the \nNevada nuclear test site--language which I support--but because it also \nincluded unjustifiably sweeping judicial review language. While I \nsupport judicial review of all final agency actions, this provision \ngoes well beyond final rulemakings and would be unnecessarily \nburdensome and costly to both the Federal Government and the private \nsector. In my judgment, should this bill become law over my objections, \nthis judicial review could cause the entire process of establishing the \nrepository to grind to a halt.\n  Congress passed NEPA in 1969 to ensure that Federal agencies \nintegrate environmental values--as well as social, economic, and \ntechnical factors--in the decisionmaking process. Section 102 of NEPA \nrequires environmental impact statements [EIS] for proposed major \nFederal actions which would significantly affect the quality of the \nhuman environment. The EIS process includes alternatives analysis in \nwhich reasonable alternatives to the proposed action are explored in an \neffort to present clear choices to decisionmakers and the public, and \nto ensure that the most environmentally sound course of action is \ntaken.\n  S. 1936 limits or eliminates the application of a number of NEPA's \nhealth and environmental standards with respect to the establishment of \na temporary waste repository. For example, in order to expedite the \ninterim repository's opening it waives any regulations for the \nprotection of public health and the environment if the regulations \nwould delay or affect the development, licensing, construction or \noperation of the interim storage facility.\n  I strongly believe that any facility in the United States designed to \nstore spent nuclear fuel should be required to comply with NEPA. \nTherefore, I wholeheartedly support the first half of the Bryan \namendment which instructs the Secretary of Energy to comply with all \nNEPA requirements.\n  My concern with the Bryan amendment stems from its language which \nwould add sweeping judicial review provisions to this bill. It would \nsubject to judicial review any agency action relating to the \ndevelopment or implementation of the integrated management system. I \nfirmly support judicial review for all final agency actions. However, I \nam concerned that including any and all agency actions, not just final \nactions, may produce innumerable interlocutory judgments.\n  The cost to taxpayers likely would be very high, and the repository \nto be established under the terms of this bill likely would be drowned \nin a sea of redtape. That is not in our Nation's best interests despite \nthe capable efforts of the Senators from Nevada to do everything in \ntheir power to prevent or\n\n[[Page S9242]]\n\ndelay the establishment and operation of a repository in their State. \nOnce our Government makes a decision to establish a repository for \nnuclear wastes which is badly needed--although I do not believe we are \nready to make that decision with the confidence we should have for a \nstep of this consequence--we should not deliberately set up the effort \nto fail by tying it in legal and procedural knots.\n\n  It appears unlikely that any additional amendments to this bill will \nbe offered or approved that would restore the applicability of NEPA \nprovisions. Therefore, because the legislation exempts the repository \nestablishment process from the application of NEPA and other \nenvironmental statutes, I will oppose final passage of S. 1936. I am \nhopeful this bill in its current form will not be enacted. The \nPresident has said he will veto it in this form, and I would urge him \nto do so.\n  But, Mr. President, I wish to emphasize that I do not take this \nstance with enthusiasm. Our Nation needs a repository for nuclear \nwaste. We should not continue ad infinitum to store it temporarily at \nthe sites where it has been produced. That is neither safe nor prudent. \nOur Government needs to redouble its efforts to reach a conclusion \nabout the establishment of a permanent repository, and it needs to do \nthat with alacrity.\n  Unfortunately, this legislation to create a temporary repository is \nnot the answer. Establishing a temporary facility necessarily brings \ndifficult problems that would not be present with a permanent facility. \nExempting the facility and the process of establishing it from \nenvironmental laws and safeguards is unacceptable.\n  It is not inconceivable, even if quite unlikely, that these problems \ncan be remedied this year in a way that would permit me to support this \nlegislation. The first requirement is that the process be subjected to \ncompliance with environmental laws and regulations. This could be \naccomplished in a conference committee. If it is not, I will continue \nto oppose it.\n  But if its flaws are not adequately repaired, and the bill either is \nnot finally passed by the Congress or is vetoed by the President, the \n105th Congress needs to begin grappling early and seriously with this \nmatter. I hope when it does so, Mr. President, that it will take a \ndifferent and more responsible course than has been taken in the \ncurrent Congress.\n\n\n                             Section 101(g)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, at page 9, lines 20-23 of the manager's \nsubstitute amendment, section 101(g) provides that ``subject to \nsubsection (f), nothing in this Act shall be construed to subject the \nUnited States to financial liability for the Secretary's failure to \nmeet any deadline for the acceptance or emplacement of spent nuclear \nfuel or high-level radioactive waste. * * *'' Is it the manager's \nintention that this language prevent contract holders from recovering \ndamages or other financial relief from the Government on account of \nDOE's failure to comply with the 1998 deadline established in section \n302(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is not the manager's intention that section 101(g) \nlimit in any way the rights of contract holders, their ratepayers, or \nthose agencies of the State governments that represent ratepayers, from \nenforcing any right they might have, including the right to hold the \nFederal Government liable financially, under the 1982 act and the \ncontracts executed pursuant thereto. Section 101(g) is expressly \nsubject to section 101(f), which makes clear that rights conferred by \nsection 302(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 or by the \ncontracts executed thereunder are not affected by this bill, including \nsection 101(g). To the extent that act or the contracts established a \n1998 deadline and the DOE fails to meet that deadline, it is not the \nmanager's intent that the substitute amendment in any way restrict the \nrelief available to those damaged by the failure to meet the deadline.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it correct then that the manager does not intend that \nthe amendment would restrict the scope of remedies available to the \nplaintiffs in the litigation in which the Court of Appeals of the \nDistrict of Columbia has recently held that the 1998 deadline is a \nbinding obligation of the Federal Government?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is correct. It is not the manager's intent that \nthe language of section 101(g) proscribe the court of appeals or any \nother court from awarding monetary relief or other financial remedies \nto those who have paid fees to the Government under the 1982 act and \nthe contracts, or those who will incur additional expense on account of \nthe DOE's failure to comply with any right conferred by 1982 act or the \ncontracts.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If a deadline were imposed by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \nof 1996, as reflected by the substitute amendment, as well as by the \nNuclear Waste Policy of 1982 or the contracts executed thereunder, is \nit the manager's intention that section 101(g) would proscribe \nfinancial liability for failure to meet the deadline to the extent it \nis imposed by the 1982 act? For instance, if DOE were to fail to \ncommence the acceptance and emplacement of spent nuclear fuel and high \nlevel radioactive waste by November 30, 1999 or thereafter, would the \namendment proscribe a court from imposing financial liability on DOE if \na court ruled that DOE's inaction constituted a failure to comply with \nthe deadline established in section 302(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct of 1982 and the contracts?\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is not the manager's intention that section 101(g) \nlimit the rights or remedies available under the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct of 1982 or the contracts executed thereunder. If a failure by DOE \nto comply with any deadline established in the amendment also \nconstituted a failure to comply with a deadline established by the 1982 \nact or a contract under that act, it is not the manager's intent that \nsection 101(g) modify the right of any contract holder to seek any and \nall remedies otherwise available for the violation of the 1982 act or \nfor breach of the contract. It is the manager's intention that section \n101(f) preserve all of those rights, regardless of whether the same or \na similar obligation is expressed in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of \n1996.\n  Mr. LEVIN. With respect to a deadline imposed for the first time in \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996, is it the manager's intention \nthat section 101(g) proscribe a court order that the Secretary of \nEnergy comply with such deadline, or granting relief other than money \ndamages to contract holders?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is not the manager's intent that section 101(g) \nproscribe anything other than financial liability for failure to meet a \ndeadline imposed by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996. To the extent \nother forms of relief are available for the government's failure to \ncomply with a deadline imposed by the amendment, the manager does not \nintend that such a remedy be prohibited.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it the manager's intention that section 101(g) limit \nthe liability of the United States for anything other than a failure to \nmeet a deadline? For instance, if the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996 \nimposes an obligation which is not a deadline, such as the requirement \nto reimburse contract holders for transportable storage systems if DOE \nuses such systems as part of the integrated management system, is it \nthe manager's intention that that obligation not constitute a financial \nliability of the United States?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is not the manager's intention that section 101(g) \nlimit the liability of the Federal Government for anything other than a \ndeadline. The manager does not intend that any other obligation imposed \nby the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996 be affected by section 101(g).\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, when I first saw the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct, S. 1271, I was very surprised at its apparent disregard to the \nrights of citizens and the protection of the environment. It appeared \nto me that proponents of that bill wanted to ignore those issues, all \nin the name of removing a burden from the nuclear industry. I can \nunderstand the desire to make the Federal Government live up to its \npromises, but not at the expense of the environment or citizen's \nrights.\n  The bill, as originally written, contained provisions for prohibiting \nthe Environmental Protection Agency from performing its legislatively \nmandated function of defining standards for radiation releases from the \npermanent or interim radioactive waste repository. Congress established \nwhat appeared to be a limit which disregarded\n\n[[Page S9243]]\n\nscientific and public input on appropriate limits. Particularly galling \nwas the prohibition of public input and EPA involvement in standard \nsetting.\n  Other issues of concern included: First, opening the door to \nreprocessing, called conditioning in the original bill; second, running \nrough-shod over the citizens of States through which the radioactive \nwaste would be transported; and third, gutting Civil Service laws for a \nparticular DOE office.\n  I filed several amendments, in an attempt to correct provisions of \nthe bill that in my view would result in unfair treatment or inadequate \nprotection of citizens and the environment. Several of those provisions \nhave been corrected, or at least modified. I am pleased to see that, in \nthe latest version of the bill, the EPA and the NRC have been brought \nback into the process, albeit somewhat awkwardly. These two agencies \nare charged with responsibilities for setting standards for protection \nof the public, workers, and the environment from produced radioactive \nmaterials, which includes those found in nuclear reactors or \nradioactive waste repositories.\n  I am very disturbed, however, with the legislatively imposed standard \nof 100 mrem per year to the average person in the vicinity of Yucca \nMountain. I understood that EPA and NRC have the responsibility and \nauthority to establish radiation dose limits and standards. I certainly \nwould not substitute my limited knowledge on the effects of exposure to \nradioactive materials, for that of the EPA and NRC. I doubt if there \nare any others in this Chamber who would be qualified to do that, \neither. We should leave it to the experts, at EPA and NRC, as well as \nto the public, instead of imposing an arbitrary standard of our own. It \nis claimed that EPA and NRC have veto rights in this bill. However, the \nbill's wording is such, that instead of giving the agencies the \nresponsibility for establishing a standard, they are required to adhere \nto our standard, unless they determine that our standard constitutes an \n``unreasonable risk to health and safety.'' What constitutes \n``unreasonable risk''? How will EPA or NRC determine what is \n``reasonable'' and what isn't in terms of risk? That is a subjective \njudgment, and it is an invitation to extensive litigation on that \njudgment. At the same time, the bill limits judicial review of \nrulemaking based on the 100 mrem standard.\n\n  I am also concerned that our limit is significantly higher than \nlimits imposed for other nuclear activities. Why is this so? Is it \nbecause someone has been told that we can't design a repository to \ntougher standards? Is this what health and safety regulation has come \nto? Don't set a standard that the National Academy of Sciences suggests \nyou should set--their report suggests a much lower number than 100 \nmrem/yr. for exposure--instead let's pick one that the engineers say \nthey can easily meet today--despite the fact that the repository will \nbe around, maybe, for thousands of years.\n  I understand that there is disagreement among scientists about the \neffects of low-level radiation. The EPA sets a limit of 25 mrem, and \nthe NRC has historically set 25 mrem around nuclear power plants. \nInternational standards setting bodies have also allowed dose limits \nfor waste storage of 15 to 25 percent of the 100 mrem total limit.\n  The EPA has also opposed the legislatively mandated limit, in letters \nto Senate Committees and individual Senators. I have also been informed \nthat EPA is going to issue their dose limits in the very near future. \n[Draft within a month.] I want to know what they say in this regard \nbefore I set a congressionally imposed limit, which may or may not meet \nour best scientific judgment.\n  Beyond this, Mr. President, the philosophy behind this bill is one \nthat is seriously questionable. The bill presumes that a permanent deep \ngeologic burial site of nuclear waste is the most suitable solution to \nthe waste problem and then sets up a structure that will inevitably \nlead to pressures to make the interim site the site of the permanent \nfacility, and with legislated safety standards for the permanent \nrepository.\n  I simply do not believe that we now have the technology or \nengineering knowledge to credibly design and construct a permanent \nrepository that can meet acceptable safety standards for tens of \nthousands of years. If we did have this ability and understanding, then \nit would not be necessary to contort our environmental laws and \nregulatory oversight as this bill does. Until we get closer to being \nable to design and construct a repository with appropriate safety \nstandards, there is no reason why we cannot continue to have monitored \nretrievable surface storage of these dangerous materials. The level of \nrisk is not greater than that posed by the construction of a central \ninterim facility requiring continuing transportation of radioactive \nmaterials from all over the country. Accordingly, Mr. President, I am \nopposed to the passage of this bill.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nexplain my opposition to S. 1936. We can, and we must, seek a \nresponsible and permanent solution to the important problem of high-\nlevel nuclear waste storage. In that light, I have supported, and will \ncontinue to support, a permanent geologic repository. What I do not \nsupport is designating the location of an interim storage site before \nwe have determined the viability of the Yucca Mountain permanent \nrepository. I have three major objections to that policy.\n  First, it exerts a growing pressure to name Yucca Mountain as a \npermanent repository. The pressure to move nuclear waste to Yucca \nMountain continues to increase. The premature decision to authorize the \nstorage of tens of thousands of metric tons of nuclear waste at the \nsite only adds to the pressure to push blindly down this course. The \nAmerican people need to be confident that the final decisions regarding \nthe permanent repository are based on sound science and not political \nexpediency. The American people deserve a credible, deliberative \npolicymaking process. They must have faith that the location of the \npermanent repository is based on a fair and balanced consideration of \nenvironmental, health and safety issues. Mandating the location of a \ninterim site at this time undermines the public confidence in this \nprocess.\n  My second concern is that the interim site may become the de facto \npermanent site. If for either scientific or political reasons, the work \non the construction of the permanent repository stops, who will be \nmotivated to move the waste from temporary storage in Nevada to a \npermanent repository in another State? The nuclear waste at the interim \nsite will, at that point, be of concern to very few. Those who were \nresponsible for generating that waste will have no moral, legal, or \nfinancial responsibility for that waste. I submit that the policy \noptions available at that time will be rather limited.\n  This brings me to my third, and most important, concern. If, despite \nthe inertia at work, another site for a permanent repository were \nnamed, it would set up an unacceptable situation. We would have moved \nthe waste from Yucca Mountain to another, yet to be named, location. \nNebraska is a major corridor to Yucca Mountain. Under no circumstances \nwill I vote for a bill that sets up the possibility of the Nation's \nnuclear waste passing though my State twice. Simply stated, it is \nunnecessary to subject the public to the risk and expense of \ntransporting this waste twice.\n  That summarizes the irony of S. 1936, regardless of what the final \ndeposition of the permanent repository at Yucca Mountain, we have \nerrored. If Yucca Mountain is found to be a viable location, we have \nunnecessarily undermined the credibility of the scientific studies. If \nYucca Mountain is not a viable site, we are given a no-win situation. \nWe either allow the interim site to become the de facto permanent site \nor we once again move high-level nuclear waste to another location.\n  Why does the Senate chose this road with no winning outcomes? Are we \nreacting to a crisis that does not exist? For years the operators of \ncommercial nuclear power plants have stated that on-site storage was \nsafe. All evidence supports this position, and I believe them. Current \non-site storage is not a permanent solution, but by the same token, it \ndoes not present a crisis.\n  The alternative to the no-win course outlined in S. 1936 is quite \nsimple. We wait until the completion of the viability study at Yucca \nMountain in 1998. At that time we can consider the policy options \navailable based on sound\n\n[[Page S9244]]\n\nscience and hard evidence. We will not have locked ourselves into \nnarrow policy options or have undermined the credibility of the process \nthrough premature decision making. The geologic repository will be \ndesigned to store high-level nuclear waste for 10,000 years. Yet, this \nbody can not wait 2 years to base public policy decisions on sound \nscience and a credible process.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I intend to support S. 1936, as amended. \nHowever, I would also like to express my reservations about portions of \nthis bill.\n  I supported cloture and I appreciate my colleagues from Nevada \nagreeing to allow this bill to move forward. It is critical that we \nproceed with the business we have to complete prior to adjournment; \nnamely, 13 appropriations bills. I hold no grudges against my sincere \ncolleagues from Nevada for their use of Senate rules to delay this \nbill. Were I in their shoes, I too would likely use every parliamentary \ndevice available to me to prevent enactment of this bill.\n  It is because I do not want to be in their shoes that I support this \nbill. I, and many of my constituents, are concerned that there may be a \nrenewed effort to place either an interim or a permanent nuclear waste \nrepository in Washington, at Hanford, adjacent to the Columbia River. \nAs many who have dealt with this issue over the years know, Hanford, a \nTexas site, and Yucca Mountain were the winners in the permanent \nrepository selection process. So, for the health of my constituents, I \nsupport development of Yucca Mountain.\n  Conversely, it is also that fear for my constituents that makes me \nmost nervous about S. 1936. While I appreciate the improvements made \nabout Environmental Protection Agency authority regarding radiation \nrelease and exposure standards, I am worried about the bill's easing of \nsome environmental and health standards. It is not unlikely that \nsomeday we in Washington may have the rest of the Nation decide that \nHanford radiation standards could be lessened in order to foist some \nnew batch of nuclear waste upon us. So, I am leery of such provisions \nin this bill and am pleased that the authors continue to make \nimprovements.\n  I also am frustrated that the U.S. Government has made a commitment \nto some of its citizens, to ratepayers, to the nuclear industry, to \nstore nuclear waste by 1998. Maybe we should not have made such a \ncommitment or collected fees to follow through on that commitment. But \nwe did. It is time to act on that commitment--even if it means so doing \nwith this imperfect vehicle.\n  Mr. President, this is a very difficult issue for me. I care about my \nState, I care about the ratepayers' money being spent on this never-\nending project to get nuclear waste in a permanent geologic repository, \nI care about the health of all people, including Nevadans, and I care \nabout fairness. I agree with many of the arguments made by my \ncolleagues, Senators Bryan and Reid. Therefore, I will support any \namendments that address my concerns. In the end though, I will support \nS. 1936 in its final form.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, on balance, I support S. 1936. It \nis not a perfect bill, but it is a reasonable bill, and I do not \nbelieve that the United States can afford further, indefinite delays.\n  The decision before the Senate is, in part, about the suitability of \nYucca Mountain, the risks associated with the transportation of spent \nnuclear fuel, and the legacy of spent nuclear fuel created by our \nnuclear industry.\n  The issues that flow from a decision to open an interim facility near \nYucca Mountain, however, are as important as the site decision itself. \nMy own State of Illinois, with 13 reactors, has more nuclear plants \nthan any other State. For 36 years, waste has been building up, and the \nvolume continues to grow. With our excellent network of highways and \nrailways, Illinois also faces issues associated with interstate \nshipments of spent fuel destined for a permanent repository.\n  There will never be a perfect disposal site for spent nuclear fuel. \nThe fuel is dangerously radioactive, and remains so for hundreds of \nthousands of years. Whether it is placed in deep geologic storage, sunk \nbeneath the ocean, drilled far into the earth, or shot it into space, \nevery approach poses risks to humans and the environment, and none will \never completely eliminate the dangers of this substance.\n  Without a perfect solution, however, we are forced to choose the next \nbest option: A location where the waste will have the least potential \nadverse impact on human health. Ideally, such a site is in an \nunpopulated area, away from threats to underground water, away from \nanimal habitats, and in a place where it poses the least environmental \nrisk and where we are assured of maximum security protection.\n  Illinois, home to over 11 million people, is not such a site. Yet, \nover 5,000 tons of spent fuel are housed at temporary locations \nscattered throughout my State. Most of these locations are in northern \nIllinois, near great concentrations of people. The fuel rods are stored \nin underwater pools, a method never meant to be permanent. While the \npools pose no imminent risk, and will likely remain safe for the \nforeseeable future, they do not ensure complete safety, maximum \nsecurity, or long-term protection of the environment. And the volume of \nwaste at these sites will continue to accumulate as spent fuel is \nremoved from nuclear plants.\n  For Illinois, there are no perfect answers, there are only options, \nand each option has its problems. If a Western waste disposal site is \nopened, Illinois, because of its key role in our national \ntransportation system, faces a future of literally thousands of \nshipments of nuclear waste across the State. The other alternative is \neven less palatable--keeping large amounts of deadly waste at Illinois \nnuclear power plans for perhaps 100 years and beyond, in facilities \nnever designed for long-term safety and security, located too close to \npeople, too close to groundwater, and quite frankly, too close for \ncomfort.\n\n  My conclusion is that spent nuclear fuel cannot remain in Illinois. \nIllinois is not suitable for the medium and long-term storage of \nnuclear waste, and should not have to risk inadvertently becoming a de \nfacto permanent site because Congress fails to act.\n  Congress has debated this issue for 14 years. Illinois ratepayers \nhave paid more than $1.5 billion to help finance the construction of a \npermanent disposal site in Yucca Mountain. Despite the billions \nreceived, the Federal Government has made little progress, and Yucca \nMountain is not expected to open until 2010 or later. Meanwhile, space \nruns out in Illinois beginning in 2001. If Congress fails to act, \nutilities will be required to build additional storage space at reactor \nsites, and ratepayers will foot the bill, essentially paying twice for \nthe storage of this waste.\n  I am concerned about transportation. While I have been assured by the \ncity of Chicago and the Illinois Department of Nuclear Safety, both of \nwhich have excellent hazardous waste transportation programs, that \nspent fuel shipments pose no risk to the general public, we must remain \nas vigilant as possible on this issue.\n  These fuel shipments must be handled in a manner that meets the \nhighest safety standards and does not put Illinoisans or other \nAmericans at risk. That's why I offered an amendment to this bill that \nwould hold the Department of Energy and the Department of \nTransportation accountable for these shipments, and directs the \nDepartment of Energy to select routes that avoid heavily populated \nareas and environmentally sensitive areas. I thank the chairman and \nranking member of the committee for accepting these amendments. I do \nbelieve, however, that more should be done to further improve \ntransportation safety, and I hope Congress will revisit this issue in \nthe very near future.\n  It is worth remembering that if this bill is enacted this year, there \nwill be no immediate cross-country exodus of spent fuel. The Nuclear \nWaste Technical Review Board recognizes that ``even if passed into law \nnow, none of the proposals before Congress would enable the operations \nof a centralized facility before 2002.'' Additionally, the process of \nlicensing and developing a large interim facility, and the \ntransportation infrastrucutre that goes with it, has been estimated to \ntake 5 to 7 years. Furthermore, it is not expected that the Department \nof Energy will meet several deadlines in this bill.\n\n[[Page S9245]]\n\n  Even if S. 1936 is promptly enacted, spent fuel will remain where it \nis for quite some time. Each decade of delay, however, adds 20,000 \nmetric tons to storage capacity. Beyond 2020, nearly 85,000 metric tons \nof spent fuel will have been generated. And that is exactly why the \nNuclear Waste Techical Review Board recommends that action must begin \nnow on a Federal facility, so that full scale operations can begin by \n2010 when reactors begin shutting down in large numbers.\n  Mr. President, this debate is not about whether nuclear power should \never have been pursued as an energy option. That has long since been \ndecided. We cannot wave the magic wand, nor turn back the clock. \nNuclear power is here, and nuclear waste must be dealt with.\n  Our decision on dealing with nuclear waste will never be perfect, \nbecause it cannot be perfect. But, it is a decision that must be made. \nIf we fail to act, Congress will send a message to the American people \nthat the nuclear waste problems created by our generation are best \nresolved, and best financed, by our children and our grandchildren. \nThat is neither right, nor fair, and that is why I am voting in favor \nof S 1936. I urge my colleagues to do likewise.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Waste and the Budget\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to congratulate \nthe senior senator from Idaho, the chairman and ranking minority member \nof the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the majority \nleader on this bill. All of these Senators deserve a great deal of \ncredit for getting this controversial bill pulled together and \nscheduled for Senate action in a year when the calendar is working \nagainst us. I also want to congratulate the Senators from Nevada. This \nis a difficult issue. I may disagree with them, but I respect the \neffort and vigor they have put into their opposition to this bill.\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act required electric utilities to contract \nwith the Department of Energy to take title and ultimately dispose of \nnuclear waste generated by these utilities in exchange for a fee on \nnuclear-generated electricity. The Department of Energy's view is that \nthey do not have obligation to take this waste until the development of \nan operational interim storage facility or a permanent repository.\n  The Clinton administration has shown incredible bad faith on its part \nto honor these contracts. While the administration has argued that \nthere is no obligation to take the waste in 1998, it continues to \ncollect fees from electric utilities pursuant to its contracts with \nthese utilities. The Clinton administration has threatened to veto \nlegislation, last year during consideration of the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Appropriations bill and this year during consideration of \nthis legislation, providing an interim storage facility that would \nprovide DOE with the means to meets its contractual responsibilities \nwhile a permanent repository is being developed. Although the \nadministration has professed support for development of a permanent \nrepository, the President has not provided the leadership necessary to \ngain the funding or the changes in the law that will be necessary to \nensure an operational disposal facility will be developed. For example, \nin his most recent budget request, the President proposed to reduce \nspending for the nuclear waste program over the next 6 years.\n  When DOE indicated it would not accept responsibility for the \nutilities' nuclear waste in 1998, the electric utility industry took \nthem to court. The United States Federal Court of Appeals for the D.C. \nCircuit recently sided with the utilities on the question of the \nFederal Government's obligation and concluded that the Federal \nGovernment has an obligation to accept title for this waste in 1998 \nthat is reciprocal to the utilities' obligation to pay. The court \nclearly rejected DOE's argument that its obligation was contingent on \nthe development of an interim or permanent repository.\n  S. 1936 will allow the Federal Government to honor that commitment. \nIt provides for an interim storage facility to meet the Federal \nGovernment's commitment to take this waste and sets forth a process \nthat will allow the Federal Government to study, evaluate, and develop \na safe and environmentally-sound permanent repository for nuclear \nwaste.\n  Earlier versions of this legislation included provisions that would \nhave violated the Budget Act. Senators Craig, Murkowski, and Johnston \nhave written a bill that does not violate the Budget Act. It is fully \npaid for over the 10-year period as required by the Act. The bill, \nhowever, will result in a $600 million annual increase in direct \nspending and the deficit beginning in 2003. This direct spending would \nbe available to fund program management, interim storage, \ntransportation, and development of a permanent repository. It pays for \nthis increased spending over the 10-year period by accelerating the \npayment of fees by electric utilities. Although the bill does not \ntechnically violate the pay-as-you-go rule over the 10-year period, it \nmeets this requirement by shifting future payments by utilities into \nthe 10-year budget window.\n\n  This bill provides direct spending authority that will be available \nto fund all aspects of the nuclear waste disposal program. I understand \nthe very strong arguments for this spending authority, but as Budget \nCommittee chairman I am constantly confronted with very compelling \narguments on why we should increase spending for numerous programs.\n  In this instance, particularly considering the Appeals Court's \ndecision, clearly the Federal Government has an obligation to take \ntitle to this waste in 1998. DOE's argument was that it had no \nobligation because no disposal facility was available. The Court \ndiscarded this view and interpreted disposal to be a very broad term \nthat included temporary storage of nuclear waste.\n  Viewing the tremendous effort that went into getting an agreement for \nconsideration of this bill, I decided not to pursue an amendment that \nwould have limited the increase in direct spending to what is needed to \ndevelop an interim storage facility. If this legislation is not \nenacted, I intend to pursue modifications to this legislation to limit \nthe increase in direct spending to what is necessary to provide for the \ninterim storage of this waste. I think a very strong case can be made \nthat the Government has a binding contractual obligation to provide for \nthe interim storage of this waste and that is clearly supported by the \ncourt's opinion.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I oppose the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct, and I would like to share some of my reasons with my colleagues.\n  First, the Senate should not be ramming through a bill to designate \nan interim storage site just when a comprehensive, sophisticated \nprocess is well underway to come up with a permanent site or solution. \nThis legislation basically says the Senate knows better--it says the \nSenate should take the place of scientists and experts, choosing Nevada \nas the so-called interim site and presumably paving the way for the \nsame location to be used forever.\n  I do not think this is the time whatsoever for the Senate to make \nthis decision--it's a misuse of power, it contradicts other policies \nthat Congress has put on the books, and it could trigger all kinds of \nunfortunate consequences, including the possibility of a very serious \naccident.\n  This bill, S. 1936, violates current law, the 1987 Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act amendments. Under the 1987 law, DOE is not allowed to begin \nconstruction of an interim storage facility until the NRC has granted a \nconstruction license for the permanent site. Also, that law stated that \nno more than 10,000 metric tons of waste could be stored at the interim \nsite before the permanent site began operating, and no more than 15,000 \nmetric tons after that. But S. 1936 authorizes an interim site storage \ncapacity far greater than either of these levels--40,000 metric tons \nafter phase two, which will be increased to 60,000 metric tons if Yucca \nMountain falls behind schedule.\n  In 1987, Congress was saying that it would be unwise to ship nuclear \nwaste across the country to a temporary above-ground storage site until \na permanent site gets built. The same is true now. It still isn't \nsmart. But, under this bill, the waste would be shipped to the Nevada \ninterim storage site anyway, before the studies have been completed to \ncertify whether or not Yucca Mountain is the place to be a permanent \nrepository of nuclear waste.\n\n[[Page S9246]]\n\n  Some say this isn't true, that there is a safeguard in the bill. But, \nwhile the bill requires DOE to stop construction on the interim site if \nthe President determines that Yucca Mountain is unsuitable as the \npermanent repository, there's a catch. If Yucca Mountain isn't found \nsuitable, the bill will require that the interim site be built in \nNevada anyway unless the President picks an alternative site within 18 \nmonths. This alternate site must then also be approved by Congress \nwithin 2 years after that. Leaving aside the idea that we should \ndesignate nuclear waste sites on objective criteria rather than strict \ntimetables, does anybody believe another site will be found in 18 \nmonths? Or that Congress will approve another site 2 years after that? \nI'm not betting on it.\n\n  Why all this pressure to act on the bill before us, S. 1936? From \neverything I have seen, there is no overwhelming case, for safety or \nrelated reasons, to force the transportation and placement of this \nwaste into an interim site. The nonpartisan Nuclear Waste Technical \nReview Board issued a report saying that there is no compelling \ntechnical or safety reason to move spent fuel to a centralized facility \nfor the next few years. And the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has said \nthat the waste could safely remain at the current sites for far longer \nthan that in dry cask storage facilities. In short, this waste doesn't \nhave to be moved now.\n  In fact, it is even conceivable that science may ultimately lead to \nthe rejection of a single repository, because of the dangers of \ntransporting waste and progress being made in developing alternatives. \nThe Senate should not be intervening, singling out Nevada, and short-\ncircuiting what could be a safer, sounder, and less costly solution.\n  And there are a number of safety concerns that argue against this \nbill. Experts have raised concerns about the radiation exposure \nstandard in this bill, and I think we should question the preemption of \nseveral key environmental laws, such as the Clean Water Act and the \nNational Environmental Policy Act.\n  Transportation of this waste also is a major concern, and reason \nenough to reject this legislation. If the plan in this bill goes \nforward, we will see the transport of up to 60,000 tons of nuclear \nwaste by road and rail from nuclear facilities around the Nation to \nthis interim storage site. These mobile nuclear waste sites will travel \nthrough West Virginia and 42 other States. I have been told that 50 \nmillion people live within 1 mile of the proposed transportation routes \nthat would be used.\n  In West Virginia, we have no nuclear facilities. We have no spent \nfuel. We have no nuclear waste. And we have no storage problem. But, \nunder this bill, West Virginians will have nuclear waste being shipped \nthrough the State. I do not want to be alarmist, but I do have concerns \nthat West Virginia and the other 42 States have not had adequate time \nto develop the necessary transportation safety plans, and are not ready \nto handle the possible accidents that may occur. I don't know how many \nof my colleagues have spent time in southern West Virginia, but the \nmountains and roads there will not be friendly to rescue efforts if one \nof these trains goes off the tracks. Under this bill, the zeal of some \nto force this premature interim storage facility into Nevada may raise \nrisks for protecting the people and the environment in places like West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. President, this is an unnecessary bill that forces Nevada to \nprematurely take the Nation's nuclear waste and become America's so-\ncalled interim storage site. It looks like a set-up to becoming the \npermanent storage facility, not as a result of the promised objective \nand scientific process, but as a result of political pressure and an \neagerness to dump a problem onto a lone State. It uses a radiation \nexposure standard that looks questionable and undermines environmental \nlaws in ways that could be dangerous. It threatens to expose millions \nof Americans to the risks of transporting and storing this waste.\n  The Senate has no business passing this bill. The President has made \nit clear he will veto the bill, wisely insisting on the completion of \nthe kind of process that should be used to make decisions as monumental \nas where, when, and how to transport and locate nuclear waste. The \nSenate should defer to that process as well, and resist this idea of \nsingling out one State in such an insensitive and heavy-handed manner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I wonder if my colleague from Alaska and \nmy colleagues from Nevada will listen to a question, which is, as I \nunderstand it, the plan now is to go to third reading immediately and \nvote on final passage at 4:55?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in response to my colleague from \nLouisiana, that is the plan that has been agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding there will be general debate until \nthat time, that we each have an amendment left, and it is my \nunderstanding neither the proponents of the legislation nor the \nopponents of the legislation are going to offer the last amendments \nthey have in order, and that the time will be evenly divided between \nnow and 4:55 for general debate on the legislation.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is my understanding, Mr. President.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I wonder if we can advance that by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. President, if it is in order and agreeable with my colleague from \nAlaska, I ask unanimous consent that we move immediately to third \nreading, and that the time between now and 4:55 for final passage be \nequally divided between the Senator from Alaska and the senior Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wonder if I may have the Chair \nidentify the time that will be divided on either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 30 minutes; the \nSenator from Nevada 31 minutes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. I did not hear \nthe inquiry of the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senate will come \nto order. I ask that all audible conversations be removed to the \nCloakroom.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as I understand it--I was distracted as \nwell--we have about 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has just over 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. I inquire among Senators on this \nside as to how much time they need. I think the Senator from Wyoming \nrequests time. How much time does he need?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I think 5 to 7 minutes will be quite \nadequate.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Idaho, I know, is going to request \ntime, 10 or 15. The Senator from Louisiana. I am going to yield myself \n5 minutes at this time, and I will attempt to accommodate--why don't I \njust go ahead with the Senator from Wyoming now and allot him 5 \nminutes. I yield 5 minutes to my good friend, the Senator from Wyoming, \nwho, unfortunately, will be departing this body at some point in time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I do richly commend my friend, Senator \nMurkowski. I have watched him doggedly work in this area. There are \nmany who have done so much in this area over the years: Senator \nJohnston from Louisiana; I was involved with it as chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Nuclear Regulations; Senator Gary Hart, and back \nthrough the years.\n  The problem with nuclear waste storage is a most serious and complex \none. I cannot tell you how tired I am of the people on both sides who \nare extremists in the area; those who are the ``Hell, no, we won't \nglow'' group and the ``nobody's ever been killed'' group.\n\n[[Page S9247]]\n\n Somewhere between those two groups is sanity.\n  I think we are finally on the track of doing something sensible. The \nmere mention of nuclear waste sends shivers up the spine of many \npeople. I discovered that when I came to the Senate and joined the \nNuclear Regulatory Subcommittee. That is what happens when one utters, \n``All right, I'll take an assignment no one else wants.'' I did that a \ncouple of times, and I got Immigration and Nuclear Regulations and \nVeterans Affairs, so cursed with business three times in some ways. I \nhave enjoyed those issues, but they are filled with emotion, fear, \nguilt and racism, all three of them.\n  So here we have this entire issue that has been a continuing victim \nof gross misinformation, reprehensible scare tactics, particularly in \nthe 17 years since Three Mile Island, and certainly people deserve to \nknow more of exactly what we are dealing with.\n  The waste products resulting from many good and beneficial uses of \nnuclear elements are not just going to go away. It is a little late for \nprotesters just to run around the streets with signs saying, ``Don't \nput it here, don't put it there.''\n  Wastes of varying levels of activities are piling up at thousands of \nsites across this country from sources like universities, nuclear \npowerplants, vital medical procedures conducted at hospitals and even \ndismantled Soviet missiles. Much of this waste is sitting--sitting--in \nor near highly populated areas which face potential threats with regard \nto earthquake, tornado, and hurricanes.\n  The specific problem the bill addresses is the disposal of high-level \nnuclear waste from powerplants, the spent-fuel rods that are left over \nafter years of generating electricity. Back in 1982--incidentally, the \nsame year Cal Ripken's playing streak started--Congress passed the law. \nI was involved in that. In essence, it said we will make a deal with \nthe nuclear power consumers in this country. We said the Federal \nGovernment would provide a place for storing the spent-fuel rods, but \nthe consumers had to pay for it.\n  Since that law has passed, those fees, plus interest, have provided \n$11 billion; $6 billion has already been spent, some of it for \nunrelated purposes, and still construction of the disposal site has not \neven started.\n  We are running out of time. No more time for placards, no more time \nfor running through the streets, no more time for standing out on the \nhighway, because here is where we are: There are 109 active commercial \npowerplants in 35 States providing 20 percent of the country's \nelectricity. For the most part, the spent-fuel rods produced in those \nfacilities are there on site in pools under 30 feet of demineralized \nwater. If the water were to drain away for any reason because of some \nstructural defect from natural disaster, the rods would reheat and \neventually melt down. These pools were never designed for long-term \nstorage. Yet, because of the strength of the political opposition to a \npermanent site--I can understand all the reasons--we run the risk of \njeopardizing the health of millions of Americans. A typical nuclear \npowerplant produces 30 tons of spent fuel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator that his 5 \nminutes have expired.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I ask for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will proceed.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. A typical nuclear powerplant produces 30 tons of spent \nfuel every year. Right now more than 30,000 metric tons of spent fuel \nare being stored at 75 sites across this country. And 23 reactors will \nrun out of room in their storage pools by 1998. By 2010, a total of 78 \nreactors will be out of storage space for their spent fuel and have \nabout 45,000 tons of metric tons of spent fuel.\n  It is very important we get the waste out of these inappropriate and \nunsafe locations into a technologically sound, permanent storage site. \nIt is also very important for every person in this country to realize \nthat it is perfectly possible and technically feasible to transport and \nstore this waste with very little risk to human health or the \nenvironment.\n  I point out the Department of Energy has been transporting nuclear \nwaste from the weapons facilities under its jurisdictions for 30 years \nwithout a single incident of environmental or human harm.\n  It is crucial to get on with the business and get on with the work of \nan efficient and safe system for civilian nuclear waste before the \nrisks we have been dodging with our current haphazard setups catch up \nwith us.\n  I applaud the work of Senators Murkowski and Craig and Johnston, \ntheir bipartisan effort through the years. They have a realistic piece \nof legislation which finally allows the Federal Government to live up \nto its commitment to provide a safe, secure, and centralized location \nfor the storage of the most radioactive of the nuclear waste. It also \nprovides the money and Federal assistance for training State and local \npersonnel in safety and emergency procedures. It is a very important \nbill and a good compromise, and good work all around. I am very pleased \nto support it and encourage my colleagues to do the same. I thank very \nmuch the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I believe the other side wants to \nspeak. I retain the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Frahm). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Madam President, how much time remains under the control \nof the Senator from Nevada?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. I, at this point, will allocate myself \n10 minutes of that time and ask the Chair to inform me when I have used \nthat.\n  Madam President, it has been a number of weeks we have been \ndiscussing the high-level nuclear waste issue. And I think it is time \nto put this into some perspective.\n  In 1980, some 16 years ago, debate on the floor of the Senate \nindicated that there was a great urgency and immediacy to take action, \nthat there was a crisis, that indeed, if nothing were done, if we did \nnot get the interim storage, what was called MRS storage, nuclear \nreactors around the country would have to shut down by 1983.\n  I offer that interesting piece of history as a footnote because the \ndebate today is in almost identical respect the same debate that \noccurred this very week on July 28, 1980. This is a contrived and \nfabricated crisis.\n  Let me begin by pointing out what the Nuclear Waste Technical Review \nBoard--this is a board that was created by act of Congress in 1987. And \nthe Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board has concluded that there is no \nneed for interim storage at this time. And that is a conclusion which \nthey have endorsed. Anyone who has any question about it, this is the \ndocument. So all of this debate is at best premature and in our view \ntotally unnecessary.\n\n  When you look at the substance of the legislation, what is occurring \nis an absolute travesty. The major environmental provisions that \nprotected Americans with bipartisan support for more than 2 decades are \nsimply wiped out, simply wiped out. We have just had a debate. The \nNational Environmental Policy Act, designed to apply to circumstances \nsuch as this, for all intents and purposes, has been eviscerated by the \nnuclear utilities in their zeal to get interim storage.\n  Let me just cite two specific references. Among the things that the \nEnvironmental Policy Act would ordinarily consider would be the \nenvironmental impacts of the storage of spent fuel and high-level \nradioactive waste for the period of foreseeable danger --thousands of \nyears. This piece of legislation would restrict the application of \nNEPA, the Environmental Policy Act, to the initial term of licensure of \nabout 30 years.\n  Nothing has occurred to date that would establish a design criteria \nfor such facility. Ordinarily the Environmental Policy Act would \nconsider the alternatives to the design criteria. That is now wiped \nout. NEPA cannot consider design criteria, cannot consider the \napplication for longer periods of time of health hazards. So we have a \nmajor piece of environmental legislation wiped out.\n  Preemption. The amendment offered by our friends from the other side \nhas put us in the situation in which all Federal laws that are \ninconsistent with this act are wiped out. And we have gone through a \nwhole litany of them.\n  We have the National Environmental Policy Act, FLPMA, clean air, \nclean\n\n[[Page S9248]]\n\nwater, all of those, if they are inconsistent, they do not apply. So \nforget environmental laws when it comes to siting an interim storage. \nThat is simply an outrage, Madam President, no matter how one feels \nabout nuclear energy or whether one believes there ought to be some \ntype of interim storage.\n  With respect to standards, nowhere in the world--nowhere --is a \nradioactive standard of 100 millirems established by statute--nowhere. \nAnd 100 millirems would be at least 24 times the standard for the safe \ndrinking water, would be at least six times-plus the standard set for \nthe WIPP facility. I must say, this is all laid out right here. So, 100 \nmillirems.\n  Why in God's name, for the most dangerous stuff on the face of the \nEarth, would we mandate by statute a 100-millirem standard, and then \nsay to the EPA, well, you know, if you can prove that that is unsafe, \nthen you can change it. We do not do that. I mean, if this were a \nstraight-up deal, if this were not some contrived wish list by the \nnuclear utilities, the EPA would be designated as finding a standard \nand establishing it. No other place in the world.\n  The National Academy of Sciences was asked in a piece of legislation \napproved in 1992--the energy bill--was asked to come back and make a \nreport with respect to a standard. And what they said is that the \nsafety standard, in terms of radioactive exposure--this is the \n``Technical Bases For Yucca Mountain Standards.'' This is the product \nof the National Academy of Sciences. And what they said is, it should \nbe somewhere between 10 and 30 millirems.\n\n  How can you justify it? How can you justify that? And indeed when you \nlook at the Environmental Protection Agency, here is what our \nAdministrator tells us.\n\n       S. 1936 and the substitute amendments establish a \n     Congressionally set overall performance standard of 100 \n     millirems a year to the average person in the general \n     vicinity of Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository for 1000 \n     years. Although the substitute amendments allow EPA to \n     challenge the 100 millirem a year standard, EPA believes the \n     standard is inappropriate because it is less protective than \n     other U.S. standards and international advisory board \n     recommendations for a single source. Furthermore . . . the \n     actual risk to public health and the environment will occur \n     well after 1,000 years. . . .\n\n  And the limitation that is imposed in this legislation applies only \nto 1,000 years.\n  So again, public health and safety be dammed. Anything that helps the \nnuclear utilities, that is what we are going to buy into.\n  Madam President, that is just an absolutely indefensible matter of \npublic policy. I must say that no other place in the world establishes \nsuch a standard. We are frequently cited to the international \nsanctioning bodies. And although 100 millirems is referenced in those \nstandards, never is it referenced for single source.\n  It indicates here that most other countries have endorsed the \nprinciple of apportionment of the total allowed radiation dose. So no--\nno--standards that exist in the world, to the best of our knowledge, \nwould propose 100 millirems from a single source.\n  Finally, on the standards issue, I must say, clearly what drives that \ndecision, as well as every provision in this bill, is to make it easier \nto lower public health and safety standards, to make it less costly. \nAnd the public health, and the consequences of those persons, would be \neffectively by and large ignored.\n  My colleague is going to talk a good bit about transportation, but we \nare talking about 85,000 metric tons. We are talking about 16,000 \nshipments or more, traveling across the rail corridors in America, as \nwell as our highway system, and 51 million Americans live within 1 mile \nof that. Each of those railroad casks weigh 125 tons, and the \nconsequence of the hazardous cargo in terms of radioactivity would be \nthe equivalent of 200 bombs dropped at Hiroshima. We are not just \ntalking about Nevadans at risk. If you ship it by way of cask and \nhighway cargo, you are talking about the equivalent of 40 bombs.\n  Finally, and we have tried to make this point albeit it is a \ndifficult thing to explain, in effect this is a financial bailout of \nthe nuclear power industry. Since the very enactment of the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act of 1982, its fundamental premise has been that the \nutilities are the ones that get the profit, they are the ones that \ngenerate the waste, they have the financial responsibility. Through a \nseries of significant changes, albeit somewhat subtle, a cap or a \nceiling or a limitation is placed on the amount that the utilities will \nbe required to contribute.\n  Now, to the year 2002, it is 1 mill based upon each kilowatt of power \ngenerated. After the year 2002, it will become no more than the amount \nof the appropriation each year. In 2003, we would be talking one-third \nof a mill, the balance all left to the taxpayer to pick up.\n  Madam President, I simply say, No. 1, this debate is unnecessary, \nthis bill is unnecessary, and that comes from a body of eminent \nscientists impaneled as a result of legislation enacted by this body. \nThe National Environmental Policy Act is, in effect, gutted as a \nconsequence of the restrictions placed upon it. All other Federal \nenvironmental laws are preempted. The standards that are set are so \nhigh as to constitute a clear and present danger to public health and \nsafety. The Environmental Protection Agency agrees, as do others.\n  Ultimately the taxpayer, not the utility, will pick up the bill if \nthis bill becomes law.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield 6 minutes to my friend from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, in the original form of our bill, we \nprovided for 100 millirem radioactivity limit from the repository. \nHowever, because our friends from Nevada stated the EPA should have a \nrole here, we amended that. The present bill now on third reading \nprovides, if EPA finds that the 100 millirem would not be consistent \nwith health or safety, they may set it at another level and, indeed, \nwhatever they would set under the Administrative Procedure Act would be \nfinal unless that level is arbitrary and capricious.\n  Madam President, we have provided here for the role of EPA to make \nthe health and safety determination. Why did we set it at 100 millirems \nto begin with? Because that is the level set by the International \nCommission on Radiological Protection, the National Council on \nRadiation Protection and Measurements, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, and indeed the EPA in its radiation protection guidance for \nexposure of the general public, 1994, as well as the International \nAtomic Agency.\n  Beyond that, the 100 millirems is a commonsense level because there \nis more than 100 millirems difference in the natural exposure of \nsomeone in Washington, DC, which is about 345 millirems, and Montana, \nWyoming, or Colorado, where the average exposure exceeds 450 millirems, \nso that if you live in an average place in the United States or if you \nlive in Washington, DC, you would get a higher exposure by flying to \nDenver, CO, or Butte, MT, Cody, WY, or you name it, and living there \nthan living here.\n\n  I remind my colleagues, Madam President, there has never been the \nslightest warning of EPA or of any nuclear radiation body to say it is \ndangerous to live in one of those mountain States where the millirem \nactivity per year exceeds what we provide in this bill. If EPA should \nso decide, they may set the standard elsewhere.\n  Madam President, Nevada is the right choice. Nevada is one of the \nmost remote places on Earth, Yucca Mountain. It is one of the driest \nplaces on Earth, and, Madam President, that area has been polluted by \nover 500 nuclear tests which have been not sealed off from the \nenvironment. Those nuclear tests have provided all of the radiation \nbyproducts that are contained in nuclear waste, including cesium 137, \niodine 131, strontium 90, americium 243, technicium 99, plutonium 241. \nYou name it, if it is in nuclear waste, it is contained already in the \nNevada test site.\n  Need I remind my colleagues that our two colleagues from Nevada have \nbeen steadfast in wanting not less tests but more tests at the Nevada \ntest site. Those tests have not been sealed off from the environment. \nIndeed, some of those tests have been right in the water table.\n  What is the defense of my colleague from Nevada when we say, how \ncould you on the one hand want nuclear bomb tests and on the other hand \nnot want these rods which are in canisters,\n\n[[Page S9249]]\n\nand those canisters are nonleak canisters that I believe would be valid \nand provide protection for 10,000 years? The answer is, well, they are \nonly 1 ton. I guess that is somewhere between 2,000 and, if you use a \nlong ton, 2,200 pounds of nuclear material.\n  Now, Madam President, a ton of radioactive material not sealed off \nfrom the environment is many thousands of times what you would expect \nin any leakage which might occur thousands of years from now from one \nof these containers. The containers designed to hold these nuclear \nwaste rods are designed to last hundreds and thousands of years. We \nwould imagine they would last, frankly, 10,000 years. That has not been \nproved. I do not state that as a fact. That is what we speculate. But, \ncertainly, hundreds of years without any leakage whatever. Yet the \nNevada test site now already has 1 ton of all these radioactive \nproducts which are not sealed off from the water supply, not sealed off \nfrom the ground around it, but where unprotected blasts took place in \nthe ground.\n  Madam President, if there is ever a place in the country to store the \nnuclear waste, it is adjacent to that Nevada test site. That is why, \nMadam President, the Congress chose in 1987 Yucca Mountain. That is why \nit is the right place to store this waste today.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, how much time is remaining on this \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 16 minutes, and the other side \nhas 19 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Senator from Louisiana is a brilliant \nman. He knows all the procedures here. He certainly knows basic \nmathematics. Basic mathematics indicates that 1 ton in the ground, \nspread out over a significant distance under the ground, is certainly \nmuch different than 70,000 tons stacked on top of the ground--\nsignificantly different. So we need to hear no more, I believe, about \nthe Nevada test site.\n  Madam President, S. 1936 guts the existing law of its environmental \nsafety provisions and forces the Federal Government to take \nresponsibility for the waste and liabilities of the nuclear power \nindustry. The nuclear power industry has been extremely clever in \nspending their money to generate this argument, because they recognize \nthat the nuclear power facilities don't last forever. In fact, most are \nbeing phased out right now. They want no responsibility for the garbage \nthey have generated. They want to shift the ball to the Federal \nGovernment. That is what this legislation is about. It is also about \ncorporate welfare at its very, very worst. It will needlessly expose \npeople across America to the risk of nuclear accidents.\n  S. 1936 is proposed because the nuclear industry wants to transfer \nthe risk and responsibilities and their legitimate business expenses to \nthe American taxpayer. The interim storage facility is not needed. In \naccordance with the charter of the Nuclear Waste Technical Review \nBoard, in March of this year, I repeat, it found no compelling safety \nor technical reason to accelerate the centralization of spent nuclear \nfuel. Implementation of dry cask storage at generator sites is \nfeasible, cheap, and relatively safe.\n  We have talked at great length, and will talk some more, about how \nunsafe it is to transport this product around the country. There is no \nneed to do that; it is safe where it is. It will be even safer with dry \ncask storage. If it is properly implemented--and that is fairly easy to \ndo--the investment will double its return by storing the material in \ncertified multipurpose canisters so the material is ready for shipment \nat some later time.\n  Operating costs for onsite dry cask storage, according to Mr. \nDreyfuss' office, amounts to only about $1 million per year per site. \nCapital costs for onsite storage include preparation of placement site \nand canisterization of spent fuel. Storing spent fuel in multipurpose \ncanisters means that the marginal onsite capitalization costs are only \na few million dollars. Implementing onsite storage at all sites needing \nsome additional storage space, would require less than $60 million for \ncapitalization and less than $30 million per year for their operation. \nThis is compared to the multibillions of dollars they are talking about \nfor interim storage. So onsite storage could be maintained for about 40 \nyears before equalling the construction cost of interim storage at the \ntest site, as estimated by the sponsors of this bill. There is simply \nno compelling need to rush into centralized interim storage. It is \nsimply wrong.\n  Madam President, we have talked about terrorism. We talked about it \nbecause it is something we should talk about. I referred, briefly, at \nthe end of the last amendment that was offered, to a statement that we \nreceived, without solicitation, from the Blue Ridge Environmental \nDefense League, located in North Carolina. The letter says a number of \nthings. We have admitted it into the Record. Let me refer specifically \nto some of the things contained in this extremely important \ncommunication.\n  These shipments of nuclear waste cannot be kept secret so long as we \nlive in a free society. And we do.\n\n       Our actions were peaceful--\n\n  Peaceful following around these nuclear waste shipments.\n\n       --but we proved that determined individuals on a shoestring \n     budget--\n\n  Not paid for by terrorists with huge amounts of money, because some \nterrorist groups are supported by foreign governments.\n\n       --can precisely track international and domestic shipments \n     of strategic materials. In the wake of Oklahoma City \n     and Atlanta, the dangers posed by domestic or \n     international terrorists armed with explosives make the \n     transport of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel too \n     dangerous to contemplate for the foreseeable future.\n\n  They go on to say that their work is in North Carolina, Tennessee, \nand Virginia. They have determined that the emergency management \npersonnel in these areas are dedicated volunteers, but they are \nunprepared for nuclear waste.\n\n       Volunteer fire departments in rural counties are very good \n     at putting out house fires and brush fires--\n\n  And the person writing this letter knows that because he has worked \nin these volunteer fire departments. They say, among other things:\n\n       The remote river valleys and steep grades of Appalachia are \n     legendary. In Saluda, North Carolina, the steepest standard \n     gauge mainline railroad grade in the United States drops 253 \n     feet per mile, 4.8 percent grade. The CSX and Norfolk \n     Southern Lines trace the French Broad River Valley and the \n     Nolchucky Gorge west through the Appalachian Mountains along \n     remote stretches of rivers famous among whitewater rafters \n     for their steep drops and their distance from civilization. \n     The Norfolk Southern Railroad crosses the French Broad River \n     at Deep Water Bridge where the mountains rise 2,200 feet \n     above the river. These are the transport routes through \n     western North Carolina that will be used for high-level \n     nuclear waste as soon as 1998 according to S. 1936.\n\n  They say:\n\n       When we asked [the emergency response teams in North \n     Carolina about their readiness to respond to a nuclear \n     transport accident, they answered professionally, saying, \n     ``We'll just go out there and keep people away until State or \n     Federal officials arrive.''\n\n  Well, another western North Carolina coordinator said:\n\n       There is no response team anywhere in this part of the \n     State, and, for the foreseeable future, there is no money in \n     local budgets to equip us with any first response to \n     radioactive spills.\n\n  In closing, Louis Zeller tells us:\n\n       I am asking you to oppose this expensive and dangerous \n     legislation which would place an unfair and unnecessary \n     financial burden on communities and which would place at risk \n     the health and safety of millions of American citizens.\n\n  Madam President, this legislation is unnecessary. It opens the doors \nto added terrorism, and it only further frightens our communities. \nMadam President, the President of the United States and others in the \nFederal Government have stated they oppose this legislation. We have a \nletter from the Director of the Department of Energy, a Cabinet-level \nofficer. She should know about nuclear waste; she worked in the nuclear \nindustry previously. She says, without equivocation, that this is bad \nlegislation. ``The bill does not solve,'' she says, ``a fundamental \nproblem posed by the Indiana-Michigan Power Company case, namely, that \nthe Department must begin to dispose of nuclear waste. Instead, the \nbill threatens to repeat the same mistakes made in the past.'' She goes \non to say other things, but basically that this is bad legislation.\n  Hazel O'Leary and I have not always been on the same side of the \ndebates.\n\n[[Page S9250]]\n\n She is someone who is head of the Department of Energy, a Cabinet-\nlevel officer, formerly in the nuclear industry, and she says this is \nbad legislation. Also, our head of the department that oversees \nenvironmental laws, Carol Browner, has written a letter dated last \nnight saying, ``I am writing to inform you that the Environmental \nProtection Agency opposes this legislation, S. 1936, and all the \namendments. S. 1936 and the substitute amendment are a concern to the \nEPA because they limit consideration of public health and environmental \nstandards in order to expedite the repository's opening. EPA is also \nconcerned about the preemption. It takes away Federal laws.''\n  Madam President, this legislation is a travesty. It has big bucks \nbehind it. We have not had the opportunity to have people in chauffeur-\ndriven limousines come and lobby Members of the Senate. We have not had \nthe opportunity to have people stand in the halls and lobby against \nthis legislation. We have a grassroots organization, like the people \nfrom the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League, who stand up for what \nis right in this country.\n  What is right in this country is to oppose this legislation. It would \ncurtail a broad range of health and safety laws, it would quadruple the \nallowable radiation standards for waste storage, and it would \nexacerbate the risk of transporting nuclear waste throughout the \ncountry. For these and many other reasons, I call upon my colleagues--I \nbeg my colleagues--to vote against this legislation. It is the most \nantienvironmental legislation in this Congress, and to say that, you \nsay it all.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is our understanding that we have 16 minutes.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nS. 1936, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, and to congratulate my \ncolleagues Senator Frank Murkowski, chairman of the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources, and Senator Larry Craig, vice-chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Energy Research and Development, for all their hard \nwork on this bill. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, I have a particular interest in the transportation \naspect of this legislation. Clearly, we will need a special \ntransportation system to safely transfer nuclear waste to a centralized \nstorage facility as mandated by S. 1936.\n  Already, there are some tough laws in place. Shipments of spent \nnuclear fuel and other commercial or defense-related high level \nradioactive waste must adhere to very strict standards before the waste \ncan move on America's highways or railroads. S. 1936 will strengthen \nthese standards.\n  It's important to point out that under the current regulation \nmonitoring process, the Federal Government and the nuclear industry \nhave transported thousands of shipments of nuclear waste without any \nrelease of radioactive material. That's an impeccable safety record. \nThis legislation takes additional steps to maintain an already safe \nenvironment for the transportation and storage of spent nuclear fuel.\n  Let me set the record straight even further. As part of the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act, the Department of Energy promised to begin \ntransporting commercial spent fuel to a Federal management facility in \n1998. To solidify this promise, contracts were signed between the \nFederal Government and utilities that own the Nation's nuclear power \nplants. S. 1936 reaffirms that commitment.\n  S. 1936 would not weaken current law--it improves it. Spent fuel \nshipments would still be regulated by the Hazardous Materials \nTransportation Act and other transportation regulations that have \nprotected us for the past 30 years.\n  To ensure safety in every step of the transportation network, the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission [NRC] already has established demanding \nregulations on the packaging and transportation of radioactive \nmaterials.\n  Spent nuclear fuel rods are transported in heavy steel containers. \nBefore these can be approved by the NRC, manufacturers must demonstrate \nthat each container design can withstand a number of hypothetical \naccident conditions, including being dropped from 30 feet onto a flat, \nunyielding surface; falling onto a vertical steel spike; being engulfed \nin a 1,475 degree Fahrenheit fire for 30 minutes; and being submerged \nunder 3 feet of water for 8 hours. The same container also must \nwithstand a separate immersion test in 50 feet of water for 8 hours.\n  Mr. President, I challenge any other transportation container to \nmeasure up to these rigorous tests. Again, these are the tests required \nunder existing law. The containers that meet these tests are some of \nthe most rugged on Earth, and rightfully so.\n  The Department of Transportation also has responsibility for \nregulating many aspects of radioactive waste shipments. Shippers are \nrequired to file a written route plan that includes the origin and \ndestination of each shipment, preapproved routes to be used, estimated \narrival times and emergency telephone numbers in each State a shipment \nwill enter. The principal intent of DOT routing guidelines is to reduce \nthe time in transit.\n  The agency requires tractor-trailer shipments to use preferred \nhighway routes, such as interstate highways and bypasses that divert \nthem away from highly populated areas. States also may propose \nalternate routes to the interstate highway system. In fact, at least 10 \nStates already have established alternate routes. Potentially affected \nStates and localities must be consulted in the process of designating \nalternate routes.\n  The Transportation Department also requires that shippers notify the \nGovernor 7 days in advance of material being transported through the \nState. To ensure the safety of these shipments, the Department of \nEnergy has developed a satellite-based system that allows continuous \ntracking and communications with all DOE shipments.\n  Mr. President, recent shipments of foreign research reactor fuel from \nSunny Point, NC to the Savannah River site in South Carolina provide a \nperfect example of the safeguards which are in place for spent fuel \ntransportation. In moving this fuel, the Energy Department worked \nclosely with State and local officials on training and planning. They \npracticed everything--from preparing routine shipping procedures to \ntesting emergency response systems. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act would \nrequire DOE to provide similar funding and technical assistance for \nState, tribal and local training and planning activities in advance of \nany actual commercial spent fuel shipments.\n  Mr. President, there is no disputing that transportation is one of \nthe most important issues in our consideration of S. 1936. It is an \nessential component of an integrated nuclear waste management program.\n  Clearly, as I have outlined today, nuclear waste can be transported \nsafely and efficiently. A comprehensive plan already is in place to \nensure this. To maximize safety, the plan directs shipments away from \nmetropolitan areas whenever possible. It allows for the selection of \nthe most direct and safest routes. It provides training to national, \nState and local officials so that they are ready to respond in the \nevent of an emergency.\n  We know that accidents happen, Mr. President. That is why S. 1936 \nbuilds on the existing regulatory framework that, to date, has \nprotected this Nation during more than 2,400 shipments of commercial \nspent nuclear fuel.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a close look at this program. Many of my \nconstituents have expressed their interest in nuclear waste \ntransportation. Fortunately, there is good news to report to them. We \nhave a safe, well-coordinated system. It ensures the safety of nuclear \nwaste transportation by relying on the expertise of the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, the Department of Transportation and the \nDepartment of Energy, as well as the State and local governments. S. \n1936 builds on the system to enhance protection of our citizens and our \nenvironment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. By passing S. 1936, \nwe can take the final steps towards ensuring that nuclear waste is \nmanaged in the safest possible manner.\n\n\n                              Section 203\n\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee on the floor. My colleague has been very \nhelpful in addressing a concern I had with certain\n\n[[Page S9251]]\n\nprovisions in Section 203 of S. 1936. I appreciate Chairman Murkowski's \nattention to this matter.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator from South Dakota. The Senator has \nraised some understandable concerns regarding requirements for the \ntransportation of spent nuclear fuel.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I would like to further question my colleague regarding \nthe transportation training standards addressed in this bill. In \nparticular, section 203 (g) would require the Secretary of \nTransportation to issue regulations establishing training standards \napplicable to workers directly involved in the removal and \ntransportation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. \nNew language, as proposed by the chairman on my behalf, would also \nrequire that an employer possess evidence of satisfaction of these \ntraining standards before an individual could be employed in such \nactivity. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, I believe this provision is consistent with existing \nlaw, as set forth in Section 5107 of title 49 of the United States Code \n(49 U.S.C. 5107), which details requirements for the training of \nemployees engaged in hazardous materials transportation. I would ask \nthe chairman if this interpretation is correct?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from South Dakota is correct. I defer to \nmy colleague's judgement and expertise, as chairman of the committee \nwith jurisdiction over the transportation of hazardous materials. I \nmight also add that this provision is not meant to prejudice in any way \nthe means by which the training requirements are satisfied.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank the Senator from Alaska for clarifying this \nmatter for me. Again, I greatly appreciate his willingness to work with \nme to resolve this matter. I urge my colleagues to support final \npassage of S. 1936.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, when the Senate debated the motion to \nproceed. I suggested that S. 1936 was the answer to nuclear waste and \nthat the editorial page of the Washington Post was the answer to \nparakeet waste.\n  I would not insult parakeets by suggesting that would be a good use \nof the letter from the Administrator of the EPA or the Chair of the \nCEQ.\n  The statements made in these letters are inaccurate and simply the \nshrill hysteria of those who believe that if you repeat a lie often \nenough, someone might believe you.\n  The administration, sadly, has demonstrated that they are incapable \nor unwilling to address this issue, and have now resorted to \nmisstatement, mischaracterization, and distortion to prevent Congress \nfrom exercising the leadership the administration has abandoned.\n  Far from being an assault on our environmental laws, this legislation \nreaffirms our commitment to the environment, and the health and safety \nof the American people.\n  Now, turning specifically to the letters--EPA says we preempt laws in \nS. 1936:\n\n       The substitute the Senate just overwhelmingly adopted does \n     not preempt environmental statutes. EIS requirements are \n     consolidated, but a full EIS is required.\n\n  EPA says section 204(i) of our bill prevents the NRC from issuing \nregulations to protect public health under certain circumstances. This \nis inflammatory and misleading:\n\n       Section 204(i) simply says that the storage of commercial \n     spent fuel, that the NRC will regulate under our bill, does \n     not need to wait while the NRC writes regulations for other \n     forms of nuclear wastes including naval reactor and defense \n     wastes.\n\n  EPA says section 205(d)(3)(C) prevents NRC from making important \ndeterminations:\n\n       All our bill says is that the NRC is not required to assume \n     that the records of waste disposal, security measures, and \n     the natural and engineered barriers will be insufficient to \n     prevent future human intrusion. Without this provision, DOE \n     would have to prove a negative.\n\n  Turning now to the letter from CEQ:\n  The CEQ's letter asserts S. 1936 ``Dismantles the EIS process under \nNEPA,'' by removing the requirement that DOE conduct an ``alternatives \nanalysis'' on the selection of an interim storage site.\n  The CEQ's letter entirely misses the point:\n\n       This legislation requires an EIS to be prepared by the NRC \n     as part of its licensing process because Congress is today \n     rendering its judgment about the need for interim storage and \n     the location of the site, we say that these decisions need \n     not be duplicated in the NRO process.\n       I would add that our legislation does not preclude the \n     President from performing an alternatives analysis in \n     selecting an interim storage site other than Nevada, if he \n     determines that the permanent repository at Yucca Mountain is \n     not viable.\n       There is an EIS. It can be challenged in court, and public \n     safety and the environment is protected.\n\n  The EPA letter says the 100 millirem standard is inappropriate:\n\n       EPA is given the authority to change the 100 millirem \n     standard if it determines it constitutes an unreasonable risk \n     to public health/saftey. What are they complaining about?\n       There are no valid scientific studies which suggest a \n     release of 100 millirem per year poses any health risk. The \n     probability of adverse health consequences has not been shown \n     to be any less from a zero dose than from a 100 millirem \n     dose.\n       There is at least a 100 millirem difference between a \n     person living on the east coast and Western States. If you \n     move from Washington to Denver, you would receive 100 or more \n     additional millirem from natural sources. EPA doesn't have a \n     problem with that.\n       You get 100 extra millirem by living in the White House, a \n     stone building with natural radiation. Is EPA saying the \n     White House is unsafe for the President?\n  Madam President, I think it is appropriate to note that these letters \nsimply represent an action by the administration to delay what has been \ndelayed for 15 years. There are no positive recommendations in spite of \nthe fact that the committee and myself personally have requested in \nthree letters to the President that if he opposes specific portions of \nthis legislation, he come up with alternatives. Those letters, for all \npractical purposes, have been ignored. Clearly, this administration \nsimply wishes to put this off to somebody else's watch, and that is \nirresponsible for the administration. It is irresponsible to duck the \nissue at this time.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my friend from Idaho and retain the remainder of \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, let me thank the chairman for the time \nand thank my colleague, the senior Senator from Louisiana, who has \nworked so closely with us in the last year to produce and bring to the \nfloor this legislation.\n  I first introduced this legislation in September of 1995 as S. 1271. \nWe worked our way through the process with hearings held, of course, \nbefore the Energy and Natural Resources Committee in December with \nadditional hearings in March and in May.\n  Finally, we have been able to craft and bring to the floor what I \nbelieve and what I call--because I think it is fair to call it that--\nprobably one of the most comprehensive environmental bills that has \ncome before the Congress this year.\n  Our Nation's high-level nuclear waste has an answer now that is \nresponsible, fair, and environmentally friendly and is supported by a \nvery large majority of this body and the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  Today, high-level nuclear waste and highly radioactive used nuclear \nfuel is accumulating in over 80 sites in 41 States. You have heard our \ncolleagues come to the floor and talk about their concern and the \nseriousness that this accumulation brings to these individual States.\n  Today, we stand before you responsible to our country and to our \nGovernment in assuring that we will be able to comply with the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act of 1982 to meet the court examinations and to be able \nto do what our country expected us to do to facilitate this \nlegislation. We have all worked closely together in a strong bipartisan \nway to assure that we could produce the ultimate legislation that would \npass. However, in doing all of this, S. 1936 contains many important \nclarifications and changes that deal with concerns raised regarding the \ndetails of the legislation amongst most of our Members. As a result of \nthat, I think we can hopefully today produce a vote and a work product \nthat the U.S. House of Representatives will take as we reconvene in \nSeptember.\n  The issue is clear, and the proposal we have before you is direct. It \ndoes not violate any environmental laws, and yet directs our country to \nmove responsibly and decisively to resolve an issue that has plagued \nour country for well over two decades. I hope that\n\n[[Page S9252]]\n\ntoday our colleagues in a final vote on this issue will vote in very \nlarge numbers to assure that we move forward on this issue.\n  Let me cover one other detailed topic. It is frustrating to me as the \ntwo Senators from Nevada have come to the floor on several occasions \nover the last week and a half to talk about the reality of a 100-\nmillirem test and how, for some reason, this in some way questioned the \nintegrity of a site and the development of a deep geological repository \nat Yucca Mountain. Let me quote from the Nevada Administrative Code, \nsection 459.335. This is the code that governs 153 facilities in the \nState of Nevada. It says this: ``The total effective dose equivalent to \nany member of the public from its licensed and registered operation \ndoes not exceed 100 millirems per year, not including contribution from \nthe disposal by the licensee of radioactive material in sanitary \nsewage,'' and so on and so forth.\n  The point I am making here--and this chart clearly spells it out--is \nthat the standards that we have established, the standards that come \nfrom the GAO audit, the standards that the State of Nevada, the very \nState the two Senators are from and arguing today, argues this. It \nargues right here that 153 facilities in the State of Nevada that use \nradioactive material cannot exceed the very standard that we are saying \nYucca Mountain cannot exceed.\n  I hope, once and for all, that we do not shake the scare tree, that \nwe look at the facts and we look at the statistics, and they are very \nclear. Whether it is proposed EPA guidance of 1995, whether it is the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission limit, whether it is the proposed DOE \nlimit, whether it is the State of Nevada, or whether it is Yucca \nMountain, what we are talking about here is an international standard \nwell accepted by all of the professionals in the field and accepted by \nthe State of Nevada, by the State government of Nevada and, obviously, \nby State politicians in Nevada.\n  Why do they arrive at that standard? Because that is the national \nstandard. That is the international standard that clearly says this is \nan acceptable level.\n  Madam President, I recognize my time is up.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me yield time to the Senator from Idaho to \nconclude his remarks.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my chairman for yielding to me.\n  Let me close with this thought. It has been a long, hard effort. It \ntook an awful lot of very talented people involved.\n  Let me thank Karen Hunsicker, David Garman, Gary Ellsworth, and Jim \nBeirne of the Energy and Natural Resources staff for the tremendous \nwork that they have done and for the expertise they themselves have \ndeveloped, the cooperative effort they have had in working with all of \nthe staffs in a bipartisan manner.\n  Let me thank once again our chairman, Frank Murkowski, and also the \nsenior Senator from the State of Louisiana, Bennett Johnston, for his \ndedicated effort over several decades to assure that there would be a \nsafe and responsible solution to the management of high-level nuclear \nwaste, and we are clearly on the threshold of allowing that to happen.\n  I hope in the end once this makes it to our President's desk that he \nwill read the bill--read the bill--and look at the changes we have \nmade. I think in doing so this President will say that we have been \nresponsible to our country and to the State of Nevada in promulgating \nlegislation that can deal with a very important national issue.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, will the Senator yield to me for a \nquick comment to endorse what he has said about the good staff work.\n  Let me add to that great staff work Sam Fowler, Bob Simon, and Ben \nCooper on our side, who have really done an outstanding job as well.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, how much time is remaining on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield to the Senator from Wyoming 3 minutes that he \nrequested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you very much.\n  Madam President, I wanted to rise in support of this bill before it \nis voted on. I have been involved in it for some time not only here but \nin Wyoming, and I just wanted to kind of generally share some thoughts \nthat I have. We have talked about it a great deal. We probably have \ntalked about it more than we really needed to.\n  Nevertheless, there has been a great deal of detail naturally, as \nthere should be. But it seems to me that there are some basic things \nthat most of us do understand and most of us accept, and I think that \nis where we are.\n  First, we have nuclear waste. We have to do something about it. It is \nthere. It is stored all over the country in a number of sites--I think \n80. Clearly, it is more difficult to ensure safety that way than it is \nif we put it in a place that we can ensure safety. We are going to have \nmore. We need to be prepared for that.\n  The ratepayers have paid to do something about it. They have paid, I \nthink, somewhere near $12 billion. We spent $5 billion already in \npreparing this spot. There is not much to show for that. Yet, we need \nto make sure that there is. It makes sense, it seems to me, to move to \nthe permanent site with an intermediate site that we have for \nstorage. We have been through that intermediate storage thing for \nseveral years. We have been unsuccessful in doing it.\n\n  Transportation is, in fact, something that is the highest of \nscientific study and I think as safe as anything can be. There are \nalways risks.\n  I have been disappointed this whole time of dealing with the storage \nof nuclear waste. Opponents in the press talk about nuclear waste \ndumps. They are not dumps. They are high-tech storage, as high tech as \nwe can be.\n  It is also true that the Government has agreed to storage in 1998. \nLet us do it.\n  So even though that is very nontechnical, Madam President, I think \nthose are about the basic ideas we have to understand. Most of us know \nwe have to do something about it. This bill gives us the opportunity to \nlive up to the challenges we have and to do the things we have to do.\n  I thank the Senator for the time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, how much time is remaining on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BRYAN. May I inquire of the Chair how much time we have on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 9 minutes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Madam President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  I have tried purposely to keep the focus on the issues, but I must \nsay that my friend from Idaho has spoken and my friend from Wyoming has \njust spoken, and they obviously reach a different conclusion as to the \nurgency of the need than does the scientific community, which has \nspecifically rejected the need.\n  Let me say with great respect to them, if they disagree, they have \nthe right under the law to volunteer their States as sites for interim \nstorage. That is permissible.\n  I find some irony in the fact they are eager to have it come to us in \nNevada and yet suggest that their own State would not be available.\n  There is another irony. Late last week, another letter was circulated \nthat raised some concerns about the interstate shipment of trash, and \nthis letter goes on to say, in part:\n\n       It is important that Congress pass interstate legislation \n     this year. Cities and towns all across the Nation are being \n     forced to take trash from other States. Many States have \n     tried to restrict the shipments.\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       But every time they do, they have been challenged in court \n     and their laws have been overturned as a violation of the \n     commerce clause of the Constitution. It is clear that States \n     cannot protect themselves, their residents or their land from \n     being spoiled by out-of-State waste. We need Federal \n     legislation to empower States and communities with the \n     authority to manage solid waste within their borders. Without \n     legislation, they will have to continue to accept unwanted \n     trash.\n\n  Does anybody see a disconnect or an inconsistency? Here they are \ntalking about trash, and many of my colleagues who have ventured forth \nin the Chamber and who have expressed support for this legislation have \ngotten greatly exercised about the trash issue. You cannot have it both \nways. My colleague and I have signed on to this letter because we \nunderstand the concerns. You can be concerned about\n\n[[Page S9253]]\n\ntrash but not the most dangerous, lethal trash known to mankind, high-\nlevel nuclear waste.\n  Finally, let me just say that we have talked about the standards ad \nnauseam. I think it just one more time needs to be pointed out that the \nNational Academy of Sciences--these are the scientists which this body \nasked to make recommendations about standards--reported and concluded \nthat the standards in terms of radioactive exposure should be from 10 \nto 30 millirems.\n  That is their view. They are scientists. Nobody--I repeat, nobody--in \nthe world has set a 100-millirem standard, and to point out that those \nwho are charged under our law with the responsibility of enforcing and \nadministering the environmental laws, the Environmental Protection \nAgency, through Carol Browner, the Council on Environmental Quality, \nthe President of the United States, the Department of Energy, all have \nurged a no vote on this piece of legislation.\n\n  Now, I guess what they do not have in common with some of the \nadvocates is that they are not supporting the view of the nuclear \nindustry. This is special interest legislation at its worst. There is \nno groundswell for this legislation. The nuclear industry and its \nphalanx of lobbyists who ply these halls every day with enormous \namounts of money and power and influence, they are the ones who are \ndriving this debate by creating a contrived and fabricated crisis that \npurports to call out for a legislative response.\n  That is simply not the case. There is no need. The damage that we do \nto our Nation's environmental laws and to people across America that \ncan be affected by this is unconscionable--unconscionable. No \nenvironmental organization in America--none--supports this legislation. \nAll oppose the irreparable damage it would do to our environmental \nlaws. And no agency charged by law at the Federal level to enforce the \nenvironmental standards supports this legislation. All have concluded \nthat to do so would be irreparable, do irreversible damage to our \nenvironment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would ask at the conclusion of the debate time for \nthe yeas and nays on final passage.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield to me one moment?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield to my friend from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my chairman for yielding.\n  I apologize. Some of the people who work the most closely with us we \noften forget. I want the Record to show that Nils Johnson on my staff, \nwho has worked on this issue for a good number of years with me and the \nstaff of the committee, was a tremendous asset through all of this \ndebate.\n  I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Again, Madam President, may I ask for the yeas and \nnays on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, as we approach the final minutes prior to voting, I \nwould like to very briefly refute some of the specific claims that have \nbeen made in the Chamber in the debate. These claims, of course, have \nhad to do with transportation, safety, cask integrity, radiation, the \napplication of environmental laws, and, of course, finally, the issue \nof just who benefits from this legislation.\n  The issue of transportation and safety and cask integrity is \nimportant, and there has been every effort to describe that the \ntransportation of used fuel is something that has a risk. But the \nopponents of this legislation talk about it as if it represents some \nnovel and untested approach, and these statements are not true.\n  We have been moving spent fuel both in the United States and around \nthe world for decades. There have been over 20,000 movements of spent \nfuel around the world over the last 40 years; 30,000 tons have been \nmoved in France alone. That is equal to what we have in storage. So it \ncan be moved, and it can be moved safely because it is designed to be \nmoved safely.\n  This bill, S. 1936, includes new measures, new training and new \nassistance to make the movement even safer. The fact is nuclear \nmaterials will be transported with or without the passage of this bill. \nSpent fuel, foreign research reactor fuel, naval fuel, and other \nradioactive materials are being transported every day in the United \nStates.\n\n  Another example is we build submarines on the east coast in \nConnecticut, but when the sub has served its useful life, the fuel is \nremoved and taken to Idaho. The sub is cut up. The reactor compartment \nis buried in Hanford, WA. So we all have an interest in this, and we \nmust address responsibly a solution.\n  Another claim I want to refute has to do with the generalization that \nhas been made on the floor of the Senate that somehow we are waiving \nthe application of environmental laws that are needed to protect the \npublic health and safety. S. 1936 requires the NRC to prepare \nenvironmental impact statements, or EIS's, as part of a decision to \nlicense a central interim storage facility, and the EIS's must include \nthe impact of transporting the used fuel to the interim storage \nfacility.\n  There is also judicial review. S. 1936 requires the DOE to submit an \nEIS on construction and operation of the repository.\n  It is clear, Madam President, S. 1936 does not trample environmental \nlaws as has been charged on this floor. This is a unique facility. None \nlike it has ever been developed anywhere in the world.\n  So the regulatory licensing program for a permanent facility \ncontained in S. 1936 is designed to protect public health and safety \nwithout reliance upon other laws.\n  With respect to NEPA, we recognize Congress has decided that we will \nbuild an interim site in Nevada, and we do not let the NEPA process \nrevisit the decision that Congress has already made. That is what we \nare saying. NEPA applies. We are simply saying NEPA does not have to \nrevisit the decision of policy that we are making here today.\n  The last claim I am compelled to refute is on the issue of timing. \nOpponents say S. 1936 claims that there is no need to tackle the issue \nnow, that it is a waste of time.\n  That does not sound like anything other than Washington bureaucracy: \nLet's defer the decision. Let's not take action. Let's keep spending \nmoney without results. Let's maintain the status quo. Let's promote the \nstalemate. Let's maintain the gridlock.''\n  For 15 years we have collected billions of dollars. We have expended \n$6 billion and we go nowhere. We have a chance to go somewhere today.\n  But the Washington bureaucracy wants to say: ``Let's keep taking the \nconsumers' money, but not provide them with nuclear waste removal \nservices we promised them in return. Let's ignore the recent court \ncases and let us stick it to the taxpayers who will have to pay the \ndamages.''\n  Our opponents would have you believe the Government has no \nresponsibility. But the recent court decision has blown our opponents' \narguments out of the water. The Federal Government has a \nresponsibility. Failure to live up to that responsibility will have \nsignificant consequences, so said the court. And it said so \nunanimously.\n  Finally, the fifth issue I must refute is the issue of just who \nbenefits from the legislation. The other side has tried to paint this \nbill as one of exclusively benefiting the nuclear power lobby. But I \nhave letters from 23 States, written by Governors and attorneys \ngeneral, urging the Congress to pass and the President to sign the \nbill. We have letters from Governors, Governor Lawton Chiles of Florida \nand others, relative to that matter.\n  We have broad support for this bill across the political spectrum. \nOurs is a bipartisan effort, Democrats, Republicans, liberals, \nconservatives. We are supported by unions as well, the Electrical \nWorkers Union, Utility Workers, AFL-CIO, Joiners and Carpenters. The \nfire chiefs in Nevada have indicated support of this. As have many \nNevadans--I have already entered that in the Record.\n  Our constituents should not have to pay twice for nuclear waste \nservices. We do not have to create 80 waste\n\n[[Page S9254]]\n\ndumps, including some in populated areas or sitting just outside \nnational parks, when one will do. We do not have to settle for further \ndelay, further stalemate and further gridlock. We can avoid \nmultibillion-dollar damages against the taxpayer for the Government's \nfailure to address a problem that a recent court case says is \nGovernment's responsibility. We can do that. It is the right thing to \ndo for the consumers and electric ratepayers, for the environment, for \npublic health and safety, and I urge we pass Senate bill 1936.\n  Madam President, at this time I would like to thank my dear friend \nand colleague, Senator Johnston, who has been involved in this much \nlonger than I, for his steadfast commitment to what is responsible and \nwhat is right for the country, to finally address our responsibility. I \nthank my friend, Larry Craig, who introduced this legislation \ninitially, and Senator Domenici, Senator Gramm, Senator Thurmond, \nSenator Simpson, Senator Faircloth, Senator Gorton. I recognize Senator \nThomas, as well as my two colleagues, Senator Bryan and Senator Reid. I \nknow what a tough thing this is for your State.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me thank the staff as well. I would like to thank \nthe Energy Committee staff, including Gregg Renkes, Gary Ellsworth, Jim \nBeirne, Karen Hunsicker, David Garman, David Fish and Betty Nevitt, as \nwell as Nils Johnson from Senator Craig's office, and the minority \nstaff, Ben Cooper, Sam Fowler and Bob Simon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I apologize for being rude but we have a \nMember who needs to vote and that is why we need to stick with the \nprogram.\n  If anyone believes in environmental standards, you must vote against \nthis bill. This bill will ultimately open the door for the greatest \nnuclear waste transportation project in human history, sending \nthousands and thousands of tons of the Nation's radioactive waste onto \nthe roads and rails. Last year we had 2,500 accidents on rail that only \ninvolved trains, and 6,000 accidents at railroad crossings over the \nlast year.\n\n  Madam President, in the last 10 years, 26,354 accidents occurred with \ndamage to track, structure or equipment in excess of $6,300 dollars. \nThere were 60,553 accidents at railroad crossings.\n  This bill is bad, bad, bad, if you support environmental standards. \nIf you oppose corporate welfare, vote against this. The court decision \nhelps our cause. That is why we offered an amendment to that effect. \nThey keep coming back saying it was a unanimous opinion. We agree. \nThree judges said they have to follow the contract they entered into. \nWe agree with that.\n  Hazel O'Leary is not only the Secretary of the Department of Energy, \nshe is also a corporate lawyer. She said that decision does not affect \nwhat the DOE is going to do. In fact, she says, if this bill passes it \nwill, again, harm what the decision did.\n  So, Madam President, if you believe in returning authority to the \nStates, vote against this bill. If you oppose Government taking private \nproperty, vote against this bill. Homeowners along transportation \nroutes may well find their property values reduced as a result of \nnuclear waste trains and trucks passing by, and that is an \nunderstatement. No mechanism exists in S. 1936 to compensate homeowners \nin such a circumstance. If you believe in public participation in \nregulatory proceedings, vote against this bill. If you believe in a \nrational nuclear waste policy, vote against this bill.\n  If you believe that the nuclear industry is entitled to lavish \ntaxpayer-financed benefits from the Federal Government at the expense \nof public health and safety, then you should vote for this legislation.\n  We ask Senators to vote against this legislation. This is the most \nanti-environmental legislation of this Congress and that says a great \ndeal because this is known as the most anti-environmental Congress in \nthe history of this country.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask we proceed with the vote. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.\n  I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators from Nevada yield back their \ntime?\n  Mr. REID.

I say to the ranking member and the manager that \nI will not offer that amendment, but I do want to speak for just a \ncouple of minutes while we are waiting for another Senator to come to \noffer an amendment. I think that will probably be good news to them \nbecause they want to move the bill along, and they do not want me to \noffer another amendment.\n  I want to describe, as you are waiting for Senator Baucus and others, \nwhat I was going to offer the amendment on. I want Members of the \nSenate to understand that we are going to be dealing with this issue in \na day or so.\n  Here is the issue. It is very simple. It is something most Senators \nhave not heard of, but it is something that went on late last night \nhere in the Senate in a deal between the Senate and the House, I am \ntold. There is a bill that is traveling with the minimum wage that is \ncalled the Small Business Job Protection Act that gives some benefits \nto small business. Of course, it is not just benefits for small \nbusiness. Included in that bill was a provision repealing something \ncalled section 956A of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  What is 956A? It is a provision of the law that was passed in 1993 to \nclose a corporate tax loophole by which corporations move investments \nand U.S. jobs overseas, and avoid paying taxes here at home. In 1993, \nthat loophole was closed by something that was proposed by President \nClinton and supported by the Congress: 956A. It says that you cannot \nstart a manufacturing plant overseas, earn a lot of money, and pay no \ntaxes back home.\n  My point is that in 1993 a tax loophole was closed. It had benefited \nsome of the largest corporations in the country. It said to them, if \nyou move your investments and jobs overseas, we will give you a special \ntax break that is not available to small businesses operating in this \ncountry. And they moved their jobs overseas. They earn income overseas \nand pay no taxes in this country on income. They invest it in passive \nassets abroad in foreign countries, and pay no income tax here.\n  We closed that tax loophole. Guess what? There are some folks in this \nChamber and the House that have been working late at night to reopen \nthat loophole. I know it is only a few hundred million dollars, but it \nis a few hundred million dollars in favors to some of the largest \ncorporations in this country.\n  I have worked for couple of years trying to get some money to deal \nwith Indian child abuse--a million dollars, two million dollars. I have \ntold my colleagues before that I have been in an office where there is \na stack of papers that high on the floor of complaints of sexual abuse \nand violence against children that have not even been investigated \nbecause there is not enough money. We do not have enough money to do \nthings like that. We are simply short of money.\n  But when it comes to late night in this place, in the conference, \nthere is enough money to give a $235 million tax break to corporations \nand say, if you want a tax break to move your jobs overseas, we will \nsweeten it up; we will give you a big, juicy tax loophole.\n  That is going to be put in the bill in conference. I am told the deal \nwas struck last night between the chairmen of the two committees \nworking late last night.\n  I venture to say that there is not another Member of the Senate who \nknows about it, and it probably does not mean a lot to some. It will \nmean something to those people who are going to lose their jobs in this \ncountry because we make it juicier for corporations to move jobs \noverseas. We decide to give a huge tax break to firms which move jobs \noverseas. And it will mean that some people in this country are going \nto lose their good-paying jobs. It is going to mean that we are out \nseveral hundred million dollars because we now have a new tax break \nthat we thought we had closed in 1993. It is going to mean that small \nbusinesses that operate in this country are going to be forced to \ncompete with large multinational firms at a greater disadvantage.\n  This is coming to the Senate, and it is stuck in a bill called the \nSmall Business Job Protection Act. It ought to be against the law to \nuse a title like that when it includes provisions like this.\n  You are going to hear more from me if it is true that the conference \nhas accepted this and is going to bring it to the floor of the Senate. \nI am told a deal was made last night.\n  I could name some large corporations on the floor--but I will not at \nthis moment--that have been moving around this town saying, ``Reopen, \nplease, for us this tax loophole. We want to benefit from it. We want \nto move our jobs overseas. We want to invest our money overseas. Reopen \nthis loophole.''\n  We have folks jumping for joy to see if they cannot accommodate those \nwho want another tax loophole done in the dead of night without the \nknowledge of people in this Chamber and the other Chamber. Most of them \ndo not know much about 956A--and done with hundreds of millions of \ndollars at a time when we cannot get $0.5 million or $1 million to deal \nwith critical issues of child abuse on Indian reservations. They cannot \neven get them investigated. But there is plenty of money to do this.\n  I will tell you, if I sound upset about this stuff, I am, because \nthis sort of thing should not go on in this town. If you want to debate \nrestoring a tax loophole, then let us debate it on the floor of the \nSenate. We repealed it 3 years ago. Now the folks want to go out and \nopen it up again. Let us debate that on the floor of the Senate and see \nif you get one vote.\n  How many want to stand up in the Senate and say, ``Yes, we would like \nto restore a new tax loophole. Count us in. We want to go home and brag \nabout creating a new tax loophole which benefits some of the biggest \ncorporations\n\n[[Page S9266]]\n\nin this country so they can move their jobs overseas''.\n  I want to know one Senator who wants to go home and brag about that \nin August. I bet there is not one who would do it, not one who would \nwant to vote on this, so you do not have to vote on it because it is \ndone under cover of darkness, slipped in a bill that is called the \nSmall Business Job Protection Act. You talk about mismanagement.\n  There is nothing about small business job protection in any of this. \nThis is not job protection--shipping jobs overseas. It is not small \nbusiness when you are talking about the biggest businesses in the \ncountry.\n  So I would say if tomorrow this conference report comes back to the \nfloor of the Senate, you are going to hear a lot about this, and I am \ngoing to ask: Who is the person that said, ``Count me in, count me in \nat a time when we are tightening our belts wanting to lead the charge \nto open up a new tax loophole. Sign me up for that''? I want to find \nthe Member of the Senate or the House who says, ``Yes, that is me. That \nis what I stand for,'' because I think this is an outrage.\n  I think that there are a lot of people who think they can do it \nsimply because if they do it in conference, we do not get a chance to \nvote on it separately. Do you know something? It was not put in the \nSenate bill. They were going to put it in the Senate bill, but they did \nnot do it because I think they knew I was going to force a vote on it. \nSo they put it in the House bill and packaged up a rule so they do not \nhave to vote on it.\n  The result is that nobody in conference who tries to push this sort \nof sweet deal--so that big business move jobs overseas--nobody has to \nvote on it. So they get the job done for their friends worth hundreds \nof millions of dollars and do not have to vote on it, therefore, and do \nnot have to go home and raise their hand and say, ``It was me. I am the \none who stood for spending several hundred millions opening up a new \ntax loophole that benefits large profitable corporations.''\n\n  I just urge that if this deal is not done--I am told it was done last \nnight--if it is not done, rethink it, because somebody is going to live \nwith the consequences, and somebody is going to have to stand up and \nsay, ``I am the one who believed we ought to open up new tax \nloopholes.''\n  That is not what we ought to be doing. We ought to be closing tax \nloopholes.\n  We ought not be doing things to ship jobs overseas. We ought to keep \njobs at home.\n  You talk about a perversion of constructive thought about economics. \nThis is a perversion.\n  So I will not offer the amendment. I was going to offer a motion to \ninstruct conferees. I do not think at this moment that is something \nthat will accomplish what I want. I guess what I would like to do is \nsimply serve notice to Members of the Senate that if there is a vote in \nconference on this, I hope conferees will stand up and be counted.\n  If this comes to the floor in this bill, I hope it comes to the floor \nin a circumstance where we can have a good aggressive fight about it. I \nknow they are going to wrap it up in conference and tie the bow and try \nto jam it through here so we do not have a chance to discuss this, but \nit is not going to go through here without some of us asking questions: \nFor whom is this done? Who does it benefit? Who did it? Why did they do \nit? And how on Earth do they think this benefits this country if you \nare concerned about jobs and opportunity in this country?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Despite the fact that I heartily agree with him, I hardly think that \nthere are many in this Chamber or many across the country who would \nthink it is a good idea to facilitate the exportation of jobs. That is \nabout the silliest thing we can do, and, frankly, I think it has hurt \nAmerica severely by providing ease of transportation, transmission, and \nrelocation of jobs that used to be in America that we thought were \nrelatively menial, low-skilled jobs that today would be very nice to \nhave in our country.\n  The Senator's point is an excellent one, and I regret that we at this \npoint cannot accommodate him, but I think the message is clear to those \nwho are going to be on the conference committee that they ought to pay \nattention because it will be remembered for a long time to come if they \nignore the opportunity to cut that flow.\n  I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, momentarily I am going to be offering an \namendment to correct a mistake the Treasury Department and Department \nof Transportation made in calculating allocation of highway funds.\n  I see my very good friend from Virginia is in the Chamber. He is a \nvery valuable member, ranking member of the authorizing subcommittee \nand wishes to make a statement on this, and I should like to yield to \nmy good friend from Virginia, Senator Warner.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I know full well the Senator did not mean \nto call me ranking member. I do believe we have had a small matter of \nan election, and I am now the chairman.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Excuse me. I am sorry.\n  Mr. WARNER. In any event, the distinguished Senator from Montana and \nI have worked together on many, many things over many, many years, and \nwe will continue, in all probability, to work together.\n  The point I wish to make is that when the Senator from Montana has \nthe opportunity to present the amendment to the Senate, I wish to be \nrecorded in opposition for the following reasons. There is nothing that \nI have witnessed in my period here in the Senate that is more divisive \nthan the highway allocation formulas.\n  Mr. President, I do not know--I think I do know, but for the moment I \ndo not have before me the documentation--who devised this formula years \nago, but I know it requires many, many bureaucrats and many, many pages \nof reference material for even those in the Department of \nTransportation responsible for this allocation formula to figure it \nout.\n  I think it is incumbent upon the Congress next year as a part of the \nISTEA reauthorization, in which I hope to play an active role, to \nrevise this formula so: First, it is simple and can be understood and \nall States know the various factors that are taken into consideration \nto make the allocation; and: second, that it is fair.\n  Right now there are donor States and donee States. The donor State is \na State in which the receipts from sales of gasoline in that State go \nto the highway trust fund and then the allocation from the highway \ntrust fund comes back and that State gets a sum less than the total of \nthe receipts paid by its constituents and such others that may avail \nthemselves of the fuel in that State. Now, donees get a greater sum \nthan the total of their revenues from the sale of gasoline as a Federal \ntax. So the time has come to reconcile this ancient formula with \nreality and with fairness.\n\n  What is the present problem? The Senator from Montana I think quite \nproperly brings before the Senate the fact that someone--and I am not \npointing an accusing finger of malice aforethought--misapplied a \nregulation, a rule or something.\n  As a result, Mr. President, we have 19 States, my State being one of \nthe 19, which received an incorrect sum of money. In the case of \nVirginia, it is $10,488,000, a sum of money which is greater than \nVirginia was entitled to under the complicated formula to which I have \nreferred had that formula been properly administered by the unknown \nbureaucrat. And 18 other States are in a similar situation--Arizona, \nArkansas, California--$65 million for California--Colorado, Indiana, \nLouisiana, Massachusetts--I will not go on. They are here. I will put \nthem in the Record. I so ask unanimous consent. I will name Oregon, Mr. \nPresident, the State of the distinguished chairman of the committee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S9267]]\n\n\n\n COMPARISON OF PROPOSED FY 1997 OBLIGATION LIMITATION BASED ON ESTIMATED\n                         FY 1997 APPROPRIATIONS

Now, my position is that this correction should be done \nin the course of our consideration of the revision of this formula next \nyear during ISTEA. Owing to the clear conscience of the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, the distinguished ranking member from New \nJersey, the distinguished ranking member of the Environment Committee, \nour chairman, and indeed backup from well-informed staff, we decided \nnot to do this amendment last night--I among others objected--as a \nmanagers' amendment--and I commend the managers of this bill for not \ntrying to do this--which results in a considerable loss of money to 19 \nStates.\n  The Senator has every right to do it as an amendment to the pending \nbill. Technically, I suppose it is legislation on this bill. I intend \nto vote, however the vote is taken, in opposition because I think the \nbetter course of action is to deal with this correction next year. \nThese sums of money will not affect the ability of the several States, \n50 of them, to go forward with their highway programs. My State, \nalthough it has been told it is going to get the $10 million, has made \ncertain plans to expend this $10 million, and it will require a certain \nperturbation in the planning to take $10 million out of the budget for \nthis year. And 18 other States will similarly be subjected to deducting \nfrom their highway budgets this sum of money. So that, to me, is the \nmore equitable and more fair way to deal with this question. That would \nenable all the other Senators, many of whom are learning, presumably \nfor the first time at this moment, knowledge of this problem.\n\n  The other reason I feel it should be done this way, and with due \nrespect to the distinguished ranking member of the committee, the \nSenator from Montana, is we do not have before us--at least I do not--\nany letter from the Department of Transportation explaining to Senators \nexactly how this happened. Perhaps the Senator from Montana can \narticulate the problem in more detail. But it seems to me the Senate \nshould have before it certain documentation from the Secretary of \nTransportation explaining how this happened and the need for it to be \ncorrected by the Congress. It is apparent that the Secretary of \nTransportation has made the decision he cannot do it administratively \nwithin the executive branch, but it requires the Congress to act.\n  So I have concluded my remarks and, at such time as the distinguished \nSenator from Montana wishes, he can put the amendment forward. I hope \nother Senators will find the opportunity to speak on it. I yield the \nfloor. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate the statement the chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Transportation of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee made. I understand the Senator's position, namely that \nalthough a mistake is made, and there is not anybody who disputes that \na mistake was made, the point is the mistake could be corrected next \nyear when Congress takes up reauthorization of the highway bill, the \nso-called ISTEA.\n  The problem with that is very simple. First of all, this is a \nmistake. This is not a formula question. When ISTEA comes up next year, \nthis Congress will deal with the formula under which the highway funds \nare disbursed. This is not a formula question--not a formula question. \nThis is correcting an administrative error the Department of \nTransportation and, more precisely, the Department of Treasury made. It \nis a simple correction.\n  I might also say the mistake that was made, and nobody disputes the \nmistake was made, is not a donor-donee question. The mistake \ndistributes the dollars inappropriately to some States and does not \ndistribute dollars inappropriately to other States, irrespective of the \ndonor-donee question. This has nothing to do with donor-donee issues. \nIt has nothing to do with the formula.\n  One more point which I think is even more salient is this. The States \nin question here would not receive this money, if the mistake is not \ncorrected, until fiscal 1997. So they are not going to be receiving any \nmoney this year, calendar 1996. They are not going to be receiving any \nmoney next year until after the fiscal year begins on October 1, 1997. \nSo this is the appropriate time to correct the mistake, that is, before \nStates would otherwise receive their money. It is a lot easier to \ncorrect a mistake before a State or somebody receives money than it is \nafterward. I know full well the States that receive their money, if \nthey were to receive their money incorrectly next year, they are not \ngoing to be very likely to give it back.\n  I think, therefore, for all those reasons, the appropriate place to \ncorrect the mistake--nobody disputes the mistake was made--is right \nnow. Just do it quickly and easily. Then, next year, this Congress will \nengage in a full battle royal, I know, over the allocation of highway \nfunds.\n  For those reasons, I think this is more appropriate that the \ncorrection be made here and now, simply, rather than putting it off to \nnext year.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am glad to yield to the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I discussed this matter with the Senator from Virginia, \nand I believe the Senator is willing to enter into a time agreement on \nthis amendment of 1 hour, equally divided.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Fine.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I ask unanimous consent an hour limitation be given to \nthe Baucus amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I withdraw the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are going to be waiting for a few \nminutes for other Senators who wish to speak to arrive. I would like to \ntake a few minutes during that wait to lend my support to the amendment \nthat will be offered by the distinguished Senator from Montana. I think \nit is well-intentioned, and I think the amendment is fair.\n  The one thing I want to be certain of is that this amendment is not \ngoing to be perceived as a formula fight, because that should not be. \nThis is a correction. It corrects the fact that the Department of \nTreasury misinterpreted the revenue reports that were\n\n[[Page S9268]]\n\nput into a new format. The unfortunate result is that the Treasury \nDepartment grossly overstated the amount of gas tax receipts to the \nhighway trust fund during 1994.\n  This error is acknowledged by the Treasury Department and by the \nFederal Highway Administration. Unfortunately, the FHWA is required by \nlaw to base a certain category of highway fund allocations on the \nTreasury's formal estimates, whether or not they are correct.\n  So, what the Baucus amendment seeks to do is correct the allocations \nmade as a result of Treasury's error. And the amendment, I must say to \nmy colleagues who were in the Chamber or who might hear us, the \namendment will not deny any State the full 90 percent of the payments \nthey are due through the Federal aid to highways formula program. What \nthis amendment will do is to set these payments at 90 percent of what \nthe States actually paid, rather than 90 percent of the Treasury's \nerroneous estimates.\n  We heard from the distinguished Senator from Virginia about the \ninterest that he and the Senator from Montana have in terms of \nexamining the formula. We will have a chance to do that, I assure you, \nat length, I believe. But we ought not to try to do it here, and that \nis not what is being attempted. Unfortunately, the impact of correcting \nthis mistake results in certain States getting more and others getting \nless than they would otherwise receive if this correction were not \nadopted.\n\n  When reviewing this amendment, I hope that the Members will keep in \nmind that the bill before us provides an increase of $100 million in \nthe overall obligation limit for the Federal Aid Highway Program, from \n$17.55 billion to $17.65 billion, a $100 million increase. This \nincrease is going to help all States in meeting their transportation \nneeds. While it is unfortunate that the legislation is required to \ncorrect this mistake, the Federal Highway Administration assures us \nthat absent this bill language, the Secretary does not have the \nadministrative authority to correct these highway allocations and bring \nthem into conformity with what we now know to be the actual gas tax \nreceipts.\n  I hope our Members will support this amendment. It is the right thing \nto do; it is the fair thing to do. The amendment is not an attempt to \npick anyone's pocket in the dark of night.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5141\n\n      (Purpose: To require the calculation of Federal-aid highway \napportionments and allocations for fiscal year 1997 to be determined so \nthat States experience no net effect from a credit to the Highway Trust \n  Fund made in correction of an accounting error made in fiscal year \n                                 1994)\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have an amendment which I send to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5141.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title III, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 3   . CALCULATION OF FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAY APPORTIONMENTS \n                   AND ALLOCATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), for \n     fiscal year 1997, the Secretary of Transportation shall \n     determine the Federal-aid highway apportionments and \n     allocations to a State without regard to the approximately \n     $1,596,000,000 credit to the Highway Trust Fund (other than \n     the Mass Transit Account) of estimated taxes paid by States \n     that was made by the Secretary of the Treasury for fiscal \n     year 1995 in correction of an accounting effort made in \n     fiscal year 1994.\n       (b) Adjustments for Effects in 1996.--The Secretary of \n     Transportation shall, for each State--\n       (1) determine whether the State would have been apportioned \n     and allocated an increased or decreased amount for Federal-\n     aid highways for fiscal year 1996 if the accounting error \n     referred to in subsection (a) had not been made (which \n     determination shall take into account the effects of section \n     1003(c) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \n     Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-240; 105 Stat. 1921)); and\n       (2) after apportionments and allocations are determined in \n     accordance with subsection (a)--\n       (A) adjust the amount apportioned and allocated to the \n     State for Federal-aid highways for fiscal year 1997 by the \n     amount of increase or decrease; and\n       (B) adjust accordingly the obligation limitation for \n     Federal-aid highways distributed to the State under this Act.\n       (c) No Effect on 1996 Distributions.--Nothing in this \n     section shall affect any apportionment, allocation, or \n     distribution of obligation limitation, or reduction thereof, \n     to a State for Federal-aid highways for fiscal year 1996.\n       (d) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect on \n     September 30, 1996.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a very simple technical correction \namendment. Very simply, it corrects a mistake that the Department of \nthe Treasury made. The administration tells us, incredibly, they need \nlegislative authority to correct the mistake. This amendment simply \ndoes that legislatively, it corrects that mistake.\n  Nobody disputes that a mistake was made--nobody. The administration \nadmits it, and the Senators who have spoken on this issue also admit it \nwas a mistake.\n  What was the mistake? The mistake is very simple. Essentially, in \n1994, the Treasury failed to credit the Highway Trust Fund with about \n$1.5 billion, an administrative error, a bureaucratic error. The \nTreasury then corrected that error in 1995, credited the Highway Trust \nFund with the 1994 mistake, that is, the $1.5 billion and also \ncontinued to collect revenues in 1995, as they should.\n  The problem is the extra bump, the additional revenue in 1995, that \nis not only the revenue to be collected properly in 1995 but also the \nadditional $1.5 billion credit because the mistake was made in 1994, \nthat additional bump skewed the formulas, because the formulas are \nbased upon the revenue that was received in 1995; that is, the \nformula's distribution for future years is based upon the 1995 \nreceipts.\n  The Department of Transportation has written us a letter saying that \nthey cannot correct this mistake administratively and cannot, by their \nown administrative procedures, correct this error. They say it has to \nbe made by legislation. It is a pure and simple error, pure and simple \nmistake. I think it is appropriate at this time to correct the mistake.\n  I might say, Mr. President, this is not a donor-donee question. This \nhas nothing to do with the claim that some States have that they are \nso-called donee States, that is, their citizens are contributing more \ndollars in gasoline taxes in the Highway Trust Fund than they are \nreceiving in highway formula distributions. This is not that issue. In \nfact, the mistake that the Treasury made results in a misallocation \nwhich is totally independent of the donee-donor issue--totally \nindependent; it has nothing to do with it.\n  I remind my colleagues who might think this is an allocation \nquestion, that this might be, ``Oh, here we go again, one of those \nbattles where States are trying to get more money for themselves,'' \nthis is not that issue.\n  We will have an opportunity to deal with that question next year. Why \nnext year? Because next year the Congress is due to reauthorize the \nhighway bill, ISTEA. The States have been dealing with the formula \nunder ISTEA for the past several years. The last ISTEA was passed in \n1991. Here we are in 1996. The next ISTEA 6 years later will be passed \nin 1997. That is the opportunity and the place to figure out what the \nproper formula is in distribution of highway funds.\n  There will be a lot of good arguments made by a lot of Senators as to \nwhat that formula should be. A lot of factors go into it. Obviously, \npopulation density, miles traveled, population growth--a whole host of \nfactors. And next year the Congress will dig down deep, try to figure \nout which factors, which indicators make the most sense, and we can \ndeal with that issue then.\n  That is the time, next year, to deal with the formula. It certainly \nis not here on the floor of the Senate at the end of July, this is not \nthe time to deal with the highway allocation formula. This is not a \nformulation, this is simply correcting a mistake which everyone agrees \nwas a mistake and should be corrected.\n\n  Some might ask, ``Gee, why don't we take up this mistake and correct \nthis\n\n[[Page S9269]]\n\nmistake next year when we take up the highway bill?'' The answer to \nthat is very simple, Mr. President. It is this: The maldistributions, \nthe unjust-enrichment distributions that will be allocated under this \nmistake will not occur this year in 1996, they will occur in the next \nfiscal year, 1997. So those States who unjustly are enriched by a \nclerical bureaucratic mistake will not be receiving any funds until \nafter October 1 of next year, 1997.\n  So now is the time to correct the mistake; that is, before States \nreceive money they should not receive and before States do not receive \nmoney that they should receive. Now is the time to correct the mistake.\n  Sure as we are here tonight, Mr. President, we know next year after \nOctober of 1997--and ISTEA will certainly come up later than October of \nnext year, that is the new highway bill as we deal with the new \nallocation formula--States are not going to want to give back money \nthey improperly receive. They already will have received the dollars. \nSo now is the time in 1996 to correct the mistake so States are in a \nlot better position to deal with what is proper here.\n  I might say, too, Mr. President, that 19 States benefited by this \nmistake; 31 States were injured, harmed by this mistake. The amendment \nI am offering simply returns us to the status quo. It does not tilt the \nformula any way, one way or the other. It is totally a restoration of \nthe status quo; that is, a total correction of a mistake that was made, \nwhich means under this amendment 31 States will be better off, 19 \nStates will be worse off, compared with where they would be if the \nmistake were not corrected. The amendment here simply again is to \ncorrect the mistake. I would like to read the names of the States, Mr. \nPresident, which will benefit under this amendment, that is, returned \nto the status quo, that is, States which will then be receiving what \nthey are supposed to be receiving under the ISTEA bill, the highway \nbill. Here are the States: Alabama, Alaska--so if you are one of these \nStates, you are a State that is being unjustly, unfairly harmed by a \nbureaucratic error. This amendment would add dollars back to correct \nthat mistake so we are back to the status quo.\n\n  Again: Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, \nFlorida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, \nMaine, Massachusetts, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New \nJersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South \nCarolina, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and \nWyoming. I might also add, Puerto Rico would be in that list as well.\n  Very simply, I will sum up, Mr. President, by saying this is an \nattempt to correct a mistake. Everyone admits it is a mistake. This is \nnot a donee-donor question. Now is the proper time to correct the \nmistake because funds have not yet been allocated. They will not be \nallocated--under the mistake--until 1997, fiscal 1997. That is \nbeginning October 1 of next year.\n  So now is the time to correct it. The issue of how we allocate \ndisbursements should be addressed when we take up the highway bill next \nyear. I have given the names of the States that will be benefited under \nthis amendment. Again, they are States who are harmed by the mistake \nbut to be returned to the status quo. Thirty-one States in that \ncategory.\n  Mr. President, I see the chairman of the committee, my very good \nfriend, John Chafee on the floor. And he also supports this amendment \nfor the correction for the States. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I support the amendment by the ranking \nmember of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, the \ndistinguished Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. President, the amendment by the Senator from Montana corrects an \naccounting error made by the Department of the Treasury in 1994.\n  There may be some confusion as to whether under this amendment States \nwill receive full credit for contributions made to the highway trust \nfund. Under the Baucus amendment the States will receive full credit \nfor all contributions made to the highway trust fund but they will \nreceive that credit in the year that they were actually collected \nrather than when they were recorded on the Treasury ledger.\n  I would like to emphasize that this is not an attempt to rewrite the \nhighway funding formula under the so-called ISTEA, the Interstate \nTransportation Act. This is not a highway trust fund formula amendment. \nAnd I do think it is very, very unfortunate that the clerical error has \nresulted in confusion, and indeed understandable irritation for Members \nof this body. Frankly, Mr. President, I greatly wish it had never \noccurred so that we would not be here trying to straighten things out.\n  I realize that some Members of this body believe that the formulas \nthat distribute highway funds are not fair or appropriate. And that is \na legitimate concern. Members will have their chance to make their case \nfor changes in the formula next year when we reauthorize the highway \nprogram. The Environment and Public Works Committee plans to commence \nhearings on the reauthorization of the so-called ISTEA in September of \nthis year. We will continue those hearings next year. We want to get on \nwith this bill. We have to get on with it next year. At that time we \ndefinitely will have arguments over the formula and what should go into \nit.\n  The Senator from Montana ticked off some of those items. For example, \nshould we count the amount of interstate highway mileage, the State's \npopulation, the miles driven, the amount of highway trust fund \ncontributions, the number of deficient bridges? All of those are \nlegitimate things to consider when we deal with the formula.\n  That will be a very healthy debate, I can guarantee everybody here, \nbecause you have donor States who put in more than they get back and \nyou have donee States that receive more than they put in. Legitimately, \nthe States that put in more are distressed. And the States that put in \nless think that, well, this is a National Highway System so you should \nnot get back exactly what you put in. That is OK. We will debate that \nvigorously.\n  But I do believe that it is unfortunate and not appropriate, when we \nare trying to straighten out a bureaucratic error, to change the \ncurrent formula that has been agreed to, was agreed to by Congress in \n1991. The distribution of funds in the highway program structure are \nissues that must be debated on the merits, as I said, when we \nreauthorize the basic legislation.\n  Some would say, ``Well, OK, if you want to straighten out this \nproblem, wait until next spring when you deal with the highway \nreauthorization. Why do we take it up now?'' We are taking it up now \nbecause the problem that we are talking about will be compounded if we \nwait. Now is the time, difficult though it might be. Some might say, \n``Oh, well, in the list that the Senator from Montana read off, Rhode \nIsland will get back some money that they should have gotten, and \nothers will have to restore some of the extra money that they \nreceived.'' As I say, we wish that all had not occurred. But if we \nwait, the problem, as I say, will become more difficult.\n  I would like to raise, Mr. President, a concern regarding the public \nperception of this issue. Failure to approve the amendment by the \nSenator from Montana will mean that an accounting error will generate \nmore than $1 billion in false spending authority. This situation \nobviously will be difficult to explain to taxpayers when they are \nconcerned about reining in Federal spending. Moreover, unless it is \ncorrected, this error will create the image of an irresponsible Federal \nGovernment which cannot correct an error. So I hope we will support \nthis amendment and get on with it, difficult though it might be. I \nthank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment being \noffered by Senator Baucus, and my colleagues Senator Chafee and \nDomenici. Due to the error by the Treasury Department, my home State of \nIowa stands to lose $2,182,000 from the highway trust fund. This \namendment would correct the Treasury Department's error, restoring the \nmoney.\n  I understand that the Treasury Department did not correctly credit \n$1.6 billion to the highway trust fund in fiscal year 1994. The \nTreasury then corrected this error in fiscal year 1995. However, by not \ncorrectly attributing the funds to fiscal year 1994, the Treasury \naction is adversely affecting the\n\n[[Page S9270]]\n\ndistribution of highway funds to 31 States in fiscal year 1997. This is \nunfair. These States are being unfairly penalized through no fault of \ntheir own. They are being penalized by an error by the Treasury \nDepartment.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to join the Senator from Montana, myself, \nand the other cosponsors of this amendment to correct this error. It is \nthe right thing to do.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am somewhat puzzled by this debate \nbecause what has happened is that the error has been corrected. No one \nis saying that there is a problem in the allocation in the bill before \nus. What we are seeing here is an effort to use an appropriations bill \nto try to go back and impose a change on a formula which this year is \nfair to correct a problem which it is asserted existed last year.\n  Let me remind my colleagues of how we came to this point. The \napportionment of highway dollars to States is based in part on the \nactual motor fuel taxes collected in the State. And the law says that \nthe most recent data available will be used.\n  In fiscal year 1996, the most recent data available was an estimate \nof fiscal year 1994 collections. The Secretary of the Treasury \ncertified that that was the data that was available. On the basis of \nthat data and the law, an allocation was made. The Department of the \nTreasury was late in reporting the 1994 actual data collection to the \nDepartment of Transportation and therefore they relied on the data that \nwas available at that time. What we are being asked to do now is to go \nback and change a formula which has already been adjusted.\n  In listening to our colleague from Rhode Island, one would get the \nview that the current appropriations bill before us has an unfair \nallocation of funds under ISTEA or an allocation which is based on old \ndata. But unless I am wrong--and I would be happy to be corrected--that \nis not the case.\n  No one is asserting that this appropriations bill in any way is in \nerror in allocating funds. What is instead being asserted is, that \nsince the most recent data available when this was done last year was \nthe estimated 1994 data, which therefore under law was used, that if \nthe actual 1994 data had been available, that the funding formulas \nwould have generated a different result. Are we, Mr. President, every \nyear, going to go back and second-guess the formula? Or are we going to \nfollow the law?\n\n  Now we have one of these things that, from time-to-time, happens, \nwhere by going back and changing the base-year data, more States \nbenefit than lose. The bottom line is that no one here has asserted \nthat the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary of Transportation \ndid not comply with the law. The law says that the allocation will be \nbased on the most recent data available. It was based on the most \nrecent data available last year.\n  No one asserts that the current formula is wrong. But what is being \nasserted is that, using data that was not available last year, we could \ngo back and reallocate these funds and take an allocation which this \nyear no one disputes is a fair allocation, but we would go back and \ntake money away from States in a formula that no one argues is unfair, \nto basically allocate funds, not according to the law last year, since \nthe estimated 1994 data was the most recent year available, but \naccording to how it would have been allocated if data had been \navailable which was not available.\n  Here is my point: I think you can argue endlessly on these things, \nbut I do not think this is the place where the argument should occur. \nThis is an appropriations bill. Obviously, what we have here is an \nattempt to change the allocation. The amendment changes an allocation, \nwhich no one disputes as being valid, to try to reallocate funds from \nlast year.\n  It is true that nobody here would dispute that if the actual 1994 \ndata was available last year, instead of the estimate, the allocation \nmight have been different. But it was not. The law says very clearly \nthat the allocation is based on the most recent data available. I \nbelieve if we are going to deal with this issue, we need to deal with \nit when we are reauthorizing ISTEA, and we need to deal with it not \njust for this year but we ought to set out a principle. I think it \nmakes absolutely no sense to simply go back and say, if data had been \navailable then, which was not available, the allocation might have been \ndifferent, and therefore take a year where no one disputes the \nallocation and reallocate the money, because 31 States will benefit and \nonly 19 States will lose. I hope we will table this amendment because \nit clearly is legislating on an appropriations bill. I think if we \nstart opening these formulas up to this kind of debate, it is going to \nmake it very, very difficult for us to be able to pass these \nappropriations bills. I am not at this point ready to give a time limit \non this bill. I think we should vote on tabling it, and then I think we \nwill want to look at second-degree amendments.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to enter into the Record a couple \nof letters from the administration which document that a mistake was \nmade. The first is a memorandum from the Department of Treasury. I \nwould like to read several portions of it without reading it in detail.\n\n       In fiscal 1994 an accounting error, described in greater \n     detail below, resulted in a $1.590 billion misallocation of \n     excise taxes against the Highway Trust Fund. This \n     misallocation of excise taxes was corrected in fiscal year \n     1995.\n\n  Another portion reads:\n\n       This change led to a misinterpretation of the information \n     provided to FMS on the IRS Quarterly Certification and \n     resulted in a misallocation of excise taxes between the \n     Highway Trust Fund and General Fund in Fiscal Year 1994. This \n     misallocation of excise taxes was corrected in Fiscal Year \n     1995, debiting the General Fund and crediting the Highway \n     Trust Fund in the amount of $1.590 billion. Procedures have \n     been implemented to assure that future adjustments to the \n     Highway Trust Fund occur in an accurate and timely manner.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this document be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 31, 1996.\n     Memorandum to: Senator John H. Chafee, Chairman, Environment \n         and Public Works Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     From: Linda L. Robertson, Assistant Secretary (Legislative \n         Affairs and Public Liaison).\n     Subject: Correcting the misallocation of excise taxes between \n         the highway trust fund and the general fund.\n       In Fiscal Year 1994, an accounting error, described in \n     greater detail below, resulted in a $1.590 billion \n     misallocation of excise taxes, against the Highway Trust Fund \n     (HTF). This misallocation of excise taxes was corrected in \n     Fiscal Year 1995.\n       The initial transfer of receipts to the Highway Trust Fund \n     is based upon monthly estimates provided to Financial \n     Management Services (FMS) by the Office of Tax Analysis. \n     Subsequently, FMS uses the IRS Quarterly Certification of \n     ``actual'' liability to adjust the Highway Trust Fund balance \n     for any difference between amounts initially transferred and \n     ``actual'' quarterly liability. This adjustment is referred \n     to as the ``Correcting Adjustment.''\n       At the request of OTA, the format of the IRS Quarterly \n     Certifications used to make correcting adjustments to the \n     Highway Trust Fund was changed. This change led to a \n     misinterpretation of the information provided to FMS on the \n     IRS Quarterly Certification and resulted in a misallocation \n     of excise taxes between the Highway Trust Fund and the \n     General Fund in Fiscal Year 1994. This misallocation of \n     excise taxes was corrected in Fiscal Year 1995, debiting the \n     General Fund and crediting the Highway Trust Fund in the \n     amount of $1.590 billion. Procedures have been implemented to \n     assure that future adjustments to the Highway Trust Fund \n     occur in an accurate and timely manner.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, very clearly, the Department of Treasury \nadmits the error, a $1.590 billion miscalculation. To review this, so \nthat Senators understand how this procedure works, by law, there is a \n2-year time lag, which means that because a mistake was made in 1994, \nby definition, 1996 allocations were not made in advance of what the \nformula would\n\n[[Page S9271]]\n\notherwise require, because in 1994, almost $1.6 billion was not \ncredited to the highway trust fund. In 1996, the formula was based upon \nthe amount that is in the 1994 account. Since the 1994 account was \ndeficient by $1.6 billion, by definition, States were not overpaid in \n1996. So no States were overpaid in 1996.\n  Again, as I said, by law, the allocation is made 2 years after the \naccount is so-called certified. Well, in 1995, after the mistake was \ndiscovered, not only were normal 1995 accounts received from States and \nthe highway trust fund credited with the usual amount it should have \nbeen, but in addition to that, the mistake--the $1.6 billion--was added \non top of the 1995 account, which overstated 1997 payments. So the \ncorrection we are trying to make here today is a combination of 1994 \nand 1995, the underpayment in 1994, as well as the overpayment in 1995, \nwhich determine the State allocations in fiscal years 1996 and 1997.\n  I might add, Mr. President, I have another letter from the Department \nof Transportation--actually, from the Federal Highway Administration, \nsigned by Rodney Slater, Administrator.\n  It states in part that it is unable to administratively make the \ncorrection. I can read portions of that, but Senators may read the \nletter. It is a little bit technical and bureaucratic. But the long and \nshort of it is that they admit the mistake and explain what would have \nhappened had the mistake not occurred. They state that it has to be \ncorrected by legislation.\n  I listened with great curiosity to the arguments of the Senator from \nTexas. He, in a sense, was saying that because the 1994 allocation was \ndetermined as it was, and the mistake was made, we should close our \neyes and be blind to any mistake that might have been made. He is \nsaying, by law, the 1996 allocation should be determined by what the \n1994 receipts are, and a mistake was made, but do not look at the \nmistake because that is what the law said in 1994.\n  Mr. President, we are only saying that everyone admits it was a \nmistake. The Department of Treasury documents it was a mistake, as does \nthe Department of Transportation. Senator Warner was on the floor not \nlong ago and also admitted the mistake.\n  I guess the real question is, if it is a mistake, do we correct it or \nnot? That is the issue. Very simply, if a mistake is made, should it be \ncorrected, or should it not be corrected?\n  I submit, Mr. President, to ask the question is to answer it. Of \ncourse, we should correct the mistake. That is what normal, civilized \nhuman beings do--correct mistakes.\n  The other argument I have heard is, well, gee, even if a mistake was \nmade, don't correct it now, correct it next year. Well, we all know, \nMr. President, one of the greatest problems that we as human beings \nhave is procrastinating, putting off what we can do now.\n  Here we are tonight. Let us correct this mistake. We could, I \nsuppose, take it up next year when ISTEA comes up. But ISTEA is the \nhighway bill. The highway bill battle is to determine what the \nallocation should be. We are not arguing what the allocation should be. \nThat is an argument that Senators will engage in next year, in 1997.\n  I might also say--repeating myself--if we don't correct the mistake \nnow, next year the States will receive dollars they should not receive, \nand they are not very likely to want to send the dollars back, even \nthough they know they should.\n  We are really put to a test here, Mr. President. The real test is: \nAre we going to live up to our word or not? I might say, particularly, \nas Senators, that is really the issue here. Sure, if a State is \nunjustly enriched, it is kind of fun to get the extra dollars. But if \nit is unjustly enriched because of a mistake, we all know we should not \naccept those dollars, and we should correct the mistake, according to \nthe formula and understanding that we all had when we passed the \nhighway bill in 1991.\n\n  So that is really the deeper underlying question here tonight. Are we \nSenators going to live up to our word? Or are we going to be greedy and \ntake advantage of a mistake that was made, even though we know that is \nnot fair, that is not the right thing to do? That is the deep \nunderlying question here tonight that we have to ask ourselves.\n  I say, Mr. President, that it is very clear. I am surprised that we \nare debating this. I am surprised that this amendment was not \nautomatically accepted. It was a mistake. We are not in a highway \nallocation fight tonight. This is not a donor-donee issue. We all know \nit is better to correct something sooner than later. So let us correct \nit tonight.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me reiterate that there is no mistake \ninvolved here. In fact, nobody has said there is a mistake involved \nhere.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me make my point, and then I will be happy to. Here \nare the facts: ISTEA says that the allocation of funds among States \nshall be based on the most recent data available. That is what it says. \nThe most recent data available, provided by the Treasury Department, \nwas the data which was, in fact, provided under the law.\n  In fact, if you will read the letter sent to Senator Baucus, \nbasically that letter makes it clear that it is the Department of \nTransportation's position that it does not have authority to use \nanything other than the official accounts of the trust fund maintained \nby the Department of the Treasury in calculating apportionments among \nthe States.\n  Here is the point. When the Treasury gave their estimate, they gave \nthat estimate based on the best data they had available and required by \nthe law. It is true that, if you go back after the fact and take data \nthat they did not have that they could have had, you could have \nallocated funds differently. But to call that an error is simply a \nmisuse of the English language. The Department of Transportation used \nthe best estimate they had based on the data they had.\n  Now, what the Senator from Montana is trying to do is to say that, \nbecause they did not have data then which they now have, that we should \nnow go back and alter allocations. No one disputes that the 1997 \nformula, which is in the bill before us, is based on the newest data, \nwhich no one disputes as being the best available data that apparently \neveryone is satisfied with, no one says that the allocation of funds in \nthis bill are in any way unfair for fiscal year 1997. If they do, I \nhave not heard it.\n  But what the Senator is saying is that because the Treasury did not \nhave final 1994 data in 1996 when they did the estimate, and because \nthey gave the best data available, complied with the letter and the \nspirit of the law, that knowing now what that data turned out to be \nafter the fact that we could go back last year and rewrite the formula.\n  Clearly, ISTEA provides no authority whatsoever to do that, and what \nis being sought here is rewriting ISTEA. This is legislation on an \nappropriations bill. This is taking an allocation for 1997, that no one \ndisputes as being valid, and changing it to reallocate funds to reflect \nan allocation that would have occurred had the Department of \nTransportation had data which was not available.\n  It seems to me that this is gamesmanship that we can engage in \nendlessly. Let me give you an example.\n  Next year we may have the final 1995 data. Next year we might even \nhave the 1996 data. It would be possible for this Senator or any other \nSenator next year to stand up and say, ``When the allocation was done \nfor 1997, the Department of the Treasury relied on 1995 data, but \nactually, if they had known what the 1996 tax collections would have \nbeen, they could have had a different allocation.''\n  My point being, this amendment could be offered every single year \nbecause there is a lag in available data that the Treasury is able to \nprovide the Department of Transportation to do these estimates. What we \nhave done in the past is simply each year made the fairest estimate \nthat we could make. But I am not aware that we have ever gone back \nretroactively and said, if Treasury had had newer data and if they had \nprovided it to the Department of Transportation data that we now know \nbut was not known then, could not have been known then, that last \nyear's allocation could be rewritten.\n  I hope my colleagues will understand and agree with me that next year \nthis\n\n[[Page S9272]]\n\nsame amendment could be offered because next year we will have the \nactual data for the next year in this series--1995-1996. We could stand \nup and argue that the actual allocation in the bill before us--not last \nyear--is wrong because it is based on 1995 data which is the best data \navailable but that next year when we get 1996 data it might produce a \ndifferent allocation.\n  The point is that while 31 States in fact do benefit, some very \nslightly, by this reallocation, this amendment could be offered every \nsingle year to every Department of Transportation allocation of funds \nunder ISTEA because each year we get a new data point. You could take \nthat data point which was not available when the funds were allocated \nby the formula, but, if it had been available, the allocation would \nhave been different.\n  Do we want to do this every single year? Am I to stand up next year \nwhen the 1996 data is available and say had we known in writing in the \n1997 allocation what the actual 1996 data was, which we do not know \ntoday, that the allocation would have been different and Texas would \nhave gotten more money and, therefore, I want to go back retroactively \nand take money in the 1998 bill away from some other State, perhaps \nMontana, to give to Texas?\n  I think this is a very, very bad precedent, and it is something that \ncould be done every single year. That is the point. I hope that we will \nnot do this because we are setting a precedent that it seems to me \nsimply leaves chaos in the allocation of these funds.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas--by the way, one of \nthe biggest beneficiaries of this bureaucratic snafu, his State, gets \nmore dollars as a result of this bureaucratic snafu than almost any \nother State.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is not correct. California loses the most dollars \nunder your amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I said one of the most. I did not say ``the.''\n  He is saying that, under the law, the allocation is made according to \nthe best data available. The fact is the data was available and is \navailable in 1994. Do you know what happened? Some bureaucrat punched \nthe wrong keys. So the allocation was put over to the general fund \ninstead of the highway trust fund. The data is always available. It is \ncollected. Just some bureaucrat, somebody, made a mistake and punched \nthe wrong buttons in the computer. So the allocations from States, \ngasoline receipts from States, a portion of it, was put in the wrong \naccount. It was put in the general fund, not the trust fund. The data \nwas available.\n  More importantly, I am astounded at the argument of the Senator from \nTexas. The Senator from Texas who rails against bureaucracy, who rails \nagainst the Federal Government, is standing here tonight basically \nstanding up for the bureaucratic ``snafu protection act.'' As he says, \nif a bureaucrat makes a mistake, we do not correct it. If the \nbureaucrat makes a mistake, we do not correct it, and we do not come \nback here on the floor and try to correct the mistake. I am astounded, \nabsolutely astounded, that the Senator from Texas would stand up and \nsay we should let a bureaucrat who makes a snafu continue the effect of \nthat mistake and do not correct the mistake even though the result is \n$1.6 billion of unfairly distributed highway trust funds.\n  That is essentially what he is saying. Essentially that is what he is \nsaying. Do not correct the mistake. If we come back here next year and \nfind a mistake, we should not correct it.\n  I hope we do not come back here next year and correct this mistake \nagain. The Department of Treasury has said, and I take them at that \ntheir word, in a memo they sent up to us here tonight, ``Procedures \nhave been implemented to assure that future adjustments to the highway \ntrust fund occur in an accurate and timely manner.''\n  Now no one can guarantee they will not make a mistake again. I would \nguess tonight there are a lot of red-faced folks over there in the \nDepartment of Treasury perhaps watching this debate saying, ``Oh, my \ngosh, how do we make that mistake? How in the world did that happen? \nBoy, don't we have egg on our face.'' It is true they do. They made a \nbooboo, a $1.6 billion mistake.\n  So all we are saying is let us correct it. The Senator is wrong when \nhe says this is an allocation fight tonight. It is not that. Nobody who \nis listening to this debate believes it is. Nobody who is listening to \nthis debate believes the argument that this is an allocation fight. \nThis is simply an effort to correct a mistake. That is all it is, pure \nand simple.\n  Now somebody can come up with some kind of sophistry, argument, turn \non the tail and come back around, and so forth, to try to confuse \npeople. This Senator is not trying to confuse anybody. This Senator is \ntrying to very plainly ask the Senate to correct a mistake that was \nmade--and this is another point, Mr. President--so that when we go into \nISTEA next year there is a better taste in people's mouths; that \nSenators will be more inclined to know that the base is fair.\n  I tell you, Mr. President, if this mistake is not corrected, there is \ngoing to be a lot of bitterness in that debate next year as we begin to \ntry to figure out what the correct allocation is because Senators will \nknow that a mistake that should have been corrected was not corrected \nand we are starting off basically with a base that is the result of a \nbig snafu and that snafu is compounded every cycle.\n  I do not think we want that. I think we want to start off on a level \nplaying field, and the level playing field will be the restoration of \nwhat the formula is supposed to be and that will be the case if this \nmistake is corrected.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Grassley and \nBingaman as cosponsors to the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I do not know that we are gaining very much \nin dragging this dead cat back and forth across the table here, but let \nme go back to the point which I think is relevant.\n  Where is this snafu? I see no documentation of a snafu.\n  Let me go back and outline exactly what the law says and how it works \nand make clear what the Senator is calling a bureaucratic snafu, the \npressing of a button by a mindless, nameless bureaucrat. If the Senator \nhas data to show that, if the Senator has documentation to show that a \nbureaucrat pushed the wrong button, this Senator would like to see it. \nBut I do not have it.\n  Now, here is what I understand the facts to be. Under ISTEA, the \nDepartment of Treasury, based on the newest data available to them, \ngives an estimate to the Department of Transportation as to how much in \nhighway trust funds is collected by States.\n  When this estimate was given for last year's appropriation, the \nDepartment of Treasury did not have the final 1994 data, as I \nunderstand it. If someone has evidence to the contrary, I would like to \nsee it. But based on everything that I have seen, based on all the \ncorrespondence that is available, the Treasury Department, based on the \nnewest data they had, gave an estimate of tax collections by State to \nthe Department of Transportation, which, based on that data, which at \nthat point, to the best of my knowledge or anyone else's knowledge, was \nthe best data that was available, on the basis of that data the \nDepartment of Transportation allocated funds in last year's \nappropriations bill which in fact we voted on and it became law and the \nfunds were allocated.\n  What is being called a snafu here is that based on the best data they \nhad last year, the Department of the Treasury made an estimate, and if \nthey had data that is now available 1 year later they would have made a \ndifferent estimate and the allocation formula would have been \ndifferent. But that is not a snafu. Basically, they were using the best \ndata they had last year just as we are using the best data we have this \nyear.\n  My point is that it is distinctly possible, in fact probable, likely, \nthat next year when we have 1995 and 1996 data we will find the \nallocation used for 1997 would have been different had we had this \ndata, which we did not have this year.\n\n[[Page S9273]]\n\n  The point being each and every year we can go back and second-guess \nlast year's estimate based on data that the estimators did not have. I \nwould be able, if we set this principle, to offer an amendment to next \nyear's appropriation based on actual data that will be available next \nyear which is not available this year to say that the formula this year \nwould have been different had we had another year of data. And it will \nbe. Invariably it will be.\n  There is no mistake in the current allocation based on the newest and \nbest estimate we have, but what the Senator from Montana is saying is \nthat the estimate made last year was made on the data which was \navailable then. I do not know that he is arguing a conspiracy by the \nTreasury. I hear the word snafu, pressed the wrong button, but I do not \nhave any data to substantiate that, and I would be willing to look at \nit if there is data. But based on everything they knew, the Treasury \nmade an estimate last year, and on the basis of that estimate we \nallocated money.\n  Based on everything they know this year, they made an estimate, and \nwe are allocating money again. But if we are going to go back and \nchange this year's formula based on new data that was not available \nlast year, why can we not do that next year and the next year and the \nnext year?\n  The whole purpose of this system is to take the best data available \nand allocate funds on the basis of it. That is what, based on all the \ninformation that I have, the Department of the Transportation did. And \nrelying on this data--and the law requires the Department of \nTransportation to rely on this data--they allocated funds. Now the \nSenator is saying a year later that if we had had new data that has \nsince become available, the allocation would be different. He is right. \nBut the point is the same will be true next year about this year. The \nsame will be true year after next about next year. If we are going to \nget into a situation where every year we are going to look back at the \nlast allocation based on data that was not available when the \nallocation was made, we are going to be able to reestimate everything.\n  Was it a snafu that the estimate they had last year based on the best \ndata turned out not to be right when they got the final data? I do not \nthink it was a snafu. It was an estimate based on what they had. It is \nno more a snafu than the data we are using this year, when next year we \nhave an additional year, will clearly be different. And by the same \nlogic I could stand up here and say it was a snafu last year. Based on \nthe data the Treasury had last year, we had an allocation of money, but \nnow 1 year later with actual data they did not have, I want to go back \nand reestimate the allocation.\n  I think we are inviting chaos if we go down this road because we \ncould do it every single year. Was the estimate last year more \ninaccurate than the estimate this year will turn out to be? I do not \nknow. Maybe it was. Maybe it will be less inaccurate than the estimate \nthis year will turn out to be. The point is, the law requires the use \nof the best available data. Based on everything I know, that was done.\n  The Senator talks about snafus, about pushing the wrong key on the \ncomputer. I do not know about any of those things. I see no \ndocumentation whatsoever. All I have seen documentation on is that, \nbased on the best data they had, the Treasury made an estimate. We \nallocated funds on it. Now that they have another year of data, if they \nwere making the estimate today, it would be different.\n  That is like saying, if I am predicting what is going to happen next \nyear, that it is a snafu that I have imperfect knowledge relative to \nwhat I will have next year after I have lived out the year. I do not \ncall that a snafu. I simply call it having to make decisions on the \nbest data that is available.\n  I think this is a fundamental issue. I think many of my colleagues \nstarted this debate saying there was a mistake made in last year's \nestimation because they did not have data which we now have. It just so \nhappens, in that mistake, 31 States gain and 19 States lose. The point \nis the exact same facts will exist next year and the next year and the \nnext year and the next year, and maybe it will be other States who will \ngain next year and other States who will lose. But we are creating a \nchaotic situation if we are going to try to go back each year and redo \nlast year's formula, based on data that was not available last year.\n  That is why, while this is not be-all and end-all of the planet, this \nis a bad principle and it is a principle we are going to end up \nrefighting every year.\n  In fact, if we start down this road, we might as well have a 1-year \nlag of collecting the money to allocate it because we are going to end \nup, every single year, rewriting this formula. Because every Senator is \ngoing to check the allocation based on the new data that will be \navailable next year, reestimate the allocation this year, and all those \nwho will gain are going to stand up, as our dear colleague is saying, \nand say, ``There was a snafu. Somebody pushed the wrong computer key. \nSomebody made a mistake. They predicted the future and the future \nturned out to be different, and therefore we ought to go back and \ncorrect that.''\n  The point is, that is not how the system works. If we are going to do \nthat, we are going to create chaos, and that is why I hope we will not \ndo it.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am here today to oppose the amendment \nbeing offered even though my State, Florida, would marginally benefit \nfrom its passage.\n  This amendment is said to correct a bureaucratic error--a mistake \nwhich resulted in many donee States receiving for 1 year less than what \nthey thought they were entitled to under the law.\n  Well, it is extremely hard for me to be sympathetic to this argument. \nI know a good number of States--donor States--who, for the last 5 \nyears, feel they got far less than that amount to which they were \nentitled. They would call the formulas enacted in law during ISTEA a \nmistake.\n  I believe the amendment now being considered appropriately highlights \nthe problems that result from a muddled, inefficient, and overly \nbureaucratic Federal highway program.\n  So, not only is it my intention to oppose this amendment tonight, but \nit is my intention to be a leader in the fight next year to move our \nNations' transportation program away from the Federal highway program \nthat exists today.\n  It is high time to harness the ingenuity of State officials and local \ngovernments, the entrepreneurialism of private industry, and the \nstrength of the financial markets to enhance the Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure. It is time to recognize that the \nnational interest may be best served by allowing States to assume the \nprimary role in transportation uninhibited by Federal mandates, the \nredistribution of States gas tax dollars.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues next year to return the \nprimary role in transportation to our States.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I do not want to prolong this either, but \nI would much rather read facts into the Record than sit here in a \nquorum call. So I will correct the misinformation we just heard from \nthe Senator from Texas.\n  The Senator from Texas is trying to imply this is an error in \nestimating the highway trust fund, it is not a bureaucratic error. I \nwould like to address that by reading the memorandum to the chairman of \nthe committee from the Department of the Treasury, dated today.\n  There is a little bit of bureaucratese in here, but, if you listen \nclosely, you can tell this is not an estimate problem, it is a \nbureaucratic problem. I will read from the beginning.\n\n       In fiscal year 1994, an accounting error, described in \n     greater detail below--\n\n  It did not say an error in estimating, in estimating receipts. It \nsays ``an accounting error.'' An accounting error was made--\n\n     Resulted in a $1.590 billion misallocation of excise taxes \n     against the Highway Trust Fund. . . .\n\n  Then it says:\n\n       This misallocation of excise taxes was corrected in Fiscal \n     Year 1995.\n\n\n[[Page S9274]]\n\n\n  Then going on:\n\n       The initial transfer of receipts to the Highway Trust Fund \n     is based upon monthly estimates provided to Financial \n     Management Services . . . by the Office of Tax Analysis. \n     Subsequently, FMS uses the IRS Quarterly Certification of \n     ``actual'' liability to adjust the Highway Trust Fund balance \n     for any difference between accounts initially transferred and \n     ``actual'' quarterly liability. This adjustment was referred \n     to as the ``Correcting Adjustment.''\n\n  More importantly:\n\n       At the request of OTA, [that is the Office of Tax Analysis, \n     in the Treasury] the format of the IRS Quarterly \n     Certifications used to make correcting adjustments to the \n     Highway Trust Fund was changed.\n\n  I will repeat that statement.\n\n       At the request of OTA, the format of the IRS Quarterly \n     Certifications used to make correcting adjustments to the \n     Highway Trust Fund was changed.\n\n  The format was changed.\n\n       This [format] change led to a misinterpretation of the \n     information provided to FMS on the IRS Quarterly \n     Certification and resulted in a misallocation of excise taxes \n     between the Highway Trust Fund and the General Fund in Fiscal \n     Year 1994.\n\n  The problem is not a miscalculation of the estimates. It was a \nmistake made because of a change in format. Somebody over there did not \nunderstand the new format and took the data, the correct data, but put \nit in the wrong account.\n\n       This misallocation of excise taxes was corrected in Fiscal \n     Year 1995, debiting the General Fund and crediting the \n     Highway Trust Fund in the amount of $1.590 billion. \n     Procedures have been implemented to assure that future \n     adjustments to the Highway Trust Fund occur in an accurate \n     and timely manner.\n\n  This has nothing to do with what the right estimate is, nothing at \nall. This has everything to do with just a bureaucratic mistake in \nmisinterpreting a new format, that is all this is. It is very clearly a \nclerical, bureaucratic error. It is not an error in estimating tax \nreceipts, not at all. It is an error made in computing the adjustments \nthat were made between the Highway Trust Fund and the General Fund. \nThat is all this is, stated clearly by the Department of the Treasury. \nThat is the technical argument.\n  The basic argument, Mr. President, is: Here we are. This is the end \nof July. This is 1996. What special is going on right now in America? \nIt is the Olympics. In the world? It is the Olympics down in Atlanta, \nwhere people compete fairly. They compete according to the rules, and \nthere are winners and losers, according to the rules. Certainly \nSenators, if they want, can take advantage of a mistake, take advantage \nof something that is unfairly given to them at the expense of somebody \nelse. Or they can live by the rules, live by the rules and not take \nadvantage of an ill-begotten gain but rather say, yes, that is not \nfair, let us correct this, when the real battle on highway allocation \nof trust funds is next year when Congress takes up the transportation \nbill.\n  That is what this is all about, very simply, very plainly. Are we \ngoing to correct a mistake or are those Senators who are enriched by \nthe mistake going to take advantage of that mistake? Or are they going \nto say, yes, a mistake is made, let us correct the mistake and let us \ngo on.\n  I made a point earlier, which I think is one worth remembering. That \nis, if this mistake is not corrected, it is going to sour the debate \nnext year when Congress takes up the highway bill, because Senators are \ngoing to know the debate begins not with what it was supposed to be, \nnot as was determined by the 1991 highway bill. Rather, it would be \nbased as a result of a bureaucratic snafu, and I do not think we want \nthat. I think we want to correct the mistake.\n  I urge my colleagues to just basically correct the mistake and get \nready for the battle next year when we take up the highway bill in \nearnest, because that is the proper place to do all that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letter, dated July 31, \n1996, from Linda Robertson to Senator Chafee, be printed in the Record, \nand I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                  Washington, D.C., July 31, 1996.\n     Memorandum to: Senator John H. Chafee, Chairman, Environment \n         and Public Works Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     From: Linda L. Robertson, Assistant Secretary, (Legislative \n         Affairs and Public Liaison).\n     Subject: Correcting the misallocation of excise taxes between \n         the highway trust fund and the general fund.\n       In Fiscal Year 1994, an accounting error, described in \n     greater detail below, resulted in a $1.590 billion \n     misallocation of excise taxes, against the Highway Trust Fund \n     (HTF). This misallocation of excise taxes was corrected in \n     Fiscal Year 1995.\n       The initial transfer of receipts to the Highway Trust Fund \n     is based upon monthly estimates provided to Financial \n     Management Services (FMS) by the Office of Tax Analysis. \n     Subsequently, FMS uses the IRS Quarterly Certification of \n     ``actual'' liability to adjust the Highway Trust Fund balance \n     for any difference between amounts initially transferred and \n     ``actual'' quarterly liability. This adjustment is referred \n     to as the ``Correcting Adjustment.''\n       At the request of OTA, the format of the IRS Quarterly \n     Certifications used to make correcting adjustments to the \n     Highway Trust Fund was changed. This change led to a \n     misinterpretation of the information provided to FMS on the \n     IRS Quarterly Certification and resulted in a misallocation \n     of excise taxes between the Highway Trust Fund and the \n     General Fund in Fiscal Year 1994. This misallocation of \n     excise taxes was corrected in Fiscal Year 1995, debiting the \n     General Fund and crediting the Highway Trust Fund in the \n     amount of $1.590 billion. Procedures have been implemented to \n     assure that future adjustments to the Highway Trust Fund \n     occur in an accurate and timely manner.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, one of the things I always try to tell my \nchildren is you should never debate about facts. You go look up facts, \nyou debate about ideas, you debate about what they mean.\n  Our dear colleague from Montana just quoted from correspondence that, \nso far as I can determine in talking to the majority and the minority \nside, no one else has.\n  What I would like to propose is this--and I would like to have a copy \nof it. What I would like to propose is that we set this amendment aside \nto give all of us an opportunity to talk to the Treasury Department in \nthe morning and ascertain exactly what the facts are so that we can \ndebate tomorrow where we all are dealing with the same facts.\n  We are all, obviously, entitled to our ideas. Jefferson once said \ngood people with the same facts are going to disagree. But what I think \nis important that we do is that we be certain that we are all dealing \nwith the same facts. What I will promise my colleague is that I will, \nobviously, read this memo, and I will talk tomorrow to the Treasury \nDepartment to ascertain exactly what happened.\n  All of the documentation that I have that was made available to my \noffice by the Department of Transportation shows that this simply was a \nbest available estimate, which, obviously, is different now that we \nhave additional data, as you would expect it to be. But I would \ncertainly be willing to look at additional information from the \nTreasury Department. I think probably the best thing to do is to set \nthis amendment aside and give us all an opportunity to talk to the \nTreasury Department to try to ascertain what the facts are. That would \nbe my suggestion.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, to say that it is a complex issue is an \nunderstatement. I am not sure everybody on this floor fully understands \nwhat we are debating. But let me tell you what I do understand about \nit, and I welcome the comments of either of the managers or the author \nof the amendment.\n  We appropriate trust funds 2 years after we receive them. For \ninstance, whatever we took in in the trust fund in 1994 is actually \nallocated to the States in 1996. That is my understanding. As I say, I \ninvite anybody to correct anything I say. I just want everyone to \nunderstand what we are talking about.\n  So whatever the Treasury Department takes in in gasoline taxes, which \nis called the trust fund, in 1994, is allocated for use in 1996. So in \n1994, apparently the Treasury Department made an error and took in $1.5 \nbillion more\n\n[[Page S9275]]\n\nthan they said they were going to have, and rather than try to correct \nthe error at the time it was made, they said, ``Well, we will just save \nthis until next year. We'll put it in the 1995 allocation.''\n  Now, bear in mind that when you are allocating money in 1995, you are \ntalking about money that the States are going to get in 1996, simply \nbecause we appropriate money a year in advance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if I might, a slight correction, 1995 is \nin 1997.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Please feel free to interrupt.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The 1995 determination affects the 1997 allocation, 2 \nyears later.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Say that again, please.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The allocation made to States is determined by the \nreceipts received 2 years earlier. So 1994 determines 1996, and the \namount in the trust fund in 1995 determines 1997.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. You appropriate the money in 1995 for 1996, don't you?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That is correct?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That is right, you allocate it 2 years later than the \nTreasury Department receives it. But the basic problem here is that the \nTreasury Department underestimated by $1.5 billion 1994 receipts.\n  So when it came time to appropriate the money from the trust fund in \n1995, it was appropriated, not realizing the fact that they had $1.5 \nbillion more than they thought they had. So this year, 1996, the States \ngot an allocation of 1994 trust funds that was $1.5 billion short--$1.6 \nbillion, to be precise.\n  Here is my problem. My State tells me that by the time the $1.5 \nbillion error had been discovered, everybody knew it, and the great \nState of Arkansas got less money in 1996 than we were entitled to, and \nwe were told that we would get it made up in 1997, which is the bill we \nare debating here tonight, the 1997 bill.\n  So the 1997 money is being allocated here this evening and, lo and \nbehold, an amendment is offered that would cause my State to be about \n$6.5 million short. Now, that is not a lot of money to a very many \npeople. However, in the State of Arkansas, $6.5 million is a pretty \ngood hunk of change.\n  So Arkansas got less money in 1996 than we were supposed to get. We \ndid not get our share of that $1.5 billion. And now they are taking it \naway from us again in 1997.\n  So, as I say, that is my understanding so far. And on that basis, of \ncourse, I do not have any choice but to vote against the Senator from \nMontana's amendment. I am hoping that a lot of other people will do \nlikewise.\n  I also note that the managers of this bill would like to get this \nthing done tonight so they can get out of here. I do not want to slow \nthings up. But I would like, when all this conversation ends over here, \nto have somebody to comment on the things I have said, either refute \nthe statement I made that we got less money in 1996 than we were \nsupposed to get, or that we got more. But you should not penalize my \nState in 1997 and give us less money if we got penalized last year. \nThat is what we call a double whammy. And it is not right and it is not \nfair.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, at 7:45 I will make a motion to table \nthe Baucus amendment and ask for the yeas and nays at that time. I say \nthat at this point in order to give Members due warning and opportunity \nto return to the Hill. And I say this. We will make no other \ncompensation for people being off the Hill until we finish this bill \ntonight.\n  Everybody ought to be alert to the fact we may have votes at any \ntime, and we are not going to delay a vote henceforth. But this vote \nwill be called at 7:45. I, at that point, will make a motion to table. \nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized at that \ntime to make that motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . TRAIN WHISTLE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       No funds shall be made available to implement the \n     regulations issued under section 20153(b) of title 49, United \n     States Code, requiring audible warnings to be sounded by a \n     locomotive horn at highway-rail grade crossings, unless--\n       (1) in implementing the regulations or providing an \n     exception to the regulations under section 20153(c) of such \n     title, the Secretary of Transportation takes into account, \n     among other criteria--\n       (A) the interests of the communities that have in effect \n     restrictions on the sounding of a locomotive horn at highway-\n     rail grade crossings as of July 30, 1996; and\n       (B) the past safety record at each grade crossing involved; \n     and\n       (2) whatever the Secretary determines that supplementary \n     safety measures (as that term is defined in section 20153(a) \n     of title 49, United States Code) are necessary to provide an \n     exception referred to in paragraph (1), the Secretary--\n       (A) having considered the extent to which local communities \n     have established public awareness initiatives and highway-\n     rail crossing traffic law enforcement programs allows for a \n     period of not to exceed 3 years, beginning on the date of \n     that determination, for the installation of those measures; \n     and\n       (B) works in partnership with affected communities to \n     provide technical assistance and to develop a reasonable \n     schedule for the installation of those measures.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to give \nlocal communities time to work with the Department of Transportation \nand the Federal Railroad Administration to find grade crossing safety \nmechanisms that meet their needs.\n  Without this amendment, the Federal Government, beginning in November \nof this year, will impose a one-size-fits-all standard on every \ncommunity in America with a railroad grade crossing. Many communities \nhave banned the blowing of train whistles. But the Federal Government \nwould preempt these local laws and impose a requirement that trains \nbegin blowing their whistles within one quarter mile of any crossing \nthat does not have the most expensive grade crossing safety equipment.\n  Without this amendment, every community in America that doesn't have \nthe fancy, top-of-the-line grade crossing safety gates will be forced \nto go out and immediately spend upwards of $300,000+ to install this \nequipment, or face Federal preemption. This means small communities of \nseveral hundred will have to find $300,000 for this equipment, or see \ntheir local train whistle bans preempted by the Federal Government.\n  Under current law, on November 2 of this year, all towns without \ncomplex and expensive grade safety requirements will be required to \nlift their train whistle bans. What this means for some towns in Oregon \nand across the country, is that day and night the communities are going \nto be barraged with train whistles.\n  These communities are essentially being blackmailed by cacophony into \nraising taxes and putting up exorbitant amounts of money to install \nhighly sophisticated safety measures--when in many cases, much simpler \nmeasures would have the same desired results.\n  My friends, there is a better way to do this. Safety is paramount, \nbut under these train whistle requirements, what we are seeing is \ncookie-cutter solutions to safety that may not be appropriate for all \ncommunities.\n  Many communities can make substantial improvements in safety through \npublic education, highway markings, and signage, but right now it looks \nlike their only choice is a costly four quadrant gates--otherwise, they \nare going to be doomed to whistling trains.\n  The original legislation, while placing an important emphasis on \ntrain safety, left out one key issue and that is community involvement \nin the decision making on train whistle bans.\n  My very simple amendment would encourage the Department of \nTransportation to work with communities to develop effective local \nsolutions.\n  First, the Department would be required to take into account the \ninterests of affected communities and the past safety record at the \ngrade crossing involved when determining how to implement safety \nrequirements.\n  Second, where the Department determines that a grade crossing is not \nsufficiently safe, my amendment requires them to work in partnership \nwith communities to develop reasonable safety requirements.\n  In Oregon, there are two communities in particular that are concerned \nabout the train whistle ban requirements, Pendleton and the Dalles. In \nthese communities, trains may pass through certain neighborhoods every \nfew minutes. Trains are required to blow their whistles one-quarter \nmile before reaching a grade crossing. Clearly this is a recipe for \nchaos.\n  I think that it is important that the Department of Transportation \nwork with these communities to develop effective and timely safety \nmeasures, instead of mandating costly and perhaps unnecessary grade \ncrossing equipment or threaten them with nonstop whistles.\n  My amendment will do just this and I urge the Senate to support its \ninclusion in this legislation.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, this amendment provides important \ndirection to the Department of Transportation with regard to the \nimplementation of a provision of the Swift Rail Development Act of \n1994.\n  Under this 1994 law, the Federal Government is required to develop \nregulations that direct trains to sound their whistles at all hours of \nthe day and night at most at-grade railroad crossings around the \ncountry, unless the local communities can afford to act on a specified \nlist of alternatives. The Swift Rail Development Act will require \ntrains to blow their whistles at approximately 168,000 railroad \ncrossings in the U.S. and more than 9,900 in Illinois--including about \n2,000 in the Chicago area and 1,000 in Cook County alone.\n  This provision was inserted into the 1994 law without debate or \ndiscussion. Communities had no input into the process, even though it \nwill be communities that will be most affected.\n  I am acutely aware of the need to improve the safety of railroad \ncrossings. A recent tragedy in my home State involving a train and a \nschool bus in Fox River Grove, IL, killed seven children and shattered \nthe lives of many more families. According to statistics published by \nthe Department of Transportation, someone is hit by a train every 90 \nminutes. In 1994, there were nearly 2,000 injuries and 615 fatalities \ncaused by accidents at railroad crossings around the country. Clearly, \nensuring the safety of our rail crossings is imperative.\n  The Swift Rail Development Act mandates that trains sound their \nwhistles at every railroad crossing around the country that does not \nconform to specific safety standards. It does not take into \nconsideration the affect of this action on communities, nor does it \nrequire the Department of Transportation to take into consideration the \npast safety records at affected at-grade crossings.\n  Requiring trains to blow their whistles at every crossing would have \na considerable affect on people living near these crossings. It is \nunclear, however, that there would be a commensurate improvement in \nsafety. In Fox River Grove, for example, the engineer blew his whistle \nas he approached the road crossing, but the school bus did not move.\n\n  At many railroad crossings in Illinois and elsewhere, accidents never \nor rarely occur, while some crossings are the sites of frequent \ntragedies. Just as we do not impose the same safety mandates on every \ntraffic intersection in the country, we should not universally require \ntrains to blow their whistles at every railroad crossing in the \ncountry.\n  When transportation officials decide to make safety improvements at a \nhighway intersection, they consider a wide range of factors, including \nits accident history, traffic patterns, and conditions in the \nsurrounding area. Every intersection is a case study.\n\n[[Page S9277]]\n\nThere are guidelines, but not inflexible rules.\n  The approach to railroad crossing safety should be no less reasoned. \nThe train whistle should be one tool in the transportation safety \nofficial's regulatory repertoire; it should not be the only one. \nBecause every community has a different history and different needs, I \ndo not believe that a one-size-fits-all, top-down approach to railroad \ncrossing safety is appropriate.\n  In Dupage County, IL, for example, there are 159 public railroad \ncrossings. In 1994, there were accidents at only 18 of these crossings, \nand 45 have not experienced an accident in at least 40 years. On one of \nMETRA's commuter rail lines, 64 trains per day pass through 35 \ncrossings. In the last 5 years, there have been a total of three \naccidents and one fatality along the entire length of this corridor.\n  Every one of the crossings on this METRA commuter line has a whistle \nban in place to preserve the quiet of the surrounding communities. The \nimposition of a Federal train whistle mandate on this line would, \ntherefore, have a considerable negative impact on the quality of life \nof area residents. The safety benefits, on the other hand, would, at \nbest, be only marginal.\n  METRA's Chicago to Fox Lake line has 54 crossings and is used by 86 \ntrains per day. A whistle ban is in place on 37 of these crossings. \nBetween 1991 and 1995, there were a total of 13 accidents on this line, \nwith five injuries and one fatality.\n  In Des Plaines, IL, one of my constituents reports that she lives \nnear five crossings. In the last 11 years, there has been only one \naccident at any of these crossings. She will hear a train whistle at \nleast 64 times per day and night.\n  In Arlington Heights, IL, there are four crossings in the downtown \narea about 300 feet away from one another. 5,400 residents live within \none-half mile of downtown, and 3,500 people commute to the area every \nday for work. Sixty-three commuter and four freight trains pass through \nArlington Heights every weekday between the hours of 5:30 am and 1:15 \nam.\n  Train whistles are blown at nearly 150 decibels, and depending on the \nweather, they can be heard for miles. According to one Burlington \nNorthern railroad conductor, a train traveling from Downers Grove, IL \nto La Vergne, IL--a distance of approximately 12 miles--would have to \nblow its whistle 124 times. 144 trains travel this route every day.\n  Mr. President, the residents of these communities, and others across \nIllinois and the country, are confused by the 1994 law that will \nrequire train whistles to sound at all hours of the day and night in \ntheir communities--in some cases hundreds of times per day--at railroad \ncrossings that have not experienced accidents in decades, if ever.\n  Under a Federal train whistle mandate, home-owners in many of these \ncommunities would experience a decline in their property values, or an \nincrease in their local taxes in order to pay for expensive safety \nimprovements. The 1994 law, in this respect, represents either a taking \nof private property value, or an unfunded mandate on local communities.\n  The train whistle mandate places the entire burden on the community. \nTrains will keep rolling through quiet, densely populated towns at all \nhours of the night, and both the railroads and the passengers will \nexperience no disruptions.\n\n  In aviation, by contrast, airline flights are routinely routed to \nminimize the disturbance to surrounding communities. Flight curfews are \nestablished, and restrictions are placed on certain types of aircraft \nin efforts to minimize the disruption to area residents. These \nrestrictions place burdens on airlines, passengers, and the \ncommunities; it is a joint effort.\n  The pending amendment provides the Department of Transportation with \nimportant direction on how to implement the train whistle law in a more \nrational and flexible manner. It directs the Secretary of \nTransportation to consider the interests of affected communities, as \nwell as the past safety records at affected railroad crossings. The \nconcerns of local communities must be heard--not just the sounds of \ntrain whistles.\n  It also addresses safety concerns. In situations where railroad \ncrossings are determined not to meet the supplementary safety \nrequirements, communities will have up to a maximum of 3 years to \ninstall additional safety measures before the train whistle mandate \ntakes affect. In these situations, the Department of Transportation \nwill work in partnership with affected communities to develop a \nreasonable schedule for the installation of additional safety measures.\n  Mr. President, I have been concerned about the implementation of the \nSwift Rail Development Act since Karen Heckmann, one of my \nconstituents, first brought it to my attention more than a year ago. \nSince that time, I have spoken and met with mayors, officials, and \nconstituents from Illinois communities, and visited areas that would be \nmost severely affected. In response to their concerns, I have written \nseveral letters to, and met with Transportation Secretary Pena and \nother officials numerous times, and have been working with the \nDepartment of Transportation to ensure that they implement the 1994 law \nin a manner that both works for communities and protects safety.\n  This amendment provides important congressional direction to the \nDepartment of Transportation that is consistent with the ongoing \ndiscussions that I, and other members of Congress, continue to have \nwith the Department. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this \nimportant amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I was pleased to join with Senator \nWyden to cosponsor an amendment concerning an issue of great importance \nto a number of my constituents. Many of them have contacted me about \nthe 1994 Swift Rail Development Act [SRDA]. As you know, the SRDA \nallows for Federal preemption of local train whistle bans so that all \ntrains would begin sounding their whistles one-quarter mile before \nreaching any grade crossing.\n  My home State of Massachusetts has 88 grade crossings in some 27 \ncommunities whose whistle bans would be preempted by this law. Many of \nthese communities have good safety record: From January 1988 through \nJune 1994, the Federal Railroad Administration [FRA] noted 34 accidents \ninvolving one fatality and 15 injuries at these crossings. Some of \nthese communities are strongly opposed to Federal preemption of their \nwhistle bans.\n  Their concerns were not allayed by FRA officials at a meeting that \ntook place in Beverly on October 25, 1995 to discuss the SRDA. A member \nof my staff reported that many who attended desired outright repeal of \nthe SRDA. As Christopher Smallhorn of Beverly Farms wrote:\n\n       I doubt your representative will transmit to you the \n     feeling of frustration and anger taken away by those \n     taxpayers attending the meeting.\n\n  A sampling of my correspondence from other constituents reveals that \nothers share Mr. Smallhorn's concerns. John J. Evans from Beverly Farms \nwrote:\n\n       This proposed new regulation * * * will render my home \n     uninhabitable as my house sits between two grade crossings.\n\n  Fay Senner wrote:\n\n       The safety at these railway crossings is a local issue and \n     one that we have been able to manage effectively in the 150 \n     years that railroads have been a part of life in Acton.\n\n  Scott and Sharon Marlow of Andover wrote:\n\n       My daughter was born with a cardiac muscle defect and I do \n     not even want to think about the anguish loud whistle blasts \n     would have caused my family or any other family with a heart \n     condition.\n\n  William C. Mullin, chairman of the Acton Board of Selectmen, wrote:\n\n       If train whistles once again pierce the peace and quiet of \n     our community, the anger of our residents will be quickly \n     felt.\n\n  Richard and Nancy Silva of Beverly wrote:\n\n       The horn blowing will change the value of our home and add \n     more stress in an already stressful environment.\n\n  Diane M. Allen, chairman of the Wilmington Board of Selectmen, wrote:\n\n       We do not wish to have the Federal government set \n     unjustifiable standards for our local roads nor do we want \n     those decisions of our duly elected officials to be \n     overridden by the Federal government.\n\n  Nevertheless, the safety of railroad grade crossings is clearly a \nreal issue, as the October 1995 school bus accident in Illinois sadly \nillustrates.\n  The FRA has released a study showing that accidents occurred at fewer\n\n[[Page S9278]]\n\nthan 6 percent of the Nation's grade crossings where whistle bans are \nin effect. A one-size-fits-all approach is therefore not appropriate. I \nam thus proud to cosponsor this amendment, which contains a more \nsensible strategy for dealing with this issue, and I compliment the \nSenator from Oregon and his staff for bringing it before the Senate.\n  Knowing the impact that the SRDA is having on communities and \nconstituents in both Massachusetts and other States, I look forward to \nworking with the FRA and my colleagues to ensure the safety of grade \ncrossings without hurting the quality of life in our communities. I \nurge my colleagues to join in supporting the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5143) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I indicate at this point, that with one \nexception, we have completed all the Members' amendments that we know \nabout and were part of the unanimous-consent agreement we reached last \nnight, which means the only amendments we have left, namely, two \nrelevant amendments for Senator Lott, six amendments on terrorism for \nSenator Lott, and the McCain amendment, as I understand it, and the \nBiden amendments, five of them on antiterrorism. We are about ready to \nhave a completion of the Bradley amendment.\n  We have completed all but the antiterrorism issue. Mr. President, \nfirst of all, it is not relevant to this bill in terms of it being \nlegislative action on an appropriation. I am very hopeful that we can \nhave an agreement reached to remove that encumbrance to completing this \nbill and having final passage.\n  I believe that is the only other vote that we will have to have on \nthis bill. We can do that following the vote that we are about ready to \ntake up, on a tabling motion of the Baucus amendment.\n  I urge any Member or any Member's staff person who has knowledge of \nthese amendments that we had included in our unanimous-consent \nagreement, if they have any different viewpoint, or if they have any \nquestion, they better address those questions during the next vote and \ncome to Senator Lautenberg and my desk here to go over the list to make \nsure they have been taken care of in our efforts to cover the remaining \nbusiness.\n  Otherwise, we will proceed to end in a couple of colloquies for the \nother two amendments, and hopefully by that time the leadership can \ngive us some indication of what kind of an agreement may have been \nreached at a meeting that began at 6 o'clock tonight relating to the \nissue of antiterrorism.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5141\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. With that, Mr. President, under the unanimous consent, \nI move to table the Baucus amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table, the amendment No. 5141.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, we have one colloquy to be delivered on \nthe floor between Senator Bradley and the leader, Senator Lott. Then we \nhave the possibility of another perfecting amendment, or an amendment \ndealing with the subject we have just failed to table; we have a Cohen \namendment to be dispensed with, and then we are ready for third \nreading.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5141\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Baucus amendment. \nIs there further debate on the Baucus amendment?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I ask unanimous consent to temporarily lay aside the \namendment at the moment to engage in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will not \nobject to proceed with business outside the scope of the Baucus \namendment, but I want to preserve the right to offer or to join with \nothers in offering an amendment on that subject. So I just want to put \nMembers on notice that this bill is not going to go forward until we \nhave that opportunity to do so.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I think I indicated the other part of \nthe business was to complete that issue, so we are not cutting off \nanybody's right to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a comment?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have placed, I think, three or four spots \nfor amendments.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Five.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Five spots. I want to report that due to the great work of \nthe full committee, Senator Hatch and I have elements of a bipartisan \nagreement on terrorism, and as a consequence of that I am not going to \noffer any of the amendments on this legislation.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator. That will also affect five or six \nother amendments on both sides.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I understand they have placed five or six slots based on \nthat. I do not think there will be any amendments on terrorism on this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Senator Bradley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Baucus amendment is set \naside.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I have an amendment that deals with \nnewborns and insurance coverage for newborns, a bill that Senator \nKassebaum and I introduced last year. It is a bill that had been \nimproved greatly with the help of Senator Frist and Senator DeWine and \na bill that I care deeply about.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator from New Jersey yield?\n\n[[Page S9279]]\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I am pleased to yield to the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to say I have been aware of this issue the \nSenator from New Jersey is discussing. There was an attempt made \nearlier to get it cleared for unanimous consent. We did not get that \ndone. But I want to tell the Senator I will be glad to work with him to \nget this issue considered the first week in September. I think it is \nsomething that we should take up and have an opportunity to consider. \nIn order to help expedite this legislation but also because I think he \nhas a good point, I want to make the further statement I will work with \nhim to get that accomplished.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I thank the majority leader for his statement and his \ncommitment, and I will not pursue the amendment based on what he has \nsaid. I think that Senator Frist of Tennessee concurs.\n  I simply want the Senate to know that this is an enormously important \nissue in terms of children who are born and forced out of the hospital \nin the first 24 hours instead of the first 48 hours, and we hope to \nrevisit this issue when we come back in September.\n  I am prepared to yield to Senator Frist if he has anything to say on \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. FRIST. Thank you, Mr. President. I would just like to say that we \nhave worked long and hard on this bill, the Newborn's and Mother's \nHealth Protection Act of 1996. It is a bill we worked on in a \nbipartisan way and provides a safe haven for mothers with young \nchildren. I am delighted the majority leader----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will withhold. The Senate will be \nin order. The Senator from Tennessee deserves to be heard. The Senate \nwill be in order.\n  Mr. FRIST. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  This bill does provide a safe haven for mothers and young children \nover a 48-hour period. It is a bill we have worked on in a bipartisan \nway, and do appreciate the consideration the majority leader has given \nto take this up after Labor Day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I think we have two final technical \namendments to dispose of?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is correct. We are also reviewing a matter with \nthe Senator from Maine and the Senator from New Hampshire. I hope we \nwill be able to have that resolved.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I believe the Senator from Maine said he would withdraw \nhis?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. No, I do not believe that is correct.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. OK, let us do the technical amendments.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 5144 and 5145, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have a technical correction to the \nbill that simply changes the wording without changing any sums; and one \nthat makes reference to direct loans. We have cleared this with both \nsides. I send them to the desk for their consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to considering the \namendments en bloc? Without objection, the clerk will report the \namendments.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes \n     amendments numbered 5144 and 5145, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5144\n\n               (Purpose: To make a technical correction)\n\n       On page 19, strike lines 10 through 12 and insert ``For the \n     cost of direct loans, $8,000,000, as authorized by 23 United \n     States Code 108.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5145\n\n         (Purpose: To make a technical correction to the bill)\n\n       On page 60, line 20, strike ``103-311'' and insert ``103-\n     331''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendments, en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 5144 and 5145), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I might indicate following any action to \nbe taken on the subject of the Baucus amendment, we are ready for third \nreading of the bill and final passage. I thank the Senators on the \nantiterrorism amendments, of which we had 11, for reaching an agreement \nto not pursue them on this particular bill but to have them as a matter \nof business to be taken up at a later time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I move, after final passage, the Senate \ninsist on its amendments, request a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair appoint conferees on \nthe part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I cannot hear \nwhat the Senator has asked for in his request.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I will repeat. It would be to move ahead on the premise \nwe are going to pass this bill in final passage in a few moments, and \nto go ahead and appoint the conferees.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have to object. That is getting a little \nahead of the game.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BYRD. The only reason I do object, I think that request should \nwait, I say this with apologies to my dear friend, until the final vote \non the bill occurs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. FORD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I simply rise to inquire of the Senator \nfrom Oregon when we might expect final passage on the legislation? I \nhave a couple of young children who go to bed at 9 o'clock, and it \nwould be kind of nice to get home.\n  It appears we are through the end of the amendment process. I had a \ncouple of amendments that I referenced that I did not offer. I wanted \nto expedite the process of this legislation. But if we are near \ncompletion, I wonder if the Senator can inform us when he can expect \nfinal passage.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I will respond that we have a piece of \nunfinished business before we can go to third reading. The Baucus \namendment was not tabled, and we have not disposed of that amendment. \nThere is a process now, I am hoping, of finding some accommodation in \norder to dispose of the Baucus amendment.\n  The Senator from North Dakota certainly made a correct point. We \nshould have had this bill passed yesterday. If we are going to do the \nHUD-VA and independent agencies tomorrow, Friday and Saturday, we have \nto get this bill behind us. So consequently, we are waiting for that \noccasion to accommodate the Senators who have an interest in that. As \nsoon as that resolved issue is brought to us, we will do that and third \nreading.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator's response. None of us enjoy \nwaiting. On behalf of the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, who \nhas a young daughter who expects to wait up for him as well, to the \nextent we can move ahead, I think all of us would appreciate it.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I might say, we have a parliamentary situation beyond \nan accommodation here to the Senators. We are in a parliamentary \nsituation. We cannot go to third reading until there is a final \ndisposition of either adopting the Baucus amendment or modifying the \nBaucus amendment. So that is where we are locked in.\n\n[[Page S9280]]\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nTransportation and the ranking member for their efforts. I believe we \nare about ready to wrap up this very important appropriations bill. \nThere are good-faith negotiations underway right now. I am hopeful in \nthe next few minutes we will have an agreement on how to deal with the \nBaucus-Gramm matter. I think we have a reasonable suggestion that can \nbe agreed to. Certainly we hope so.\n  Then when that is done, we will be able to go to third reading and \nfinal passage of the transportation appropriations bill tonight. There \nhas been some suggestion that we carry this over until tomorrow, but as \nwe know, things have a way of growing overnight.\n  The chairman and the ranking member are absolutely right, as we are \nvery close to completing this appropriations bill. So if Members will \nbe patient a few more minutes, I think we can get it completed and go \nto final passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9275-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we will \ngo tomorrow morning at 9:30 immediately to the reconciliation bill, \nwhich is the welfare package. Under the rules I think there are 10 \nhours allowed for that. Some of that time may be yielded back. So we \nwould spend the bulk of the day tomorrow on that issue with the vote \ncoming sometime late tomorrow afternoon. I believe the Democratic \nleader would appreciate it coming later on in the afternoon. We will \nwork with him to get a time that meets with his needs.\n  Then we would go to some conference reports that may be available. \nRecorded votes may be requested on those--legislative appropriations, \nD.C. appropriations. Then we would hope to take up the HUD-VA \nappropriations bills tomorrow night, and stay with that until we have \nother conference reports that may be available.\n  There has been an agreement reached and the conferees' signatures \nacquired on the health insurance reform package. Senator Kassebaum, \nSenator Kennedy, many others have done a lot of good work on that. So \nwe should be able to take up that health insurance package on Friday.\n  I understand agreement has also been reached on the safe drinking \nwater conference report, which is a very important bill. And we have \nsort of a deadline on that one. If we do not act on it by Friday, there \nis some $725 million that would move over into another fund. So really \ngood work is being done.\n  Also, there has been a press conference this afternoon with regard to \nthe terrorism task force efforts. We have had our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle working with the Chief of Staff and the White House. \nAnd they had announced earlier this afternoon, or about 2 hours ago, \nthat they had made substantial progress. We believe we can take up an \nagreed-to package on the terrorism issue hopefully tomorrow or Friday.\n  So a lot of good work has been done today. We will have this final \nvote here hopefully in just a few minutes and begin with welfare reform \nin the morning. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is an amendment that pertains to the \nStates of Maine and New Hampshire, dealing with weight limit for \ntrucks.\n  We have worked in close conjunction with the Senator from New Jersey, \nthe Senator from Montana, and the Senator from Rhode Island.

The error is significant enough to justify that fiscal \n     year 1997 apportionments and allocations of Highway Trust \n     Funds be adjusted; and finds that the provision in B \n     appropriately corrects these deficiencies, then subsection B \n     will be operative.\n\n[[Page S9281]]\n\n       (b) Calculation of Federal-Aid Highway Apportionments and \n     Allocations.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), for \n     fiscal year 1997, the Secretary of Transportation shall \n     determine the Federal-aid highway apportionments and \n     allocations to a State without regard to the approximately \n     $1,596,000,000 credit to the Highway Trust Fund (other than \n     the mass Transit Account) of estimated taxes paid by States \n     that was made by the Secretary of the Treasury for fiscal \n     year 1995 in correction of an accounting error made in fiscal \n     year 1994.\n       (2) Adjustments for effects in 1996.--The Secretary of \n     Transportation shall, for each State--\n       (A) determine whether the State would have been apportioned \n     and allocated an increased or decreased amount for Federal-\n     aid highways for fiscal year 1996 if the accounting error \n     referred to in paragraph (1) had not been made (which \n     determination shall take into account the effects of section \n     1003(c) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \n     Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-240; 105 Stat. 1921)); and\n       (B) after apportionments and allocations are determined in \n     accordance with paragraph (1)--\n       (i) adjust the amount apportioned and allocated to the \n     State for Federal-aid highways for fiscal year 1997 by the \n     amount of the increase or decrease; and\n       (ii) adjust accordingly the obligation limitation for \n     Federal-aid highways distributed to the State under this Act.\n       (3) No effect on 1996 distributions.--Nothing in this \n     section shall affect any apportionment, allocation, or \n     distribution of obligation limitation, or reduction thereof, \n     to a State for Federal-aid highways for fiscal year 1996.\n       (4) Effective date.--This section shall take effect on \n     September 30, 1996.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think we have put together a good \ncompromise here. It sets up three conditions that have to be met. It \nmandates that the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of \nTransportation will look at the issue, which has been raised by our \ncolleague from Montana, and if they make three findings concerning its \nsignificance--if the President, based on their study, makes those three \nfindings, then the provision of the Senator from Montana will be \noffered in the bill. The Senator from Montana has agreed to this \namendment. I thank him for working with us on this.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is an accommodation to allow us to \nproceed with the bill. I think it meets the objective of the Senator \nfrom Texas, and as to another look at the degree to which there is an \naccounting clerical error, it is also significant. It is my view that \nit is. It is altogether appropriate that we crafted the amendment in a \nway so that the Senators who were concerned about this issue are better \nreassured that this error was, in fact, made.\n  Second, it accommodates our interests because it is quite clear that \nan error was made, and I feel quite confident that the administration, \nin reexamining this, will make the proper certification. Nevertheless, \nit helps us get a little better record and a better sense of what \nactually did happen here. That suits the interests of all Senators all \nthe way around.\n  I thank my colleague from Texas for helping craft this amendment. I \nurge its adoption.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I think it is also important to understand \nwhy some of us are so sensitive on issues like this. Coming from a \ndonor State, a State that over the years has consistently contributed \nsubstantially more to the highway trust fund than it receives back, we \nare sensitive about any changes in formulas that result in a further \nloss of funds to our State.\n  Now, it appears that a technical error was made and not a formula \nchange. The resulting formula change corrects that area rather than \nbeing a formula designed to benefit some States at the expense of \nothers. I think a number of us who come from those donor States--and 16 \nof the 19 States affected here that lose money are donor States--felt \nthat we needed a certification as to the validity of that particular \ntechnical error and the fact that this proposal by the Senator from \nMontana corrects that error in the correct fashion. So the \ncertification here will allow us to receive that information.\n  I think it will leave us with some feeling that we are adopting the \nright procedures here in terms of certifying the accuracy of this.\n  So I thank the Senator from Montana for his willingness to work with \nus. I particularly thank the Senator from Texas for his ability to \ndiscern and take a complex issue and put it into understandable \namendment form in a fairly short amount of time. I thank him for his \nefforts.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me also thank the Senator from Texas, \nthe Senator from Indiana, the Senator from Montana, and others for \nworking on the second-degree amendment.\n  I have a question of the Senator from Texas.\n  Does the second-degree amendment make any change in the underlying \nformula?\n  Mr. GRAMM. No.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me add one comment and one thought to what the Senator \nfrom Indiana said. All but three or four of the States which would lose \nmoney if this allocation were made according to the amendment are \nStates which already are ahead of the game. They are donee States--\nthree or four. Those of us that are donor States, so-called, there are \n20 of us. When we look at this kind of amendment and see that, it \nobviously makes us somewhat skeptical. Again, most of the States by far \nthat would be on the giving end are the same States that already are, \nunder the formula, on the giving end. That may be a coincidence. It may \nbe that the alleged error happened to work out that way.\n  But I want to join the Senator from Indiana in expressing the \nsensitivity of the States that already give much more than they get \nback under the formula.\n  My question to the Senator from Texas is this: Can he state for the \nRecord what those three findings are?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me get back the copy of the amendment.\n  The three findings are--let me make it clear because I want to be \ncertain, given what the Senator from Indiana said, we are not making \nthe judgment here of whether or not an error was made. It is my belief \nthat probably is not the case, as the Senator from Montana believes \nthat it was the case. We are setting up objective criteria to have a \njudgment, so we are not prejudging that based on anything we say here.\n  Let me just read it.\n\n       The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of \n     Transportation shall conduct a review of the reporting of \n     excise tax data by the Department of Treasury to the \n     Department of Transportation for FY '94 and its impact on the \n     allocation of Federal aid highways.\n       If the President certificates that all of the following \n     conditions are met:\n       1. A significant error was made by Treasury in its estimate \n     of highway trust fund revenues collected in FY '94;\n       2. The error is fundamentally different from errors \n     routinely made in such estimates in the past;\n       3. The error is significant enough to justify that FY '97 \n     apportionments and allocations of highway trust funds be \n     adjusted; and finds that provisions in B--\n\n  That is the Baucus amendment.\n\n     appropriately corrects these deficiencies, then subsection \n     B--\n\n  Which is the Baucus amendment.\n\n     will be operative.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor to that \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask on behalf of the Senator from \nVirginia, Senator Warner, that he be added as a cosponsor to the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I join in thanking my colleague from Montana \nfor his willingness to work with us on this amendment.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would also like to add my name as a \ncosponsor to the Gramm amendment, if I am not already on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment? If not, the question is on \nagreeing to the second-degree amendment of the Senator from Texas.\n  The amendment (No. 5147) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on the underlying Baucus \namendment, the first-degree amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5141) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S9282]]\n\n                           Shiloh Interchange\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to discuss the importance of \nthe Shiloh Interchange in Billings, MT.\n  ISTEA authorized this project for $11 million. However, since that \nauthorization the cost of the project has increased by an additional $3 \nmillion. The Senator from Oregon is aware of the request I have made to \ninclude an additional $3 million for this project.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes, you have requested additional funds for this \nproject. However, criteria established in the One-hundred-and-fourth \nCongress by the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee of the House \nprecludes me from being able to accommodate the Senator from Montana's \nrequest.\n  The subcommittee has an ironclad rule that no highway projects which \nare not authorized be included for funding under the appropriations \nbill. In addition, no increases above the authorized levels will be \nincluded. Given the level of single-purpose projects included in ISTEA \nthe ability of the Appropriations Committee to accomodate the Senator's \nrequest has been severely reduced, and such adjustments need to be made \nin the authorizing legislation.\n  Mr. BURNS. I appreciate the Chairman's clarification and \nconsideration. Have any non-authorized levels for highway projects been \nincluded in either the FY96 law or the current bill being considered by \nthe Senate?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. No, there are no increases above the authorized level \nin the fiscal year 1996 act or the fiscal year 1997 bill currently \nunder consideration.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chairman, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Surface Transportation Board\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as we focus upon the Transportation budget \nfor the upcoming fiscal year, I would like to discuss with you a number \nof points regarding the Surface Transportation Board [STB] in light of \nthe ICC Termination Act.\n  The statutorily mandated time frames have been complied with in the \nlatest merger.\n  The STB should assign a priority to the handling of old cases. For \nexample, those cases pending more than 3 or 4 years before the \neffective date of the ICC Termination Act. In addition, the STB's own \nrelease as to its recent public vote in the Union Pacific/Southern \nPacific merger, it was indicated that considerable weight was given to \nthe managerial judgment of the applicants. Since that application had \nbeen pending prior to the effective date of the ICC Termination Act, \nsimilar treatment should be given to the other long-pending cases.\n  The STB's policy should be based on the widest perspective as to \nrailroad proposals, be they mergers, constructions, line extensions, or \nrates, that will benefit area-wide economies in addition to the \napplicants themselves. Also, the Board should encourage rail proposals \ncompatible with the requirements of appropriate environmental laws and \nshould continue its policy of promoting competition in rail \ntransportation which I believe will benefit the consumer.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The Senator's points are well-taken. Long-pending cases \nof this type should be decided promptly. Such action would be \nparticularly warranted with rail proposals that will benefit area-wide \neconomies, promote competition, or foster the objectives of our \nenvironmental laws. I would hope that such public interest \nconsiderations would merit early resolution.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n Michigan Transit projects in the Transportation Appropriations bill, \n                            fiscal year 1997\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my colleague from Michigan and I would like \nto join the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee in a brief colloquy regarding Michigan transit projects in \nthe bill before the Senate.\n  We are seeking to resolve the differences between the House and \nSenate Appropriations Committee reports on Transportation \nappropriations for fiscal year 1997 that relate to section 3 bus and \nbus facility funding for Michigan. Hopefully, the proposal from the \nMichigan Department of Transportation, as embodied in the chart below, \ncan be useful to the conference committee when it meets. I ask \nunanimous consent that the chart be inserted into the record following \nour discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. We have sent the chart to the Michigan House Members whose \ndistricts are affected. Because of the short time, explicit support for \nthis arrangement has not been received from all of them. However, this \ndistribution appears to be a fair compromise between the House and the \nSenate committees report language. Barring any significant objection \nfrom Michigan's House Members, I urge the conferees to retain the total \nSenate funding level of $20 million provided for section 3 transit \nprojects and accommodate the distribution in the chart.\n  I would hope that the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee would do his utmost to preserve the Senate \nlevel in conference. As the Senator from Oregon is aware, his State is \na donor State like Michigan, and as such, receives less than an even \nreturn on the gas taxes contributed into the Highway Trust Fund, from \nwhich transit funds are derived. Though that return was improved by \nISTEA for highways, States like Michigan, and I suspect Oregon, \ncontinue to be significant donor States on transit projects. This \nformula matter must be addressed when Congress next takes up \nreauthorization of ISTEA.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I appreciate the interest of the Senators and their \ninput in helping to recommend a resolution of the differences between \nthe House and Senate report language on transit projects in Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I fully support the remarks of my fellow Michigan \nSenator regarding the unfair distribution of transit funds, and how the \nSenate must insist on the higher total funding level of $20 million for \nthe State of Michigan. However, I wish to further elaborate on the \ndistribution of these funds within the State of Michigan.\n  The Michigan Department of Transportation has provided our offices \nwith a project by project breakdown of this distribution, which Senator \nLevin has introduced. Per the fiscal year 1996 Transportation \nAppropriations Conference report, the full $1.23 million final project \nfunding is recommended for the Lansing Intermodal Facility. \nFurthermore, we, in coordination with the Michigan Department of \nTransportation [MDOT], recommend that at least $1.8 million be \nappropriated for the Grand Rapids Area Transit Authority, and at least \n$900,000 to the Kalamazoo Transit Authority for buses and an intermodal \nfacility. Finally, MDOT believes that as a start-up project, no more \nthan $764,000 is needed for the Dearborn Intermodal Facility. No more \nthan the remaining $7.13 million, in our coordinated opinion with MDOT, \nshould be appropriated to MDOT for statewide distribution. There are \nother projects enumerated in the MDOT proposal, which melds the House \nand Senate marks, which we also believe deserve the designated level of \nsupport.\n  Mr. President, I would ask the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee whether he cares to comment on this proposal?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Considering the extensive discussions I know the two \nSenators from Michigan have conducted with their State and local \ngovernments over this proposal, I wish to assure both Senators that I \nwill make every effort to ensure their proposal is given full \nconsideration in conference discussions with the House.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          Transit agency                 Description       Federal funds\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLansing...........................

Mr. President, I would like to ask the esteemed chairman \nof the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Hatfield, if he would \nyield to a question regarding the transportation appropriations bill.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I would be pleased to yield to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you. I first want to personally praise the \ndistinguished chairman for this appropriations bill\n\n[[Page S9283]]\n\nwhich does so much to enhance the safety and infrastructure investment \nin our Nation's transportation systems. I know the Senator is a long-\ntime supporter of renewable energy technologies and transportation \nwhich uses clean fuels that preserve air quality in our Nation's \ncities.\n  I am particularly pleased at the committee's decision to approve the \nPresident's request for funding the Advanced Technology Transit Bus \n[ATTB]. This project, under development in Los Angeles, uses the \nexpertise of our defense aerospace industry to build a next-generation \ntransit bus that will run on a variety of clean fuels, will provide \nconsiderable maintenance savings to our transit agencies and will \nprovide conveniences for disabled passengers.\n  The committee included by request for $13.1 million in bus \ndiscretionary funding to deploy five bus prototypes for transit \nagencies participating in the project across the country. The President \nhad also requested $6.5 million in his budget to complete the research \nprogram under the National Planning and Research budget of the Federal \nTransit Administration. The committee fully funded the President's \nrequest for Transit Planning and Research, but did not specifically \nrefer to the Advanced Technology Transit Bus. As the chairman knows, \nthe prototype development will be dependent on the completion of the \nresearch phase.\n  I ask the chairman whether the Transportation Appropriations \ncommittee report excludes support for the ATTB research funding? In \naddition, since fuel cell technology is one of the propulsion systems \nproposed for the ATTB, would some funding for the Fuel Cell Transit Bus \nProgram also be available to the ATTB project?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I assure my colleague from California that the \ncommittee report does not mean the committee does not support research \nfunding for the ATTB. I point out that the report also states that the \ncommittee has not earmarked projects mentioned in the House report that \nare not listed in this report. This action is taken without prejudice \nto final decisions on project funding that will be made in conference. \nThe fuel cell component of the ATTB is an important part of the \nproject, and I will make every effort to ensure that it is considered \nfor funding.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for his support for the research and \ndeployment of the Advanced Technology Transit Bus.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like to engage in a colloquy with the \nchairman of the committee to clarify the subcommittee's intent with \nrespect to the committee report language relating to the BART-SFO \nextension.\n  Specifically, I would like to address the stipulation contained in \nthe committee report that would prevent the Federal Transit \nAdministration from entering into a full funding grant agreement for \nthe BART-SFO extension until all litigation regarding the project has \nbeen resolved. I have very strong concerns that this requirement could \nresult in indefinite delays in the project. Further, I understand \nSecretary Pena, Governor Wilson, and the Federal Transit Administration \n[FTA] share these same concerns.\n  I understand it is not the chairman's intent with this report \nlanguage to kill this project. Further, the chairman does not intend to \nimpose any restrictions on the BART-SFO extension that have not \npreviously been demanded of this and other transit projects seeking \nfull funding grant agreements from the FTA.\n  I have a July 30 letter from Secretary Pena stating that the language \ncontained in the committee report could encourage lawsuits and further \nthat he would prefer not to see this language included. I understand \nthe chairman does not intend to encourage frivolous lawsuits with this \nlanguage, and further, I understand in speaking with the chairman that \nI can be assured this committee report language will be revised during \nthe conference negotiations with the House to reflect the chairman's \nintent to move ahead with this project.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. That is my understanding.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask the President if the chairman would yield to \nanother question.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I would be happy to yield to the senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We appreciate the chairman's past support for this \nproject and knows he understands the value of providing key connections \nfor transit with other modes of travel, such as airports. We also \nappreciate his concerns over local participation in the decision-making \nfor such a project. We would like to remind the chairman that this \nproject has been on the local ballots and approved by our voters on \nthree previous occasions. It enjoys wide community support. We \nunderstand from the county counsel of San Mateo County that as of July \n16, 1996, any new initiative petition would be too late to qualify for \nthe November 1996 ballot.\n  Is it the chairman's understanding that the committee report language \nwill not necessitate another vote in 1996 if the time for qualifying \nsuch initiative has expired?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. That is my understanding. I thank the Senators for \nbringing their concerns to me.\n\n\n     digital brite radar indicator tower equipment (dbrite) at the \n                  gainesville-alachua regional airport\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman in a \nbrief colloquy on critical issues affecting the Gainesville-Alachua \nRegional Airport and the State of Florida.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I would be pleased to engage in a colloquy with the \nSenator from Florida on this matter.\n  Mr. MACK. I would first like to thank the Chairman for his leadership \nand the fine work of his subcommittee in keeping the highways, railways \nand airways of this Nation safe and effective in meeting the \ntransportation needs of our citizens.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank my friend and colleague.\n  Mr. MACK. I believe you are aware, Mr. Chairman, of the situation \nconfronting the Gainesville-Alachua Regional Airport in their effort to \nobtain a radar upgrade and the installation of a DBRITE system.\n  Gainesville was one of four airports specified by Congress in the \nreports accompanying the fiscal year 1988 and fiscal year 1990 \nTransportation appropriation bills to receive radar upgrades. To date, \nall but Gainesville have received radar upgrades. I find it very \nfrustrating that the FAA has not fully implemented the direction in \nthese reports. At the time the FAA requested the DBRITE system, they \nconsidered it a crucial safety factor for air traffic utilizing the \nOcala, Gainesville, and north Florida region. Now, as a contract tower \nwith 35 percent less manpower, this system appears even more essential. \nThe DBRITE system would provide local controllers with real time \npictures of all air traffic in the North Central Region, complementing \nthe capacities and coverage of Jacksonsville Airport.\n  I noted this year's Transportation Appropriations Committee Report \ncontains language encouraging the FAA to honor prior commitments. \nAccordingly, Mr. Chairman, as it has now been almost 8 years since \nCongress allocated funds for Gainesville's DBRITE system, I would \nexpect the FAA to take heed of this language and provide this much \nneeded system to Gainesville-Alachua Regional Airport.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I can sympathize with the frustration \nexpressed by the junior Senator from Florida on behalf of the \nGainesville/Ocala communities and regional airport. If the FAA had \nrecognized a legitimate need which still exists, I certainly think it \nappropriate for the FAA to move forward in the delivery of the DBRITE \nsystem for the Gainesville-Alachua Regional Airport.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, as an additional matter, I would like to \nbring to the chairman's attention another problem confronting the \nGainesville-Alachua Regional Airport Authority and the surrounding \nareas and communities in finalizing their eligible FAA noise grant \nfunding.\n  I have been informed that as a result of judicial inverse \ncondemnation proceedings, the city was forced to acquire certain \nproperties and relocate former owners and occupants from certain sites \ncovered by Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 150, Airport Noise \nCompatibility. This action required significant financial commitments \nfrom the local authorities, the city of Gainesville, and the Regional \nAirport Authority which these parties were apparently led to believe \nwould be eligible\n\n[[Page S9284]]\n\nfor reimbursement through the AIP Noise Grant Program.\n  Would you not concur, Mr. Chairman, that this matter warrants FAA \nconsideration?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I can assure the Senator from Florida \nthat I certainly think this is a matter which the FAA should carefully \nreview. And, I look forward to working with him to bring both these \nmatters to a resolution before the Congress finalizes the fiscal year \n1997 legislation.\n\n\n                           vts 2000 colloquy\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I would like to engage into a colloquy with the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee. Mr. President, I would like to commend the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee on its committee report \nwhich provides funding to complete the final development of the Vessel \nTraffic System [VTS] 2000. This is a system that is necessary to \nenhance the safety and environmental quality of our country's vital \nports and waterways. In the recent past, and quoted in the committee's \nreport, the GAO has estimated the cost of establishing these VTS \nSystems at the originally envisioned 17 ports at a cost of up to $310 \nmillion. Through a competitive bidding process and the widespread use \nof commercial off-the-shelf and non-developmental equipment, the \nestimated costs have now been dramatically reduced. In fact, recent \nestimates of the costs are well below those estimated by the GAO--now \nless than $200 million. And that number could be substantially reduced \ndepending on what type of systems are implemented as part of VTS 2000.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I appreciate my colleague's remarks. The VTS 2000 \nprogram was one that we considered very carefully during markup of the \nTransportation appropriations bill this year. I believe that the VTS \n2000 system provides great promise in promoting the safety and \nenvironmental protection of our Nation's waterways. The conference \ncommittee will indeed consider very carefully during our deliberations \nthese cost issues you have just raised.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the \nremarks made by my colleagues regarding the VTS 2000 system. The study \nwhich was recently published by the Marine Board of the National \nResearch Council concluded that ``there is a compelling national \ninterest in protecting the environment and in providing safe and \nefficient ports and waterways.'' and that ``VTS can be a significant \nfactor in enhancing the safety and efficiency of ports and waterways . \n. .''. Establishing VTS systems at our Nation's important ports and \nwaterways is absolutely vital. Also, I agree with my colleague that the \nestimated cost to produce and field the systems has been dramatically \nreduced. In addition, I would like to highlight the fact that the \nestimated annual costs to operate the system once it has been deployed \nhave also been greatly reduced. Whereas some have estimated the annual \noperating costs of a VTS system to be $65 million, the Coast Guard now \nbelieves that those costs will be only $42 million per year for \ninstallation at all proposed posts, which includes the $20 million \ncurrently being spent annually on five operational ports. I would also \nnote that there are a variety of creative ways to meet those annual \noperating obligations which should be fully reviewed once a final VTS \nsystem is proposed.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I appreciate the very knowledgeable \ncomments of Senator Breaux. He is correct that there are significant \npotential cost reductions in both the establishment and operation of \nthe VTS 2000 system. Both of my colleagues can rest assured that I will \nkeep these issues clearly in focus as we deliberate the fiscal year \n1997 Transportation appropriations bill in conference with the other \nbody.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I also appreciate the very knowledgeable comments of \nboth of my distinguished colleagues from Louisiana. Maintaining the \nsafety and environmental quality of this Nation's waterways remain \ncritically important objectives of this subcommittee. The important \ncost issues raised by the Senators from Louisiana should be carefully \nconsidered by the conference committee as well as the completion of a \nfinal VTS system.\n\n\n                mid-america aviation resource consortium\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Senator Hatfield, I strongly support the Senate report \nlanguage which opposes the House's earmark of $1,700,000 for the Mid-\nAmerica Aviation Resource Consortium [MARC]. In order to fund the \nfacility in Minnesota, the House transferred funds out of the air \ntraffic controller training program from the FAA Academy in Oklahoma \nCity. This is an imprudent transfer of funds to a program which has not \nreceived the necessary support to continue.\n  I refer my colleagues to the conference report that accompanied the \nfiscal year 1996 bill which stated, ``The conferees agree to provide \n$250,000 for continued support of the Mid-America Aviation Resource \nConsortium as proposed by the House, but intend that this be the final \nyear of Federal support for this facility unless requested in the \nPresident's budget.'' Funding for this facility was not requested in \nthe President's fiscal year 1997 budget.\n  I would like to include in the Record a letter from Mr. Richard \nSanford, director of the Florida Aviation Management Development \nAssociates, an FAA contractor, to Senator Mack which references the \nreallocation of $1.7 million in the House bill. Mr. Sanford writes, \n``This action, taken against the wishes of the FAA, effectively reduces \nthe [FAA Academy's] budget and directly decrements $1.7 million from a \ncompetitively awarded instructional services contract held by the \nUniversity of Oklahoma. I am very concerned that this action serves to \npenalize desired academic/business partnerships in the interests of \nsupporting a consortium whose members have neither competed for the \nbusiness nor are the FAA's preferred instructional service \nprovider(s).''\n  I urge Senate conferees on the fiscal year 1997 transportation \nappropriations bill to insist upon the Senate position.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Senator nickles, I appreciate your interest in this \nimportant issue and your strong commitment to safety training at the \nFAA. I oppose the House effort to reallocate $1,700,000 from the FAA \nAcademy to MARC and will remind conferees of the intention of the \nfiscal year 1996 conference report to terminate funding for MARC. \nFinally, I will urge the fiscal year 1997 conference to maintain the \nposition outlined in the Senate provision.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent the letter from Mr. Sanford be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       FAMDA, a Joint Venture,\n\n                                    Palm Coast, FL, July 10, 1996.\n     Senator Connie Mack,\n     Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mack: The Federal Aviation Administration has \n     elected to model partnerships between the Government, \n     academia, and business by awarding both technical and non-\n     technical instructional services contracts to organizations \n     featuring such partnerships. In the technical training area, \n     the partnership with the FAA at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma \n     City is shared by the University of Oklahoma with American \n     Systems Corporation as a subcontractor. In the non-technical \n     area, Florida Aviation Management Development Associates \n     (FAMDA), a joint venture between the University of Central \n     Florida and American Systems Corporation (ASC) supports the \n     Center for Management Development (CMD) in Palm Coast, \n     Florida.\n       A short time ago, the House Appropriations Subcommittee \n     signed out their appropriations bill which, among other \n     things, directed the reallocation of $1.7M originally \n     budgeted to support instructional activities at the FAA \n     Academy in Oklahoma City to the Mid-America Aviation Research \n     Consortium (MARC), a group of educational institutions which \n     have positioned themselves to provide technical training \n     support to the FAA. This action, taken against the wishes of \n     the FAA, effectively reduces the Academy budget and directly \n     decrements $1.7M from a competitively awarded instructional \n     services contract held by the University of Oklahoma. I am \n     very concerned that this action serves to penalize desired \n     academic/business partnerships in the interests of supporting \n     a consortium whose members have neither competed for the \n     business nor are the FAA's preferred instructional services \n     provider(s). I am also mindful that this same flawed strategy \n     could be applied to the Center for Management Development in \n     Palm Coast to the detriment of the University of Central \n     Florida and ASC.\n       Senator Don Nickles is leading an effort to restore the \n     $1.7M in funding to the FAA Academy and, ultimately, the \n     University of Oklahoma. I urge you to lend your support to \n     his efforts and favorably resolve this issue in conference. I \n     have attached information\n\n[[Page S9285]]\n\n     which may provide additional insight on this issue.\n       Thank you for your continued support of CMD and the FAMDA \n     joint venture.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Richard M. Sanford,\n                                                Managing Director.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. This is a good bill, Mr. President, responsibly and \ncarefully assembled by the distinguished chairman, the ranking \nDemocratic member, the subcommittee and its staff. I compliment them on \ntheir work and support its passage.\n  Even so, Mr. President, due to the very difficult budget environment \nin which we are laboring, this bill does not do complete justice to \nwhat I believe are vital transportation infrastructure needs, a reality \non which I believe I could find considerable agreement with the \nchairman and ranking member. For example, Massachusetts and other \nStates need more funding for mass transit and passenger rail than the \ncommittee could provide.\n  Federal funding for Amtrak has declined by approximately one-quarter \nsince 1995. This year, the Senate bill appropriates $592 million for \nAmtrak for 1997 which is $130 million more than the House provided. I \ncommend the committee for at least including this amount for Amtrak \nbecause the House's amount is a slow-motion death penalty. The capital-\nintensive nature of passenger rail makes it unlikely to survive as a \nviable transportation mode without some kind of Government support. And \nI do not know why we find that surprising. We heavily subsidize \nscheduled air travel, general aviation, and highways. It is entirely \nappropriate--and beneficial to our Nation--that we subsidize passenger \nrail.\n  The United States still falls short among the nations of the world in \nper capita spending on passenger rail--behind such countries as \nBelarus, Botswana, and Guinea, not to mention the nations of Western \nEurope. It is my hope that the Senate position on funding for Amtrak \nwill be sustained in the conference committee to resolve the \ndifferences between the bills passed by the House and the Senate. And \nas a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, which has reported \nlegislation to restructure Amtrak in order to place it on a path toward \ngreater fiscal stability and accountability, I am very hopeful that we \ncan enact reauthorization legislation before the end of the 104th \nCongress.\n  I strongly support the Senate actions to fund the Northeast Corridor \nImprovement Project [NECIP] which is vital to reducing congestion in \nthe corridor and which, in turn, will result in important \nenvironmental, energy and employment benefits. We must move ahead with \ntrack work, upgrading maintenance facilities and completion of the \nelectrification of the northern section as soon as possible. The $200 \nmillion in funding this legislation provides for NECIP will enable this \nimportant work to move forward. Again, I urge the members of the \nCommittee who will be conferees to insist on the Senate position on \nNECIP in the conference committee. I would like to express my gratitude \nto Chairman Hatfield and Ranking Member Lautenberg for their continuing \nand dependable support of NECIP.\n  Another area of special importance to Massachusetts is mass transit. \nI cannot avoid being disappointed by this bill's funding level for mass \ntransit operating assistance. Recent cuts in funding have had a \ndevastating effect on mass transit systems in my State. In \nMassachusetts, statutory caps are imposed on the amount of funding \ntransit authorities can receive from State and local sources. \nTherefore, cuts in Federal assistance have a direct, immediate, and \nunavoidable impact on service to seniors, workers and students in my \nState. Having voiced my concern, I do want to acknowledge that I \nrealize this problem is not attributable to the will of the \nsubcommittee, its chairman, or its ranking member.\n  My constituents living and working in the Boston area are very \nappreciative for the funding included in the bill for the South Boston \nPiers Transitway, which is a critical component of the State \nImplementation Plan to comply with Clean Air Act requirements, and is \nanticipated to serve 22,000 riders daily. The transitway will be \nintegrated with the extensive network of transit, commuter rail and bus \nservice at South Station.\n  I also appreciate support for the restoration of historic Union \nStation in Springfield, MA, which will allow for the consolidation of \nregional transportation services in western Massachusetts in a single \nintermodal facility for local bus lines, intercity bus systems, trains, \ntaxis, and limousine service. The restoration of the facility will be \naccompanied by renovation of the facility to accommodate commercial \ntenancy.\n  Also welcome is the committee's recommended funding for the \ndevelopment of the Cape Cod Intermodal Center which will accommodate \nintercity buses, regional buses, local shuttles, intercity trains, \nAmtrak summer tour trains, and bicyclists and will provide connections \nto the steamship authority's Hyannis terminal and to Barnstable \nMunicipal Airport.\n  Once again, I thank the chairman and ranking member, who have labored \nconscientiously and diligently to do as much good in the transportation \narena for the Nation and its people as possible under the budget \nrestrictions imposed on them. I also want to acknowledge with \nappreciation the work of the staff with whom I am familiar, Pat McCann, \nPeter Rogoff, and Anne Miano. I offer my strongest encouragement to the \nconferees the Senate will name to work out differences between the \nHouse-passed and Senate-passed bills. This is a good bill, and I \nfervently hope the conference agreement will contain its best features. \nIt matters to the nation and its people in 1996, and it will matter in \nthe future.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to speak today in support of \nthe transportation appropriations bill for fiscal year 1997.\n  I commend the leadership of the Transportation Subcommittee, Chairman \nHatfield and ranking member, Senator Lautenberg, for their hard work in \nfashioning a program of infrastructure investment and safety \nenhancement with such little resources available to the subcommittee \nunder this budget.\n  This bill makes considerable improvements over the House-passed \nlegislation. These improvements will provide better air quality, better \nmobility for our citizens and safer skies. The recent tragedies from \nthe air disasters from Florida and New York sadly underscored the fact \nthat we have not done all that we can to make our skies safer.\n  I represent a State with 32 commercial airports, including at least \nhalf a dozen international airports, that handle more than 123 million \npassengers a year. So, I have a particularly strong interest in being \nsure that aviation security is our highest priority in air travel.\n  As a member of the House Government Operations Committee that held \nextensive hearings on the Pan Am Flight 103 disaster in 1989, and later \nas Chair of its Subcommittee on Government Activities and \nTransportation, I strongly urged greater attention to aviation \nsecurity.\n  I want to also add my thanks to the chairman for the increased \nfunding for aviation safety. Funding in the bill will add 250 more air \ntraffic controllers and provide needed investment in our airways \ninfrastructure, including $1.46 billion in airport improvement program \nfunding. The House provided only $1.3 billion, a cut of $150 million \nfrom this year's level.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Senate committee provided the full \namount requested by the President for the northern California TRACON. \nThis is the regional radar facility for air traffic. The Senate's \nfunding of the $8.7 million requested keeps this facility on track for \ncommissioning in November 2000.\n  The Senate bill also provides $3.1 million for the precision approach \npath indicators, a state-of-the-art navigational systems for our \nairports. This funding will enable the Los Angeles company which \nmanufactures this equipment to keep their production lines open.\n\n  I also believe ocean traffic safety will be enhanced by a provision \nthat would prohibit funds to prohibit the Coast Guard from implementing \nregulations that would permit vessels to operate with a narrower margin \nof safety between Santa Barbara and San Francisco. This is a high-\ntraffic area, particularly for oil tankers. The provision prohibits a \nvessel traffic safety fairway which is less than 5 miles wide. I \nauthored a similar provision as a Member of the House. It makes good \nsense.\n\n[[Page S9286]]\n\n  On enhancing trade, the Senate could do no better than its support \nfor the Alameda transportation corridor. The Senate Appropriations \nCommittee's support for the Alameda corridor project was our last major \nhurdle for moving this major trade project forward.\n  Last year in the National Highway System bill, we declared the \nproject a ``high priority corridor,'' eligible for a Federal loan. We \nworked with the President's top financing and transportation experts to \nfashion a loan package, and the President requested the $59 million \nappropriation to pay the subsidy cost for a $400 million loan for the \n$2 billion project.\n  The House supported that program, and now we have the Senate on \nboard. The House and Senate approach the loan in different ways. \nAlthough this is not the approach that I would have recommended, \nSenator Hatfield preferred using part of the funds provided under the \nState infrastructure bank program to provide a direct Federal loan for \nthe project instead of the House's plan under the Federal Railroad \nAdministration's loan guarantee program.\n  We can work out the best approach in conference. But there is no \ndoubt that the House and Senate, Democrat and Republican, mayors of \nLong Beach and Los Angeles and the Governor of California and the \nPresident of the United States all support $59 million in Federal seed \nmoney to build this project. It will eliminate more than 200 \nintersections with the rail link to the largest port complex in the \nUnited States, the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. It will provide \na modern gateway to Pacific Rim trade for our exporters across the \ncountry.\n  The Senate bill provides $234 million more for transit than the House \nbill, including $134 million more for local rail systems. Each weekday \nmore than 6.8 million commuters use some form of transit, eliminating \nthe need for more than 1,000 lanes of urban highways. I think that is a \ngood investment in terms of improved air quality and economic \nproductivity for our people.\n  The bill provides needed transit investment for California \ncommunities, including $5.5 million for a new transit center for \nStockton which will anchor its major downtown redevelopment plans and \n$2.5 million to consolidate several, duplicative transit operations \naround Lake Tahoe into an efficient system using the latest in \nintelligent transportation technology. The bill provides $3 million for \nthe Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative and $600,000 for a new \nmultimodal transit center in Thousand Oaks.\n\n  I am particularly pleased at the committee's decision to approve the \nPresident's request for funding the advanced technology transit bus. \nThis project, under development in Los Angeles, uses the expertise of \nour defense aerospace industry to build a next-generation transit bus \nthat will run on a variety of clean fuels, will provide considerable \nmaintenance savings to our transit agencies and will provide \nconveniences for disabled passengers.\n  The committee included my request for $13.1 million in bus \ndiscretionary funding to deploy five bus prototypes for transit \nagencies participating in the project across the country.\n  Do I agree with everything in this bill? No, of course not. We do not \nmeet the President's request for operating money for the Federal \nAviation Administration. On the transit side, I am troubled by the \nfreeze on operating assistance and the low funding for our major fixed \nrail transit projects in San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n  I am particularly concerned over the language in the Committee Report \nfor the Bay Area Rapid Transit project to link up with San Francisco \nInternational Airport. I appreciate the chairman's generosity in \npersonally meeting with me and Senator Feinstein to hear our request \nfor funding. Although the committee provided $20 million for the Bay \nArea rails program, it included harsh and overly restrictive report \nlanguage.\n  I believe it is well within reason to restrict Federal funding until \nBART has presented a detailed financing plan and met all local funding \ncommitment criteria. However, to hold up a full funding grant agreement \n``until all litigation regarding this project is resolved'' is highly \nunrealistic. This language must send a chill down the spine of every \nmajor transit general manager. What project is next? Lawsuits are not \nuncommon on any public works project, and there are legal avenues \nalready available particularly to address the environmental impact \nissues.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nMr. Gordon Linton, administrator of the Federal Transit Administration, \nin this regard.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               U.S. Department    \n                                                of Transportation,\n\n\n                               Federal Transit Administration,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 31, 1996.\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatfield: I write to express concern about \n     language in the Senate report accompanying the fiscal year \n     1997 U.S. Department of Transportation and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act that would prohibit the Federal Transit \n     Administration (FTA) from executing a Full Funding Grant \n     Agreement or issuing a Letter of No Prejudice for the Bay \n     Area Transit District's extension to San Francisco \n     International Airport (the ``SFO extension'') ``until all \n     litigation'' against the project ``has been resolved . . .'' \n     For the reasons presented below, I respectfully request that \n     this language be deleted in conference.\n       First, let me emphasize that, for good reason, no such \n     directive has been applied to any fixed guideway project in \n     FTA's thirty-five year history. All large transit projects, \n     like all large public works projects, are inevitably the \n     subject of some litigation. We cannot expect otherwise. \n     Indeed, all Federal transit grantees undertaking new starts \n     set aside contingency line items in their budgets to finance \n     the litigation they can and should anticipate in the ordinary \n     course of business. Resolution of such litigation often takes \n     many years.\n       The language in the Senate report would require than a $1.2 \n     billion investment in economic growth, congestion mitigation, \n     and enhanced mobility for the Bay Area somehow proceed with \n     no grievances against the project from contractors, \n     suppliers, property owners, competing providers of \n     transportation, or interested parties opposing the project. \n     Whatever the intent, the language would hold the BART SFO \n     extension hostage to any party making a claim--whether \n     meritorious of spurious--against the project for the purpose \n     of extracting money or other concessions from BART and \n     Federal and local taxpayers.\n       Second, notwithstanding the persistent threats of \n     environmental litigation against the SFO extension, both FTA \n     and BART have every confidence in the adequacy of our \n     environmental studies for this project and in our compliance \n     with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the \n     California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and all other \n     applicable Federal and local environmental law and \n     regulations. Let me assure you that there has never been a \n     transit project that was the subject of NEPA and CEQA \n     documents so thorough and voluminous as those for this \n     project.\n       Finally, the selection of the locally preferred alternative \n     for the SFO extension was the result of a very open, \n     vigorous, and lengthy debate. Clearly, not everyone will be \n     pleased with the tough decisions that must be made to pursue \n     a project so vital and visible as this one; such is the \n     nature of the transportation industry and the legacy of the \n     Federal transit program's reliance on local decisionmaking to \n     best serve a locality's needs. Litigation against a project \n     ought to stand or fall on its own merits in the courts; it \n     ought not be allowed to skew the orderly, even-handed \n     development of legislation for the Fedreal transportation \n     programs.\n       I have sent a similar letter to Congressman Wolf. Please \n     let me know if I can be of any assistance in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Gordon I. Linton.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I look forward to continued conversations with the \nchairman and BART officials to bring some better understanding of their \nrespective concerns before the Senate completes a conference report on \nthe bill.\n  I also look forward to further conversations on how we can increase \nfunding for the Los Angeles Red Line extension. The $55 million \nprovided in the bill will have a serious impact on the project's \nconstruction schedule. The amount is about a third of the President's \nrequest. The shortfall could lead to $300 million in cost increases \nfrom delays. More than 5,000 jobs would be lost. Ultimately, this \nshortfall will lead to slower highway speeds and costly delays that our \nstressed Los Angeles highway network and its commuters can hardly \nsustain.\n  We still have more work to do in conference to improve the \ninfrastructure investments for California. Overall, the Senate bill \nprovides greater help for my State, and I am hopeful these last few \ndifferences can be settled so we can\n\n[[Page S9287]]\n\nsend the bill to the President for his signature.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \ntransportation appropriations bill. I want to applaud Senators Hatfield \nand Lautenberg for their strong leadership over an area of increased \ncompetition for fewer dollars.\n  This legislation though, is bittersweet, as it marks the final \ntransportation bill for Chairman Hatfield. My neighbor to the south has \nbeen a compassionate champion for our Nation's infrastructure. The loss \nto this body and the Pacific Northwest will be felt for a very long \ntime.\n  The State of Washington has witnessed tremendous growth over the last \ndecade, accompanied by traffic congestion on roads that have not kept \npace with this region's large influx of residents. I am pleased that \nthis bill seeks to accommodate much of that growth within the Puget \nSound region.\n  The committee has included funds which support a commuter rail \nservice between the cities of Everett, Seattle, and Tacoma. This line \nwould form the foundation for a larger regional transit service in the \nPuget Sound that is set for a vote this November. This commuter service \nwould operate trains on existing track between the most heavily \npopulated centers of Washington State.\n  The committee also included funding to aid commuters traveling from \nsuburban cities to downtown Seattle. These funds will enable King \nCounty Metro to connect the cities of Kenmore, Redmond, Renton, \nTukwila, and Auburn with Seattle, through smaller neighborhood buses \nthat meet larger commuter buses heading into the city.\n  Further, I am thrilled that the bill has included funds that support \na comprehensive transportation solution to congestion around the \nKingdome and new baseball stadium. Together with King County, the city \nof Seattle, the Washington State Department of Transportation, the Port \nof Seattle, the Baseball Stadium Public Facilities District and \nBurlington Northern-Santa Fe Railroad, these dollars will create a \ntransit center facilitating access for both transit and pedestrians \nthrough the area.\n  Last, Mr. President, I wanted to commend the committee for allowing \nWenatchee to finish construction on the Chelan-Douglas Multimodal \nCenter. The city of Wenatchee and Link Transit Systems have been \nworking on the Multimodal Transportation Center project for 3 years. \nThese funds will finish construction on the project and improve \npedestrian and bicycle access.\n  All of these projects utilize several different modes of \ntransportation to more quickly and efficiently move our growing \npopulation. I appreciate the committee's hard work in light of \ndifficult budget choices and urge my colleagues' support of this \ncritical appropriations bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Department of \nTransportation and Related Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year \n1997.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor bringing us a balanced bill considering the current budget \nconstraints.\n  The Senate reported bill provides $12.6 billion in new budget \nauthority [BA] and $12.3 billion in new outlays to fund the programs of \nthe Department of Transportation, including federal aid highway, mass \ntransit, and aviation activities.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority is taken into account, \nthe bill totals $12.6 billion in BA and $36.1 billion in new outlays.\n  The subcommittee is essentially at its 602(b) allocation in both BA \nand outlays.\n  The Senate reported bill is $184 million in outlays below the \nPresident's 1997 request. The bill does provide for the President's \nrequest of $250 million for state infrastructure banks.\n  The Senate reported bill is $240 million in BA below the House \nversion of the bill. Both House and Senate bills provide the same \namount of outlays.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of this bill be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  TRANSPORTATION SUBCOMMITTEE--SPENDING TOTALS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL--  \n                            FISCAL YEAR 1997                            \n                        [In millions of dollars]                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      Budget            \n                                                    authority   Outlays \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDefense discretionary;                                                  \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed....................................  .........         37\n    H.R. 3675, as reported to the Senate..........  .........  .........\n    Scorekeeping adjustment.......................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Subtotal defense discretionary..............  .........         37\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed....................................  .........     23,748\n    H.R. 3675, as reported to the Senate..........     11,950     11,668\n    Scorekeeping adjustment.......................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Subtotal nondefense discretionary...........     11,950     35,416\nMandatory:                                                              \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed....................................  .........  .........\n    H.R. 3675, as reported to the Senate..........        608        602\n    Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                       \n     Budget Resolutions assumptions...............         -3  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Subtotal mandatory..........................        605        602\n                                                   =====================\n        Adjusted bill total.......................     12,555     36,055\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n    Defense discretionary.........................  .........         37\n    Nondefense discretionary......................     11,950     35,416\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund............  .........  .........\n    Mandatory.....................................        605        602\n      Total allocation............................     12,555     36,055\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate                                  \n Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                        \n    Defense discretionary.........................  .........  .........\n    Nondefense discretionary......................  .........  .........\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund............  .........  .........\n    Mandatory.....................................  .........  .........\n    Total allocation..............................  .........  .........\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe bill was passed.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Now, Mr. President, I move that the Senate insist on \nits amendments, request a conference with the House of Representatives \non the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized \nto appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S9288]]\n\n  The motion was agreed to, and the Presiding Officer appointed Mr. \nHatfield, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Specter, Mr. Bond, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Shelby, \nMr. Lautenberg, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Mikulski and Mr. Reid \nconferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I want to call attention to a matter \nrelating to one of our staff people, Pat McCann, who is the staff \ndirector for the majority party. He is a very interesting person who \nhas been on this committee, the transportation subcommittee, for 13 \nyears. It is illustrative of another matter, and that is how our \ncommittee must operate on a bipartisan basis.\n  When we bring a bill to the floor we have to have comanagers, in \nwhich the ranking member and whoever he or she may be, a Democrat and a \nRepublican, and the Chair, have to have agreed to the bill and \ntherefore present a united front. I say this is unusual about \ncommittees in the Senate, but we are the only committee that has to \nreport bills by law. We have to keep this country going and, therefore, \nwe have to report 13 bills, come whatever may.\n  I happened to be chairing the Appropriations Committee in a previous \ncycle, from 1981 to 1987. I, at that time, had an opportunity to hire \non the committee Pat McCann, as the Republican majority at that time. \nBut subsequent chairmen of that committee, the full committee, Senator \nStennis and Senator Byrd, followed the same pattern that I followed and \nthat is that we do not wipe out our staff in each election cycle, \nbecause they are truly professionals, serving both sides of the \ncommittee. So Pat McCann continued on in that professional role.\n  My immediate predecessor, Senator Lautenberg, now the ranking member, \nas the chairman of that subcommittee, continued Pat McCann, and Anne \nMiano, our assistant staff director, was hired by Senator D'Amato when \nhe chaired that particular subcommittee. As it was with Peter Rogoff, \nwho is now the staff director for the minority. They continued all \nthrough these various changes of party and majorityship.\n  So I not only pay tribute to Pat McCann for his faithful service, \ntotally professional service that he has provided the committee, but to \nall the staff on our particular committee.\n  I thank also at this time the outstanding work of Senator Lautenberg. \nWe could not have brought this bill to the floor without Senator \nLautenberg's leadership, and we could not have resolved the many \nconflicts and problems that we faced in this committee.\n  Again, I say to Anne Miano, Peter Rogoff, Pat McCann that we only are \nable to do this when we have this kind of staff. We look good, and at \nthe same time we have to realize it is more than just our charming \npersonalities. It is the fine work of staff that has made possible the \nproducing of this bill.\n  So I just want to call attention to Pat's leaving of the Senate. He \nis going to move through the conference with us. By the time we get \nthat conference report back here, he will probably be up in the \nbalcony, up in the gallery. I hope he is not editorializing verbally up \nthere as we proceed with the conference report, because I expect it to \nbe of such quality that we will be able to pass it with a voice vote \nwithin a very, very brief time.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I, too, want to add some words of \ncommendation and appreciation to the staff, particularly on this \noccasion when Pat McCann will have seen the last transportation \nappropriations bill that he is going to have to work on. I reminded \nhim, sometime he is going to look back here, where it is a quarter to \n10 at night, he has not had dinner, has not seen his family, he has not \nbeen able to watch the Olympics, how much he is going to miss this \nplace. He started to weep, and I could see a tear fall down his cheek, \nbut he will be strong.\n  On a serious note, Pat's service has been truly exemplary of \nbipartisanship. He came to me as a Republican, stayed with me as a \nRepublican and left as a Republican. That is really bipartisan. But we \nhave worked very well together--again, trying to be serious, Pat and \nPeter, the two senior people on each of the subcommittee staffs, the \nmajority and the minority, have given loyal service wherever and \nwhenever called upon to do so.\n  We are going to miss Pat. He brings a special touch and a good sense \nof humor and knows the subject extremely well, and he had the good \njudgment to send his daughter to college in New Jersey. Princeton, of \ncourse, is a nice place to have a child. Mine didn't go there. He felt \nit was too close to dad or too close to home. Pat has been a marvelous, \nmarvelous influence on staff and on Members as well.\n  So it is with other members. Peter Rogoff is really busy these days. \nWe learned the difference between being in the majority and being in \nthe minority. It is numbers of people that you have to do the job. \nPeter has been a very able assistant throughout this.\n\n  I thank also Anne Miano. I have gotten to know Anne over the years \nand watched her approach motherhood and do that very well, while also \nstaying on top of the work she has here.\n  Joyce Rose who has been helpful, Carole Geagley and Mike Brennan, his \nfirst time on the bill. To all the staff, my deepest appreciation and \nthanks for a good job.\n  When I look at how complicated things are right now and see how \nsparse the funding for major, significant programs has become, we just \ndealt with over 37 billion dollars' worth of funding, very important \ntransportation programs dealing with aviation, highways, rail, Coast \nGuard, and I think have done it with balance and with consideration for \nthe value of all of the programs.\n  That resulted, Mr. President, from the influence of Senator Hatfield, \nhis leadership, his constancy, his conscientious belief that things \nhave to be right among all, not just a few. It has enabled me to feel \nvery good and feel like a full partner, though in the minority status \nand throughout the negotiation and the planning and the hearings and \nthe markup of this bill.\n  So, we note with a degree of sadness, though he will be here with \nother bills, this is the last time that we will have Senator Hatfield's \nvalued hand as chairman. I hope, too, the conference will go through on \na voice vote and, as a tribute to Mark Hatfield, perhaps I can call on \nthe goodness of the hearts of our colleagues to do it just that way.\n  As a friend, as a leader, as an outstanding citizen and American, \nMark Hatfield has been an enlightenment for many of us and particularly \nfor me in the years I have had a chance to work with him.\n  We close this bill hoping our colleagues are satisfied with the job \nwe have tried to do as best we can. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In addressing the Committee he stated, ``While I can't change \nthe past, I can--and did--learn from it; so did the rest of the Navy. I \nwas cautioned by the Secretary of the Navy for not being proactive in \nmonitoring the conduct of\n\n[[Page S9289]]\n\njunior officers and not taking effective action to prevent misconduct \nat Tailhook '91.

Mr. President, history will record Senator Sam Nunn's \ndistinguished public service with many chapters. There are, I am \ncertain, more to come covering future challenges he will accept.\n  None, however, will be more important, more meaningful to him, than \nhis ever vigilant concern for the men and women of all ranks of the \narmed services.\n  I can attest to his work, for I was privileged to serve on the Armed \nServices Committee for 6 years, when Senator Nunn was chairman, as the \nranking Republican.\n  We were partners and a very high degree of bipartisanship prevailed \namong all members.\n  One of the many tributes to his service on this committee was paid to \nSenator Nunn on July 12, 1996, with a Trooping of the Colors by the \ntroops for their chairman.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record remarks made on \nthis memorable auspicious occasion.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Full Honor Review and Award Ceremony for Senator Sam Nunn\n\n\n                            Award Narrative\n\n       For exceptional and outstanding service as Chairman, \n     Ranking Member, and Member of the Armed Services Committee of \n     the United States Senate from 1972 through 1996.\n       Senator Nunn has been the leading legislative voice on \n     national security issues during a period of extraordinary \n     change and challenge for the Department of Defense. With his \n     unparalleled knowledge of national defense and foreign policy \n     issues, his contributions to the security and well-being of \n     our Nation are profound. His clear and eloquent voice has \n     focused public debate on defining the vital interests of the \n     United States, and promoted a strong defense and peace for \n     future generations.\n       Senator Nunn has taken the initiative in authoring and \n     sustaining legislation that has strengthened the morale and \n     welfare of our men and women in uniform and their families, \n     including the Nunn-Warner increases in military pay and \n     benefits in 1980 to put the All-Volunteer Force on a sound \n     footing, the Persian Gulf benefits package for the men and \n     women who fought in Operation Desert Storm, and the post-\n     cold-war transition benefits for military personnel, \n     Department of Defense civilians, and defense industry \n     employees.\n       Senator Nunn co-authored the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat \n     Reduction Program which has reduced significantly the threat \n     of nuclear war by providing incentives for the states of the \n     former Soviet Union to dismantle their arsenals.\n       Senator Nunn played a critical role in the development of \n     the Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986, \n     creation of the combatant command for special operation \n     forces, enactment of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act \n     of 1994, establishment of cooperative acquisition programs \n     with our NATO allies, passage of legislation to facilitate \n     cost savings through the closing of military bases, and in \n     the development of the annual National Defense \n     Authorization Acts.\n       At the request of President Clinton, he accompanied former \n     President Jimmy Carter and retired General Colin Powell to \n     Haiti during the 1994 crisis, where he helped to achieve an \n     agreement that averted a military confrontation.\n       Senator Nunn has consistently articulated his views in a \n     bipartisan manner that recognizes and sustains the \n     traditional values of military service, duty, and patriotism. \n     His achievements and dedication represent the highest \n     traditions of government and public service, and reflects \n     great credit upon himself, the Department of Defense, and the \n     Congress of the United States. For these and his many other \n     contributions, I take great pleasure in presenting Sam Nunn \n     the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public \n     Service. [Applause]\n       Secretary Perry: Less than a mile up the Potomac River from \n     here on Roosevelt Island are inscribed these words of \n     President Theodore Roosevelt: ``In popular government, \n     results worth having can be achieved only by men who can \n     combine worthy ideals with practical good sense.'' For more \n     than two decades, our government has been blessed with the \n     worthy results achieved by a man known for combining worthy \n     ideals with practical good sense. That man is Senator Sam \n     Nunn.\n       Worthy ideals and practical good sense are the hallmarks of \n     each of Sam Nunn's many achievements. In 1991, Senator Nunn \n     had the practical good sense that the world would be a much \n     safer place if the thousands of nuclear weapons in the former \n     Soviet Union were dismantled and safeguarded. He combined \n     that practical good sense with worthy ideals, and along with \n     Senator Richard Lugar, created the Nunn-Lugar program. This \n     program has been a remarkable success.\n       Perhaps the most compelling Nunn-Lugar success story is \n     centered on the Ukrainian town of Pervomaysk, which once \n     housed 700 nuclear warheads, all of them aimed at targets in \n     the United States. I have visited Pervomaysk four times in \n     the last two years. The first visit was in March 1994, just \n     after we signed the Trilateral Agreement, when I looked down \n     into a nuclear missile silo and saw the missile, then saw the \n     first batch of warheads on the way out. On my fourth visit \n     this June, I joined the defense ministers of Ukraine and \n     Russia in planting sunflower seeds at the site. By harvest \n     time, that former missile field will be a productive \n     sunflower field.\n       Thanks to the vision of Senator Sam Nunn, over 4,000 \n     nuclear warheads have been removed from deployment and more \n     than 700 bombers and ballistic missile launchers have been \n     dismantled. Ukraine is now nuclear-weapons free. Kazakstan is \n     already weapons free and Belarus will be nuclear weapons free \n     by the end of the year.\n       The worthy ideals and common sense that lie behind the \n     Nunn-Lugar program, are emblematic of Senator Nunn's entire \n     career in the U.S. Senate. He has applied these traits to \n     making America safer and stronger. He was the unsung hero of \n     the Goldwater-Nichols Act. Sam never minded being unsung, but \n     I think today we ought to sing him. And--\n       [Applause]\n       --I believe the Goldwater-Nichols Act is perhaps the most \n     important defense legislation since World War II. It \n     dramatically changed the way that America's forces operate by \n     streamlining the command process and empowering the Chairman \n     of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the unified commanders. \n     These changes paid off in the resounding success of our \n     forces in Desert Storm, in Haiti, and today, in Bosnia. Sam \n     Nunn provided much of the thinking and logic behind the \n     legislation and was the persuasive force behind its passage \n     into law. I will always think of it as the Goldwater-Nichols-\n     Nunn legislation.\n       Throughout his career, Senator Nunn left his mark \n     throughout the U.S. Armed Forces. In the 1970's and the \n     1980's, he championed the stealth technology that helped \n     win the Gulf War. In the 1990's, he led the fight for \n     acquisition reform, ensuring that our forces get the best \n     equipment, at the best price, at the quickest time. And \n     he's been a strong advocate of making the most use of the \n     Guard and Reserve and their unique talents and resources.\n       And nobody--I mean nobody--has done more for our men and \n     women in uniform than Sam Nunn. He knows that they are the \n     ones we count on to keep our country safe. And he's worked \n     tirelessly to help build our quality force. Thanks to his \n     efforts, we now have the best force in our history and the \n     best force in the world. I have seen that quality force in \n     action everywhere I've traveled. I've seen it at the DMZ in \n     Korea, on the carriers in the Med and along the zone of \n     separation in Bosnia.\n       I visited our IFOR troops in early January. It was the day \n     after we opened up the Pontoon Bridge over the Sava River on \n     the Bosnia border. The tanks and the Bradleys were rolling \n     across the bridge and General Nash, General Joulwan, General \n     Shalikaskvili and I decided that our entry to Bosnia would be \n     on foot. And we decided to walk across the Sava River bridge \n     from Croatia into Bosnia. Halfway across, we met some of the \n     combat engineers who built the bridge, still working on \n     finishing up some of the details. One of them was Sergeant \n     First Class Kidwell, who stepped forward and said his \n     enlistment was up and he wanted to reenlist. After all he and \n     his comrades had been through to build this bridge--the \n     bitter cold, the flooding of epic proportions, the danger of \n     land mines--this sergeant still wanted to reenlist.\n       And so we swore him in for another four years in the Army, \n     right there in the middle of the Sava River bridge. And I can \n     tell you I have never been more proud of our Armed Forces \n     than at that moment. And that moment--[Applause]--that moment \n     is a tribute to Sam Nunn and to the quality force he has \n     fought to build.\n       Today, the Department of Defense is thanking Senator Nunn, \n     through his Distinguished Public Service Award. And to this \n     award, I want to add my personal thanks. Three-and-a-half \n     years ago, as I was considering whether or not to return to \n     public service and to Washington, I consulted Senator Nunn. \n     He urged me to accept the job as\n\n[[Page S9290]]\n\n     Deputy Secretary of Defense, and he talked about the exciting \n     opportunities to improve the security of our country. And as \n     I weighed my decision, one of the big pluses in my thinking \n     was the opportunity to work with a public servant as \n     intelligent, thoughtful, and courageous as Sam Nunn.\n       Well, this is Sam Nunn's last year in the U.S. Senate, but \n     his influence will last for decades to come. He influenced \n     the Senate and the Department of Defense. He's influenced the \n     Nation. He leaves a magnificent legacy; a legacy of wisdom, \n     tenacity, vision, and patriotism; a legacy which will make \n     our world a better and safer world for our children and our \n     grandchildren. Thank you, Senator Nunn.\n       [Applause]\n       General Shalikashvili: Senator Nunn, Mrs. Nunn, \n     distinguished guests, let me begin by congratulating these \n     magnificent soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coast \n     guardsmen standing in front of you.\n       [Applause]\n       My thanks to you. You've really made this day very, very \n     special.\n       Now, in ancient times, the purpose of parades was for \n     soldiers to come together in a very formal way to honor a man \n     of very great status. And that very much is the purpose of \n     this ceremony today--to honor a most remarkable man and to \n     thank him for 24 years of service in the U.S. Senate.\n       President Theodore Roosevelt had a favorite admonishment--a \n     warning really--a warning that you cannot spread patriotism \n     too thin. Surely, as much as any American alive today, Sam \n     Nunn has painted a picture--a vibrant canvas of patriotism--a \n     canvas unstained by partisanship or personal gain, or even \n     personal pride. But painted, instead, with broad brush \n     strokes of wisdom, of conscience, of love for his country and \n     of heartfelt love for the men and women in uniform. He has \n     sat through year after year, for over two decades, of endless \n     hearings and briefings, of going on trip after trip, \n     listening to the needs and requests from our country's senior \n     military and defense officials--always patiently, always with \n     the courtliness for which he's so well known. And always it \n     has been with the dedication to ensure that our policies are \n     correct, that are plans are well-conceived, and that our \n     military has the resources to remain the finest and most \n     capable military in the world.\n       It has been said of him, that on issues of national \n     security, Sam Nunn is the E.F. Hutton of the Hill. Well, \n     actually, he's bigger than that. People not only eavesdropped \n     to hear his views, they sought his views. [Applause]\n       There is an old saying that if you want peace, then you \n     must understand war. It is a dictum that Sam Nunn has spent \n     his career heeding--to the great benefit of his fellow \n     Americans and of every American that's worn the uniform \n     during his 24 years in the Senate.\n       I, for one, will greatly miss his counsel, his support, and \n     his friendship and his unyielding efforts to maintain the \n     Armed Services Committee as a serious body where issues of \n     national security receive a fair and open hearing, and where \n     wisdom and conscience, rather than partisanship, rule.\n       Senator Nunn, on behalf of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and on \n     behalf of every man and woman in uniform, I thank you and I \n     salute you. And I also suspect, indeed, I sincerely hope, \n     that your voice and your counsel and your service will remain \n     a national asset for a long, long time to come. My thanks to \n     you. [Applause]\n       Senator Nunn: Secretary Perry, General Shalikashvili, \n     members of the Joint Chiefs, Department of Defense personnel, \n     Chairman Thurmond, my colleagues in the Senate and House and \n     staffs--we should never forget them--distinguished \n     ambassadors, men and women of our military service, members \n     of my family and many friends.\n       From the bottom of my heart, I thank you for this great \n     honor, for this medal and for this ceremony. Colleen and I \n     will cherish this day, this parade, this ceremony, and we \n     will remember it forever. Chairman Carl Vinson, my great-\n     uncle, upon the christening of the nuclear aircraft carrier \n     named in his honor, stated, ``My star has reached its \n     zenith.'' I feel that way today, Secretary Perry, General \n     Shali and all of you gathered here.\n       Secretary Perry and General Shali, your remarks were so \n     laudatory that I may change my mind and follow in the \n     footsteps of Senator Strom Thurmond by becoming a write-in \n     candidate for the U.S. Senate. [Applause]\n       Congress has no higher responsibility than its duty under \n     our Constitution to provide for the common defense. That is \n     our constitutional charge. During my quarter century in the \n     Senate, my greatest sense of satisfaction has been working \n     with our outstanding men and women in uniform that serve our \n     Nation all over the world, as well as the personnel in the \n     Department of Defense. To those who proudly marched in \n     today's parade and to your comrades in arms who are on duty \n     around the world--those of us in the Congress of the United \n     States, and I think I can speak for everyone on both sides of \n     the aisle, we are very proud of you and we are very proud of \n     your families and we are proud of the job you do for the \n     American people.\n       When I look around this audience, I feel like a pupil \n     standing with gratitude before his mentors, his teachers and \n     his heroes.\n       Secretary of Defense Bill Perry is all three. He has \n     matched his technological genius with his dedicated \n     commitment to the well-being of our men and women that serve \n     our Nation in uniform. His personal integrity and his ability \n     to explain complex issues in understandable terms is \n     particularly valued by those of us whose VCRs are always \n     blinking at 12 o'clock. [Laughter]\n       Secretary Perry's ability to judge character and leadership \n     is exemplified in his choice of General Shalikashvili to head \n     our Nation's armed forces. General Shali, we are grateful for \n     your outstanding career and most of all we are grateful for \n     your leadership of our military and for your example to the \n     young people in the military and all young Americans.\n       When I see here today the Under Secretary for Acquisition \n     and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, I am reminded of \n     1977 when then Air Force Colonel Paul Kaminski and his \n     assistant, then Major Joe Ralston, were driving Arnold Punaro \n     and me on a cloak-and-dagger route to see the then highly-\n     classified Stealth fighter at a clandestine location which \n     could not be mentioned to anyone. The reason the F-117 stayed \n     secret so long is that these guys couldn't find the base. \n     [Laughter]\n       We ended up calling for help at a McDonalds' pay phone. \n     There was, however, no doubt about their ability to keep a \n     secret. Perhaps, that is why they are such good leaders \n     today.\n       When I see retired General James Hollingsworth, my dear \n     friend, in the audience, it brings back memories of his \n     outstanding leadership in Korea and his leadership in \n     the fundamental strengthening of our NATO posture at a \n     very crucial time in our history. Thank you, Holly.\n       When I see one of my great friends and teachers, Jim \n     Schlesinger, former ``Secretary of Everything,'' I am \n     reminded of his enormous contributions to our national \n     security for the last four decades. Jim continues to be \n     America's intellectual ``pillar of iron'' on matters of \n     national security and foreign policy.\n       I also think back today to the courageous leadership of \n     General David Jones, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs; \n     General Shy Meyer, the head of the U.S. Army; as well as \n     Admiral Bill Crowe, now Ambassador, in leading the way toward \n     fundamental Department of Defense reorganization which has \n     paid off big-time as Secretary Perry has already mentioned. I \n     also recall my good friend, the late General Dick Ellis, who \n     as commander of the Strategic Air Command, prepared the \n     foundation for much of the work I have done in risk reduction \n     and non-proliferation. John Warner remembers that well \n     because he was my partner in that endeavor.\n       I am reminded of industry giants like David Packard who \n     recently passed away and others like him in industry today--\n     many of whom are in this audience--who have led the way in \n     making America the technological superpower of the world.\n       I think today of our excellent Committee staff who have \n     assisted me and the Senate for the last 24 years, indeed, \n     assisted all of us in the Congress, led by Staff Directors \n     like Ed Braswell, Frank Sullivan, Rhett Dawson, Jim Roche, \n     Jim McGovern, Carl Smith, Pat Tucker, Dick Reynard, Les \n     Brownlee and, of course, Arnold Punaro, who likes to be \n     called general. These staff directors and those who serve \n     with them are the unsung heroes of America's military \n     strength. They work day and night. They are assisted every \n     day by outstanding people on our personal staffs. Many of \n     those are here today. I will not try to call all of their \n     names, but I am indebted to them and they know it.\n       There are two important footnotes to every national \n     security improvement in which I have been involved. First, I \n     take full responsibility for my mistakes and my bad ideas. No \n     one else is responsible for those. But all of my good ideas \n     were inspired by our men and women in uniform like those who \n     stand so proudly here today. I have been the beneficiary of \n     the leadership, guidance, advice and support of Senators like \n     Senator John Stennis, Senator Scoop Jackson, and Senator \n     Robert Byrd, as well as my other colleagues on the Armed \n     Services and Appropriations Committees and my many friends in \n     the House of Representatives. That's the first footnote.\n       My second footnote, I believe, is of some relevance in this \n     era of unfortunate but increasing political party warfare. \n     And that's what it is. Each time I have been involved in a \n     major national security initiative, it has been with a \n     Republican partner.\n       From Barry Goldwater and Strom Thurmond on defense \n     reorganization; to John Warner on risk reduction and pay and \n     benefits for our troops; to Bill Cohen on special operations \n     and low intensity conflict and de-mirving our missiles; and \n     to Dick Lugar and Pete Domenici on preventing the spread of \n     weapons of mass destruction.\n       Every major improvement in defense during my time in the \n     Senate has been the result of a few Senators and House \n     Members of both parties putting our Nation's security before \n     partisan politics. [Applause.]\n       I submit, ladies and gentlemen, that there is no serious \n     problem facing America today that can be solved by one \n     political party. The American people recognize that and it is \n     time for those of us in Washington to recognize that. \n     [Applause.]\n       I could go on and on, but most of the parades I have \n     attended were as an enlisted man standing at parade rest so \n     the time has come for self-imposed cloture. [Laughter.]\n\n[[Page S9291]]\n\n       Thomas Jefferson once said, ``The blood of martyrs is the \n     seed of freedom's tree.'' America's independence and our \n     continued freedom have rested for 220 years on this premise. \n     Freedom is in greater supply around the world today thanks to \n     the United States and our allies--our allies played a big \n     role and we should never forget that--but it comes at no \n     small price in terms of required courage and commitment.\n       To the men and women in uniform and to all those who serve \n     our Nation, I will leave the Senate keenly aware of what \n     every American should remember. Our sense of security depends \n     on your vigilance and your discipline. Our prosperity depends \n     on your sacrifice. Our dreams and our children's dreams \n     depend on your sleepless nights. And our freedom to live our \n     lives in freedom depends on your willingness to risk yours.\n       May God bless each of you and all of those who serve \n     America in the cause of freedom.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the dedication, \npublic service, and patriotism that personified the life of Capt. John \nWilliam Kennedy, U.S. Air Force. Lieutenant Kennedy, or Jack as he was \nbetter known, was reported as missing in action on August 16, 1971, in \nSouth Vietnam. He was presumed killed in action on July 16, 1978, and \nfinally confirmed as having been killed in action in May of this year.\n  Jack was born here in Washington, DC, but grew up in nearby \nArlington, VA. He graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in \n1969. While at VMI, he was the 1969 Southern Conference 160-pound \nwrestling champion, a member of the VMI honor court, and was inducted \ninto the VMI sports hall of fame in 1980.\n  In October 1970, a year after entering the Air Force, Jack graduated \nfrom pilot training at Craig FBI in Selma, AL, and was awarded the \nUndergraduate Pilot Training Office Training Award for being tops in \nhis class. He then attended O-2A pilot training at Hurlburt Field, \nEglin AFB, FL, and was thereafter assigned to the 20th Tactical Air \nSupport Squadron [PACAF] in South Vietnam.\n  Unfortunately, Jack's promising young career was tragically ended \nwhile Captain Kennedy was flying on a visual reconnaissance mission \nover the Quangtin Province in South Vietnam. On August 16, 1971, radio \ncontact with Jack's O-2A aircraft was lost. A search effort was \ninitiated, but no crash site or radio contacts or witnesses were \nuncovered. U.S. Army intelligence reports indicated that the 31st North \nVietnamese Regiment was in the area at this time.\n  In 1993, over 20 years later, remains were found at a crash site in \nQuangtin Province. The DNA from these bone fragments were positively \nidentified as a match with Jack's mother in 1995, and Captain Kennedy's \nremains were returned to the United States in late June 1996. On \nFriday, August 2, a funeral is scheduled for Captain Kennedy in the Old \nPost Chapel on Fort Myer, and internment with full military honors will \nfollow at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  For his remarkable, yet short career, Lieutenant Kennedy was awarded \nthe Distinguished Flying Cross, the Purple Heart, the Air Medal with \ntwo oak leaf clusters, the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam \nService Medal, and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal.\n  Capt. John Kennedy was the embodiment of an American hero. A true \npatriot and a superb Air Force officer who served with courage and \nintegrity, he lost his life during one of the most intense and \ndemanding periods in our Nation's history. His mother, who lives in \nLake Ridge, VA, and his brother, Dan, who many of us know from his \nefforts on the Hill as Bechtel's representative, should be proud of \nJack and what he accomplished during his short life. I am thankful that \nJack's fate has been determined, and that he has now been returned home \nfor a proper burial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9289-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SETH J. DIAMOND\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, Montana suffered a large loss on Friday \nafternoon. A plane crash in the northwest corner of our State claimed \nthe life of three men, Seth Diamond, Ken Kohli, and Al Hall. Seth lived \nin Missoula, MT, and Ken and Al lived in Cour d'Alene, ID.\n  Over the last few years, my staff and I had the pleasure of getting \nto know Seth Diamond. As a representative of the timber community in \nthe intermountain West, I had many opportunities to work with Seth. \nWhether we were working on changing the way our Government deals with \nthe Endangered Species Act or working in issues related to forest \nhealth and management, Seth was there with fresh ideas on how to solve \nhotly contested issues. It was Seth's sense of fairplay that gave him \nsuch a good standing with groups on both ends of the natural resource \nmanagement spectrum. I valued and respected his comments and advice.\n  Seth Diamond was born in Philadelphia and grew up on Long Island, NY. \nHe received an undergraduate degree from Duke and a wildlife biology \nmasters from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. In \n1988, Seth found his way to Montana as a biologist for the U.S. Forest \nService. He worked on the Lewis and Clark National Forest out of \nChoteau, MT.\n  The West is truly an unique area. Most believe you have to grow up in \nthe West to appreciate our way of life and feel a strong commitment to \nprotecting the businesses that have made Montana economically and \nculturally what it is today. It amazes me that a kid who grew up on the \neast coast could come to Montana and work to keep the wood products \nindustry a part of Montana's economy, but most importantly believe it \nis vital to the well-being of Montana. Seth did just that.\n  Montana's resource dependent communities owe a great debt to Seth. He \nworked to achieve a common goal of providing jobs for families and \nprotecting a renewable resource.\n  In addition to his commitment to Montana, Seth was a proud family \nman. He is survived by his wife, Carol, and children Kale, Laura, and \nJesse Lynn. They and the rest of the Diamond family have Phyllis' and \nmy prayers.\n  Montana is a richer place today because of the work and dedication of \nSeth Diamond. I feel fortunate to have been given an opportunity to \nconsider him a friend.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9291-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FOREIGN OIL CONSUMED BY U.S.? HERE'S THE WEEKLY BOX SCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending July 26, the United States imported 7,500,000 \nbarrels of oil each day, the same amount imported during the same week \na year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 53.9 percent of their needs last \nweek, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before \nthe Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained about 45 percent of \nits oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in \nthe 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil \nsupply.\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by \nU.S. producers using American workers? Politicians had better ponder \nthe economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign \nproducers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of \nimported oil flowing into the United States--now 7,500,000 barrels a \nday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9291-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9291-S9292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SALUTING THE ALABAMA NSSC DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, in 1981, the Alabama Association of \nRetired Senior Volunteer Program [RSVP] project directors developed a \nproposal requesting State funding for their projects as a supplement to \ntheir Federal budgets. During State budget negotiations, the funding \nwas also extended to Alabama's Senior Companion and Foster Grandparent \nprojects, marking the beginning of a collaboration among senior service \ncorps programs in my State that has continued for 15 years.\n  As a State association known as the Alabama National Senior Service \nCorps Directors Association, these three programs--RSVP, Senior \nCompanion, and Foster Grandparents--have worked together to secure \nother funding. The Senior Corps' 35 State projects receive more than a \nquarter million dollars annually from the State budget to cover costs \nrelated to volunteers. These funds have been used to establish several \nprograms, including a public housing mentoring program and training \nprograms in prescription and over-the-counter drug misuse. The funds \nhave also been used to conduct free\n\n[[Page S9292]]\n\ncommunity intergenerational workshops at sites throughout the State. \nThe association also contracts with the IRS to provide tax counseling \nservices for the elderly.\n  The association is now seeking Medicaid waiver funding and hopes to \nsoon venture into the arena of private sector funding. Project \ndirectors have taken the first step toward seeking private sector \nsupport by incorporating as a 501(c)(3) organization.\n  I am pleased to congratulate and commend the Alabama National Senior \nService Corps Directors Association for developing an array of \noutstanding programs and for providing a model that illustrates the \npower and potential of these kinds of partnerships in providing \nimportant services to our senior citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9291-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE MENTALLY ILL AND THE HEALTH INSURANCE BILL\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I was informed by the chairman of \nLabor, Health and Human Services, Senator Nancy Kassebaum, that the \nconferees on the health insurance bill were not going to include--with \nreference to the mentally ill in this country--were not going to \ninclude even the compromise which had been offered to them that has \nbeen pending for the last 2 or 3 weeks. Frankly, the U.S. Senate voted \noverwhelmingly to rid this country of a terrible, terrible plight, the \ndiscrimination against the mentally ill in insurance coverage in this \ncountry. And not only the discrimination but the lack of fairness and \nparity of coverage.\n  I say publicly now to the business community of the United States, in \nparticular the large companies, some of which are self-insured--I do \nnot say this very often--but ``Shame, shame on you. Shame on you.'' It \nis a very simple proposition of parity that is not going to cost very \nmuch and will say to the 5 million severely mentally ill Americans and \ntheir families that they are not going to be treated any longer like \nsecond-rate, if not third-rate, citizens.\n  All we asked of them in our compromise Senator Wellstone and I \nsubmitted was that if you are going to cover mental illness, if you are \ngoing to cover mental illness, that you must include two things: One, \nthe same lifetime cap that is total coverage, and the same annual \nallowable per year as you include in insurance for everyone else.\n  Let me repeat, that amendment did not require any kind of insurance. \nIt did not dictate coinsurance, deductibility or anything. So companies \ncould still tailor mental health coverage. If they are concerned about \nabuses, they can write the abuses out before they even offer them.\n  All we asked for was the simple proposition to get started \nrecognizing the discrimination that is in our current situation. That \nis to say, those who are mentally ill, do not cover them with $50,000 \nfor life while you cover cancer patients with $1 million, do not cover \nthe mentally ill with a $100,000 total lifetime if you cover those who \nhave tuberculosis or have serious heart trouble with $500,000 or $1 \nmillion. Just parity, total coverage for total lifetime. On an annual \nbasis, do not say to those who are mentally ill, you can only collect \n$10,000 a year maximum where you have $100,000 or $50,000 for others.\n  I truly believe there is a total lack of willingness to understand \nthe nature of this problem. This problem is a blight on America, a \nblight on our insurance companies, and a blight on the business \ncommunity who continues to resist moving in the direction of parity.\n  I want to thank those companies in the United States that already \ncover the mentally ill. And there are many. And I can say they are not \nrunning around complaining about the extraordinary costs. As a matter \nof fact, if this amendment, the one we told them we would settle for, \nwere adopted, the increases are almost insignificant according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, because there are not a lot of people who \nwill reach those limits. It is just to make sure we do not say to them, \nyou are second-rate citizens.\n  If you have insurance, your parents bought insurance, they cover \nsomebody in their family with schizophrenia, they did not get the shock \nof their life that after they have spent $100,000 they have no more for \nthe rest of their life and look around at their neighbor who had a \nheart condition and they get $1 million worth of coverage. No.\n\n  I am not sure where we are going to end up. But I can say that a \ncounteroffer was proposed, and I regret to say it was tantamount to a \nwhole menu of options. And if you have a menu of options, you are going \nto get nothing, you are going to dump the mentally ill where they are \nalready being dumped.\n  So I hope that they will reconsider this decision. I, for one, am \nprepared to look, at this moment, at any way I can--I am not sure I can \nsucceed--but at any way I can to make it hard to pass that bill. And \nany way I can find to make it impossible to pass that bill, I will do \nit. I am not sure on this conference I will accomplish a great deal, \nbut we will make some noise about it because there is no need for this \ndecision to go this way.\n  If those on the business side will look at the proposed amendment \nthat was offered in lieu of the Senate-passed amendment, if they can \ncome forth and tell me and tell those who support it how it will hurt \nthem, how it is going to cost them, what their problems are, then I \nwould be willing to say indeed they are trying to do something fair.\n  Thus far, I think it is stubbornness, I think it is totally shameful, \nand I, for one, have been a staunch supporter of making sure we do not \nput undue burdens on business. It is a joke to say they do not want any \nadditional mandates when the whole bill is a mandate. The whole bill is \na mandate. We mandate insurance companies and businesses to pay for \npeople with preexisting conditions which is going to cost billions of \ndollars, and they do not talk about that. There is no excuse.\n  I, for one, believe we have made a reasonable case. We have been more \nthan fair. The millions of Americans suffering from this disgraceful \ndiscrimination are willing to accept a foot in the door, a little bit, \njust a start, and we get the door slammed right on them.\n  Obviously, we have a lot of work to do, but any conferees that are \nunaware of the decision to give the mentally ill people of this country \nnothing in this conference report, maybe they ought to start with the \nconferees. That is what they are about to do.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say that the Senator from New Mexico spoke with \ngreat eloquence and power, and speaks for me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9292-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9292-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9292-S9293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:30 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, with an amendment, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       S. 640.

A bill to modify certain provisions of the Health Care \nQuality Improvement Act of 1986; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 2005. A bill to prohibit the restriction of certain types of \nmedical communications between a health care provider and a patient; to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n           the patient communications protection act of 1996\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two new bills \nwhich I believe will help more fully inform patients and consumers \nabout the health care choices they face, and safeguard the most \ncritical relationship between care giver and patient.\n  The first bill, which I introduce with my colleagues Senator Snowe \nand Senator Boxer, is the Health Care Quality Improvements Act of 1996. \nIt amends and improves the 1986 public law which created the national \npractitioner databank, an informational resource maintained by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services which is a compendium of State \ndisciplinary actions and civil malpractice case judgments against \ncaregivers. As of this year, some 86,000 caregivers are listed in this \ntaxpayer-supported databank. Currently, this informational resource is \naccessible only by hospitals, insurance plans, and State boards of \nmedicine and health care licensing. The legislation introduced by \nSenator Snowe and me, today, would for the first time allow public \naccess to critically important databank records. Caregivers who have \nhad at least three reportable incidents in their files would have their \nentire databank records opened to the public. This legislation also \nwould create an Internet site on the World Wide Web allowing easier \naccess for publicly accessible information.\n  The second bill, the Patient Communications Protection Act of 1996, \nwould make illegal provisions in some contracts between caregivers and \nhealth plans which restrict communications between caregivers and their \npatients. Too often, I believe, these contract provisions limit the \nfree and necessary communications of information to patients regarding \ntheir medical condition and all possible modalities of treatment. This \nlegislation, while upholding the right of plans to work with physicians \nto improve the overall quality of care within a health plan, clearly \nrestricts plans from impeding the free flow of medical information \nbetween State-licensed caregivers and patient.\n  The Health Care Quality Improvements Act is endorsed by a number of \ngroups including Families USA, Consumer Action, the National \nAssociation of Health Data Organizations, and the United Seniors Health \nCooperative.\n  The Patient Communications Protection Act is supported by the Oregon \nMedical Association, the American Association of Retired Persons, the \nCenter for Patient Advocacy, Citizen Action, the Consumers Union, and \nthe American College of Emergency Physicians.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2004\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Health Care Quality \n     Improvement Act Amendments of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STANDARDS FOR PROFESSIONAL REVIEW ACTIONS.\n\n       Section 412(a) of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act \n     of 1986 (42 U.S.C. 11112(a)) is amended in the matter after \n     and below paragraph (4) by adding at the end the following \n     sentence: ``A motion for summary judgment that such standards \n     have been met shall be granted unless, considering the \n     evidence in the light most favorable to the opposing party, a \n     reasonable finder of fact could conclude that the presumption \n     has been so rebutted. The decision on such a motion may be \n     appealed as of right, without regard to whether the motion is \n     granted or denied, and the courts of appeals (other than the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit) have \n     jurisdiction of appeals from such decisions of the district \n     courts.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Carjacking \nCorrection Act of 1996. This bill adds an important clarification to \nthe Federal carjacking statute, which is to provide that a rape \ncommitted during a carjacking should be considered a serious bodily \ninjury.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Biden. He\n\n[[Page S9300]]\n\nhas long been a leader in addressing the threat of violence against \nwomen, and our partnership in enacting the Violence Against Women Act \nis evidence of strong bipartisan outrage at every incident of assault \nor domestic violence.\n  This correction to the law is necessitated by the fact that at least \none court has held that under the Federal carjacking statute, rape \nwould not constitute a serious bodily injury. Few crimes are as brutal, \nvicious, and harmful to the victim than rape. Yet, under this \ninterpretation, the sentencing enhancement for such injury may not be \napplied to a carjacker who brutally rapes his victim.\n  In my view, Congress should act now to clarify the law in this \nregard. The bill we introduce today would do this by specifically \nincluding rape as serious bodily injury under the statute.\n  I want to thank Representative John Conyers, the ranking member of \nthe House Judiciary Committee, who brought this matter to my attention \nand is leading the effort in the House for passage of this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Wellstone, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \n        Inouye, Mr. Pell, Mr. Simon, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Breaux, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        Robb, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 2008. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide \nbenefits for certain children of Vietnam veterans who are born with \nspina bifida, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans \nAffairs.\n\n\n                 The Agent Orange Benefits Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today, with 19 of my colleagues, I am \nintroducing the Agent Orange Benefits Act of 1996. This legislation is \nan important step toward easing the burden of innocent, indirect \nvictims of our country's use of agent orange during the Vietnam war. \nThe bill would extend health care and related benefits, including a \nmonthly monetary allowance, to Vietnam veterans' children suffering \nfrom spina bifida--a serious neural tube birth defect that requires \nlifelong care.\n  This bill is a necessary followup to the Agent Orange Act of 1991, \nwhich I coauthored with Senators Kerry and Cranston and Representative \nLane Evans and which unanimously passed the Senate. Among other things, \nthe Agent Orange Act required the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA] \nto contract with the Institute of Medicine [IOM], which is part of the \nNational Academy of Sciences [NAS], to conduct a scientific review of \nall evidence pertaining to exposure to agent orange and other \nherbicides used in Vietnam and the subsequent occurrence of disease and \nother health-related conditions. The law required an initial report, \nwhich was issued by NAS in 1993, followed by biennial updates for 10 \nyears. The first update was published by NAS last March.\n  In accordance with the law, Vietnam veterans are not required to \nprove exposure to agent orange; the law presumes that all military \npersonnel who served in Vietnam were exposed to agent orange. The \nSecretary is to provide presumptive disability compensation for \ndiseases suffered by Vietnam veterans whenever he determines, based on \nall credible evidence, including the congressionally mandated NAS \nreports, that a positive association exists between exposure and the \noccurrence of such diseases in humans. For purposes of this law, a \npositive association must be found to exist whenever credible evidence \nfor an association is equal to or outweighs the credible evidence \nagainst the association.\n  We have been struggling for decades to provide compensation and \nhealth care for Vietnam veterans--and, if warranted, their children--\nfor health problems associated with exposure to agent orange. Since \n1985, Vietnam veterans have been eligible for free VA health care for \nconditions believed to be related to exposure to agent orange. Vietnam \nveterans are also eligible for presumptive disability compensation for \nseveral diseases, including chloracne and various cancers, associated \nwith exposure to agent orange or other herbicides used in Vietnam. Most \nrecently, in response to the March NAS report, the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs awarded service-connected disability compensation for \nprostate cancer and acute and subacute peripheral neuropathy.\n  An area of key concern to Vietnam veterans has been what they believe \nto be a high rate of birth defects in the children born to them since \ntheir service in Vietnam. The Agent Orange Act of 1991 specifically \nmandated that the area of reproductive disorders and birth defects be \ngiven special attention to determine whether or not compensatory action \nis warranted. The March NAS report showed new evidence suggesting a \nlink between exposure to agent orange and the occurrence of spina \nbifida in Vietnam veterans' children. The report also noted that there \nis growing evidence, though not as strong as the evidence on spina \nbifida at this point, suggestive of an increase in other birth defects \namong Vietnam veterans' children.\n  In response to the NAS report, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \nassembled an interdepartmental task force, which consulted with \ninterested veterans' service organizations and experts in spina bifida, \nto review the NAS findings and make policy recommendations to the \nSecretary.\n  In May, the Secretary delivered to the President several policy \nrecommendations based on the VA's review of the NAS report. These \nincluded recommendations to add prostate cancer and acute and subacute \nperipheral neuropathy to the list of presumptive diseases, and, if \nauthority were granted, to treat spina bifida in veterans' children in \nthe same manner. The VA does not currently have the authority to \nprovide benefits to veterans' children. Subsequently, President Clinton \nannounced that the administration would propose legislation to provide \nan appropriate remedy for Vietnam veterans' children who suffer from \nspina bifida. This bill reflects that effort.\n  Clearly, the Government's responsibility does not end once veterans \nreturn from war. Effects of combat, even those passed down through \nreproductive disorders, are a direct result of our decisions to place \nour Nation's men and women in harm's way. We have a moral \nresponsibility to help veterans whose children suffer from spina bifida \nand to meet those children's health care needs.\n  It should be noted that spina bifida is a devastating, irreversible \nbirth defect resulting from the failure of the spine to properly close \nearly in pregnancy. It requires lifelong medical treatment, and the \ncost of caring for a child with spina bifida can be financially \ndevastating for families. While spina bifida affects approximately one \nof every 1,000 newborns in the United States, a study of Vietnam \nveterans that was included in the NAS report showed three spina bifida \ncases in a group of only 792 infants of Vietnam veterans--a \nstatistically significant result.\n  The Agent Orange Benefits Act of 1996 would provide health care, \nlimited vocational rehabilitation, and a monthly stipend to Vietnam \nveterans' children with spina bifida based on the severity of each \nchild's condition. It includes the provision of essential medical care \nand case management services to coordinate health and social services \nfor the child.\n  Unfortunately, the NAS report confirmed what Vietnam veterans have \nlong feared: the Vietnam war continues to claim innocent victims. \nNothing can erase the physical and psychological wounds of the war, \nbut, by providing limited benefits to affected children, the Agent \nOrange Benefits Act of 1996 will allow us to heal some of the lingering \nscars from Vietnam.\n  The NAS report also serves as a valuable reminder that the impact of \nany war is felt decades beyond the final shots. Just as reproductive \ndisorders and birth defects in their children have been among Vietnam \nveterans' greatest health concerns, health problems in their children \nis of great concern to veterans who served in the Gulf war. We must be \nprepared to learn from the scientific effort on agent orange and apply \nthese lessons to the effort to discover the true health effects of \nenvironmental hazards on the men and women who served in the Gulf and \non their children. Based on the NAS report's findings related to spina \nbifida in the children of Vietnam veterans,\n\n[[Page S9301]]\n\nthe VA is establishing a reproductive outcomes research center to \ninvestigate potential environmental hazards of military service. I look \nforward to seeing those efforts come to fruition, and I am hopeful they \nwill help us provide answers to the many outstanding questions in this \narea.\n  I applaud the President and Secretary Jesse Brown, along with my \ncolleagues who have been committed to this fight for years, for working \ntogether to develop a proposal that adequately addresses the needs of \nthese children and their families, and for providing modest \ncompensation for a wrong that can never fully be righted.\n  With the passage of this legislation, we can begin to fulfill our \npromise to these most innocent victims and their families.

For purposes of \n     this section, additional disability or death is qualifying \n     only if it was not the result of the veteran's willful \n     misconduct and--\n       ``(1) it was caused by hospital care, medical or surgical \n     treatment, or examination furnished the veteran under any law \n     administered by the Secretary, either by a Department \n     employee or in a Department facility as defined in section \n     1701(3)(A) of this title, where the additional disability or \n     death proximately resulted--\n       ``(A) from carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, \n     error in judgment, or similar instance of fault on the part \n     of the Department in furnishing the hospital care, medical or \n     surgical treatment, or examination; or\n       ``(B) from an event not reasonably foreseeable; or\n       ``(2) it was incurred as a proximate result of the \n     provision of training and rehabilitation services by the \n     Secretary (including by a service-provider used by the \n     Secretary for such purpose under section 3115 of this title) \n     as part of an approved rehabilitation program under chapter \n     31 of this title.''; and\n       (2) in the second sentence--\n       (A) by redesignating that sentence as subsection (b);\n       (B) by striking out ``, aggravation,'' both places it \n     appears; and\n       (C) by striking out ``sentence'' and substituting in lieu \n     thereof ``subsection''.\n       (b) The amendments made by subsection (a) shall govern all \n     administrative and judicial determinations of eligibility for \n     benefits under section 1151 of title 38, United States Code, \n     made with respect to claims filed on or after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, including those based on original \n     applications and applications seeking to reopen, revise, \n     reconsider, or otherwise readjudicate on any basis claims for \n     benefits under section 1151 of that title or predecessor \n     provisions of law.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  Agent Orange Benefits for Vietnam Veterans' Children Suffering From \n                              Spina Bifida\n\n       The Agent Orange Act of 1996 would extend health care and \n     related benefits, including a monthly monetary allowance, to \n     Vietnam veterans' children suffering from spina bifida--a \n     serious neural tube birth defect that requires life-long \n     care--provided the children were conceived after the veterans \n     began their service in Vietnam.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       A March National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report cited new \n     evidence that supports a link between exposure to Agent \n     Orange and the occurrence of spina bifida in children of \n     veterans who served in Vietnam. This report was required by \n     the Agent Orange Act of 1991.\n       Since 1985, Vietnam veterans have been eligible for free VA \n     health care for conditions believed to be related to exposure \n     to Agent Orange. Veterans' disability compensation for \n     several Agent Orange-related illnesses--including non-\n     Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, Hodgkin's disease, \n     chloracne, respiratory cancers, and multiple myeloma--has \n     been awarded as a result of either congressional or VA \n     action, some of which was based on a 1993 NAS report. Earlier \n     this year, Secretary Brown and the President, in response to \n     the March NAS report, extended service-connected benefits to \n     veterans suffering from prostate cancer and acute and sub-\n     acute peripheral neuropathy.\n       Reproductive disorders and birth defects in their children \n     have been among veterans' greatest Agent Orange-related \n     health concerns. This legislation is necessary because, while \n     the VA has recommended that spina bifida in veterans' \n     offspring be service-connected, the VA does not currently \n     have the authority to extend health care or other benefits to \n     children of veterans.\n\n\n                                  cost\n\n       CBO has not yet provided an estimate for this proposal. \n     However, costs would be offset by overturning the Gardner \n     case, which would limit the VA's liability for non-\n     malpractice-related injuries occurring in VA facilities. This \n     non-controversial provision was included in Democratic and \n     Republican budget proposals for FY 96. Excess savings would \n     be directed to deficit reduction.\n\n\n                role of the national academy of sciences\n\n       The Agent Orange Act of 1991 directed the VA to contract \n     with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct for 10 years \n     biennial, comprehensive evaluations of the scientific and \n     medical information regarding the health effects of exposure \n     to Agent Orange and other herbicides used in Vietnam.\n       The first report, ``Veterans and Agent Orange: Health \n     Effects of Herbicides Used in Vietnam,'' was published in \n     1993. It created the following categories to classify the \n     level of association between certain health conditions and \n     exposure to Agent Orange: Category I (``sufficient evidence \n     of an association''); category II (``limited/suggestive \n     evidence of an association''); category III (``inadequate/\n     insufficient evidence to determine whether an association \n     exists''); category IV (``limited/suggestive evidence of NO \n     association'').\n       Following the 1993 report, the VA began to compensate \n     Vietnam veterans suffering from three diseases in categories \n     I and II that had not been service-connected through previous \n     congressional or administrative action: porphyria cutanea \n     tarda, respiratory cancers, and multiple myeloma.\n       The 1996 update, which was issued in March, confirmed many \n     of the findings in the 1993 report, and found new evidence to \n     link spina bifida in veterans' children with exposure to \n     Agent Orange. The NAS panel placed ``spina bifida in \n     offspring'' in category II, supporting a connection between \n     birth defects and military service. The NAS report currently \n     places birth defects other than spina bifida in category III.\n       After reviewing the NAS report and other information, the \n     VA has recommended that all remaining conditions in \n     categories I and II, including spina bifida, be service-\n     connected.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                            The Secretary of Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 5, 1996.\n     Hon. Christopher S. (Kit) Bond,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies, \n         Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am pleased to share with you a copy of \n     legislation we provided earlier today to Senator Daschle. \n     This legislation, the ``Agent Orange Benefits Act of 1996,'' \n     would provide benefits to certain children of Vietnam \n     veterans who are born with the birth defect spinal bifida. \n     Enacting this legislation is a Presidential priority.\n       Under Public Law 102-4, and with the benefit of a National \n     Academy of Sciences report, I determined that a positive \n     association exists between the exposure of Vietnam veterans \n     to herbicides (such as a Agent Orange) and spinal bifida in \n     their children. In approving this determination, the \n     President promised to submit ``an appropriate remedy'' for \n     these veterans' children. This legislation fulfills that \n     commitment. It provides for health care, vocational training, \n     and monthly monetary allowance for these children.\n       As set forth in the legislation, the Administration \n     proposes to offset the costs associated with these new \n     benefits with a savings proposal that would effectively \n     reverse the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Gardner v. Brown \n     which held that monthly VA disability compensation must be \n     paid for any additional disability or death attributable to \n     VA medical treatment even if VA was not negligent in \n     providing that care.\n       Enactment of this legislation is a top Presidential \n     priority. I strongly urge the Senate to include it in the \n     earliest appropriate legislative vehicle.\n       Thank you for your assistance in ensuring prompt and \n     immediate action on this important legislation.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program to the presentation of this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jesse Brown.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n[[Page S9303]]\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n\nTABLE 1-1--Updated Summary of findings in occupational, Environmental, \nand Veterans Studies Regarding the Association Between Specific Health \n                  problems and Exposure to Herbicides\n\n     Sufficient evidence of an association\n       Evidence is sufficient to conclude that there is a positive \n     association. That is, a positive association has been \n     observed between herbicides and the outcome in studies in \n     which chance, bias, and confounding could be ruled out with \n     reasonable confidence. For example, if several small studies \n     that are free from bias and confounding show an association \n     that is consistent in magnitude and direction, there may be \n     sufficient evidence for an association. There is sufficient \n     evidence of an association between exposure to herbicides and \n     the following health outcomes: Soft-tissue sarcoma; Non-\n     Hodgkin's lymphoma; Hodgkin's disease; Chlorance.\n     Limited/suggestive evidence of an association\n       Evidence is suggestive of an association between herbicides \n     and the outcome but is limited because chance, bias, and \n     confounding could not be ruled out with confidence. For \n     example, at least one high-quality study shows a positive \n     association, but the results of other studies are \n     inconsistent. There is limited/suggestive evidence of an \n     association between exposure to herbicides and the following \n     health outcomes: Respiratory cancers (lung, larynx, trachea); \n     Prostate cancer; Multiple myeloma; Acute and subacute \n     peripheral neuropathy (new disease category); Spina bifida \n     (new disease category); Porphyria cutanea tarda (category \n     change in 1996).\n     Inadequate/insufficient evidence to determine whether an \n         association exists\n       The available studies are of insufficient quality, \n     consistency, or statistical power to permit a conclusion \n     regarding the presence or absence of an association. For \n     example, studies fail to control for confounding, have \n     inadequate exposure assessment, or fail to address latency. \n     There is inadequate or insufficient evidence to determine \n     whether an association exists between exposure to herbicides \n     and the following health outcomes: Hepatobiliary cancers; \n     Nasal/nasopharyngeal cancer; Bone cancer; Female reproductive \n     cancers (cervical, uterine, ovarian); Breast cancer; Renal \n     cancer; Testicular cancer; Leukemia; spontaneous abortion; \n     Birth defects (other than spina bifida); Neonatal/infant \n     death and stillbirths; Low birthweight; Childhood cancer in \n     offspring; Abnormal sperm parameters and infertility; \n     cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders; Motor/coordination \n     dysfunction; Chronic peripheral nervous system disorders; \n     Metabolic and digestive disorders (diabetes, changes in liver \n     enzymes, lipid abnormalities, ulcers); Immune system \n     disorders (immune suppression and autoimmunity); Circulatory \n     disorders; Respiratory disorders; Skin cancer (category \n     change in 1996).\n     Limited/suggestive evidence of no association\n       Several adequate studies, covering the full range of levels \n     of exposure that human beings are known to encounter, are \n     mutually consistent in not showing a positive association \n     between exposure to herbicides and the outcome at any level \n     of exposure. A conclusion of ``no association'' is inevitably \n     limited to the conditions, level of exposure, and length of \n     observation covered by the available studies. In addition, \n     the possibility of a very small elevation in risk at the \n     levels of exposure studied can never be excluded. There is \n     limited/suggestive evidence of no association between \n     exposure to herbicides and the following health outcomes: \n     Gastrointestinal tumors (stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, \n     colon cancer, rectal cancer); Bladder cancer; Brain tumors.\n\n       Note: ``Herbicides'' refers to the major herbicides used in \n     Vietnam: 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid); 2,4,5-T \n     (2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid) and its contaminant TCDD \n     (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin); cacodylic acid; and \n     picloram. The evidence regarding association is drawn from \n     occupational and other studies in which subjects were exposed \n     to a variety of herbicides and herbicide components.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the legislation \nintroduced by the able Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, which \nprovides health care and assistance to the children of Vietnam veterans \nwho suffer from spina bifida. This legislation provides the needed \nauthority for the Department of Veterans Affairs to treat these \nchildren for their service-connected disabilities arising from their \nfather's exposure to agent orange during the Vietnam conflict. This is \nan unprecedented but appropriate action, since scientific research is \nnow sufficiently sophisticated to allow us to understand the effects of \ntoxic exposures on ourselves and on future generations.\n  As a result of the Agent Orange Act of 1991, the Department of \nVeterans Affairs and the National Academy of Sciences have at regular \nintervals reviewed the ongoing research on Agent Orange exposure. The \nreport update issued this spring found ``limited/suggestive evidence'' \nlinking the birth defect spina bifida to agent orange exposure. The \nreport notes that all three epidemiologic studies reviewed suggest an \nassociation between herbicide exposure and increased risk of spina \nbifida in offspring. It further notes that in contrast to most other \ndiseases, for which the strongest data have been from occupationally \nexposed workers, these studies focused on Vietnam veterans. All the \nstudies were judged to be of relatively high quality, although they did \nsuffer from some methodologic limitations.\n  On the basis of this finding, Secretary Jesse Brown recommended that \na service connection be granted to Vietnam veterans' children with \nspina bifida. It is the right decision, and I applaud him for it. The \nresearch and the legislation are long overdue for families that have \nbeen struggling for some twenty years. Some one has observed that \n``procrastination is the thief of time.'' These children and their \nfamilies have already lost time, lost long years of doubt and \nwondering, of financial hardship that they bore alone because the \ngovernment procrastinated in investigating and acknowledging its role \nin this tragedy. The legislation introduced today by Senator Daschle \nattempts to correct that injustice, and I commend him for it. The poet \nEdward Young (1683-1796) has said: ``Be wise today; 'tis madness to \ndefer.'' Support this legislation, take responsibility for the tragic \naftermath of our involvement in Vietnam, and take care of these \nchildren.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleague from South Dakota, Senator Daschle, in cosponsoring the Agent \nOrange Benefits Act of 1996. This bill takes another crucial step \nforward in repaying our debt to those who have served their country and \nare still suffering as a result of their service in Vietnam many years \nago. In May, President Clinton announced that legislation would be \nproposed to aid Vietnam veterans' children who suffer from the disease \nspina bifida. This bill fulfills that commitment by recognizing and \naccepting natural responsibility for one of the serious health care \nneeds of veterans' families that stem from the tragic effects of agent \norange.\n  Senator Daschle and I and many others have worked for the past decade \nto try to bring to a fair and just resolution the questions surrounding \nagent orange and the effects it has had on the men and women who \nfaithfully served this country. I know that there is still controversy \nabout the effects of agent orange. There may always be controversy, \njust as there may always be controversy about the Vietnam war itself. \nBut we must set aside the controversy--or put it behind us--to enable \nsuffering children to receive the care and treatment they need when \nthat suffering can be followed back to a service person's exposure to \nagent orange.\n  After years of hard work, I believe we have reached an acceptable \nconsensus on the effects of agent orange through numerous studies--and \nindependent scientific reviews of the many studies--which have been \nmade on the effects of this dangerous chemical that contains deadly \ndioxin. I might add that it has been 30 years since agent orange was \nsprayed in Vietnam and we must stop debating over the bias of each \nindividual analyzing the information. As I said back in May of 1988, \n``It is offensive to veterans to tell them that there is not enough \n`scientific evidence' to justify compensation * * * The evidence is in \ntheir own bodies, and even worse, in the bodies of their children.''\n  We have made great strides in reaching a consensus in some areas of \nhealth care for Vietnam veterans. Since 1985, Vietnam veterans have \nbeen eligible for free health care from the Veterans Administration for \nconditions that are related to exposure to agent orange. Veterans' \ndisability compensation has been awarded to veterans affected by \nseveral agent orange-related illnesses including non-Hodgkins lymphoma, \nsoft tissue sarcoma, Hodgkin's disease, chloracne, respiratory cancers, \nmultiple myeloma, and, most recently, prostate cancer and acute and \nsubacute peripheral neuropathy.\n  Today, Mr. President, we are addressing a particularly heinous effect \nof agent orange--an effect that unfortunately will carry the legacy of \nthe Vietnam war to yet another generation. The bill we are introducing \ntoday would extend health care and related\n\n[[Page S9304]]\n\nbenefits to children of Vietnam veterans who suffer from spina bifida, \na serious neural tube birth defect that requires life-long care--\nprovided, of course, the children were conceived after the veterans \nbegan their service in Vietnam.\n  The National Academy of Sciences released a report in March of this \nyear, citing new evidence supporting the link between exposure to agent \norange and the occurrence of spina bifida in children of veterans who \nserved in Vietnam. This report, Mr. President, warrants our action.\n  Both the President and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Jesse \nBrown, have asked that spina bifida in veterans' offspring be \nconsidered service connected. However, the VA currently does not have \nthe authority to extend the health care and other related benefits to \nthese children that they so greatly need. This bill will grant the VA \nthe necessary authority to finally start providing needed care to these \nchildren who are suffering.\n  Mr. President, these are children whose misery stems from physical \ndamage caused to one of their parents who was fighting for this country \nin Vietnam. We should do no less than provide them with the care and \ntreatment they need. We must not make some of the children of our \nVietnam veterans the last victims of the Vietnam war. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S.J. Res. 58. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relative to granting power to the \nStates to propose constitutional amendments; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n       state-initiated constitutional amendment joint resolution\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about \nfirst principles, about fundamental truths, about a battle that helped \ngive birth to a nation. The amendment I have sent to the desk \nrepresents an effort to restore the federal system conceived by the \nFramers over two centuries ago by giving the States the capacity to \ninitiate constitutional reforms.\n  In considering my remarks earlier this morning, I was reminded of a \ntrip my family and I made several years ago when I was Governor of the \nState of Missouri. In 1989, we were extended an opportunity to visit \nthe site where the Continental Army, led by Gen. Atemas Ward, fought to \nseize Bunker Hill on the Charlestown peninsula.\n  It was a moving experience. One cannot help but recall the monument, \ndedicated by Daniel Webster, that stands as a tribute to the lives that \nwere lost. I recommend the trip to both Members and the viewing \naudience alike.\n  I must confess, however, that the expansive field you will find fails \nto fully capture the raw carnage that visited Bunker Hill in June of \n1775. Close to 2,000 lives were lost in less than 2 hours. And, while \nGeneral Howe's regulars were masters of the peninsula at the end of the \nday, the casualties they sustained were more than twice that of the \nAmerican militia.\n  Historians, Mr. President, have come to record Bunker Hill as a \nbloody if indecisive contest, an early salvo in a conflict which Dr. \nJonathan Rossie has characterized as a ``glorious cause.'' Glorious, if \nwarfare can be called that, because the issue that animated the \ncolonists that day was freedom, for themselves and generations yet to \ncome; God, courage, and posterity were their invisible allies.\n  And as I reflect on those events, I cannot help but wonder what has \nbecome of the first principles for which our forefathers fought? What \nhas become of the fundamental truths that compelled those great \npatriots up that hill, bayonets flashing, voices shouting ``push on, \npush on.''\n  For that battle outside of Boston helped give birth to a nation, a \nconstitutional republic that was the first of its kind. A system where, \nas Madison suggested in ``Federalist'' No. 46, ``the federal and state \ngovernments are in fact but different agents of the people, constituted \nwith different powers, and designed for different purposes.''\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, Madison's vision is being lost. \nJudicial activism, Federal intervention, and past constitutional \nreforms have led to a gradual erosion of State power. In particular, \nthe passage of the 16th and 17th amendments have had a disastrous \neffect on the capacity of the States to check Federal expansion. The \nformer, establishing the income tax, gave the central government a \nvirtually unlimited spending power, while the latter, providing for the \ndirect election of Senators, worked to undermine the Senate's \ncontemplated role as the protector of State autonomy.\n  One of the single, greatest challenges we face as a country and as a \nCongress, is addressing the constitutional imbalance that has arisen \nfrom the convergence of these trends. Allowing the States to initiate \namendments on issues ranging from a balanced budget to congressional \nterm limits would do just that.\n  The operation of the proposed amendment is as simple as its intent is \nclear. Whenever two-thirds of the States propose an amendment, in \nidentical terms, it is submitted to the Congress for review. If two-\nthirds of both Houses fail to disapprove the amendment during the \nsession in which it is received, the proposal is then forwarded to the \nStates for ratification by three-fourths of the legislatures thereof.\n  If adopted, the proposed amendment would have tremendous value on \nseveral different fronts. First, it would force the cold corridors of \npower on the Potomac to respond to the will of the people--no more \nmandates, no more deficits, no more careerist in the Congress. \nSimilarly, the amendment would allow the States to once again share the \nconstitutional agenda of the Nation. And finally, it would provide a \npotential for addressing the problems of federalism in a context which \ncould conceivably augment State power.\n  In Gregory versus Ashcroft, Justice O'Connor opined that ``in the \ntension between Federal and State power lies the promise of liberty.'' \nAnd so it does. I believe reconstituting the federal system of which \nMadison wrote must become conservatives' new glorious cause. This \namendment is a measured, moderate step toward achieving that end. For \nthese reasons, Mr. President, I beg its adoption.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

The error is significant enough to justify that fiscal \n     year 1997 apportionments and allocations of highway trust \n     funds be adjusted; and finds that the provision in B \n     appropriately corrects these deficiencies, then subsection B \n     will be operative.\n       (b) Calculation of Federal-Aid Highway Apportionments and \n     Allocations.--(1) In General.--Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), for fiscal year 1997, the Secretary of \n     Transportation shall determine that Federal-aid highway \n     apportionments and allocations to a State without regard to \n     the approximately $1,596,000,000 credit to the Highway Trust \n     Fund (other than the Mass Transit Account) of estimated taxes \n     paid by States that was made by the Secretary of the Treasury \n     for fiscal year 1995 in correction of an accounting error \n     made in fiscal year 1994.\n       (2) Adjustments for effects in 1996.--The Secretary of \n     Transportation shall, for the State--\n       (A) determine whether the State would have been apportioned \n     and allocated an increased or decreased amount for Federal-\n     aid highways for fiscal year 1996 if the accounting error \n     referred to in paragraph (1) had not been made (which \n     determination shall take into account the effects of section \n     1003(c) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \n     Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-240; 105 Stat. 1921)); and\n       (B) after apportionments and allocations are determined in \n     accordance with paragraph (1)--\n       (i) adjust the amount apportioned and allocated to the \n     State for Federal-aid highways for fiscal year 1997 by the \n     amount of the increase or decrease; and\n       (ii) adjust accordingly the obligation limitation for \n     Federal-aid highways distributed to the State under this Act.\n       (3) No effect on 1996 distributions.--Nothing in this \n     section shall affect any apportionment, allocation, or \n     distribution of obligation limitation, or reduction thereof, \n     to a State for Federal-aid highways for fiscal year 1996.\n       (4) Effective date.--This section shall take effect on \n     September 30, 1996.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9305-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, for many years I have had the \nprivilege of knowing Ed Marciniak, now president of the Institute of \nUrban Life at Loyola University, who chairs the City Club of Chicago's \ncommittee on the future of public housing in Chicago.\n  He had a commentary on public housing that was published in \nCommonwealth, which is really more of a commentary on poverty and urban \nlife and what we ought to do. He says:\n\n       The average income of families living in Chicago's public \n     housing is $2,500. Broadly speaking, a fatal flaw of these \n     projects is that they provide tenant families with little \n     else than space: little in the way of opportunity or \n     incentive to better themselves and their children. In most \n     cities the high-rise projects, often with as many inhabitants \n     as a small town, house not a single teacher, nurse, \n     firefighter, manager, technician, or civil servant and offer \n     few role models for the children, few standard-setters for \n     the adults, and scant motivation to become self-sufficient.\n\n  Recently Congress has approved a pilot project called Moving to \nOpportunity. Marciniak points out that it was based on a model in \nChicago. He writes:\n\n       Moving to Opportunity was modeled on a successful program \n     sponsored by Chicago's Leadership Council for Metropolitan \n     Open Communities. Since 1976, the Council has used federal \n     funds to screen and then relocate more than 6,000 public \n     housing families, most of them female-headed, into privately \n     owned apartments, half of them in suburbs. By bidding good-by \n     to public housing, most of the families not only bettered \n     their living conditions but also greatly improved their \n     children's opportunities. Among the suburban children only 5 \n     percent dropped out of school, 54 percent attended college, \n     and 27 percent found jobs. When people's expectations were \n     raised and standards established, many started living up to \n     them. Residential mobility made a difference.\n\n  I have had a chance to observe this program and it is a great step \nforward.\n  With a little creativity and sensitivity we can do much better in \nthis country.\n  What is required is that we recognize that we have to do something to \naddress the problems of those who are the least successful now in our \nsociety. They lack success not because of lack of ability in most \ncases, but because they find themselves trapped.\n\n[[Page S9307]]\n\n  We have to open that trap.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the article from Commonweal be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n          More Than a Roof--Promising Moves in Public Housing\n\n                           (By Ed Marciniak)\n\n       Not long ago, I attended a national housing conference \n     where a featured panelist was a woman introduced as a \n     longtime resident of public housing. She herself then noted, \n     matter-of-factly, that she had lived in public housing for \n     forty-five years. For me, that admission was mind-blowing. \n     Even more startling, however, was the realization that her \n     remark had not caused even a ripple of surprise among the \n     subsidized-housing professionals in the audience. \n     Nonchalantly, they had come to accept public housing's way of \n     life as a given for which they felt no personal \n     responsibility.\n       It's unlikely that informed members of the general public \n     are so complacent, whether as taxpayers concerned with the \n     costs or as citizens aware of the pathologies associated with \n     much public housing. People in the know are beginning to \n     insist that government subsidies must not only meet their \n     recipients' immediate needs but must be oriented toward \n     helping them become self-supporting. Recent developments in \n     and around Chicago, the area I know best, confirm that most \n     public housing clients, the poorest of the urban poor, have \n     not given up. Many have already helped themselves escape the \n     trap that public housing has become. We now know that there \n     are ways of giving them a chance to do so that have been \n     tested, at least on a small scale, and found workable. These \n     approaches deserve to be better known and more broadly \n     applied. But, as will be seen, many questions need to be \n     asked and answered.\n       In a bipartisan effort, Congress is currently overhauling \n     the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. Despite its noble purpose and \n     promising beginnings with scattered, low-rise public housing, \n     that legislation has produced something of a monster. Today \n     the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD  \n     finances some 1.4 million apartments owned and managed by \n     local hosing authorities. Another 1. 5 million privately \n     owned units are federally subsidized through rent vouchers of \n     one kind or another. Taking into account these programs and a \n     host of others sponsored by HUD, the department has become \n     the nation's largest slumlord.\n       But the problem is not primarily the numbers or costs. Our \n     giant high-rise public housing projects have become ghettos \n     for the urban poor: conglomerations riddled with drugs, \n     gangs, crime, and poverty, peopled by far too high \n     a proportion of single-family households, some now in \n     their third and fourth generation. The average income of \n     families living in Chicago's public housing is $2,500. \n     Broadly speaking, a fatal flaw of these projects is that \n     they provide tenant families with little else than space: \n     little in the way of opportunity or incentive to better \n     themselves and their children. In most cities the high-\n     rise projects, often with as many inhabitants as a small \n     town, house not a single teacher, nurse, firefighter, \n     manager, technician, or civil servant and offer few role \n     models for the children, few standard-setters for the \n     adults, and scant motivation to become self-sufficient.\n       In recognition of these realities, Congress has persuaded \n     HUD to begin dismantling these housing projects by giving \n     residents, through rent vouchers, the option of living in \n     privately owned housing in mixed-income neighborhoods; by \n     scattering low-rise public housing throughout the city and \n     its suburbs; by tearing down vacant high rises instead of \n     rebuilding them; by using HUD dollars to attract other \n     investment in additional housing for families of low and \n     moderate income; and by stricter screening of a applicants \n     and the prompt eviction of lawbreakers who are drug dealers \n     or gang leaders. In April, HUD Secretary Henry G. Cisneros \n     released a report on ``The Transformation of America's Public \n     Housing,'' reporting these and other steps HUD is taking to \n     ensure ``long-term recovery.''\n       Congress has approved, though as a pilot project, a \n     ``Moving to Opportunity'' initiative, which offers public \n     housing families a chance to move to scattered-site public \n     housing in the city or the suburbs. This modestly funded \n     program, already in operation in Baltimore, Boston, Los \n     Angeles, New York, and elsewhere, is being evaluated by its \n     success or failure in escorting families into the urban \n     mainstream. Important data will be collected about families \n     who become home owners or leaseholders paying conventional \n     rents. What were the bridges or escalators they used to leave \n     public housing? Who provided the ladders of opportunity? Are \n     the relocated families now in better housing? How many stayed \n     in the suburbs, how many moved back to the city?\n       ``Moving to Opportunity'' was modeled on a successful \n     program sponsored by Chicago's Leadership Council for \n     Metropolitan Open Communities. Since 1976, the Council has \n     used federal funds to screen and then relocate more than \n     6,000 public housing families, most of them female-headed, \n     into privately owned apartments, half of them in suburbs. By \n     bidding good-by to public housing, most of the families not \n     only bettered their living conditions but also greatly \n     improved their children's opportunities. Among the suburban \n     children, only 5 percent dropped out of school, 54 percent \n     attended college, and 27 percent were enrolled in a four-year \n     college. As for the parents, 75 percent found jobs. When \n     people's expectations were raised and standards established, \n     many started living up to them. Residential mobility made a \n     difference.\n       This good news is part of a larger movement toward \n     depopulation of Chicago's family projects; occupancy has \n     decreased from 137,000 in 1980 to 80,000 in 1995. More \n     importantly, the council's work reflects a growing awareness \n     among government and private funders of antipoverty programs \n     of the need to find answers for certain key, long-neglected \n     questions. How do people shed chronic dependency to achieve \n     self-sufficiency? How do we reverse the nation's poverty \n     rate, which declined in the 1970s and early 1980s but has \n     been inching up ever since? How is the underclass turned into \n     a working class?\n       Accordingly, the role of the private sector serving \n     poverty-engulfed neighborhoods is also under scrutiny. \n     Churches, social service agencies, youth clubs, and \n     counseling centers are being asked to link short-term aid to \n     more lasting improvement, to do more than collect the \n     statistics on Sunday attendance, on youngsters who use the \n     gym, on Christmas baskets, on kids in day care, on midnight \n     basketball, or on mothers in self-improvement classes. \n     Funders want to know whether and how their dollars made a \n     difference: How many of the families were no longer on public \n     aid? What percentage of the teen-agers finished high school? \n     How many adults found jobs?\n       Similar questions can be and are now being asked about the \n     persistence of homelessness. How did it happen that the \n     homeless were made the immediate responsibility of local \n     housing officials? Many of the homeless are jobless or the \n     victims of a family break-up. Many were evicted from mental \n     health institutions and dumped mercilessly on city streets. \n     Some are vagabonds, down-and-outers addicted to drugs and/or \n     alcohol. All may qualify as homeless, but what they \n     desperately need encompasses a lot more than a space to live \n     in.\n       Too often, of course, discussion of such problems devolves \n     into ideological debates, focused on ``Who is to blame?'' \n     rather than on ``What is to be done?'' On homelessness, \n     however, as with public housing, there are pragmatic \n     initiatives in play. An example is Deborah's Place in \n     Chicago, a shelter for homeless women but with a difference. \n     From day one, the purpose of Deborah's Place has been to help \n     the women return to a more normal lifestyle--a job, a family, \n     or, in case of need, to a caring institution that matches the \n     woman's special problem. At three different locations, each \n     with a staged program. Deborah's Place works to ``help women \n     leave the streets and shelters behind for new lives of \n     independence, productivity, and well-being.'' As clients move \n     up and out, they leave room and time for other women to be \n     assisted.\n       On ending joblessness, strategy can also make a difference. \n     Suburban Job Link, with offices in Chicago's South Lawndale \n     community and suburban Bensenville, uses a unique method for \n     promoting upward mobility. On contract with relatively job-\n     rich suburban employers, the organization buses workers to \n     temporary jobs that often lead to ``working interviews'' \n     for applicants who want to demonstrate their potential to \n     fill entry-level positions. Factory owners and other \n     employers are invited to hire any worker full-time without \n     a fee, thus supplying the missing rung on a stepladder to \n     year-round employment. Through its ``no-charge'' \n     arrangement, Job Link will place 1,000 ``temps'' into \n     regular jobs with benefits in the next twelve months. \n     Finally, it continues to bus the newly hired until they \n     arrange transportation on their own, through a car pool, \n     for example. As a not-for-profit, Job Link is funded by \n     government and foundation grants and by its own earned \n     income.\n       Another strategic point of entry for encouraging upward \n     mobility has to do with school choice. Over the past decade \n     it has become evident that nonpublic schools, especially \n     those under religious sponsorship, have been remarkably \n     successful in easing not only children but also their low-\n     income parents into the urban mainstream. Nearly one of every \n     four youngsters enrolled in an elementary or secondary school \n     in Chicago attends a nonpublic school. Now, hundreds of \n     scholarships to attend Catholic, Lutheran, and Episcopal \n     schools are given to youngsters who live in the Cabrini \n     Green, Henry Horner, Rockwell Gardens, and other public \n     housing projects. The aid covers only part of the tuition, \n     requiring parents or guardians to pay the balance and fees.\n       Though statistics are not available, it is our experience \n     that the decision by a public housing family to enroll \n     children in a private school is often the first step that \n     eventually leads to an apartment in the private housing \n     market. The choice made by a deserted mother, taken at \n     personal sacrifice, is rewarded and reinforced when she sees \n     that her child is in fact making educational progress; she is \n     likely to strive even harder to climb out of poverty in order \n     to continue sending her child to the school of her choice.\n       A final example--useful even though at present it is a \n     matter of aspiration rather than achievement--returns to a \n     housing program. It will be operative in 1997 when Chicago's \n     Lawson YMCA finishes rehabilitating its twenty-five-story \n     building to provide 583 single-occupancy rooms. The \n     difference here lies in the overall aim, which is not just to \n     provide livable space for otherwise homeless\n\n[[Page S9308]]\n\n     persons but also to help people who are homeless, jobless, \n     and difficult-to-employ get jobs, preferably within walking \n     distance, and become self-sufficient. The YMCA staff will \n     work, for example, with people who are recovering from \n     substance abuse by concentrating aggressively on job training \n     and job getting. Success will be measured not just by \n     occupancy rates but, more importantly, by the number who have \n     moved to independent living.\n       As with the other examples, the virtue of the YMCA \n     initiative lies in its responding not just to today's need \n     but also to tomorrow's challenge. To paraphrase columnist \n     Robert J. Samuelson, the United States struggles through a \n     soul-searching transition from an era of entitlement to an \n     era of responsibility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9306-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MODEL EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS FOR EX-OFFENDERS\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the continued outstanding accomplishments of a model \nemployment program for ex-offenders in my home State of Colorado.\n  The Golden Door program, founded and developed by Bill Coors, \npresident of the Coors Brewing Co., was implemented 28 years ago this \nmonth. The goal of Golden Door is to provide ex-offenders with a \ncomprehensive program for reentry into society with a focus on \nemployment. In addition to an employment opportunity targeting people \nwith limited employment skills, the Golden Door program offers an \neducation, training in personal finances, general counseling, and the \nstability that allows people to successfully maintain a job.\n  Eighty percent of the participants in the Golden Door program \ncomplete it successfully and move on to assume full-time positions \nwithin the corporation. While this kind of opportunity is somewhat \nrare, Colorado has proven that the concept can be effectively \nduplicated, proving profitable to the sponsoring business, the \ncommunity and the participants.\n  Bill Coors' vision for a better community and a second change for \npeople has left the State of Colorado with his legacy of philanthropic \nefforts and a solid example to which businesses, small and large alike, \ncan aspire. It was in 1994 that I first called the attention of \nCongress to the Golden Door program, commending its good will and \nsuccess. I also used that opportunity to express my support for the \nTargeted Jobs Tax Credit--now the Work Opportunity Tax Credit--\ninitiative, a program designed to assist smaller businesses in \nemploying people of similar target groups.\n  Since then, a variety of other legislative action has been taken to \nencourage the successful reentry of ex-offenders into society. \nEmployment training is being institutionalized in prisons, and Congress \nis working to safeguard the continuation of these programs as we move \nthrough the legislative process.\n  In addition to highlighting the ongoing success of Golden Door and \nthe Nation's concern over reducing the rate of recidivism, I would like \nto recognize a sister program to Golden Door called Gateway Through the \nRockies, a community partnership to reduce criminal recidivism. The El \nPaso County, CO, Sheriff's Department recently kicked off Gateway to \nprovide inmates nearing release with a comprehensive program of \neducation, counseling, work experience, social skills training and \npost-release support. Modeled after Golden Door, Gateway offers ex-\noffenders a second chance at no cost to taxpayers.\n  Golden Door and Gateway Through the Rockies are shining examples of \nhow communities and businesses can work together toward improving the \nquality of life for the community, while drastically reducing the cost \nwe now incur by simply shuffling people in and out of the penal system. \nOn July 11 of this year, my colleague, Senator Graham, stated in a \nSenate floor statement that in Florida, ``the recidivism rate among \nthose prisoners who have been through our prison industry program is \none-fifth of the recidivism rate of the population as a whole.'' These \nfigures are impressive. It is my hope that in our effort to practice \nfiscal responsibility and become a less intrusive and yet more \nresponsive government, we would make practical decisions regarding that \nsegment of our community that has paid its debt and is capable of \nmaking a positive contribution. Programs serving as this segue simply \nmakes sense.\n  Mr. President, I would like to state my commitment to encouraging \nsuch programs and exploring potential legislative initiatives to \nfacilitate community partnerships to reduce recidivism. Again, my \nthanks to all of the individuals, organizations and businesses for \ntheir ground-breaking contributions to community-based programs in \nColorado and across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9308-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CITY CAB CO.\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to honor City Cab Co. on its \n68th anniversary. City Cab Co. is the Nation's oldest African-American \ntaxicab association.\n  On July 17, 1928, a group of ambitious African-American taxi drivers \nmet in Detroit to discuss the possibility of starting a nonprofit \ncorporate association because they were not accepted at the major cab \ncompany. Two weeks later, City Cab Co. was founded with nine charter \nmembers. City Cab membership has grown over the last 68 years, and as \nthe company has remained in the city since its inception, it has become \nclosely involved with the community. City Cab has transported children \nwith special needs to and from school for over 30 years free of charge. \nThis year, an anniversary gala will benefit these children further with \nproceeds going to scholarship fund.\n  City Cab has shown the people of Detroit what it means to be a \nsupportive partner of the community. I know my Senate colleagues join \nme in congratulating City Cab Co. on its 68th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9308-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9308-S9309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE GATHERING STORM\n\n Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to read an \narticle by Maj. Gen. Edward J. Philbin, which I ask be printed in the \nRecord. In the wake of downsizing our national defense apparatus, we \nwill come to rely even more on the capabilities of United States' \nReserve Forces. As Members of Congress, we should take it upon \nourselves to insure that guard and reserve units are prepared to carry \nthis mission well into the next century.\n  The article follows:\n\n                    [From National Guard, June 1996]\n\n                          The Gathering Storm\n\n                (By Maj. Gen. Edward J. Philbin (ret.))\n\n       Recently, I was conducting experiments on the aerodynamic \n     behavior of low-altitude, low-velocity spherical bodies at \n     the Andrews Air Force Base golf course. Like all weather-wary \n     flyers, I kept a suspicious eye on the mutating cloud \n     formations overhead. Across the initially cloudless, blue sky \n     crept wisps of white, which slowly burgeoned into rising \n     silver cloud towers, the pinnacles fattening into great \n     overhanging mushrooms of gold and purple. Progressively, the \n     sky was darkened by a great sea of these forbidding gray \n     thunderstorms. And then, these ``duty boomers'' unleashed a \n     lightning barrage, which generated peals of thunder, followed \n     by a monsoon-like deluge of water.\n       With apologies to Winston Churchill for appropriating one \n     of his titles, I was struck by the similarity between this \n     atmospheric spectacle and the acerbic treatment accorded the \n     Army Guard since Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm almost \n     six years ago. At that time an orchestrated public affairs \n     attack on the Army Guard was launched, concentrating on the \n     three roundout brigades federalized on November 30, 1990. The \n     most popular target of abuse was Georgia's 48th Infantry \n     Brigade, roundout to the 24th Infantry Division, because of \n     its alleged post-mobilization ineptitude at the National \n     Training Center (NTC). The fact that the 48th Brigade had, \n     before mobilization, been consistently evaluated as combat \n     ready by the 24th Infantry Division was ignored. Also ignored \n     was the 48th's call-up 3\\1/2\\ months after its parent \n     division was alerted for Gulf deployment. Also never \n     mentioned was the fact that, despite all the obstacles placed \n     in its path at the NTC, the 48th was revalidated as combat \n     ready in 91 calendar days, which was just one day more than \n     scheduled, and on the very day the cease-fire went into \n     effect. During those 91 days, the 48th Infantry Brigade spent \n     only 65 days actually training.\n       Despite these facts, the 48th has been continually flogged \n     and castigated by the media for ``failure'' to deploy to the \n     combat area. With relentless determination, the media have \n     published a rash of articles emphasizing fictional failings \n     rather than positive accomplishments of the 48th, concluding \n     that since the 48th `'couldn't hack it,'' then none of the \n     Army Guard ``can hack it.'' This World War II tactic relies \n     on the theory that ``if you tell a big enough lie, and tell \n     it often enough, most people will eventually believe it.'' \n     The audience for which this propaganda is intended is the \n     members of Congress in the hope they will relegate the Army \n     National Guard to a state constabulary.\n       The Reserve Officers Association (ROA), in its May issue of \n     the ROA National Security\n\n[[Page S9309]]\n\n     Report, published the written testimony of Richard Davis, \n     General Accounting Office (GAO), which was presented at a \n     hearing before Senator John McCain (R-Arizona). Davis, among \n     other things, claimed that ``at least one reserve component \n     has not sufficiently adapted to the new challenges [of \n     regional dangers rather than a global Soviet threat] and \n     therefore may not be prepared to carry out its assigned \n     missions.'' Guess which one? It's the Army National Guard. \n     Davis went on to state that (1) the ``Army National Guard has \n     considerable excess combat forces'' while the ``big Army'' \n     hungers for more combat support units; (2) ``the ability of \n     some Army National Guard combat brigades to be ready for \n     early deployment missions * * * is highly uncertain,'' \n     suggesting that Army National Guard roles and missions should \n     be ``modified;'' and (3) the Air National Guard force \n     dedicated to continental air defense ``* * * is not needed \n     today'' and eliminating them would free ``considerable \n     funds'' for better use. Since this issue will be resolved \n     cooperatively with the United States Air Force and the \n     Congress, no further comment will be made here.\n       Davis, whose resume is devoid of any hint of military \n     experience, grounded his opinion upon the alleged military \n     deficiencies of the three Army National Guard brigades, \n     federalized for the Gulf War. However, those three brigades \n     met the Army's deployability criteria, but were never given \n     the mission to deploy and no sealift was ever requested or \n     scheduled for them. I repeat: All three roundout brigades and \n     the three additional Guard battalions (Texas, Alabama and \n     South Carolina) met the readiness deployability criteria \n     established by the Army Mobilization and Operations Planning \n     System (AMOPS) on the first day of federalization.\n       The truth, obscured by the slanderous billingsgate that has \n     been spewed on the Army Guard, is that Operation Desert \n     Shield/Desert Storm was a significant success for the Army \n     National Guard as well as the ``big Army.'' Army Guard \n     volunteers filled critical positions early in the crisis. It \n     was successful in rapidly deploying 60 COL/LTC level commands \n     to SWA, all of which made a significant contribution to \n     Operation Desert Storm/Desert Shield.\n       Due to years of preparation, Army Guard units were ready \n     for federalization and were successful. All Army Guard units \n     were at their respective mobilization stations within 72 \n     hours of federalization. More than 97 percent of ARNG units \n     met or exceeded deployability criteria when federalized. \n     Sixty-seven percent of all Army Guard units deployed within \n     45 days of being federalized. The primary obstacle to an even \n     earlier deployment was unavailability of sealift and airlift.\n       Almost 100 percent of the Army Guard soldiers called-up \n     reported for active duty and more than 94 percent of the \n     units' soldiers were deployable. Of the unit troops, only six \n     percent (3,974 of 62,411) were ineligible for deployment \n     under statutory provisions and DoD guidelines.\n       Before federalization, the combat readiness of the Army \n     National Guard was at an historic high. The Army Guard \n     demonstrated its ability to alert, federalize and rapidly \n     deploy to the theater of operations (CENTCOM)--reports to the \n     contrary notwithstanding.\n       Did Mr. Davis (B.S. degree in accounting; M.S. in business \n     administration) consider any of these data in arriving at the \n     apocalyptic conclusions about the Army National Guard's \n     military prowess? If he did, he didn't mention it in his \n     written or oral testimony. But his oral testimony was \n     liberally buttressed with statements such as: ``I think,'' \n     ``I believe,'' ``it's my opinion,'' but no evidence was \n     given.\n       Our ``good friends'' in the ROA never mentioned these facts \n     to their readers. Nor did ROA mention that for various \n     reasons a considerable portion of the Army Reserve is not \n     deployable. Probably that is the reason the Army Reserve is \n     energetically blocking the path of Army Reservists who wish \n     to transfer to the Army Guard. ROA claims that the purpose of \n     its National Security Report is to inform Reservists of the \n     facts of readiness issues. Yet, ROA publishes only material \n     that denigrates the Army Guard. The motive may be found in \n     the following excerpt from a commentary printed beside the \n     Davis testimony:\n       ``Anyone reading carefully between the lines of the \n     articles contained in this month's NSR will become aware of \n     the riptides and undercurrents that can impact negatively on \n     the future size and role of the Reserves if we (ROA) are not \n     careful. The problem is that many Reserve officers assigned \n     to units feel they do not have to join ROA in order to take \n     advantage of the benefits of the highly effective legislative \n     work ROA does on their behalf on Capitol Hill.''\n       Sounds more like a membership drive than a crusade for the \n     truth.\n       ROA followed Mr. Davis' fantasy with two other articles \n     presented as if they were hot-off-the-press news flashes: \n     ``21st Century Force: A Federal Army and a Militia'' and \n     ``The State Militia.'' In fact, as the Brits say, they were \n     ``mutton dressed up as lamb,'' having been written in 1993 at \n     the Army War College's Strategic Studies Institute, by COL \n     Charles Heller, who was an Army Reserve advisor.\n       Heller's first article blames the ``inordinate influence'' \n     of the AGAUS and NGAUS for the ``big Army's'' alleged \n     difficulty in structuring a stronger Total Army. Not \n     surprisingly, he paints the Army Reserve and ROA as more \n     responsive to and supportive of the ``big Army.'' \n     Predictably, Heller alleges that the Army Reserve call-up \n     and its service in the Gulf War were exemplary, while Army \n     Guard combat maneuver elements required, ``lengthy post-\n     mobilization training and then [did] not deploy to the \n     Gulf.'' Heller concludes that, ``the Total Army should be \n     organized into two components--a federal Army (Active Army \n     and the U.S. Army Reserve) and a militia (the state Army \n     National Guard.'') He stops short, just barely, of \n     advocating equipping the Army Guard with horses, lances \n     and swords.\n       Heller proposes that the Army Reserve be made responsible \n     for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). That's \n     very interesting, since the ROA leadership, which published \n     Heller's musings, now professes to have utterly no interest \n     in seeking new jobs for the Army Reserve. Yet, they \n     feverishly sought and probably still seek passage of the \n     Laughlin Bill (H.R. 1646), which would have interjected the \n     Army Reserve into the National Guard's constitutional state \n     mission.\n       Very solicitous of the National Guard's welfare, Heller \n     worries that the Army Guard will have no time to train \n     adequately for both the state and federal mission, alleging \n     without explanation that the Army Guard failed in the Gulf \n     deployment and in the Los Angeles riots. He proposes of that \n     the Army Guard should concentrate on the state mission. He \n     also advocates USAR involvement in the state, as well as the \n     federal, mission in a contradiction in his argument, which in \n     his exuberance to redesign the Army Guard, he ignores.\n       His opinions and conclusions are heuristic, self-serving, \n     internally contradictory and unsupported by any evidence. All \n     of these allegations are refuted by the actual performance of \n     the Army Guard in the Gulf War. But Heller performs a \n     valuable service by raising an extremely important question: \n     Why have two Army Reserve components? Why, indeed? Certainly, \n     the constitutional framers recognized, as did George \n     Washington, the need to establish a full-time standing army \n     and accordingly gave Congress the power to raise and support \n     armies--and only standing armies were contemplated by that \n     particular language. The Founding Fathers never intended and \n     the sovereign states never granted the federal government the \n     power to organize and maintain a federal militia over which \n     the states would have no control. They recognized the \n     necessity of a well-regulated militia and, in the Militia \n     Clause of the Constitution (Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 16), they \n     made provisions accordingly. It is under this clause that the \n     militia and its modern counterpart, the National Guard, have \n     developed.\n       A propaganda storm has been gathering and thickening around \n     the Army National Guard since the Gulf War. These libels are \n     intended to generate thunderous doubt about the capability of \n     the Army Guard to perform its federal mission; to generate \n     lightning bolts of criticism of the Army Guard from the \n     Congress and ultimately to create a legislative deluge in \n     which the Army Guard will sink into oblivion. This storm has \n     been energized by the hunger of the National Guard would-be \n     competitors to co-opt our missions and the share of the \n     federal military budget that supports these missions.\n       There are two ways to deal with an imminent thunderstorn. \n     One way is to huddle under an umbrella, close your eyes to \n     the lightning, put your fingers in your ears to mute the \n     thunder and hope for survival. The other way is to seed the \n     clouds with a defusing substance like silver iodide, \n     dissipate their destructive energy and make them vanish. The \n     time may be at hand when supporters of the National Guard \n     must resort to the defusing technique, which might very well \n     answer, once and for all, Heller's question. Why have two \n     Army Reserve components?\n       Why, indeed, when the United States Constitution authorizes \n     only one--the National Guard.\n       Note: As this article was being written, troops of the 48th \n     Brigade were packing up to once again deploy to the NTC. On \n     April 23, Mr. Davis' GAO Division notified DoD that it was \n     initiating, on its own authority, a review of ``Roles, \n     Missions, Functions and Costs of the Army Guard and Army \n     Reserve.'' Be assured that the NGAUS will be scrutinizing \n     both events for any signs of dissembling.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9308-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9309-S9310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     LAKE SUPERIOR STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Lake Superior \nState University on the 50th anniversary of its founding. The \nUniversity has a long and interesting history.\n  In 1822, Colonel Hugh Brady established a fort in Sault Ste. Marie \nalong the Saint Mary's River. The fort was later named after Colonel \nBrady, its first commanding officer. In 1866, Fort Brady was rebuilt to \nprotect the State lock and canal from invasion or destruction. In 1892, \nFort Brady was moved to a nearby hill-top because increased commercial \nshipping raised the value of river-front property.\n  During World War II, Fort Brady saw a lot of action as over 20,000 \ntroops were stationed there for training. The Army used the winters of \nthe region to condition its snowshoe troops for warfare in northern \nEurope. At the end of\n\n[[Page S9310]]\n\nWorld War II, Fort Brady was placed on inactive status.\n  After Fort Brady's closing, local businessmen and officials were \nprompted to find a way to keep the recently renovated buildings and \nproperty in use. At the same time that residents were working to keep \nFort Brady functioning, the Sault branch of the Michigan College of \nMining and Technology (currently Michigan Technological University) was \nbeing inundated with applications from war veterans. It was quickly \ndecided that moving the school to Fort Brady would solve both problems.\n  In 1946, the Michigan College of Mining and Technology opened with a \nclass of 272. The Sault Ste. Marie branch offered classes in chemical, \nelectrical, and mechanical engineering and in forestry. Michigan State \nUniversity assisted in the founding of a general studies program that \noffered liberal arts credits for the first 2 years of course work that \nwere transferrable to other institutions.\n  In 1966, the college was renamed Lake Superior State College. The \nState Board of Education accorded the College 4-year status and \nauthorized it to grant baccalaureate degrees. The College's first class \nof 4-year students graduated in 1967. The College separated from \nMichigan Technological University in 1970, and on November 4, 1987, \nGovernor James Blanchard signed legislation changing Lake Superior \nState from a College to a University.\n  Over its 50 years, the University has grown steadily and currently \nhas an enrollment of approximately 3,500 students. Lake Superior State \nhas maintained the school's small personal atmosphere, while achieving \nnational recognition for accomplishments such as winning three NCAA \ndivision 1 hockey titles. In the field of academics, the school is \nparticularly known for the quality of its criminal justice and nursing \nprograms.\n  Over the past 50 years, Lake Superior State University has prepared \nthousands of students, including several members of my Senate staff, to \ncontribute to the State of Michigan and the Nation. I know my Senate \ncolleagues will join me in honoring Lake Superior State University on \nits 50 years of service to the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9309-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO HARRIET TRUDELL\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of Nevada's \nliving legends, Harriet Trudell. Harriet has had many titles during her \nlife, from democratic activist, human rights advocate, lobbyist, \nfeminist, campaign manager, and champion of the poor, to mother and \ngrandmother. To me, Harriet is both a valued friend and a trusted \nadvisor. To her country and the State of Nevada, she is a courageous \nand tireless fighter who can always be counted on to tell it like it \nis.\n  For more than 20 years, Harriet has been a key player in the public \narena, both in Nevada and across the Nation. She is an invaluable asset \nto all of the many organizations and groups to which she has lent her \nenergy, her fervor, and her skill. Harriet has a strong voice, a quick \nmind, and a political acumen which she uses to great effect for those \nwho often lack a voice in our society. Both her compassion and her \noutrage at injustice drive her to organize, inspire, and fight, long \nafter most would have been exhausted. From marching in protest down \n``the Strip'' in Las Vegas, to addressing the State legislature or \nlobbying Members of Congress, Harriet sticks to her convictions and \nnever gives up the fight.\n  Over the years, whether she was serving on my staff or for another \norganization, Harriet has fought for those in our society who are so \noften forgotten. Whenever there is a social issue confronting Congress, \nI can always expect a phone call from Harriet to remind me of my \nobligations. She is a champion of women, children, minorities, and the \npoor. When tough decisions have to be made, Harriet is there serving as \nour conscience. Even when her causes are politically unpopular, she \nsteadfastly speaks out for justice.\n  It is my pleasure to speak today in tribute to Harriet Trudell--a \nNevadan and a patriot--and congratulate her on being selected for a \nwell-deserved honor by the Southern Nevada Women's Political Caucus. \nNevada and the Nation owe Harriet Trudell a debt of gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9310-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOSH WESTON\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nJosh Weston who is retiring as chief executive officer of Automatic \nData Processing. It's been said that you can't judge a businessman by \nintentions, but by results. If that's true, then we can only judge Josh \nWeston as an incredible success. Josh joined ADP in 1970, and he has \nfar exceeded the high expectations I had for him.\n  During his 14 years as chairman and chief executive officer of ADP, \nJosh's leadership accelerated ADP's already extraordinary record of \nexcellence. In the words of Wall Street Stock analyst James A. Meyer, \n``This company is so well managed that it's the envy of everyone on \nWall Street.''\n  Josh has decided that it's time to pass on his mantle at ADP, and he \nleaves a legacy that was not only good for ADP, its staff, clients, and \nshareholders, but for our country. His extraordinary talent for \nmanagement will serve as a model to be studied by managers across our \ncorporate society.\n  ADP has grown phenomenally since two friends and I joined together in \nthe early 1950's. It went public in 1961 and continued to grow and \nprosper; in fact, ADP is the only public company in the Nation to \nachieve consistent, record growth in earnings and revenue for 139 \nquarters--nearly 35 years. In the most recent quarter, which ended on \nMarch 31, ADP earned a net $143.9 million. Earnings grew 15 percent and \nrevenue 20 percent.\n\n  Yet, ADP's success goes far beyond the debit and credit columns. It \ncurrently has 350,000 clients, prepares checks for 19 million, and \nenjoys a financial history which has made investors, many of them \nordinary ADP employees, financially secure. In addition, ADP provides \njobs for 5,000 New Jerseyans and employs 29,000, worldwide.\n  Much of this success is due to the leadership of Josh Weston over the \npast 14 years. He did it by following and building upon ADP's \nestablished formula for success: striving to master new technology, to \nimprove efficiency, to attract outstanding staff, to make profits every \nemployee's responsibility, and to develop new products and markets .\n  But perhaps most importantly, ADP has always invested in the morale, \nskills and training of its employees. These valuable men and women are \nADP's greatest resource, and Josh never failed to recognize this fact. \nIn fact, in a recent article in the Newark Star Ledger, Josh credited \n``teamwork'' as the key to ADP's success.\n  Although an extremely successful businessman, Josh has always \nbelieved that we make a living by what we gain, but we make a life by \nwhat we give. And Josh's contributions to his community are \nconsiderable. The numerous Pro Bono Boards on which he has been active \ninclude Chairman of Boys Town of Jerusalem; Chairman of Mountainside \nHospital; Vice-Chairman of the Tri-State United Way; New Jersey \nSymphony Orchestra; Atlantic Health System; WNET/Channel 13; I Have a \nDream Foundation; Montclair Art Museum; Montclair State University \nBusiness School; New Jersey Quality Education Commission; National \nConference of Christians and Jews; New Jersey University of Medicine \nand Dentistry; etc. This sampling undeniably demonstrates Josh's \nbreadth and depth of commitment.\n  For the past 14 years, Josh Weston and ADP have been a great team, \nbut Josh has decided that it's time to relinquish the CEO title to \nADP's current president and chief operating officer, Art Weinbach. As \nusual, Josh made an excellent decision.\n  Management gurus John Clemens and Douglas Mayer once noted, ``From a \nmanagement viewpoint, Shakespeare's King Lear is a tragedy because Lear \nfailed to understand two managerial concepts: the need to select \ncompetent successors and the need to let go.'' Josh undeniably \nunderstands these concepts. However, ADP will miss his vision and \nvitality. Josh Weston is not just a businessman or an executive; his \nrecord of accomplishment, his commitment to his customers and his \nloyalty to his employees distinguishes him as a true leader.\n  I am proud to call him a friend, and I wish him the best as he goes \non to other challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9310-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9311-S9312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S9311]]\n\n\n\n                           GEN. COLIN POWELL\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, few would dispute the fact that one \nof the most distinguished and highly respected public servants in our \nlifetime is Gen. Colin Powell.\n  I read in Carl Rowan's column of a speech he gave at a commencement \nat Bowie State University.\n  I contacted General Powell to obtain a copy of it, and I have just \nread his remarks for the second time.\n  They are common sense. They are compassionate. They are forward-\nlooking.\n  A significant part of his remarks, in my opinion, is what he has to \nsay about affirmative action.\n  Affirmative action can be abused like any good thing can be abused. \nHis comments should be spread much more widely than simply to this \ngraduating class.\n  I ask that Gen. Colin Powell's remarks be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n                      Remarks of Gen. Colin Powell\n\n       I can never speak at a commencement such as this without \n     the years peeling away as I drift back into a reverie of my \n     own commencement some 38 years ago. The world you have \n     educated yourselves for is so very, very different from the \n     world that I started in those many years ago.\n       I graduated as the Cold War was deepening, as lethal \n     arsenals of nuclear weapons were growing ever more ominous. \n     The world in 1958 that I entered was a world that seemed on \n     the verge of gloom and despair. For most of my years as a \n     soldier, for most of those 35 years, I participated in a \n     death struggle of survival between the forces of Communism \n     and the evil empire, and the forces of good, the forces of \n     democracy, that we represented. It was a long, long struggle, \n     a struggle that dominated most of my life.\n       I can still remember the commission I got at my ROTC \n     graduation in 1958. It was signed by Dwight Eisenhower, and \n     the mission they gave Lt. Powell at that time was simple. \n     ``Lt. Powell go to Germany. Take command of 40 soldiers. Find \n     the City of Frankfurt. Go to the east of the City of \n     Frankfurt. You'll find the Iron Curtain. Lt. Powell, with \n     your 40 soldiers, guard a small section of the Iron Curtain. \n     In the time of war, don't let the Russian Army come through. \n     Got it?'' ``Yes, sir. Got it.'' And I did that for two years, \n     successfully preventing World War II from breaking out.\n       The years went by, and 28 years later, I got a new \n     commission. This time from Ronald Reagan, and he made me a \n     Lieutenant General of Infantry And they gave me 75,000 proud \n     American soldiers to command. And 28 yeas later, my mission \n     was, ``General Powell, with your 75,000 soldiers, you'll be \n     in Germany, find the city of Frankfurt. Go the east of the \n     city of Frankfurt. Guard a slightly wider section of the Iron \n     Curtain this time. Try to do as good a job as you did when \n     you were a Lieutenant.''\n       During your years here at Bowie, that Cold War came to an \n     end. The arsenals of nuclear weapons are being dismantled. \n     The Soviet Union has broken into 15 individual nations, each \n     seeking its own way down a difficult path of learning how \n     democracy works, mastering the mysteries of free enterprise \n     and market economic system. Communism lies discredited, its \n     few remaining adherents cling to the corpse of a dead \n     ideology.\n       This historic reconciliation that has taken place between \n     East and West has changed the old Cold War map that used to \n     be red and blue with an Iron Curtain between the colors into \n     a new kind of map, a map full of mosaic pieces, different \n     colors as new nations and old nations seek to find a new way \n     in a different kind of world, a world structured as a world \n     trading system as opposed to a world in conflict.\n       This reconciliation that took place between the Soviet \n     Union and us is matched by other historic reconciliations \n     that have taken place around the world in recent years. In \n     the Middle East, the peace process is moving forward that we \n     hope will be successful in finally bringing peace to that \n     troubled part of the world.\n       In South Africa, Nelson Mandela who was on trial when I \n     graduated from college and who spent 27 years in prison, is \n     now the president of his country. And in his triumph, he \n     killed the evil ideology of Apartheid.\n       In our own hemisphere, as I think back just seven years to \n     when I was National Security Advisor to the President of the \n     United States and we had all kinds of problems here in Haiti, \n     in Nicaragua, and Honduras and El Salvador and Panama and \n     now, all of those nations are moving forward down the road to \n     democracy with elected civilian leaders; all of them save \n     one, Cuba. But Cuba cannot withstand the winds of historic \n     change that are sweeping across our hemisphere. In Asia, the \n     pattern is the same as we watch the Philippines and India, \n     the Southeast Asia tiger, Vietnam, even China, emerging into \n     this new world trading system.\n       You are entering a world where our former adversaries, \n     those that we were in conflict with for all these decades, \n     have now become our economic competitors as well as becoming \n     our new markets, new opportunities for us.\n       It is not a world without problems or conflicts. Bosnia, \n     Liberia, North Korea, and other places of tragedy remind us \n     on our television sets every evening of the dangers that will \n     lurk ahead. Yet, I want you to see this as a time of hope and \n     optimism because our value systems have prevailed.\n       There is no cross-border war anywhere in the world today. \n     No nation is fighting with any other nation across a national \n     border. American troops on this Memorial Day are not at war. \n     Instead, they are conducting peacekeeping operations. In \n     Bosnia they are even working alongside Russian soldiers who \n     were once their sworn enemies.\n       The world that you are entering to make your contribution \n     will increasingly be structured not by armies staring at each \n     other across iron or bamboo curtains. Instead, it will be \n     structured by free world trade, by the power of the \n     information and technology revolutions, by the instantaneous \n     flow of capital, data, ideas, values. The cellular telephone, \n     the fax machine and the Internet are breaking down all the \n     old Cold War boundaries that once divided people.\n       What will not change is the responsibility that America \n     will have to burden the very difficult, difficult task of \n     world leadership. We have power that is trusted. We are still \n     a beacon of freedom, and we are still an example of what can \n     be achieved, what can be accomplished when free people are \n     allowed to determine their own destiny.\n       With the end of the Cold War, we have now turned inward \n     here in America to start to deal with those vexing problems \n     that, perhaps, we overlook while we were worrying about \n     nuclear warfare and World War III. We look inward and know \n     that we need a more rapidly growing economy to provide good, \n     well-paying jobs for all Americans. We know that we have to \n     do something about the problems of violence on our streets \n     and violence in our schools. We have to do something about an \n     education system, while it serves you well, it is not \n     structured to serve all our youngsters well.\n       We must do something about the scourge of drugs that \n     threatens to wipe out an entire generation of young people. \n     We will have to deal with the breakdown that has occurred in \n     the norms of civility within our society which have led to \n     such public and political rancor that causes us to wonder \n     what kind of a society we are becoming. We must do something \n     about the racial separation that exists in our nation and \n     keeps us from the dream of an integrated society that Dr. \n     King set out for us.\n       In some ways, the new world that we face will be more \n     complex and demanding than the old world, both here and \n     abroad. But despite the challenges, incredible opportunities \n     await you in this new world, opportunities that await \n     educated people. The education you received here, the \n     additional education you must acquire in whatever field of \n     endeavor you enter--because in this increasingly technical \n     and competitive world, success will go to those who realize \n     that education must now become a lifelong pursuit.\n       America will not be going back to smokestack industries. \n     The corporate restructuring that you see taking place allow \n     us to be more competitive, more agile, more ready to deal \n     with the challenges of a world economic system. You each face \n     the prospect of several different careers in several \n     different companies in different places around the country \n     and around the world as you go about your working career.\n       America has changed in so many, many wonderful ways since \n     my graduation in 1958. When I graduated as a black man, I \n     was, by law, a second-class citizen. When I graduated in \n     1958, the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights \n     didn't fully apply to me. I entered at that time perhaps the \n     only institution in America that permitted a black person to \n     rise in an integrated setting limited only by my own \n     willingness to work hard and my dreams and ambition. And that \n     institution was the United States Army.\n       The Army led the nation, and the nation followed. The young \n     Captain Powell who was once refused service at a lunch \n     counter in Georgia, when I came home from Vietnam after a \n     year of fighting for my country, that Captain Powell was able \n     to become General Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff for the Armed Forces of United States.\n       But I didn't do it alone. I climbed on the backs of the \n     those who came before me and those who broke the trail, the \n     Buffalo soldiers and Tuskegee Airmen, and the other black \n     military pioneers. I climbed on the backs of men and women \n     who knew that they served a country that was not yet prepared \n     to serve them. But they did it anyway because they had faith \n     in what the future held for them and for their country.\n       I benefited from the sacrifices of Dr. Martin Luther King, \n     Jr. and Jesse and Rosa and Andrew and so many, many others--\n     black and white--who were determined to build an America that \n     would be faithful to the dreams of its founding fathers. \n     The men and women who are honored along with me today, \n     your teachers and parents and family members who are \n     present today, they struggled as well.\n       We succeeded because we worked hard, we believed in \n     ourselves, and because we believed in the fundamental \n     goodness of the American people and we believed in the \n     redemptive potential of our society; and we did it all for \n     you. We now expect you to do even more. We expect you to \n     climb higher. We expect you to take advantage of the \n     marvelous opportunities that are before you, opportunities \n     that were not there for us. We expect\n\n[[Page S9312]]\n\n     you to let your shoulders be used by those who still search \n     for success, who wonder if the dream is still there for them. \n     Because you see, the struggle is not yet over. We're not \n     where we have got to be. We're not where we want to be. We \n     have a great America. We can make it a greater America.\n       There are those who say, ``Well, you know, we can stop now. \n     America is a color blind society.'' But it isn't yet. There \n     are those who say, ``We have a level playing field.'' But we \n     don't yet. There are those who say that, ``All you need is to \n     climb up on your own boot straps.'' But there are too many \n     Americans who don't have boots, much less boot straps.\n       A few--a few Horatio Alger stories, not enough to give hope \n     to our fellow citizens who still live in the despair of \n     racism, who are trapped in tightening circles of poverty and \n     poor education, who wonder if compassion and caring are still \n     the pillars of the American dream. There are those who rail \n     against Affirmative Action. They rail against Affirmative \n     Action preferences, while they have lived an entire life of \n     preference. There are those who do not understand that the \n     progress we have achieved over the past generation must be \n     continued if we wish to bless future generations.\n       And so, Colin Powell believes in Affirmative Action.\n       I believe it has been good for America, and I know that we \n     can design Affirmative Action Programs that will satisfy the \n     Constitutional requirements, because what we want is \n     Affirmative Action that provides access for all Americans to \n     the opportunities that rightfully belong to all Americans.\n       In my travels around the country since retirement, I have \n     visited with many corporate leaders, and I have been pleased \n     to see how committed American industry is to Affirmative \n     Action. They understand that we cannot waste any human \n     potential. They understand that in the future that is ahead \n     they must have diverse work forces. They must be prepared to \n     operate in a world trading environment that is increasingly \n     minority, as we would call it, becoming a majority.\n       I'm very, very proud of what I've seen in American \n     corporate life. In one case, one company leader said to me, \n     ``We don't care what the government does with respect to \n     Affirmative Action. We believe in it. We believe it's the \n     right thing to do. We are going to continue to move \n     forward.''\n       Affirmative Action finds and prepares qualified people for \n     entry into the education system and into the work force. We \n     must resist misguided government efforts that seek to shut it \n     all down, efforts such as the California Civil Rights \n     Initiative which poses as an Equal Opportunity Initiative, \n     but which puts at risk every outreach program. It sets \n     back the gains made by women, and puts the brakes on \n     expanding opportunities for people who are in need.\n       I don't speak about Affirmative Action from an academic \n     sense. I speak from experience. In the military, we worked \n     hard to include all Americans. We used Affirmative Action to \n     reach out to those who were qualified, but who were often \n     overlooked or ignored as a result of indifference or inertia. \n     We used Affirmative Action in the military to create the \n     level playing field and to create the color blind environment \n     that so many people speak of.\n       We didn't wait for it to happen. We made it happen in the \n     military. We created an environment where advancement came \n     from performance and a striving for excellence and not from \n     color or gender. But first we had to open the gates to let \n     people in. As a result, we produced an Armed Force rich in \n     its diversity and the very, very best in the world, a \n     reflection of what all of America should look like. So we \n     have to keep it up. We have to commit ourselves. There is no \n     alternative.\n       When one black man graduates, at the same time, 100 black \n     men are going to jail. We still need Affirmative Action.\n       When half of all African American men between the ages of \n     24 and 35 years of age are without full-time employment, we \n     still need Affirmative Action. When half of all black \n     children live in poverty, we need Affirmative Action as well \n     as quality education systems and a thriving economy to \n     produce the good jobs, the good jobs that free enterprise and \n     capitalism can produce, the jobs that at the end of day are \n     the only solution to the problems we face.\n       Some people will say that Affirmative Action stigmatizes \n     the recipients. Nonsense. Affirmative Action provides access \n     for the qualified. And for anybody who feels stigmatized, go \n     get A's instead of C's. Knock them dead. And then--I tell the \n     story in my book about when I was a young Lieutenant and one \n     of my commanding officers back then in the late '50s came up \n     to me and said, ``Powell, you're doing great. You're one of \n     best black Lieutenants I've ever known.'' And I just said, \n     ``Thank you, sir.'' And I said to myself silently, ``That \n     ain't going to be good enough. You may have a stereotype of \n     me, but I intend to be the best Lieutenant you ever saw.'' \n     And I will--for the way to handle stereotypes and stigmatism \n     is to let it be somebody else's problem. You just perform and \n     do your very, very best.\n       Because you see, the Army put me in an environment where I \n     could be a winner, and I wanted to be a winner. Beautiful \n     graduates before me this morning are all winners. You have \n     benefited from the sacrifices of those who went before you. \n     You have worked hard. And today, you receive your reward. You \n     are filled by the love and by the dreams of your parents and \n     families. You are nourished by the education you have \n     received from the dedicated teachers here present who \n     have given you the priceless gift of learning.\n       We expect you to go forth and prosper and contribute to the \n     economic growth of this nation. We expect you to lead a life \n     of service to your community and to serve those who have not \n     had the advantages that you have. You are people of \n     accomplishment. You are now role models. Each of you must \n     find a way to reach down and back to help someone in need, \n     someone in pain, someone who wonders if anybody cares, \n     somebody who wonders if the American dream is still there for \n     them.\n       In order to have a complete life, make sure you share your \n     time, your talent, and your treasure with these who are less \n     fortunate. We expect you to raise strong families. We expect \n     you to raise children who are inspired to do even better than \n     you are. Marry well, and marry for life. Be parents of value. \n     Teach your children the difference between right and wrong. \n     Teach your children the place of God in their lives.\n       Teach your children the value of hard work and education. \n     Teach them to love. Teach them to be tolerant. Teach them to \n     be proud of their heritage, their color. And teach them to \n     respect their fellow citizens who may look different but who \n     are not different.\n       Teach them to respect themselves, to believe in themselves. \n     Teach them, above all, to believe in America as you must \n     believe in America. America, a noisy, noisy country, the \n     noise has a name. It's called ``democracy.'' Democracy as we \n     argue with each other to find the correct way forward. \n     America, a wonderful place. A place with problems, problems \n     that are now yours to solve and not just to curse, because we \n     are a good people. We want to do the right thing. We must \n     have faith in ourselves. We are, as Lincoln put it, ``The \n     last, best hope of earth,''\n       I am so proud of you today, so very, very proud. Go forth \n     now to make this a better land. Go forth to find your \n     destiny. Go forth to find happiness. Go forth on your \n     American journey. Go forth with my congratulations and with \n     God's blessings. Have a great life.

Mr. President, I want to express my support of Jeffords-\nRoth-Leahy renewable energy amendment. This amendment will restore \nfunding for the Department of Energy solar and renewable energy \nresearch and development program to the amount appropriated in fiscal \nyear 1996.\n  I want to thank Senator Jeffords for offering this amendment because \nI believe that our country's renewable energy program is at an \nimportant watershed. With support from Congress and the Federal \nGovernment, our Nation can forge ahead in developing reliable and cost-\neffective renewable technologies. We can also position our renewable \nenergy industry to capture its share of the rapidly expanding market of \nsolar and other renewable technologies. And, we can expand power \ngeneration capacity in an environmentally responsible manner.\n  In recent years, energy efficiency and renewable energy programs have \nbeen remarkably successful and have created a new industry capable of \nworld leadership in a very important technology sector. Energy \nefficient technologies are generating billions of dollars of consumer \nenergy savings and new business opportunities and play an important \nrole in job creation, according to a study by energy expert Daniel \nYergin. If we retreat from this promising growth industry, as we did \nthroughout the decade of 1980s, our international competitors will \nquickly carve up a market that will exceed a billion dollars by the \nturn of the century.\n\n[[Page S9313]]\n\n  We should not reduce funding for renewable R and allow this \ninitiative to sputter and stall. We must move forward, as other \ncountries are doing, and make essential investments in technologies \nthat will create new jobs, open export markets, and promote a healthy \nenvironment. This is the choice we have made in approving this \namendment.\n  At stake is our ability to compete in an international energy market \nthat will experience explosive growth in the decades ahead. Many \ncountries cannot afford to meet the growing energy demand by building, \noperating, and maintaining centralized power plants and the costly \ninfrastructure associated with them. The flexibility offered by \nrenewable technologies is a natural fit for the developing world.\n  Countries around the world are also making conscious strategic \ndecisions to endorse and adopt renewable energy as a mainstay of their \nenergy policy. These policies may lead to the amelioration of problems \nassociated with global climate change.\n  The past decade was a period of unparalleled success in the drive to \nreduce the cost of solar and renewable technologies. Some are at the \nverge of becoming cost competitive with conventional energy sources. \nThis trend will continue to improve in the years ahead. As these \ntechnologies become more and more cost competitive, the rate at which \nthese technologies are integrated into the energy grid will steadily \nincrease.\n\n  What is at stake is the ability of a young, dynamic industry to \ncapture the world markets for renewable technologies so that Americans \ncan hold their share of rewarding, high paying jobs. That is what the \nJeffords amendment is all about. If we are to move into the future with \na strong economy and a healthy environment, renewable energy \ntechnologies must be a part of our investment strategy for the future.\n  Although the value of U.S. renewable energy exports exceeds a quarter \nof a billion dollars, the U.S. renewable energy industry is barely \npenetrating the expanding world market for renewable energy \ntechnologies. This is a result of a weak commitment to renewable energy \nresearch, development, and export promotion.\n  Compared with seven other leading trading nations, the United States \nranks lowest in resources allocated to solar and renewable export \npromotion, according to a 1992 Department of Energy report.\n  National Science Foundation data confirms that the U.S. investment in \nR is in decline. Since 1987, Federal R investments have dropped \nsteadily in real terms. Since 1992, industry R has stagnated. And \ntoday, less than one-third of private R is dedicated to research; the \nrest is being spent on product and process development.\n  I support the Jeffords amendment because I want to reverse this \ntrend. Frankly, I would have preferred higher spending levels for solar \nand renewable programs, but this is not realistic given the budget \nconstraints we face. Unless we maintain a reasonable funding level for \nthese programs, we will continue to lose ground and should not be \nsurprised if other countries outcompete U.S. industry in this rapidly \nexpanding market.\n  Finally, there are important energy security reasons for supporting \nthis amendment. U.S. oil imports are at record levels, are continuing \nto grow, and could reach 60 percent of consumption by the year 2005. \nOil imports that high would contribute nearly $90 billion to the trade \ndeficit. According to a recent Department of Commerce analysis, this \nlevel of oil imports constitutes a threat to U.S. economic security. \nPersian Gulf countries are projected to control 70 percent of the \nglobal market for oil by the year 2010, making world oil markets \nincreasingly unstable.\n  Renewable energy technologies will lead to significant movement \ntoward alleviating some of the potential negative consequences of our \ncontinuing and increasing reliance on imported oil.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9312-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO THE EXPERIMENTAL AIRCRAFT ASSOCIATION ON THE OCCASION OF THE \n      43D ANNUAL ``FLY IN'' IN OSHKOSH, WISCONSIN, AUGUST 1, 1996\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the \n160,000 international members of the Experimental Aircraft Association, \nbased in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, on the opening day of their 43rd annual \n``Fly In'' convention, the single largest aviation event of its kind in \nthe world.\n  Mr. President, the Fly In, held at the Wittman Regional Airport in \nOshkosh, is the stage for 12,000 experimental aircraft, vintage \nwarplanes, showplanes, ultralights and rotorcraft. More than 700 \nexhibitors will present examples of cutting edge aviation technology, \nand more than 500 workshops, seminars and forums will feature many of \nthe leading figures in aviation passing along their knowledge and \nexperience on subjects covering the whole spectrum of flight.\n  More than 800,000 people from all over the world will attend the Fly \nIn.\n  This year's program includes a salute to test pilots, the people who \nstrap into the latest aviation designs and push them as far and as fast \nand as high as they can possibly go, pushing the performance envelope \nin the continuous quest for better aircraft. There will also be a \nsalute to Korean War and Vietnam War veterans.\n  Mr. President, the Fly In is a terrific show, but it is only part of \nthe ongoing work of the EAA.\n  The Experimental Aircraft Association works both to preserve \naviation's heritage and promote its future. If you are interested in \ndesigning, building, restoring, maintaining or flying airplanes, or if \nyou simply take pleasure in watching aircraft perform, the EAA offers \nsomething for you through programs at the state, regional, national and \ninternational level, all aimed at making flying safer, more enjoyable \nand more accessible for anyone interested.\n  The EAA supports a foundation dedicated to the education, history and \ndevelopment of sport flying. It maintains a large collection of \naircraft, a portion of which is on display at the EAA Air Adventure \nMuseum in Oshkosh. EAA has created the Young Eagles program to give a \nfree flight experience to young people, and there's a scholarship \nprogram for young people interested in aviation careers.\n  All this began, Mr. President, in January, 1953, a little less than \n50 years after the Wright brothers flew at Kitty Hawk. Paul Poberezny \nand a group of flying enthusiasts met at Milwaukee's Curtiss Wright \nfield, now known as Timmerman Field. The first Fly In was held nine \nmonths later at Curtiss Wright, drawing fewer than 40 people and a \nhandful of aircraft.\n  Mr. Poberezny was elected the group's first president, and he held \nthat post until 1989, when his son, Tom, took the reins. For the first \n11 years of its existence, EAA was run out of the basement of Mr. \nPoberezny's home in Hales Corners, Wisconsin, near Milwaukee. Now it \noperates from its headquarters in Oshkosh.\n  Mr. President, flight has fascinated the human race for centuries. \nLess than a century ago, powered flight became a reality. Sixty-six \nyears later, we landed on the moon. Still, the wonder of traveling \namong the clouds remains, and that spirit, along with the inventiveness \nand daring of pilots, designers and engineers, is nurtured by the \nExperimental Aircraft Association.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9313-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9313-S9314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IT'S TIME TO END DEFERRAL\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it's time to end the perverse $2.2 \nbillion U.S. jobs export subsidy called deferral that our Tax Code \nprovides to big U.S. companies that move their manufacturing plants and \nU.S. jobs to tax havens abroad, and then ship back their tax-haven \nproducts into the United States for sale. Since 1979, we have lost \nabout 3 million good-paying manufacturing jobs in this country, in \npart, because of this ill-advised subsidy.\n  Presidents Kennedy, Nixon, and Carter all tried to curb this \nmisguided tax subsidy. In 1975, the Senate voted to end it. In 1987, \nthe House voted to stop it. But in each case, high-powered lobbyists \nfor the big corporations were able to derail it before such action \ncould be enacted and signed into law.\n  In July, Robert McIntyre, Director of the Citizens for Tax Justice, \noffered compelling testimony in support of the effort to pull the plug \non this misguided tax break at a recent Families\n\n[[Page S9314]]\n\nFirst forum on paycheck security issues. He thoroughly debunks the \nlobbyist-driven myths that repealing this $2.2 billion U.S. jobs export \nsubsidy will somehow prevent large U.S. multinational firms from \ncompeting in the global economy. I think that you will find his \ntestimony provides an excellent perspective on this subject, and I hope \nthat you will read it.\n  I ask that the text of Mr. McIntyre's recent testimony be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The material follows:\n\nStatement of Robert S. McIntyre, Director, Citizens for Tax Justice, In \n    Support of Legislation To Curb Tax Subsidies for Exporting Jobs\n\n       Citizens for Tax Justice strongly supports legislation to \n     limit current federal tax deferrals that subsidize the export \n     of American jobs. Such reform legislation is embodied in S. \n     1355, Senator Byron Dorgan's ``American Jobs and \n     Manufacturing Preservation Act.'' Similar legislation has \n     been approved by the House of Representative in the past. We \n     urge the full Congress to pass S. 1355 and send it to the \n     President to sign.\n\n\n tax breaks for exporting jobs should be eliminated--we shouldn't pay \n    our companies to make goods for the American market in foreign \n                               countries\n\n       In its 1990 annual report, the Hewlett-Packard company \n     noted: ``As a result of certain employment and capital \n     investment actions undertaken by the company, income from \n     manufacturing activities in certain countries is subject to \n     reduced tax rates, and in some cases is wholly exempt from \n     taxes, for years through 2002.'' In fact, said Hewlett-\n     Packard's report, ``the income tax benefits attributable to \n     the tax status of these subsidiaries are estimated to be $116 \n     million, $88 million and $57 million for 1990, 1989 and 1988, \n     respectively.''\n       This is not an isolated instance. An examination of 1990 \n     corporate annual reports that we undertook a few years ago \n     provided the following additional examples.\\1\\\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n       Baxter International noted that it has ``manufacturing \n     operations outside the U.S. which benefit from reductions in \n     local tax rates under tax incentives that will continue at \n     least through 1997.'' Baxter said that its tax savings from \n     these (and its Puerto Rican) operations totaled $200 million \n     from 1988 to 1990.\\2\\\n       Pfizer reported that the ``[e]ffects of partially tax-\n     exempt operations in Puerto Rico and reduced rates in \n     Ireland'' amounted to $125 million in tax savings in 1990, \n     $106 million in 1989 and $95 million in 1988.\n       Schlering-Plough said that it ``has subsidiaries in Puerto \n     Rico and Ireland that manufacture products for distribution \n     to both domestic and foreign markets. These subsidiaries \n     operate under tax exemption grants and other incentives that \n     expire at various dates through 2018.''\n       Becton Dickinson reported $43 million in ``tax reductions \n     related to tax holidays in various countries'' from 1988 to \n     1990.\n       Beckman noted: ``Certain income of subsidiaries operating \n     in Puerto Rico and Ireland is taxed at substantially lower \n     income tax rates,'' worth more than $7 million a year to the \n     company over the past two years.\n       Abbot Laboratories pegged the value of ``tax incentive \n     grants related to subsidiaries in Puerto Rico and Ireland'' \n     at $82 million in 1990, $79 million in 1989 and $76 million \n     in 1988.\n       Merck & Co. noted that ``earnings from manufacturing \n     operations in Ireland [were] exempt from Irish taxes. The tax \n     exemption expired in 1990; thereafter, Irish earnings will be \n     taxed at an incentive rate of 10 percent.''\n       In fact, under current law, American companies often are \n     taxed considerably less if they move their manufacturing \n     operations to an overseas ``tax haven'' such as Singapore, \n     Ireland or Taiwan, and then import their products back into \n     the United States for sale.\n\n\n              how we subsidize the export of american jobs\n\n       The tax incentive for exporting American jobs results from \n     current tax rules that:\n       1. allow companies to ``defer'' indefinitely U.S. taxes on \n     repatriated profits earned by their foreign subsidiaries; and\n       2. allow companies to use foreign tax credits generated by \n     taxes paid to non-tax haven countries to offset the U.S. tax \n     otherwise due on repatriated profits earned in low- or no-tax \n     foreign tax havens.\n\n\n              s. 1355 would end this wrong-headed subsidy\n\n       Why should the United States tax code give companies a tax \n     incentive to establish jobs and plants in tax-haven \n     countries, rather than keeping or expanding their plants and \n     jobs in the United States? Why should our tax code make tax \n     breaks a factor in decisions by American companies about \n     where to make the products they sell in the United States?\n       Why indeed? We believe that this tax break for overseas \n     plants should be ended. Profits earned by American-owned \n     companies from sales in the United States should be taxed--\n     whether the products are Made in the USA or abroad.\n       S. 1355 would end the current tax break for exporting \n     jobs--by taxing profits on goods that are manufactured by \n     American companies in foreign tax havens and imported back \n     into the United States. It would achieve this result by (1) \n     imposing current tax on the ``imported property income'' of \n     foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations; and (2) adding a \n     new separate foreign tax credit limitation for imported \n     property income earned by U.S. companies, either directly or \n     through foreign subsidiaries. \\3\\\n       legislation identical to S. 1355 was passed by the House in \n     1987. Unfortunately, at that time the reform provision was \n     dropped in conference at the insistence of the Reagan \n     administration.\n\n\n    spurious arguments against curbing subsidies for exporting jobs\n\n       Of course, Congress has heard loud complaints from \n     lobbyists for companies that benefit from the current tax \n     breaks for exporting jobs. Some have apparently argued that \n     their companies will be at a competitive disadvantage in \n     foreign markets if this legislation were approved. But since \n     the bill applies only to sales in U.S. markets, that argument \n     makes no sense.\n       Lobbyists also have asserted that if American \n     multinationals have to pay U.S. taxes on their profits from \n     U.S. sales for foreign-made goods, they might be \n     disadvantaged compared to foreign-owned companies selling \n     products in the United States. Perhaps. But as the House \n     concluded in 1987, it would be far better ``to place U.S.-\n     owned foreign enterprises who produce for the U.S. market on \n     a par with similar or competing U.S. enterprises'' rather \n     than worrying about ``placing them on a par with purely \n     foreign enterprises.'' \\4\\\n       Finally, lobbyists have made the spurious point that \n     overall, foreign affiliates of U.S. companies have a negative \n     trade balance with the United States, that is, they move more \n     goods and services out of the United States than they export \n     back in. To which, one might answer, so what?\n       After all, S. 1355 does not deal with all foreign \n     affiliates of U.S. companies. Rather, it deals only with \n     U.S.-controlled foreign subsidiaries that produce goods for \n     the American market in tax-haven countries.\\5\\ When U.S. \n     companies shift what would otherwise be domestic production \n     to these foreign subsidiaries it most certainly does not \n     improve the U.S. trade balance; it hurts it.\\6\\\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       American companies may move jobs and plants to foreign \n     locations in order to make goods for the U.S. market for many \n     reasons--such as low wages or lack of regulation--that the \n     tax code can do little about. But we should not provide an \n     additional inducement for such American-job-losing moves \n     through our income tax policy.\n       American multinationals should pay income taxes on their \n     U.S.-related profits from foreign production. Such income \n     should not be more favorably treated by our tax code than \n     profits from producing goods here in the United States. We \n     urge Congress to approve the provisions of S. 1355.\n     \\1\\ Several of the companies mentioned here apparently have \n     been lobbying hard against S. 1355.\n     \\2\\ Many companies do not separate the tax savings from their \n     Puerto Rican and foreign tax-haven activities in their annual \n     reports.\n     \\3\\ ``Imported property income means income . . . derived in \n     connection with manufacturing, producing, growing, or \n     extracting imported property; the sale, exchange, or other \n     disposition of imported property; or the lease, rental, or \n     licensing of imported property. For the purpose of the \n     foreign tax credit limitation, income that is both imported \n     property income and U.S. source income is treated as U.S. \n     source income. Foreign taxes on that U.S. source imported \n     property income are eligible for crediting against the U.S. \n     tax on foreign source import[ed] property income. Imported \n     property does not include any foreign oil and gas extraction \n     income or any foreign oil-related income.\n     ``The bill defines `imported property' as property which is \n     imported into the United States by the controlled foreign \n     corporation or a related person.'' House Committee on Ways \n     and Means, ``Report on Title X of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1987,'' in House Committee on the \n     Budget, Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, House Rpt. \n     100-391, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., Oct. 26, 1987, pp. 1103-04.\n     \\4\\ Id.\n     \\5\\ Companies that manufacture abroad in non-tax-haven \n     countries generally would not be affected by the bill, since \n     they still will get foreign tax credits for the foreign taxes \n     they pay.\n     \\6\\ Foreign affiliates of U.S. companies that produce goods \n     for foreign markets--not addressed by Senator Dorgan's bill--\n     may well have a negative trade balance with the United \n     States, insofar as they transfer property from their domestic \n     parent to be used in overseas manufacturing. But it would \n     obviously be far better for the U.S. trade balance--and for \n     American jobs--if those final products were manufactured \n     completely in the United States and exported abroad, rather \n     than having much of the manufacturing process occur overseas. \n     To assert that foreign manufacturing operations by American \n     companies helps the U.S. trade balance is to play games with \n     statistics.\n     For example, suppose an American company was making $100 \n     million in export goods in the U.S. for foreign markets. Now, \n     suppose it moves the assembly portion of that manufacturing \n     process overseas, where half the value of the final products \n     is produced. At this point, instead of $100 million in \n     exports, there are only $50 million. America has thus lost \n     exports and jobs--even though the foreign affiliate itself \n     has a negative trade balance with the United States. For \n     better or worse, however, S. 1355, does not address this \n     situation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9313-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9314-S9315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE RUSSIAN ELECTIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on June 16, something happened that has \ntremendous implications for the American people and for people \neverywhere. On that day, Russia, which just a few years ago was the \ngreatest threat to democracy in the world, held a democratic election \nto select its President.\n\n[[Page S9315]]\n\n  That alone, Mr. President, is reason to celebrate. Despite calls from \npeople across the Russian political spectrum who still do not \nunderstand what democracy is about to cancel the election, the Russian \ngovernment stuck by its commitment to democracy--\n  No decisions were taken by secretive Politburos.\n  Parties representing the full spectrum of political sentiment \nparticipated. Candidates crisscrossed that vast country making promises \nto win the votes of ordinary people.\n  And in the end, most stunning of all, there was a graceful concession \nspeech by the losing candidate, the leader of the Communist party that \nonly a little while ago we regarded as the personification of tyranny, \ncommitting the party to challenge irregularities in the election ``in \nthe courts, not in the streets.''\n  Mr. President, this was not a perfect election. There were \nirregularities. There may well have been instances of ballot box \nstuffing. I was quite concerned about the extent to which media \ncoverage of the election appeared to favor one candidate. But it also \noccurred to me that, if I were a newspaperman covering an election in \nwhich one major party had a record of advancing democracy and the \nfreedoms associated with it and the other had a 70-year history of \nsuppressing the freedom of newspapers like mine, I might have tended to \nadvocacy rather than neutrality too. That is not an excuse, but despite \nthe irregularities, there is general agreement that the will of the \nRussian people was heard in this election.\n  The Russian people voted for democracy, and the tremendous \nsignificance of that should not be lost on anyone. Despite all of the \nhardship they are experiencing. Despite the crime and corruption. \nDespite their loss of empire. Despite the fact that the standard-bearer \nof the forces of democracy has made many mistakes, the brutal war in \nChechnya being the most egregious, and is in poor health.\n  The Russian people voted for freedom. Freedom to speak their minds. \nFreedom to associate. As ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who is \nnot someone I admire, put it in explaining why he would not support the \ncommunists: freedom to decide where to spend his vacation. For some, it \ncame down to things as simple as that, things which we take for \ngranted.\n\n  Mr. President, the world has changed profoundly in the last decade. \nCommunism as a world force is gone. Whatever the future may bring in \nterms of the distribution of power in the world, the age of ideological \nconfrontation between communism and democracy is over. While there \nremain many aggressive forces in the world, I cannot help but feel that \nthe world will be a safer place when its two greatest powers are both \ncommitted to democracy and the protection of individual rights.\n  And I think we owe credit to President Clinton, Secretary of State \nChristopher, and Deputy Secretary Talbott. Over the past 3 years, they \nhave braved the attacks by those, including some in this chamber, who \ncannot bring themselves to give up their cold war notions about evil \nempires and would have us focus only on the vestiges of the old and \nugly in Russia and ignore all that is new and promising.\n  Where do we go from here? As the ranking member of the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee, I have watched as funding for foreign \nassistance has been slashed over the past 18 months, including \nassistance to Russia. Assistance to Russia is being phased out over the \nnext 2 years, even though it is obvious that it is going to take the \nRussian people at least another decade to be able to take control of \ntheir own lives instead of expecting the government to do it for them, \nand that our assistance would be valuable to them.\n  President Yeltsin has won the support of his people to continue \nreform. But the Russian economy remains a shambles. The Russian \nGovernment has no money to finance its reforms. Crime is rampant. There \nare still pensioners on the streets of Moscow hawking pairs of \nchildren's rubber boots in order to survive.\n  Aid from the United States cannot possibly solve these problems \ndirectly. The problems are so immense that only the Russian people \nworking together will be able to.\n  But what our aid can do is show them the way. Most Russians still \nhave only a faint notion of what a market economy offers. Most also \nstill carry the perceptions drilled into them by their Soviet masters \nthat Americans are their enemies.\n  I have not been fully satisfied with the results of our aid program \nin Russia. There has been confusion, a lack of strategic thinking, and \nboilerplate approaches that did not fit the unique conditions there. \nToo much of the money has ended up in the pockets of American \ncontractors, without enough to show for it.\n  But some programs have given the Russian people hope for a \nbetter future. People-to-people exchanges are an example of how we can \nhelp change old ways of thinking. I believe the thousands of exchanges \nof ordinary citizens that we have sponsored over the last 4 years \nplayed a role in President Yeltsin's victory. Farmer-to-farmer \nprograms. Business exchange programs. Academic exchange programs. Civic \norganization development projects. They have shown the Russian people \nwhat is possible.\n\n  Americans have learned from these exchanges too. We have learned that \nthe Russian people are not ogres. Like us, they are mostly worried \nabout the welfare of their families. But they are learning for the \nfirst time that it is possible to have a system of government whose \nprimary aim is the defense of individual rights, and which actually \nserves them.\n  Mr. President, there remains much to criticize in Russia. The \ndemocracy that exists there is fragile, and the future unpredictable. \nThe future is far from predictable. There will continue to be setbacks, \nand instances when Russia behaves in ways that are inconsistent with \ninternational norms. I have been horrified by the brutality of the \nRussian military in Chechnya. While it has been reassuring to see the \noutpouring of protest against this barbarity by the Russian people \nthemselves, President Yeltsin and his security advisors need to \nrecognize that Chechnya's future is not going to be decided by bombing \nits people into submission.\n  Having said that, let us today recognize how much has changed for the \nbetter in Russia compared to just a few years ago. And I hope we will \nalso reaffirm our commitment to support reform in Russia. We know how \nto put our aid dollars to good use there, and there is much good yet to \nbe done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9314-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9315-S9316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           YEAR-ROUND SCHOOLS\n\n  Mr SIMON. Mr. President, recently a friend of mine, Gene Callahan, \nsent me an editorial from the Evansville Courier suggesting that \nEvansville look at year-round schools.\n  The reality is the whole Nation should do that.\n  We take the summer months off, in theory, so that our children can go \nout and harvest the crops. That made sense a century ago and maybe even \n60 years ago, but it does not make sense today.\n  If we increased the school year from 180 days to 210, we would still \nbe far behind Japan's 243 days and Germany's 240 days. And simply \nadding that 30 days would mean the equivalent of 2 additional years of \nschool by the time the 12th grade is finished. But in reality it would \nbe more than that. Any fourth grade teacher will tell you that part of \nthe first weeks of teaching in the fourth grade is revisiting what \nstudents learn in the third grade. The three month lapse makes it more \ndifficult for students starting in the fourth grade.\n  But suggesting year-round schools is not going to be simple. We will \nhave to pay teachers more. We will have to air condition school rooms. \nIn essence, what we will have to do is to make the priority out of \neducation that we must, if we are to be a competitive Nation with the \nrest of the world.\n  One not so incidental result of that would be that our students would \nbe better prepared, we would gradually reduce our illiteracy rate, and \nbecause students will have more opportunity upon graduation and would \nnot be in the streets in the summer months, the crime rate is likely to \ndrop some. The drop is not likely to be dramatic, but it would help.\n  I commend the editors of the Evansville Courier.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the editorial from the Courier be printed \nin the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n[[Page S9316]]\n\n              [From the Evansville Courier, June 17, 1996]\n\n                 Take Another Look at Year-Round School\n\n       The Evansville-Vanderburgh School Corp. has good cause to \n     consider starting the school year in mid-August--test-\n     readiness of children is a valid concern in both home and \n     classroom. And in our view, the same argument weighs for \n     future consideration of a year-round school calendar.\n       The school administration has recommended that the School \n     Board approve a calendar that moves up the beginning of \n     school by eight school days, in great part to allow students \n     more time to prepare for state performance testing.\n       The ISTEP tests have been given in the spring, but \n     beginning in the fall, they will be administered the last \n     week in September and first week of October. With students \n     returning from a three-month vacation, it will be a challenge \n     for teachers to get them up to school speed in time for the \n     tests. The earlier start would buy time for students and \n     teachers.\n       The premise here--that students returning from a long \n     summer vacation are not prepared to take a test--seems just \n     cause for consideration of year-round school, such as the \n     plan that will be tried at Lincoln Elementary School on an \n     experimental basis.\n       In fact, children no longer need a three-month vacation; \n     they no longer need to be off that long to work in the \n     fields.\n       Three months away from school is counterproductive to \n     learning. As a result, valuable learning time is needed each \n     fall to reacquaint children with learning and to refresh what \n     they learned the previous year.\n       The School Board should approve the administration's \n     recommendation for the earlier school start, and then ask \n     itself if the same rationale doesn't justify a serious look \n     at year-round school.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9315-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF FRANK R.

Mr. President, could we get the attention of the \nSenator from Texas?\n  Mr. President, I have to say, if we are going to start playing this \ngame--I have been urging my colleagues to cooperate not 1 day, not 2 \ndays, not a week, not 2 weeks, but ever since the majority leader got \nelected to that position, every day.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of H.R. 3215 which was received from \nthe House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3215) to amend title 18, United States Code, \n     to repeal the provision relating to Federal employees \n     contracting or trading with Indians.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n\n                    trading with indians act repeal\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of this \nlegislation, H.R. 3215, to repeal the Trading with Indians Act. I would \nnote that the Senate has twice approved measures to repeal this 19th \ncentury law--in November 1993, and again last October as part of a bill \nmaking technical corrections in Indian laws.\n  Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking the chairman of the Indian \nAffairs Committee, John McCain, who joined me in sponsoring the Senate \ncompanion bill, S. 199, and who encouraged his committee to incorporate \nit into last year's technical corrections measure. I also want to \ncommend Congressman J.D. Hayworth for championing the legislation in \nthe House on behalf of his native American constituents. Without his \nactive support, it is safe to say that the House would not have acted \non the measure this year.\n  When the Trading with Indians Act was enacted in 1834, it had a very \nlegitimate purpose: to protect native Americans from being unduly \ninfluenced by Federal employees.\n  But, a law that started out with good intentions more than a century \nago has become unnecessary, and even counterproductive, today. It \nestablished an absolute prohibition against commercial trading with \nIndians by employees of the Indian Health Service and Bureau of Indian \nAffairs. The problem is that the prohibition does not merely apply to \nemployees, but to family members as well. It extends to transactions in \nwhich a Federal employee has an interest, either in his or her own \nname, or in the name of another person, including a spouse, where the \nemployee benefits or appears to benefit from such interest.\n  The penalties for violations can be severe: a fine of not more than \n$5,000, or imprisonment of not more than 6 months, or both. The act \nfurther provides that any employee who is found to be in violation \nshould be terminated from Federal employment.\n  This all means that employees could be subject to criminal penalties \nor fired from their jobs, not for any real or perceived wrongdoing on \ntheir part, but merely because they are married to individuals who do \nbusiness on an Indian reservation. The nexus of marriage is enough to \ninvoke penalties. It means, for example, that an Indian Health Service \nemployee whose spouse operates a small business on a reservation could \nbe fined, imprisoned, or fired. It means that a family member could not \napply for a small business loan without jeopardizing the employee's \njob.\n  The legislation before us today will correct that injustice without \nsubjecting native Americans to the kind of\n\n[[Page S9317]]\n\nabuse that prompted enactment of the law 160 years ago. The protection \nthat the Trading with Indians Act originally offered can now be \nprovided under the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Government \nEmployees. The intent here is to provide adequate safeguards against \nconflicts of interest, while not unreasonably denying individuals and \ntheir families the ability to live and work--and create jobs--in their \ncommunities.\n  Both Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala and Interior \nDepartment Assistant Secretary Ada Deer have expressed support for the \nlegislation to repeal the 1834 act. Secretary Shalala, in a letter \ndated November 17, 1993, noted that repeal could improve the ability of \nIHS to recruit and retain medical professional employees in remote \nlocations. It is more difficult for IHS to recruit and retain medical \nprofessionals to work in remote reservation facilities if their spouses \nare prohibited from engaging in business activities with the local \nIndian residents, particularly since employment opportunities for \nspouses are often very limited in these locations.\n  Let me cite one very specific case in which the law has come into \nplay. The case, which surfaced a couple of years ago, involved Ms. \nKaren Arviso, who served as the Navajo area IHS health promotion and \ndisease prevention coordinator. Ms. Arviso was one of those people who \nplayed a particularly critical role during the outbreak of the \nhantavirus in the Navajo area at the time. She put in long hours \ntraveling to communities across the reservation in an effort to educate \npeople about this mysterious disease.\n  Instead of thanks for her dedication and hard work, Ms. Arviso \nreceived a notice that she was to be fired because her husband applied \nfor a small business loan from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The \nTrading with Indians Act would require it. What sense does that make?\n  Mr. President, repeal of the Trading with Indians Act is long \noverdue. I urge the Senate to pass this legislation again today, and \nfinally send it on to the President for his signature.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nH.R. 3215 a bill to repeal certain provisions of laws relating to \ntrading with Indians and to urge its immediate adoption. I am pleased \nto be joined by Senator John Kyl in sponsoring S. 199, the Senate \ncompanion to H.R. 3215 to repeal the Trading with Indians Act.\n  H.R. 3215 would address a longstanding problem in Indian policy. I \nhave worked extensively with my colleagues from Arizona, Senator Kyl \nand Congressman Hayworth, to repeal the Trading with Indians Act. The \nTrading with Indians Act was originally enacted in the 1800's to \nprotect Indians from unscrupulous Indian agents and other Federal \nemployees. The prohibitions in the Trading with Indians Act were \ndesigned to prevent Federal employees from using their positions of \ntrust to engage in private business deals that exploited Indians. These \nprohibitions carried criminal penalties including a fine of up to \n$5,000 and removal from Federal employment. As time has passed, it has \nbecome apparent that the law is doing more harm than good.\n  The Trading With Indians Act has had significant adverse impacts on \nemployee retention in the Indian Health Service [IHS] and the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs [BIA]. The problems stemming from the Trading with \nIndians Act are well-documented. The way that the law is written allows \nfor the conviction of a Federal employee even when the employee is not \ndirectly involved in a business deal with an Indian or an Indian tribe. \nBecause the prohibitions in the Trading with Indians Act apply to the \nspouses of IHS and BIA employees, the adverse impacts are far-reaching. \nFor example, if a spouse of an IHS employee is engaged in a business \nthat is wholly unrelated to the BIA or the IHS and does not transact \nbusiness with the BIA or the IHS, the spouse is still in violation of \nthe Trading with Indians Act. Employee retention in often rural and \neconomically depressed Indian communities is difficult enough without \nthe additional deterrent of an outdated prohibition to force out \nproductive and experienced employees who might otherwise stay. The act \neven prohibits Indians from the same tribe from engaging in business \nagreements or contracts entirely unrelated to the scope of the Federal \nemployee's employment. Because the act applies to agreements between \nall BIA and IHS employees and all Indians regardless of their proximity \nor range of influence, it would prohibit a BIA or IHS employee on the \nNavajo reservation in Arizona from selling his car to a Penobscot \nIndian from Maine.\n  As tribal governments become more sophisticated and more Indian \npeople become better educated and able to adequately protect themselves \nagainst unscrupulous adversaries, the Federal Government must respect \nthese changes by repealing outdated and paternalistic laws which are \nstill on the books. Respect for Indian sovereignty demands that the \nrelics of paternalism fall away as tribal governments expand and grow \ntoward self-reliance and independence. It is clear that although this \nstatute served an admirable purpose in the 1800's, it has become \nanachronistic and should be repealed. The important policies reflected \nin the Trading with Indians Act are now covered by the Standards of \nEthical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch. The Standards of \nEthical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch adequately \nprotects the Indian people and tribes served and provides simple \nguidelines to follow for all Federal employees when it comes to \ncontracts with Indian people and Indian tribes.\n  I would like to express my appreciation for the work of Senator Kyl \nand Congressman Hayworth in the development of this bill and I urge my \ncolleagues to support passage of H.R. 3215. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the statement of Senator Kyl be included in the Record immediately \nfollowing my remarks.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill appear at \nthe appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3215) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9316-4", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 2391\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to announce \na temporary tax victory for small business taxpayers. The IRS has made \na failed attempt to implement new rules for payroll tax deposits. These \nrules would require many employers to make their biweekly payroll tax \ndeposits electronically.\n  On July 12, I authored a letter to Treasury Secretary Rubin and IRS \nCommissioner Margaret Milner Richardson. This letter discussed problems \nthat employers and banks are having in understanding new payroll tax \ndeposit rules and methods.\n  First, my letter asks Secretary Rubin to address specific questions \nposed by employers and their banks. Employers and their banks have a \ngrowing series of questions about the new procedures. Many of these \ncenter around the degree of access that IRS has to bank customers' \naccounts. Second, the letter reminds the Secretary that he has \nauthority under the law to provide some regulatory relief for small \nbusinesses.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 1996.\n     Secretary Robert E. Rubin,\n     Department of the Treasury,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Rubin: This letter is to express our great \n     concern of the impact upon small businesses and their banks \n     of new Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) rules. We hope that you \n     will act in accordance with Congressional intent to ensure \n     that the regulations do not create hardships for small \n     businesses. We also wish that you will answer specific \n     questions posed by our constituents working in the banking \n     industry.\n\n\n                        Small Business Concerns\n\n       Because the current EFT rules create new and significant \n     burdens for small businesses, and because the tax code \n     specifically allows for exceptions from the EFT rules for \n     small businesses, we request that you take immediate action \n     to clarify the necessary exceptions well in advance of the \n     January 1, 1997 effective date.\n       Small employers presently utilize the Federal tax deposit \n     (FTD) coupon system and their local bank to make periodic \n     payroll tax deposits with the Federal government. Internal \n     Revenue Code Section 6302(h) seeks to reduce paperwork by \n     replacing the FTD coupon system with an electronic fund \n     transfer system. However, Congress intended, as set out in \n     section 6302(h) and its legislative history, that the \n     regulations prescribe exemptions and alternatives to the \n     EFT rules for small businesses. To date, these exemptions \n     and alternatives have not been promulgated.\n       As a result, employers and their banks are confused. The \n     current regulations seem to require EFT compliance by all \n     employers that had made employment tax deposits exceeding \n     $50,000 in 1995. In anticipation of the approaching effective \n     date, the Internal Revenue Service has begun the process of \n     educating employers of their new EFT compliance requirements. \n     Nonetheless, small and rural employers know that the Congress \n     intended that they be exempt, and they are eager to see the \n     intended exemptions.\n       In part, the legislative history of the new law prescribes \n     the following.\n\n[[Page S9319]]\n\n       ``The Committee [on Finance] intends that the regulations \n     do not create hardships for small businesses.''\n       ``The provision grants the Secretary considerable \n     flexibility in drafting the regulations and, the Committee \n     [on Finance] urges the Secretary to take into account the \n     needs of small employers, including possible exemptions for \n     the very smallest of businesses from the new electronic \n     transfer system.''\n       Small businesses will suffer unintended hardships if your \n     agency is unable to clarify the exemptions in advance of the \n     effective date. It seems that many small businesses will need \n     their banks to affect these new EFT transactions. Because \n     their banks may view this as a new and different service, \n     those banks may find it necessary to require small businesses \n     to pay added fees. Also, because EFT transactions can involve \n     a new variety of either debit or credit transactions, some \n     small business persons are adverse to allowing the IRS the \n     ability to deduct funds from their business accounts \n     without what some may deem as an adequate ``paper trail''. \n     Employers that do not need to comply should be spared the \n     anxiety of the rule change.\n       Again, since the tax code anticipates exemptions for small \n     and rural businesses, we request that you act promptly to \n     define those exemptions in order to spare these employers the \n     expense and anxiety of attempting to comply. Because employer \n     penalties are involved, and the compliance date is \n     approaching, we think that this requires your immediate \n     attention.\n\n\n                             Bank Concerns\n\n       Small businesses are not the only ones concerned about the \n     pending EFT rules. Although Iowa banks support efforts to \n     modernize our banking system and increase the use of EFT, \n     they have commented on potential problems arising from \n     implementation of these regulations. Since small businesses \n     are not governed by Internal Revenue Service Regulation E \n     (except sole proprietorships), banks question whether proper \n     notice and disclosure requirements will be in place. The \n     following are a list of unanswered questions raised by banks.\n       (1) What degree of access to bank customers' accounts is \n     provided to the Internal Revenue Service? Do the regulations \n     give the Internal Revenue Service open access to a bank \n     customer's account? What protections are in place to guard \n     against unfettered access and use of information in the \n     customer's account?\n       (2) A business may authorize a specific transfer to be made \n     for the purpose of paying depository taxes. However, if \n     penalties are assessed by the Internal Revenue Service, would \n     the bank then have the authority or requirement to withdraw \n     additional monies without the customer's approval from the \n     customer's bank account to pay these penalties?\n       (3) Who is responsible for notifying businesses of \n     transactions involving the bank account?\n       Iowa banks maintain that these are only several of many \n     unanswered questions about the practical applications of the \n     new regulations. Small businesses, banks, and the Internal \n     Revenue Service all have an interest in assuring the proper \n     and appropriate implementation of the regulations. Properly \n     promulgating efficient and effective regulations that do not \n     devastate either small businesses or banks requires \n     cooperation amongst all of the parties concerned. Two of the \n     three interested parties, small businesses and banks, have \n     expressed important and pressing concerns. We believe that \n     these questions and concerns should be addressed before \n     implementing regulations that pose unnecessary or burdensome \n     requirements on small business taxpayers or their banks.\n       Thank you in advance for your prompt and considerate \n     attention to these matters. Because taxpayers in our state \n     are eager to clarify these new rules, and because of the \n     coming effective date of January 1, 1997, we would appreciate \n     your efforts to make your response to us before August 23, \n     1996.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles E. Grassley,\n                                            United States Senator.\n     Greg Ganske,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, Secretary Rubin responded \nby letter that he appreciated my efforts to inform him of the problems, \nand that he was reviewing the matter.\n  Today, IRS Commissioner Margaret Milner Richardson announced that the \nIRS was suspending the 10 percent penalty for 6 months. The IRS had \noriginally intended employers who had deposited $50,000 or more last \nyear to begin to follow the new electronic funds rules by January 1, \n1997. Now, though employers are still encouraged to comply, no penalty \nwill be imposed for failure to change deposit methods until after July \n1, 1997.\n  Mr. President, though only a temporary reprieve, this is a victory \nfor small business employers, and I am proud of my part.\n  I welcome the efforts of Treasury and IRS to make a better second try \nat educating taxpayers. In my view, taxpayers are the consumers of the \nservices provided by Treasury and the IRS. I think that good customer \nservice sometimes includes a good second try.\n  I am also enthusiastic about the potential for Electronic Funds \nTransfers or EFT. For large and medium sized employers, EFT could \nbecome more efficient and cost effective than the present coupon FTD \nsystem. Some small businesses may realize similar economies. Other \nsmall businesses should be allowed alternatives.\n  The Treasury Department has also said that it will soon be responding \nto the questions that were posed in my letter. The response will be in \nthe form of answers to some of the most common questions.\n  Though that response is still forthcoming, I think that the will \nallay some of the fears that employers and banks have posed. In part, \nthe IRS seems to have simply done a poor job in its initial effort at \neducation. However, I am waiting for the official response before \ndetermining how completely or adequately it answers all of my concerns.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9318-7", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9319-S9320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              A BROKEN AGREEMENT ON A JUDICIAL NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, earlier tonight, at the time of our \nlast vote, I was notified that we had an agreement--and let us call it \nkind of a code of honor--that Ann Montgomery, a very fine judge, who \nwill be a great judge on the Federal district court in Minnesota, would \nbe confirmed here tonight in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, for really many, many months now, picking up with \nintensity in the last several months and the last several weeks, I have \nbeen in intensive discussions with the majority leader, whom I think \nhas been operating in very good faith. I felt as if I had received a \nvery firm commitment from him--I believe his word is his bond--that \nwhile there had been some ``soft hold'' put on Judge Montgomery, \nactually at the beginning of this week or by the middle of this week--\nit was to be tonight--we would move her nomination forward.\n  Mr. President, much to my amazement, after we had an agreement with a \nclear understanding that this would happen, at the last second one of \nmy colleagues, the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, objects. And \nwhen the minority leader, Senator Daschle, asks her why, there is no \nresponse at all.\n  Mr. President, let me just say that it is my firm hope that tomorrow \nwe will have this resolved, and if a Senator has a ``soft hold'' on \nJudge Montgomery, then we should--and I certainly hope the majority \nleader will do this. I feel as if he had made the commitment to move \nthis nomination forward. Then let us move this forward for a vote.\n  I did not ask for unanimous consent. If we need to have a vote, I \nwould be pleased to debate with any Senator the merits of this \nnomination. Judge Montgomery has received just outstanding support and \nunbelievable recommendations from across the broadest possible spectrum \nof the legal community; support from myself and support from my \ncolleague, Senator Grams from Minnesota.\n  So, Mr. President, let me just be crystal clear about it. What is so \nunfortunate is that here you have a fine judge who has been waiting to \nbe district judge, has been waiting and waiting and waiting and \nwaiting. I was just, I say to my colleague from Iowa, picking up the \nphone to call her. I had just dialed it to say, ``I want you to know \nthe long wait is over. Tonight will be the night. Tell your family. \nTell your children.''\n  This is outrageous. And I would appreciate it if my colleagues would \nhave the courage to simply defend whatever positions they take, not \njust announce a hold at the last second and then have nothing to say.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that we will resolve this. I believe \nthe majority leader has given me his word. I think his word is good. I \nknow it is good. But\n\n[[Page S9320]]\n\nI have to say to my colleagues, whomever they are--I know it is not the \nSenator from Iowa--if you have a soft hold and you want to keep it \nanonymous, that is one of the procedures that is so outrageous to \npeople in the country. We will just move this forward, and we will have \ndebate, and we will have a vote.\n  Mr. President, I am really disappointed for Judge Montgomery tonight. \nI am absolutely determined that this will be resolved by the end of \nthis week. I will do everything I can as a Senator from Minnesota, will \nuse every bit of knowledge that I know about this process and this \nSenate, and every bit of leverage I have to make sure that this \neminently qualified woman becomes a U.S. district court judge.\n  I hope we can work in the spirit of collegiality. I certainly did not \nsee that tonight.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/31/senate-section/article/S9319-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
