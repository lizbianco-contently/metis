I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise today not only in support of the balanced \nbudget amendment, but also to bring the attention of this body to some \nactivities and some events in this Government that I find very \ndisconcerting.\n  As we look at the budgets of the different organizations and programs \nthis Government sponsors, and is charged to do so, I am concerned about \nthe defense budget. It has been cut far too deeply, far too soon, as we \nhave put too much focus, maybe, on some of the domestic issues and are \ntoo hesitant to look at the future security of this country.\n  The defense budget is constantly being raided for unrelated purposes, \nresearch and development programs are shortchanged, and even the \nprocurement of weapons has been neglected. The cost is a collapse of \nnear-term readiness and, of course, what I fear probably we are moving \ntoward is a hollow force. So far, the administration and the Congress \nhave not been willing to spend enough to maintain a well-prepared \nmilitary force.\n  Defense advisers to President Clinton acknowledge that the Pentagon \nis some $49 billion short of the amount needed to fund their planned \nforce for fiscal years 1996 through 2001. GAO, the General Accounting \nOffice, determined the shortfall was actually $150 billion over that \nsame period.\n   [[Page S3072]] The numbers all point to the same thing--an ill-\ntrained, underequipped, and demoralized U.S. military force.\n  It is time to restore America's military strength and readiness. \nObviously, Congress needs to look at increased funding for the \nmilitary. But it also has to take a look at U.S. defense policy and how \nthose dollars are spent. Congress needs to look at priorities, on how \nit is spent, on what weapons, and where we want this country to be 20 \nyears from now, and we need to force the administration to stick to \nthose policies.\n  The administration needs to examine the number and level of military \ncommitments that U.S. forces undertake. The U.S. Armed Forces right now \nmust have the necessary funds to fulfill the missions that they have \nbeen given.\n  The problem is funds that should be used for readiness have been \ndiverted. That GAO study cites that between fiscal 1990 and 1993, $10.4 \nbillion out of the defense budget was used for such activities as World \nCup Soccer and the Summer Olympics. In the fiscal years 1990 to 1994, \ntotal defense spending fell 25 percent, while nondefense spending rose \n361 percent. So it is time to put some of the priorities on how we \nspend those dollars back into the budget.\n  Just as alarming is the new trend of raiding the Defense Department's \nbudget for ``operations other than war.'' U.S. troops involvement in \nU.N. peacekeeping missions around the world put an immense strain on \nthe already tight defense budget.\n  President Clinton proposed spending $246 billion for defense for \nfiscal year 1996. It is now up to the Congress to take a serious look \nat the U.S. defense policy and come up with a realistic defense budget.\n  After years of cuts in the defense budget and a drawdown of forces, \nwe have to look at where we are, where we should be, and where we want \nto be.\n  So the Defense Department budget has fallen steadily for 10 years \nsince 1985. The procurement amount has fallen 65 percent over the same \nperiod. The reduction of U.S. Armed Forces generally has been too deep \nand, yes, too fast.\n  Over the last 10 years, infrastructure has only been cut 15 percent. \nThat is compared to draconian cuts in weapons and equipment \nprocurement, research and development, and force structure.\n  If the United States had maintained a realistic defense budget, we \nwould not be looking at another round of base closings and \nrealignments. We would have a fully ready and well-equipped military \nforce ready to handle any eventuality.\n  The defense budget has been stretched too thin and now it is our \nbases that will pay the price. Bases around the country, bases \ninstrumental to our national defense, will be scrutinized and possibly \nclosed and given new missions.\n  Malmstrom Air Force Base, in my home State of Montana, is one of \nthose bases that will be looked at in this round of BRAC. Malmstrom is \nan important cog in the base structure and is an integral part of the \ncity of Great Falls, MT, and to the rest of the State.\n  It is too bad that we get mixed up in our priorities regarding this \ndefense budget, and bases such as Malmstrom could be lost in the \nshuffle.\n  Mr. President, with a great deal of concern that I ask my colleagues \nto look closely at our defense policy and where our priorities lie for \nthe Defense Department and the U.S. Armed Forces in this coming fiscal \nyear.\n  Yes, we sit here and debate a balanced budget amendment and we have \nheard all of the-sky-is-falling fears that has come out of this debate. \nIt will still make us set our priorities and reevaluate the mission of \ngovernment and what the role of government really should be, especially \nat the Federal level.\n  I happen to believe the protection of our shores and a strong \nnational defense is very important to the security of this country and, \nyes, those children of the future\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nickles).

Mr. President, I return here to a familiar refrain, a \ntheme revisited, not, as has my good friend from Montana, with regard \nto the balanced budget amendment or base closing. Those are critical \nissues we will face in these next weeks. But there is one that we will \nface that is rather awesome in nature, too, and that is the issue of \nillegal immigration.\n  Mr. President, on January 24 I introduced S. 269, the Immigrant \nControl and Financial Responsibility Act of 1995. At that time I \npresented to my colleagues and to the American people a rather general \noverview of the bill.\n  Today I wish to describe in greater detail one particular part of \nthis legislation--the requirement for a new system to verify \neligibility to work in the United States and to receive benefits under \ncertain government-funded programs of public assistance.\n  Let me speak first about the urgent need for effective enforcement of \nthe current law against knowingly employing aliens in U.S. jobs for \nwhich they are not authorized, and about the simple fact that such law \ncannot ever effectively be enforced without a more reliable system to \nverify work authorization. After explaining clearly why a new system is \nneeded, I will describe to you the provisions of S. 269 which will \nrequire--no, demand--the implementation of such a system.\n\n\n                      need for employer sanctions\n\n  Mr. President, it has been recognized for so many years--I would \nhunch for as long as there has been interest in the issue, and that is \nquite a time--that the primary magnet for most illegal immigrants is \nthe availability of jobs that pay so much better than what is available \nin their home countries. It is also widely recognized that satisfactory \nprevention of illegal border entry is most unlikely to be achieved \nsolely by patrolling the very long U.S. border. That border of the \nUnited States is over 7,000 miles on land and 12,000 miles along what \nis technically called ``coastline.'' Furthermore--and heed this or hear \nit--the real sea border consists of over 80,000 miles of what the \nexperts at the Nautical Charting Division of the National Ocean Service \ncall ``shoreline,'' including the shoreline of the outer coast, \noffshore islands, sounds, bays, and other major inlets. And patrol of \nthe border is, of course, totally inadequate to deal with foreign \nnationals who enter the United States legally--for example, as tourists \nor students--and then choose openly, blatantly to violate the terms of \ntheir visa, by not leaving when their visa expires or by working at \njobs for which they are not authorized.\n  Therefore, every authoritative study I have seen has recommended a \nprovision such as that in the 1986 immigration reform law, making it \nunlawful to employ illegal aliens--those who entered the United States \nillegally and those violating the terms of their visa. These studies \ninclude that of the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee \nPolicy, on which I served over 10 years ago, and the Commission on \nImmigration Reform, now doing such fine and consistent work. They are \ndoing beautiful work under the able chairman, former Congresswoman \nBarbara Jordan.\n  Such studies also recognize that an employer sanctions law cannot \npossibly be effective without a reliable and easy-to-use methods for \nemployers to verify work authorization.\n  Accordingly, the 1986 law instituted an interim verification system. \nThis system was designed to use documents which were then available, \neven though most of them were not resistant to tampering or \ncounterfeiting. Not only that, but it is surprisingly easy and totally \nsimple to obtain genuine documents, including a birth certificate. \nThus, we believed then that the system would most likely need to be \nsignificantly improved. In fact, the law called for ``studies'' of \ntelephone verification systems and counterfeit-resistant Social \nSecurity cards.\n  Unfortunately, the interim system is still in place today, over 8 \nyears later. This is true even though--as many of us feared and which \ncertainly came to pass--there is widespread fraud in its use.\n  [[Page S3073]] As a result, the employer sanctions law has not been \nas effective in deterring illegal immigration as it could be--and \nshould be. In the fiscal year that ended about a month before the 1986 \nlaw passed, apprehensions of illegal aliens had reached the highest \nlevel ever--1.8 million. After the law passed, there was a decline for \n3 years to just over 900,000. But then the level began to rise again. \nThe latest figure available is for the fiscal year that ended in \nSeptember--1.3 million.\n  It is most assuredly disgraceful that, over 8 years after a law was \nenacted making it unlawful to knowingly employ illegal aliens, so many \nare still able to find work, thus still having that powerful incentive \nto violate America's immigration laws in doing so.\n  We must do better. An improved system to verify eligibility to work \nin this country must be implemented--in order that the enforcement tool \nwith the greatest potential to deter illegal entry and visa abuse can \nproduce the benefit that is required.\n  Mr. President, as I said in my introductory statement on the 24th, \n``We must be able to assure the American people that whatever other \ngoals our immigration policy may pursue, its overriding goal is to \nserve the long-term interest of the majority of our citizens.'' It is \nour paramount duty as legislators to serve that singular interest, and \nthat is precisely what the goal of our immigration laws should be.\n  Yet no matter how successful we might be in crafting a set of \nimmigration laws that would--in theory, at least--lead to the most \nlong-term benefit to a majority of U.S. citizens and their descendants, \nsuch benefit will not actually occur if those laws cannot be enforced.\n  Effective enforcement requires effective employer sanctions, and \neffective employer sanctions requires an effective verification system. \nIt is just that simple. Nothing more. And S. 269 is intended above all \nelse to lead to a verification system that has the needed degree of \neffectiveness.\n  S. 269 would require the President to implement a new verification \nsystem--the word is ``implement''--not merely talk about it; not merely \nestablish scores of studies to talk about it and read about it, to do \nit. And it imposes an 8-year deadline for the implementation.\n  The bill does not require that any particular form of verification be \nused, only that it satisfy certain criteria of effectiveness and \nprotection for privacy and civil liberties.\n  It also authorizes separate 3-year demonstration projects in five or \nmore States, so that the design of the final, nationwide system would \nbe based not only on theory, but on what has actually been found to \nwork in practice.\n  The system must reliably verify first, that the person who the \napplicant claims to be is authorized for the work, and second, that the \napplicant actually is this person.\n  If the system requires that a card or other document be presented it \nmust be in a form that is resistant to tampering and counterfeiting.\n  Most importantly, very importantly, the bill explicitly states that \nno such card or other document may be required by any Government entity \nas a ``national ID card,'' and I have been through all that.\n  It is not to be required to be carried on a person. It is not to be \npresented except at the time to verify eligibility to work or to \nreceive benefits under Government-funded programs of public assistance. \nThere is a tremendous fraud in the receipt of Government-funded public \nassistance. We will hold hearings on the issue of SSI fraud, disability \ninsurance fraud.\n  With regard to the Social Security system, people bring their \nrelatives from another country and say they are disabled, they do not \nspeak English, they need the help of our Government, and we, as \nAmericans, generously respond. But that system needs careful attention. \nWe found recently one of the applications for that particular benefit \nhad been filed overseas, so they have figured that one out. They are \nbeginning even to file for assistance from a foreign country, come \nhere, take them to the agency, and say: Here is this person; they \nrequire assistance; they do not speak English; they are not well. And \nthen they are placed in our social support system, our safety nets, the \nones for our U.S. citizens. This is not what the safety net is about.\n  This was part of the reaction of proposition 187 in California. The \ndocument will be used only to enforce certain criminal statutes related \nto fraudulent statements or fraudulent manufacturer or use of \ndocuments.\n  Let me just share this most fascinating picture ID. I did this \nseveral weeks ago, but it is so dazzling that I thought I would do it \nagain. Several months ago, a member of my staff was contacted by a \nperson in California who said, ``Look, just send me Simpson \nbiostatistics, and we will go from there.'' So he just went down--this \nis a dazzling picture of one of the most certainly attractive Members--\noh, no, excuse me. This gentleman here is a very astute, wise-looking \nfellow. This is my California identification card, which expires on my \nbirthday, September 2, in the year 1998. Alan Kooi Simpson. My address, \nI have never heard of. I have never been to Turlock, CA, but the mayor \nhas contacted me and made me an honorary citizen. I appreciated that, \nand I enjoyed the lovely letter. There is an address here of 4850 \nRoyal, Turlock, CA, and included are the correct vital statistics. This \nis not my signature.\n  All right, that was obtained on a street corner in Los Angeles, at \nnight, with $100 bill. It was illegal, of course, but someone else did \nit. My father always taught me, in the practice of law, ``If anyone \ngoes to jail, be sure it is your client.'' Now, it is my Social \nSecurity card. I did block out two of the numbers, but here it actually \nis. This is not my number. This is a counterfeit-resistant so-called \ncard. It has the same material in it, and so I am now in the Social \nSecurity system with somebody else's number. I do not know whose number \nthis is. I am not sharing with you the entire number.\n  Now, that is just a $100 bucker, an overnighter. This document would \nenable me to seek public assistance in California. I could go into any \npublic assistance agency. There is a holographic card, and this is the \ncorrect one. But if you were not careful and you were not looking \ncarefully, you would not notice the holograph in the true card.\n  So this little card which is reproduced here would enable me to get \nsocial support. It would likely even enable me to vote in certain \njurisdictions of California. It would certainly get me a driver's \nlicense, and it would get me into the money stream. Now, that is what \nis happening in your country.\n  It is endemic. Within 500 yards of this building, we can pick up not \nonly these--these are minor documents, they will get a person \nanything--but a person can pick up passports, pick up birth \ncertificates. So we have a cottage industry of fake documents. The \ndocuments then lead into things like Social Security and workmen's \ncompensation, and drain away the systems of the country.\n  So this is what we are up to. We are going to do something with \ndocumentation. We are going to do something to people who provide these \ndocuments. We are going to see that we might use the driver's license \nsystem, the holographic system in the State of California. But we are \ngoing to see that these documents are not easily forged, and those who \ndo forge them and produce fraudulent documents will serve big time in \nthe big place.\n  Now, these are the only uses to which any form of the system might be \nutilized, including one not even relying on the presentation of \ndocuments--for example, a telephone call-in system. We might look into \nthat. That is part of the recommendation. The bill also provides that \nthe privacy and security of any personal information obtained for or \nutilized by the system must be carefully protected. It must be treated \nas highly confidential information, and not made available to any \nperson except as is necessary to the lawful operation of the system.\n  Furthermore, a verification of eligibility to any person may not be \nwithheld or revoked for any reason other than that the person is \nineligible under the applicable law or regulation. The bill explicitly \nprovides all of those protections.\n  So, Mr. President, in concluding, I feel so very strongly that the \ngreatest contribution this current Congress could make toward the \nenforcement of \n[[Page S3074]]  our U.S. immigration laws would be to improve the \neffectiveness of the current law against the knowing employment of \naliens not authorized to work or even to be present in this country. \nThe passing of a bill such as S. 269 would be a monumental step toward \nmaking that contribution.\n  In the coming weeks, I will make additional statements to this body, \ndescribing other provisions of S. 269 and exactly why those provisions \nare important. Hearings will begin at the end of that period in the \nSenate Subcommittee on Immigration, which I chair. And a fine group of \nMembers are on that subcommittee, Democrat and Republican alike. I look \nforward to working with my ranking member, Senator Kennedy. He and I \nhave worked together on immigration issues for 17 years.\n  Hearings will be held. We will consider all other immigration reform \nlegislation from all of my colleagues, comprehensive, bipartisan, as \nwell as specific proposals such as this one for the accuracy of a more \nfraud-resistant system for issuing these documents. We have to look \ninto the one for issuing of birth certificates and matching records. \nCan Senators believe we do not even match birth and death records?\n  I sincerely look forward to hearing the ideas of my fine colleagues \non these issues. Then we will be able to avoid things that are bringing \ndown the system, things that give rise to the power of the force of \nproposition 187.\n  It reminded me of the story of the child who was at the graveyard in \na jurisdiction noted for rather shabby election processes. Pick your \nown State, as you might imagine. The child was crying, and the person \ncame up and said, ``Son, why are you crying?'' And he said, ``I just \nlearned that my dad came back to vote, and I never even saw him.''\n  So we do want to try to avoid that in the future, because people use \nthese cards to vote, to vote themselves largess from the Treasury, to \nthen draw on our resources that we taxpayers--legal taxpayers--provide. \nThat must stop. There is a way to stop it. We propose that. I would \nenjoy working and will enjoy, as I always have, working with all of my \ncolleagues on this most serious issue. We are very dedicated to this \nprocess. I intend to spend a great deal of time and effort in these \nnext months in doing responsible immigration reform--not only illegal \nimmigration, but legal immigration.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA.

Mr. President, last year, Congress spent an enormous \namount of time considering health care reform. After the debate came to \na close, after all the posturing, speeches, and amendments, we failed \nto produce a health care bill. The greatest disappointment of the 103d \nCongress was our failure to enact health care reform. Millions of \nAmericans are without health care, millions more are underinsured, and \ncountless others are only a paycheck away from losing health care \ncoverage. The crisis in our health care system will simply not go away.\n  Thirty-nine million Americans are uninsured. Last year, an additional \n1 million Americans lost health insurance. If we don't enact \nlegislation this Congress, the number of uninsured will continue to \nrise. I commend the Demcratic leader, Senator Daschle for recognizing \nthis dire need and for leading the U.S. Senate into the crafting of \nsome form of health insurance for the people of America.\n  In Hawaii, we have solved the problems of affordability and access. \nHawaii has achieved the American health care dream--near-universal \nhealth care coverage for its citizens at a cost that is 25-30 percent \nbelow the national average. For 20 years, Hawaii has maintained a model \nhealth care system. We have one of the healthiest populations in the \nNation. A study by the Journal of the American Medical Association \nfound that Hawaii has one of the lowest infant mortality rates. Deaths \nfrom chronic health problems such as cancer, heart disease, and lung \ndisease are also among the lowest in the Nation.\n  Nearly everyone in Hawaii has some form of health insurance, so these \nlife threatening conditions are detected earlier, which reduces \npremature death and shortens hospital visits. Because our population \nhas ready access to a primary care physician, we use hospital emergency \nrooms only half as often as other States.\n  There is no reason why the rest of the Nation should settle for \nanything less than what Hawaii enjoys. Americans do not want a Band-Aid \napproach to health care reform. They do not want a medisave program or \na savings account approach to health care. They want real, tangible \nhealth care that gives coverage when they need it. By developing a \nbipartisan consensus, we can take major steps to contain costs, expand \nchoice, and increase access to care.\n  Hawaii has enjoyed its health care program, and we hope that we can \nextend this to the rest of the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/24/senate-section/article/S3074-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3074-S3075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DEFENSE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes this \nmorning to review and comment on action taken this week by the House of \nRepresentatives during consideration of the defense supplemental.\n  I am deeply concerned by the legislation that the House is sending \nus. It is, in my view, deficient in at least three respects.\n  First, it spends too much money. The administration asked for a $2.6 \nbillion in emergency defense spending to pay for operations already \nundertaken in the past in Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Southwest Asia, \nHaiti, and Cuba. The House approved that, but it also added an extra \n$680 million that neither the administration nor the Pentagon \nrequested.\n  Even Defense Secretary Perry has said the Pentagon, and I quote him, \n``has higher priority bills that should be funded first,'' and that the \nPentagon would seek to reallocate money from existing defense funds in \nthe spring to pay some of the $680 million worth of bills that the \nHouse wants to fund immediately. Since there is no urgent need for \nthese unrequested funds, I see no reason to provide them in a \nsupplemental.\n  My first point then, Mr. President, is simply the additional $680 \nmillion should be stricken out when the Appropriations Committee \nconsiders this legislation.\n  Second, I am not yet persuaded--and I sit on the Defense Subcommittee \nof the Appropriations Committee--that all of the $2.6 billion that the \nadministration did ask for ought to be funded necessarily in the \nsupplemental. A supplemental request is supposed to be reserved for \nunexpected and unanticipated exigencies. However, at least some of the \nadministration's request appears to be for normal or routine or \nexpected expenses, like the no-fly zone over Bosnia and Iraq, which has \nbeen underway for years.\n If we are to really reform the budget process, we have to prevent \nagencies from low-balling their initial requests because they believe \nthey can always come back and ask for more later in a supplemental. It \nis kind of a habit that we have gotten into, and I do not think it is a \nparticularly good one. We need to insist that the military, like every \nother agency, submit budget requests sufficient to cover predictable \nexpenses.\n\n  And third, I am concerned about the offsets the House used to pay for \nthis supplemental. Now, I agree that we should offset expenditures \nwhenever \n[[Page S3075]]  possible. Even though this request can be treated as an \nemergency, which would allow the spending to be added to the deficit, \nit makes sense to offset as much as we can. It makes sense to cancel or \ncut programs that are wasteful or lack merit, but I strongly object to \nsome of the cuts that the House made.\n  To begin with, the House of Representatives got about half of its \noffsets from nondefense programs at a time when it is already moving to \nmake deep cuts in domestic programs. We read about them every day now. \nThe House intends to rescind about $17 billion from nondefense spending \nin the next few weeks. The domestic side of the budget is getting \nslaughtered, and I cannot justify taking money from already depleted \ndomestic accounts to pay for defense spending when the defense budget \nis the only one being protected.\n  We ought not cut domestic programs to provide funding for defense \nespecially when we have not examined carefully every Pentagon program. \nWe ought to, to the extent we can, fund this internally, find the \noffsets within the Pentagon's own budget.\n  Mr. President, for many years, the defense budget was protected by a \nwall that prevented the Congress from raiding defense to pay for \nunderfunded domestic programs, and some of the strongest defenders of \nthe so-called budget wall when it protected defense now want to rip it \ndown rather than allow it to protect domestic programs. Members of \nCongress who supported such a wall must recognize that it works both \nways. Just as it kept money from going out of defense to the domestic \nbudget, it should keep funds from being transferred out of domestic and \ninto the defense budget.\n  So I am profoundly bothered by the notion of paying for any of this \ndefense supplemental with cuts in nondefense spending. If offsets are \nnecessary, the Senate ought to examine the Pentagon's budget, make \ntough decisions and cut funding for lower priority defense programs.\n  Now, I think there are plenty of low-priority programs that exist \nthere, but if the Pentagon does not agree then the threat of internal \ncuts might give it an incentive to explore other alternatives, and I \nwill give you an example. One is to have our allies pay their fair \nshare of our costs of being represented in those countries where we \nhelp provide a defense mechanism for them as well as for the world at \nlarge.\n  The bill already contains over $300 million in such contributions. We \ncan and we should get more. That is what happened in the Persian Gulf \nconflict, and that is what ought to happen here now as well.\n  But, Mr. President, if in the end we cannot find enough outside \ncontributions or internal defense cuts to fully pay for this \nsupplemental, then we ought to declare the remainder an emergency as \nthe law allows.\n  Under the rules of the budget process and common sense, we can, if we \nmust, say that emergency spending should be added to the deficit, and \nthat is what the American public does when they face an emergency in \ntheir own lives; when a family member gets sick, they do not deny \nthemselves medical care just because it has to go on a credit card. The \nsame reasoning ought to apply to the Federal Government. And I see no \nreason to insist on fiscal purity in dealing with this supplemental \nespecially when it is already mathematically unbalanced.\n  As Congressman Obey, the ranking member on the House Appropriations \nCommittee, pointed out, the supplemental the House passed is balanced \nonly in terms of budget authority. Now, the distinguished occupant of \nthe chair sits on the Budget Committee with me, and we clearly know the \ndifference between outlays and budget authority.\n  In terms of outlays--the actual money that we spend--this \nsupplemental adds $282 million to the deficit this year and $644 \nmillion to the deficit each year over 5 years. In terms of fiscal \npurity, this bill is already sullied, so that no ideological argument \ncan be properly raised against overtly declaring some of this bill an \nemergency.\n  Mr. President, as the Senate considers the House-passed supplemental, \nI hope we are going to modify it in ways that I have suggested. I think \nit is important that the public be aware of what happens when we rely \non domestic programs to fund some of the Defense Department's needs--\nnot that each should not get its fair consideration. But too often the \nterm ``domestic programs'' obscures the real mission that we undertake. \nWhen we see these days that child nutrition programs are being either \ncut or withdrawn, when we see programs for education in our country, a \nvital part of our development, our competitive opportunities in the \nfuture and to stabilize our society, are being cut, in many ways, Mr. \nPresident, I think the domestic programs offer us as much by way of \ndefense of what we care about in our country as does the military \nbudget.\n  So as we review this, I do not believe the argument that says we are \ngoing to weaken our defenses, we are going to reduce our strength \napplies. We need to build our strength in our domestic programs as well \nas our military programs.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will be able to look at this, modify our \nview on whether or not the House of Representatives supplemental as it \nis being offered is something that we should accept as is. We ought to \nmake the changes we feel are necessary to provide for both major parts \nof our budget.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my comments on health care begin with a \nthank you to the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, for insisting that \nhealth care reform top our legislative agenda in 1995. It would have \nbeen easy for Senator Daschle to ignore an issue that has obviously \ngone from very hot to very cold in the wink of a political eye.\n  In fact, Mr. President, as I was thinking about what it was I was \ngoing to say in response to Senator Daschle's invitation to come here \nthis morning, I thought of a tune that I learned in my childhood. I \nwas, unfortunately, unable to locate the junior Senator from New York, \nwho I am sure would have come here and sung it for me here on the \nfloor, so I will have to resort to reading it instead of singing it. \nBut the song goes:\n\n     Where or where has my little dog gone\n     Oh where oh where can he be\n     With his tail cut short and his ears down long\n     Oh where oh where can he be?\n\n  Where has the health care issue gone? Did all those uninsured \nAmericans get coverage while I was out campaigning for reelection? Did \nthe horror stories cure themselves? Did the market fix the whole darn \nthing? Or did we just grow weary of having to educate the American \npeople on a subject too attractive for even the amateur demagogue to \nresist?\n  Last year, as we struggled against the odds, to hold together a group \nof Republican and Democratic Senators who saw health care reform as \nmoral and economic imperative I said:\n\n       In our hearts, where we are able to understand the need for \n     health care security, and in our heads, where the numbers are \n     calculated, we know the status quo is not acceptable.\n\n  What was true last year is even more true this year. There are still \ntens of millions of Americans who work but who cannot afford to bury \nhealth insurance. There is still forecast a staggering and unaffordable \nincrease in Federal health care spending over the next 10 years. The \nimpressive and unprecedented change in the marketplace while giving us \nhope that costs can be controlled has not altered the need for reform. \nAnd, the horror of job lock, lack of portability, and fear of \nuninsurability are still tormenting millions of our citizens.\n  Unfortunately for these Americans they do not represent a majority, \nor even a powerful enough minority. The majority are comfortably and \ntemporarily able bodied, fully insured, and employed. And, the majority \nhas been led incorrectly to believe that the status quo is just fine.\n  [[Page S3076]] However, the status quo is, in fact, unacceptable, and \nI am encouraged that Senator Daschle, Senator Dole, and other \nRepublican and Democratic Senators continue to work for change. We must \nnot give up this fight.\n  I hope we will have the courage this year to consider more than just \na little change. I am encouraged by many of the things that I have \nheard, again from both Republicans and Democrats, about how we can \nalter our current Federal and our private sector programs. I hope, for \nexample, we will consider changing the way eligibility occurs. Rather \nthan proving that you are poor enough or proving that you are old \nenough or disabled enough or that you work for just the right boss, it \nwould be better in my judgment, more efficient and simpler and fairer \nto simply say that if you can prove that you are an American or a legal \nresident, that is how you become eligible for our system.\n  Once eligibility occurs, however, we must make it clear that all \nAmericans have to contribute, both financially and in a personal way to \ncost controls. Otherwise the system will not work.\n  I hope we will consider changing the rules so that health rather than \nhealth care is the goal of our system. Incentives should be present to \nproviders and patients to become healthier and not sicker. This is \nparticularly true for families with babies. The responsibility for care \nshould not end after 1 day normal delivery.\n  I hope we reform insurance practices so that everyone can purchase \nhealth insurance regardless of health or job status, so that we make it \nmore likely that in the long run we can achieve a system where all \nAmericans are eligible for coverage.\n  I hope we reform the Government health programs, not simply by \ncutting payments to providers but by studying ways to provide more \noptions to beneficiaries and allowing market forces to reduce costs, so \nthat we make it more likely that we can achieve a system where all \nAmericans are eligible for health coverage.\n  I hope we reform the Tax Code so that the self-employed have the same \nincentives as larger companies to purchase health insurance, so that we \nmake it more likely that we can achieve a system where all Americans \nare eligible for health care.\n  I do hope we reform our tort system as well, so the fear of being \nsued does not dominate the relationship between the provider and the \npatient. But above all, I hope we do not forget the stories we all told \nlast year about Americans and businesses who needed a changed system in \norder to have the freedom to pursue their dream without the fear of \nfinancial ruin. I intend to work and support reform that improves the \ncurrent health care situation and makes it more likely that we can \nachieve a system where all Americans are eligible for health care. I am \nconfident that if we continue working on this issue as a priority issue \nwe can pass reform legislation this year that improves the short term \nsituation and that makes it more likely that we can achieve, in the \nlong term, a solution to the problem of access to and the high cost of \nhealth care for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think it is vitally important, when we \nare engaged in debates that we have the facts on legislative issues \nthat come before this body. I am concerned about a statement that was \nmade by President Clinton on Tuesday, February 21, dealing with the \nissue of a regulatory moratorium, a moratorium which is cosponsored by \n35 or 36 Senators.\n  The President stated--and I will quote, ``The House will be voting on \nan across-the-board freeze on all Federal regulations.'' Mr. President, \nthat is not correct. Neither the House bill nor the companion bill in \nthe Senate freeze all Federal regulations. Our bills contain a lot of \nexemptions, so the President's statement is factually incorrect.\n  He said, ``For example, it would stop the Government from allocating \nrights to commercial fishermen.'' That is not true.\n  He said, ``It would stop the Government from authorizing burials at \nArlington Cemetery.'' That is not true. It was not true in the House \nbill, and it is not true in the Senate bill.\n  Mr. President, both bills have exceptions for routine administrative \naction. Certainly burials at Arlington Cemetery are routine \nadministrative actions,\n as well as the Government allocating rights to commercial fishermen. \nThese are routine Government actions. Actually, we have given the \nPresident eight exceptions to the regulatory moratorium. The \nPresident's statement says that it would stop good regulations, bad \nregulations, and in-between regulations--all regulations. Again, that \nis totally, completely factually misleading and inaccurate. I am \nbothered by that.\n\n  I think it is fine to be engaged in the debate, and the President has \nthe option to veto this legislation if he chooses, but when he speaks \nagainst it he has the obligation to the American people and to the \nCongress to give the facts. Clearly, his statements are not accurate. \nThe President even said our moratorium would cancel the duck hunting \nseason. Clearly, again that is not the case. It will not cancel duck \nhunting season. The establishment of a duck hunting season is clearly a \nroutine administrative action.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of all the exceptions that we \nhave in the moratorium legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SEC. 5. EXCEPTIONS.\n\n       (a) Section 3(a) or 4(a), or both, shall not apply to a \n     significant regulatory action if--\n       (1) the head of a Federal agency otherwise authorized to \n     take the action submits a written request to the President, \n     and a copy thereof to the appropriate committees of each \n     house of the Congress;\n       (2) the President finds, in writing, the action is--\n       (A) necessary because of an imminent threat to human health \n     or safety or other emergency;\n       (B) necessary for the enforcement of criminal laws;\n       (C) related to a regulation that has as its principal \n     effect fostering economic growth, repealing, narrowing, or \n     streamlining a rule, regulation, administrative process, or \n     otherwise reducing regulatory burdens;\n       (D) issued with respect to matters relating to military or \n     foreign affairs or international trade agreements;\n       (E) principally related to agency organization, management, \n     or personnel;\n       (F) a routine administrative action, or principally related \n     to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts;\n       (G) requested by an agency that supervises and regulates \n     insured depository institutions, affiliates of such \n     institutions, credit unions, or government sponsored housing \n     enterprises; or\n       (H) limited to interpreting, implementing, or administering \n     the internal revenue laws of the United States; and\n       (3) the Federal agency head publishes the finding and \n     waiver in the Federal Register.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, maybe somebody from the administration \nwill read those exceptions and realize that we have given the President \na great deal of flexibility and opportunity to exempt those regulations \nthat he deems are important or necessary to protect public health and \nsafety.\n  I hope he will reconsider his opposition to this moratorium. I hope \nmy colleagues will support it because I think we have gone to great \nlengths to try to make sure that we would give flexibility where needed \nbut also to stop unnecessary and expensive regulations and give us a \nchance to pass real regulatory reform with cost-benefit analysis to \nmake sure benefits exceed costs.\n  I mention my concerns about the President's statements on the \nregulatory moratorium because he has also made misleading statements in \nregard to the budget and budget items.\n  The President of the United States a couple of days ago mentioned in \nan article that he had trimmed the Federal bureaucracy by 100,000 \nworkers, and cut the deficit by $600 billion in his first 2 years in \noffice.\n   [[Page S3077]] I see similar claims by administration officials \nreported every day in the Washington Post and elsewhere. The public \nassumes these claims are correct.\n  Again, I think it is vitally important that we know the facts. I \nwould like to point out to the President and our colleagues what the \nfacts are. These numbers are also pointed out in a recent Wall Street \nJournal editorial because they check up on the President too. Have we \nreduced Federal employment by 100,000 since the President came into \noffice? No. Since 1993 we have reduced FTE employment by 86,100. It is \nonly if you use the baseline going back to the previous year that you \ncan claim to have reduced it 102,500.\n  However, more importantly, what the President did not say is 63,500 \nof those 86,100 job cuts are in defense.\n  By 1996, projections are that we will reduce FTE employment by \n156,900. Eighty-four percent of those cuts are reductions in defense. \nSix percent are in the Resolution Trust Corporation and FDIC because \nthey have worked through the savings and loan mess. Therefore, 90 \npercent of the President's claims of Federal job cuts comes from \nDefense and RTC. That means we are only cutting about 15,000 in \nnondefense Government agencies.\n  So is the President really cutting the size of the Government? No. \nHas he cut the size of defense? Yes.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial by \nthe Wall Street Journal entitled ``Numbers Game.''\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n                              Numbers Game\n\n       It's the season to cut government, or at least to claim to, \n     so we perked up when we heard President Clinton declare in \n     his State of the Union address that he had cut ``more than \n     100,000 positions from the federal bureaucracy in the last \n     two years alone.''\n       As they say in detective work, interesting--if true. So we \n     decided to pull out the new federal budget to check. What we \n     discovered is that Mr. Clinton isn't lying, but he isn't \n     telling the whole truth either. His speeches need an \n     asterisk.\n       From 1993 to Fiscal Year 1996, the Clinton Administration \n     will in fact have cut the federal government by 157,000 full-\n     time positions. But there's a catch: 131,000 of those \n     positions are civilian Defense jobs. Those cuts reflect the \n     inevitable post-Cold War decline in military spending, not \n     some brave retrenchment in the overall size of government.\n       There's another catch: Of the 26,000 positions to be cut \n     from the non-Defense side of Leviathan, 9,500 come from the \n     Resolution Trust Corp. and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. \n     Those two banking agencies grew like Topsy to manage the \n     savings and loan debacle, but are now cutting back as the \n     bailout ends. The RTC is even supposed to go out of business \n     this year. The bottom line is that over the course of the \n     Clinton presidency, the non-Defense, non-S part of the \n     government will cut a measly 16,500 full-time positions out \n     of some 1.2 million. In essence the domestic government is \n     conducting business as usual.\n       Mr. Clinton also says he's making the federal establishment \n     ``the smallest it has been since John Kennedy was \n     President.'' But again, excluding Defense, total executive \n     branch employment will be 1,181,000 in 1996. Back in 1963, \n     when JFK was President, total non-Defense employment was a \n     mere 861,000. Maybe that should be the 1996 goal for \n     Republican budget-cutters; they could say they got the idea \n     from the President.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. One final comment, the President's statement also claims \nthat he cut the deficit by $600 billion in his first 2 years in office. \nThat sounds very nice. It reminds me of another quote of the President \nduring the State of the Union where he said:\n\n       We cut over a quarter-trillion dollars in spending, more \n     than 300 domestic programs, more than 100,000 positions in \n     Federal bureaucracies in the last 2 years alone.\n\n  Have we cut $1 trillion in spending? That bothers me because I do not \nthink we have seen spending decline.\n  The President's statement said that we cut spending over a quarter-\ntrillion dollars. He said that in the State of the Union Address.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues the facts. In 1992, the last \nyear of the Bush administration, we spent $1.380 trillion. In 1993, we \nspent $1.4 trillion. In 1994, we spent $1.46 trillion. Spending went up \nevery year.\n  I think we too often get into this discussion of baselines, and \npeople get lost and their eyes fog over. Spending has gone up every \nyear. The President says he cut spending from a baseline which is \nprojected to be higher. Did he actually cut spending? Did the President \ncut spending in his first 2 years? Will he cut spending in his first 4 \nyears? Have we seen any spending cuts?\n  The answer according to CBO is no. The President's statement was that \nhe reduced the deficit by $600 billion in his first 2 years of office. \nWhere did that come from?\n  I will show you where it came from. CBO projected in 1993, just when \nPresident Clinton was elected--what they thought deficits would be for \nthe next 6 years. If you add these years together, it totals $1.848 \ntrillion.\n  Two years later, January 1995, CBO projected deficits of $1.287 \ntrillion. You subtract the two and you get a little less than $600 \nbillion. That is why the President said he reduced the deficit by $600 \nbillion.\n  So we know the deficit is less than previously projected, but where \ndid the reduction come from? Did it come from $250 billion in spending \ncuts? No. According to CBO--and these are not Don Nickles' figures, \nthey are CBO figures--if you add up all the tax and fee increases they \ntotal $262 billion. The President deserves credit for that--he did \nenact the largest tax increase in history. Spending reductions total \n$88 billion, and $213 billion in deficit reduction comes from technical \nreestimates, economic reestimates, and debt services.\n  With regard to spending reductions, in 1993 we had no spending \nreductions, we actually spent more than the baseline. In 1994, we had \nno spending reductions, we actually spent $9 billion more than the \nbaseline. In 1995, we are going to have no spending reductions, we \nactually will spend $3 billion more than the baseline. In 1996, 1997, \n1998, it is projected that we are going to go have some spending cuts, \nprimarily from an extension of the freeze on discretionary spending.\n  So the President ends up with a total of $88 billion in spending \ncuts, primarily from the last two years by extending the discretionary \nfreeze. My guess is he probably will not be President for these last 2 \nyears, so that is an easy thing to do--that is, putting the spending \ncuts off until the last 2 years.\n  If you add the first 4 years together, you see more spending \nincreases than you see in spending cuts in his Presidential term. We \nhave spending increases of $9 billion and $4 billion and $3 billion, \nfor a total $16 billion in spending increases, and we are projected \nnext year to have spending cuts of $15 billion.\n  So spending actually went up under President Clinton's first term, if \nwe give him credit for everything in his budget. He has presided over \nno spending cuts whatsoever--not a dime of spending cuts. This is \naccording to CBO.\n  What about the balance of this $600 billion? Well, it is made up of \ntechnical, economic, and other assumptions. These are reestimates \ncaused by lower than expected inflation or unemployment. If you add \nthose things together--and the RTC spending less money than anticipated \nbecause we do not have as many bank failures--the technical number is \n$213 billion.\n  In the first 4 years, we have all tax increases and technical \nchanges. That is all the deficit reduction. I am glad that we have it. \nI am glad that the deficit is not as bad as it was projected to be in \n1993, but it is not because we cut a quarter of a trillion dollars in \nspending, as stated in the President's State of the Union.\n  We have to be factual in these debates. These numbers are taken \ndirectly from the CBO budget books. Why did they have a different \nbaseline in 1993 and 1995? Here is the difference. I will submit this \ntable for the Record so my colleagues can look at it. I do not mean to \nget too technical, but it is important to be factual. When you hear \npeople talk about spending cuts we really need to be factual and give \nthe American people the facts. I know my colleague from New Jersey said \nwe are not cutting defense so much and that we need to keep more money \nin social programs. I respect that position, I just do not agree with \nit. I will include the chart to show what we have done in defense in \nthe last 3 years. We cut defense in 1992 by 5 percent; in 1993 by 3 \npercent; in 1994 by 4 percent; in 1995 by 4 percent. So we have cut \ndefense spending.\n  Mr. President, we have not cut domestic spending. Domestic spending \n[[Page S3078]]  has increased every single year. For the last 3 years, \ndomestic spending has gone up. In 1991, it was 7 percent; in 1992, 10 \npercent; in 1993, 7 percent; in 1994, 5 percent; in 1995, 5 percent. We \nhave mandatory programs exploding in cost. The only spending category \nthat has gone down every year is defense. Programs like the earned \nincome tax credit have been exploding in cost. In 1991, it cost $5 \nbillion; in 1994, it cost $11 billion; in 1997, it is supposed to cost \n$23 billion--almost 5 times what it cost a few years ago.\n  We read in the papers where the IRS is not processing tax returns \nbecause they found that the EITC is just ripe for abuse. People are \nfiling fraudulent claims. The growth rate on the earned income tax \ncredit, for example, was 11 percent in 1991; 55 percent in 1992; 18 \npercent in 1993; 22 percent in 1994; 55 percent in 1995; 18 percent is \nthe projection for 1996. It is just exploding in cost.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Medicaid. People are concerned about Medicaid. Look at \nthe growth rates. In 1990, Medicaid's total cost to the Federal \nGovernment was $41 billion. In 1994, it was $82 billion; it doubled. \nBetween 1990 and 1994, the cost of Medicaid doubled to the Federal \nGovernment, with growth rates of 19 percent, 28 percent, 29 percent, 12 \npercent. It has been exploding in cost.\n  Some people want to keep those costs climbing. That is not \nacceptable. We cannot afford it and the States cannot afford it. So we \nneed to change it. When we reduce that growth rate, I am sure that we \nare going to have people saying that we cannot afford it. We cannot \nafford not to slow the growth rate of a program like that. Food stamps \nin 1990 cost $15 billion, and in 1994 they cost $25 billion. The growth \nrate since 1990 in food stamps went up 17 percent, 25 percent, 21 \npercent, 11 percent. That is not sustainable.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record all of these \ntables on spending.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Civilian FTE Cuts Under Clinton\n\n\n                    compared to ``base year'' levels\n\n       The Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 established \n     a ``base'' level of civilian employment from which the Act's \n     272,900 FTE reduction is to be measured.\n       61% of the workforce cuts through 1994 have come from \n     defense, and by 1996 defense will account for 75% of all \n     workforce cuts.

Mr. President, these are just facts. These are not \naltered, these are not gamed in any way to try and make any particular \npoint, except to show that spending has been exploding. We cannot \ncontinue to increase spending. That is why I believe we have to pass a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. I hope my colleagues \nwill vote for it. I hope my colleagues will pass it. I know it is going \nto force us to make difficult decisions. And if we do not, Congress \nwill unfortunately continue to find excuses not to make the tough \ndecisions, and we will see the deficits continue to climb. I hope we \nwill take the responsible action on Tuesday and pass a constitutional \namendment to make us balance the budget.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank my friend from Arkansas.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/24/senate-section/article/S3076-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, when President Clinton announced a financial \npackage to aid Mexico in its current economic crisis, Speaker Gingrich \nand I announced our support. Mexico was, and is, of vital importance to \nthe United States. In my view, we could not stand by and watch Mexico \nfinancially melt down if there were any realistic chance to help.\n  Earlier this week, an agreement was signed between the United States \nand Mexico, and its full details were released to the public. I have \nanalyzed it, with the help of staff, outside advisers, and other \nSenators. I find it somewhat surprising and, at its core, \ndisappointing. My message should not be misinterpreted--I do want \nUnited States efforts to assist Mexico to work. I hope we can help \nMexico achieve the financial stability that they so desperately need. \nHowever, I must reluctantly point out the shortcomings of the agreement \nreached this week.\n  In my view, the basic mistake Mexico made last year was allowing \nevents to get to the point where the only apparent choice was to \ndevalue the peso. Perhaps the Government believed that a little \ndevaluation would be a good thing.\n  Common sense should have recognized that Mexico's decision to break \nits promise to the Mexican people to keep the peso stable against the \ndollar would precipitate a breech of trust--a stampede to get out of \npesos and into dollars.\n  The Treasury Department needs to be very careful in the use of funds \nfrom the exchange stabilization fund. For example, I am not convinced \nthat thrusting the United States into the middle of a Mexican banking \ncrisis is prudent or necessary.\n  The primary focus of the stabilization plan is not aimed at reversing \nthe fundamental mistake of devaluation--not now and not over time. The \nmeasures described in the agreement to firm up the price of the peso \nseem almost an afterthought. They do not address the problem of \nextinguishing the excess pesos that have been coming off the Mexican \nprinting presses, even as recently as last week. The heart of the \nproblem is restoring confidence in Mexican pledges by moving toward \nrestoring the value of Mexico's currency, and I hope it is not too \nlate. I hope that administration officials will still focus on the main \ntarget: extinguishing pesos and restoring confidence in the Mexican \ncurrency. This should be the first priority, not raising interest \nrates.\n  It appears my concerns are shared by the markets. When it was first \nannounced that the United States would help Mexico, the Mexican stock \nmarket went up and the peso strengthened. Yet when the exact terms of \nthe deal were made public, the peso weakened and the stock market \nresumed its slide.\n  In the coming days and weeks, Congress will examine many issues in \nthe Mexico situation--what advice the administration gave, when \nofficials knew about the devaluation, allegations of conflict of \ninterest, and other issues. I am also working with the administration \nto send a group of Senators to Mexico in the near future to get a \nfirsthand assessment of the situation. A central part of that \nassessment will be looking at whether the administration's proposed \nmedicine will cure the disease.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/24/senate-section/article/S3080-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3080-S3081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             RESPONSE TO ADMINISTRATION'S OIL IMPORT STUDY\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern for a \nlack of response by President Clinton to a recent report by the \nDepartment of Commerce. This report indicates our dependence on oil \nimports poses a threat to national security.\n  This is not a new report; we have heard this before. What is new is \nthe lack of action that has been taken by this administration. In \nresponse to this report, President Clinton has decided not to respond; \nhe has chosen to continue on with the same energy policies that have \nput us at risk.\n  Last year, our country imported more oil than it ever has before. \nDomestic production has fallen and American oil and gas workers are \nlosing jobs. The administration should not ignore this plight.\n  The Commerce Department study has little to say about stripper wells. \nThat troubles me. Nationwide, there are more than 478,000 stripper \nwells. These stripper wells produce more than 1.4 million barrels a \nday. When foreign oil floods this country, the price of oil falls below \nthe cost of operating most stripper wells. That's what has happened in \nthe last quarter of 1993 and the first quarter of 1994.\n  The Commerce Department concedes this saying, ``The impact of low \nprices has been especially severe on small producers operating stripper \nwells'' yet fails to provide a solution. Stripper wells serve an \nimportant role in this country and without them our dependency on \nforeign oil only increases.\n  This administration has ignored the plight of the industry for some \ntime now. Various proposals have been discussed with the President, but \nno action was taken. The failure to recognize the implications to \nnational security as well as to the economy is unacceptable.\n  There is a need to identify opportunities for assistance to the \ndomestic oil and gas industry. For this reason, I have cosponsored \nlegislation with Senator Nickles and Senator Inhofe which will address \nthe needs of this industry. The bill proposes support for \n[[Page S3081]]  production and addresses numerous issues that pose \nunnecessary burdens to the industry.\n  I believe this legislation is necessary to begin the discussion on \nthe status of the domestic oil and gas industry and in light of the \nrecent lack of action by the administration, a review of our Nation's \nenergy policies and approaches.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/24/senate-section/article/S3080-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        NATIONAL ENGINEERS WEEK\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, this week our Nation celebrates National \nEngineers Week. This week is sponsored by a coalition of 64 engineering \nsocieties, corporations, and government agencies. This year the event \nis being chaired by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers \n[AIChE] and Fluor Corp. As chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation Committee, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize the contributions the 1.8 million engineers in our country \nmake to improve the quality of our lives.\n  Mr. President, try to imagine what our lives would be like without \nthe engineering achievements of the 20th century. Imagine a world with \nno television, no airplanes, no computers, no cordless telephones, no \nmiracle drugs, no interstate highway system, no central heating and air \nconditioning, or no communication satellites.\n  Each of these items began only as an idea. Each needed engineers to \ntransform the idea into reality. Engineers are the men and women who \nplan, design, and direct the manufacturing or construction of nearly \nevery human-made element of the world. The very word ``engineer'' comes \nfrom the Latin word ``ingeniare'', which means ``to devise.'' For \ncenturies, engineers have devised things to solve problems.\n  From clothes to communications, medicines to microwave ovens, \ntelevision to transportation, potato chips to microchips, the work of \nengineers touches every aspect of our lives. Engineers turn ideas into \nreality through technology. In the process, engineers make our lives \neasier, healthier, more efficient, and more fun.\n  Mr. President, I am sure several of my colleagues already are aware \nof the significant role engineers play in our society. That is because \nthey are engineers themselves. The Senator from Virginia, Senator \nWarner,  and the senator from Ohio, Senator Glenn, were both trained as \nengineers. They each made significant contributions to the national \nsecurity and leadership of our Nation before serving their country in \nthis body. Both bring technical expertise and a much needed perspective \nto our public policy debates.\n  During National Engineers Week, we should not only look back at the \nachievement of engineers, but also look forward. If we are to maintain \nthe standard of living and leadership role in the world we currently \nenjoy, we must assure a strong emphasis on mathematics and science in \neducation. The quality of our future lies in our ability to attract the \nbest and the brightest young minds to study and pursue careers in \nengineering.\n  Mr. President, I commend the engineers of the Nation, past and \npresent, for their contributions to the well-being of our Nation. I \njoin them in celebrating National Engineers Week.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/24/senate-section/article/S3081-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             THE U.N. CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, on February 16, Ambassador Madeleine \nAlbright signed the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. The \nUnited States joined 175 other countries that have signed and/or \nratified the Convention. The next step would be for the administration \nto send the Convention--and a statement of any reservations and \nunderstandings--to the Senate for our advice and consent.\n  Mr. President, in the past several days, I have received thousands of \ncalls from all over the country in opposition to this Convention. My \noffice has not received one call for it. These contacts have raised \nmany serious problems that need to be examined. They have raised \nquestions about Articles 13, 14, and 15, which grant children the \nfreedom of speech, thought, conscience, religion, association, and \nassembly. Could these articles be interpreted to limit the ability of \nparents to decide for themselves how best to raise their children? \nShould U.S. citizens be subject to some sort of international committee \nthat enforces compliance with Article 28(2) which states: ``State \nParties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that school \ndiscipline is administered in a manner consistent with the child's \nhuman dignity and in conformity with the present Convention''?\n  Under Article VI of the Constitution, Senate ratification of this \ntreaty would make it the supreme law of the land. Would the Convention \nthen supersede Federal and State laws? What would the effect of the \nConvention be on the tenth amendment? Is the Convention merely a \nsymbolic exercise, or will it actually require the United States to \ntake actions? These are sincere questions from sincere people. They \ndeserve answers.\n  Mr. President, I realize the original intent of the Convention was to \nprotect children from such abuses as forced labor and to improve the \nsituation for those children in many parts of the world. No doubt about \nit, many children around the world face unbearable and unacceptable \nconditions every day. And for these children, a properly crafted \ndocument could provide some much needed relief.\n  However, I also believe we in the United States have made significant \nprogress in protecting the rights of the child through Federal, State, \nand local laws. These laws are better equipped to deal with the varying \nchallenges posed by the issue of child rights. If there is one thing \nthis election taught us, it is the need to get excessive government out \nof people's lives. This applies to the Federal government, and it \ncertainly applies to the multilateral, quasi-government that is the \nU.N.\n  I don't know the administration's timeable for sending the Convention \nto the Senate for advice and consent. When submitted, it will be \nreferred to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations--where I am \ncertain it will receive the careful review it deserves. However, until \nall the questions that thousands of Americans have about the Convention \nare satisfactorily answered, I will not support ratification of this \nConvention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/24/senate-section/article/S3081-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL ENGINEERS WEEK\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, February 19-25, 1995 marks National \nEngineers Week, a time when America honors the 1.8 million men and \nwomen who make up our Nation's second largest profession.\n  I commend our Nation's engineers for their contributions to \ntechnology in the private and public sectors. The technological \nbreakthroughs achieved by engineers have enabled people around the \nworld to live healthier, more efficient, and more fulfilling lives. In \nmy home State of Illinois, engineers have provided people with valuable \nscientific innovations in areas such as communications, medicine, and \nagriculture.\n  I would also like to recognize the work of three junior high students \nfrom Central School in Glencoe, IL: Stephanie Richart, Alexandra Wong, \nand Denise Arbruster. These three students were the Chicago-area \nwinners of the National Engineers Week Future City Competition. This \ncompetition asked students to envision a 21st century city, and then \nexpress their ideas through computer printouts, scale models, and oral \npresentations. Many local engineers graciously volunteered their time \nto advise students on their projects. I salute everyone who \nparticipated, and I wish the Central School team well in the national \ncompetition here in Washington.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/24/senate-section/article/S3081-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 1 to the \n     Committee on the Budget with instructions.\n       (7) Nunn amendment No. 299, to permit waiver of the \n     amendment during an economic emergency.\n       (8) Nunn amendment No. 300, to limit judicial review.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from \nOklahoma a question. He mentioned food stamps. The Senator will recall \nthat last year on the Agriculture appropriations bill, we debated the \nissue of allowing the States to experiment with giving food stamp-\neligible recipients cash instead of food stamps. I have taken strong \nexception to that, and I do not mean to demean people who are on food \nstamps. But let us assume that a parent with three children is getting \na couple hundred dollars a month in cash like an SSI check, or Social \nSecurity check, or anything else, and assume they get that check on the \nfirst day of the month and the television repairman, or the television \ncable company man shows up and says, ``I am here to disconnect the \ncable; you are behind 2 months and our rule is we have to disconnect. \nYou owe us $50.'' I have this deep seated suspicion that the cable \ntelevision guy is going to get the $50 and the children are going to \nget what is left.\n  While that passed last year, I am going to do everything I can this \nyear to undo that. It is still a pilot program. Some of the Governors \nlike it because, as you know, if you go to the grocery store and spend \na voucher, you have to pay sales tax on it. If you go to the grocery \nstore and use a food stamp, you do not pay sales tax. So this is worth \nmillions of dollars to States, which are always looking for new \nrevenues--painless revenues, especially.\n  My state has a 5-percent sales tax which also applies to groceries. \nThere are not too many States which still tax food, but mine does. That \nmeans that Arkansans who are getting food stamps will see a 5-percent \nreduction in the amount of food they can provide for their children, \neven if they are careful about spending that money only for food.\n  I was wondering if the Senator had any thoughts about that.\n  Mr. NICKLES. One, I want to say that maybe I should have given the \nnumbers for the projected cost of food stamps. Food stamps grew at zero \npercent in 1994 and will grow at 4 percent for the next couple of \nyears. Maybe some of the reforms the Senator is talking about have been \nsuccessful. I share his concern, though.\n  I think if you want to covert a commodity program to cash it is going \nto be open for abuse. There was an excellent program on one of the \ntelevision networks recently about people selling their food stamps for \ncash so they can use it for various other things, including alcohol and \ndrugs. So I think we need to reform the program. I mentioned that the \nearned income tax credit has really been abused. People are going into \npoor areas and trying to get citizens to file a fraudulent return. They \nwill get a persons social security number and say, ``I can use this to \nget a $1,500 or $2,000 earned income tax credit, I will give you $500 \nnow and let me take your credit.'' That is one of the reasons why the \nIRS is trying to crack down.\n  I think maybe some pilot programs are in order, because there is \nbound to be a better way.\n  But I am concerned, when we start turning it into cash, that you may \nbe increasing the incentives for abuse instead of decreasing the \nincentives.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I appreciate the Senator's comment.\n  As the Senator knows, we are experimenting with a credit card type \nfood stamp program--I am hoping that will be successful--where a \ngrocery store just takes your credit card and they can tell you exactly \nhow much you have left for the month. It can also kick out any \nineligible commodities or groceries you have picked up so that you are \nnot paying for something like cigarettes or toiletries, for examples.\n  The other thing the Senator makes a very good point on is the earned \nincome tax credit. I happen to be a strong proponent of the earned \nincome tax credit. I think it is a very good tool to keep people \nworking, because you have to be working and you have to be a parent \nbefore you qualify for it.\n  But the IRS was in my office just recently telling me that I could \nexpect quite a few calls from constituents about the delay in getting \ntheir tax refunds. And, of course, the papers are now full of that.\n  But one of the reasons it is late is because they are trying to audit \ntwo or three things. One is to make sure people report all the income \nthat they received on 1099 forms. If the Senator, for example, gets a \ngas royalty at the end of the year, the gas company would send you a \n1099 saying we paid you $1,800 this year. So they want to check those \nagainst what you reported. That is very legitimate.\n  But the other thing, which is more time-consuming but in my opinion \nprobably is more rife with fraud, and that is the earned income tax \ncredit. I did not realize until recently that some people really are \nripping the system off.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield for one other comment. \nCongress has now expanded the EITC to people without kids. Eligibility \nhas increased dramatically to where 40-some percent will be eligible in \nthe District of Columbia. I believe the State of Mississippi had 50 \npercent of the persons eligible for earned income tax credits. A lot of \npeople did not know they were eligible, so they are getting help from \nincome tax filers. And it is rampant with abuse.\n  I think we are going to have to make some changes in eligibility to \ntighten up the program, because, a few years ago it cost $5 billion and \nthey project in a couple of years it is going to cost $25 billion. So \nthat is the fastest growing entitlement type program that we have. I \nthink we are going to have to curtail it. I think we are going to have \nto curtail a lot of them. I look forward to working with my friend from \nArkansas.\n\n\n                      Motion to refer, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair in allowing \nus to talk about something other than the pending motion, to which I \nwill now return.\n  Let me, for the benefit of my colleagues, once again describe my \nproposed amendment. As I said last evening, I consider it to be an \nabsolutely ingenious idea. When I first began to think about it, I \nwasn't sure that a legislative fix could cure the problems associated \nwith the balanced budget amendment.\n  Everybody knows that I have consistently been a leader in the Senate \non constitutional amendments. When it comes to people who willy-nilly \nthrow these constitutional amendments around, I belong to the wait-\njust-a-minute club. I revere that document as I revere no other \ndocument, other than the Holy Bible. And the Constitution is our legal \nbible. It is the legal guide that provides people in this country with \nindividual liberties, provides for the general health and welfare of \nthe people of this country and for the common defense. We should not \nput ``willy-nilly'' economic policy or social policy--particularly \nsocial policy that is incapable of being enforced--into this \nmagnificent document known as the U.S. Constitution.\n  People in this country literally put their hands over there hearts \nwhen they hear the Constitution mentioned, almost as though the flag is \ngoing by. And yet the people of this Nation have been led to believe \nthat if we would just put a few words in the Constitution, this nagging \nbudget deficit somehow will be made to disappear. It is deceptive in \nthe extreme.\n  Everybody here who has read the constitutional amendment knows that \nthis amendment does nothing to balance the budget; does very little \nmore than we are doing right now. But there is this reverence for the \nConstitution \n[[Page S3083]]  and the people, subconsciously or consciously, think if \nwe put language in the Constitution we are going to get a balanced \nbudget out of it.\n  But during this entire debate, not one person has told you how. We \ninvited those who believe in the Contract With America that the \nRepublican House Members all strongly favor to tell us.\n  ``How are you going to balance the budget?''\n  ``I don't know.''\n  ``Who has standing to sue under this amendment?''\n  ``I don't know.''\n  ``When will a lawsuit ripen?''\n  ``I don't know.''\n  ``Would I, as a Senator, have standing to sue the Congress if they \ndid not balance the budget?''\n  ``I don't know.''\n  ``Could the courts raise taxes in a lawsuit? Could the Supreme Court \nentertain a lawsuit saying, yes, indeed, Congress is out of compliance \nwith this amendment. It is not in balance. Therefore, we are going to \ngive the Congress 60 days to balance the budget unless 60 percent of \nthe Members of each House vote otherwise.'' Sixty percent is not a \nmajority. It literally defies democracy. But if the Court says, ``60 \npercent of you have to vote to unbalance the budget or we are going to \ntake over the legislative affairs of Congress and raise taxes and cut \nspending ourselves.''\n  What if 60 days have gone by and Congress has done nothing. And the \nCourt says, ``OK, we gave you 60 days. You are still sitting on your \nduff. Therefore, we are going to raise all income taxes by 3 percent \nand we are going to cut spending across the board, including defense, \nby 3 percent. And, according to our calculations, that will balance the \nbudget.''\n  As Lincoln told Chief Justice Taney when Lincoln suspended the right \nof habeas corpus in the State of Maryland, ``He's made his ruling. Let \nhim enforce it.''\n  So under this scenario, assume the Congress says to the Supreme \nCourt, ``We have three branches of Government. You are only one. We are \nnot going to waive the balanced budget requirement with 60 votes \nbecause we can't. We have 41 obstreperous people over there who will \nnot let us unbalance it. In addition, we are not going to raise taxes \nand we are not going to cut spending.''\n  And so the Supreme Court Chief Justice calls the President and says, \n``Mr. President, you are charged with the responsibility of enforcing \nthe laws of this country. Now do it.''\n  And the President says, ``Look, how am I going to enforce the laws of \nthe country? If they refuse to act under the Constitution, I can't make \nCongress do anything. I am on bended knee to the Congress all the time \nanyway trying to get them to pass my bills.''\n  The Court is asking me to alienate 100 Senators by removing them from \noffice or taking some other action against them.'' I do not know what \nthe President would do. What you then have is an unsolvable \nconstitutional crisis that would threaten this Nation as nothing since \nthe Civil War has threatened the country.\n  Sometimes people say to me, ``You do not care what your constituents \nthink; this is very popular.'' I care deeply about what my constituents \nthink. But do you know what I want my constituents to think more than \nanything else? I want them to think they have a Senator up here who is \nthinking, who understands the Constitution, has studied it all of his \nlife, who reads the Federalist Papers and knows what the Framers of the \nConstitution have said on every issue, and who has some idea about what \nwill work in the Constitution and what trivializes the Constitution.\n  A Senator told me 2 days ago, ``I'm going to support the \nconstitutional amendment because I want the courts involved.'' If \nanyone wants the courts involved they should go down to Kansas City and \ntalk to the people down there, where a judge did not literally raise \ntaxes, but he said, ``Here is what you are going to do to achieve \nintegration.'' And in order to do that, the Kansas City school district \nhad no choice but to raise taxes. That decision was affirmed by the \neighth circuit and affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court, and is getting \nready to be reargued next week.\n  Nobody here should suffer under the delusion that the Supreme Court \nwill, as it does in certain cases involving Congress say, ``That is a \npolitical matter and this Court does not resolve political matters; you \npeople get back over there and do your duty.'' It is just as likely \nthat the Court wouldn't say that, as it would.\n  Is it not interesting, the contradictions we have seen in this \nChamber since we started debating the constitutional amendment? The \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana, Bennett Johnston, offered an \namendment which would prohibit the courts from enforcing the balanced \nbudget amendment. When that was defeated he considered offering another \namendment saying the courts must enforce the constitutional amendment. \nAnd I promise, Mr. President, that, too, would have been defeated.\n  The Senator who said he wanted the courts involved in enforcing the \namendment probably should not say that back home. The people in my \nState have a very healthy apprehension about people who are not elected \nto office, such as judges, determining their lives. How many times have \nyou heard, ``I want the Supreme Court to enforce the law, not to make \nlaws.''\n  So what we have is this contradiction here. On the one hand, we have \nsome Senators saying, ``I want the courts to enforce this because we \nwon't,'' and you have a whole chorus of Republicans and Democrats who \nsay, ``I don't want the courts involved in this at all.''\n  I have never heard, in my 20 years in the U.S. Senate, as many \nquestions answered with ``I don't know.'' Cumulatively, I have heard \nmore ``I don't knows'' since this debate started than in the other 20 \nyears combined. Do you know what Norm Ornstein calls these \nconstitutional amendments? The fix of last resort. What he should have \nsaid is the fig leaf of last resort, something to hide behind.\n  Senators say privately, ``Well, we can't do it politically because we \nwill lose all these interest groups. It would be disastrous if we did \nwhat we have to do. So let's put it in the Constitution, and we can \nhide behind that.'' You can put it in the Constitution, but you cannot \nhide.\n  I understand that there is probably only one Republican who will vote \nagainst the balanced budget amendment. While my Republican colleagues \nin the Senate did not sign the Contract With America, they are pushing \nHouse Joint Resolution 1, which passed the House and was included in \nthe contract. If I had signed the contract, I would be praying that the \nDemocrats could muster enough votes to kill this, because it is \ntotally, wholly impossible to enforce.\n  One look at the contract would demonstrate that the Republicans in \nthe House are not serious about balancing the budget. The Contract With \nAmerica and Speaker Gingrich have proposed substantial increases in \ndefense spending and tax cuts for the middle class, defined as people \nwho make as much as $200,000 a year. That is hardly middle class. I do \nnot consider myself middle class. And I do not make that much money. \nBut if I did, I certainly would not consider myself middle class. In \naddition, the Republicans want to cut the capital gains tax, which \nmostly benefits the wealthiest 5 percent of the people in the country. \nWhen we add it all up the contract would cost an additional $471 \nbillion over the next 7 years and more than $700 billion over 10 years.\n  If we were to start right now trying to balance the budget between \nnow and the year 2002--do not increase defense, do not cut taxes, just \nleave the trend line as it is--if we set out right now in the next 7 \nyears to balance the budget, we would have to raise taxes, cut \nspending, or a combination of the two, to the tune of a little more \nthan $1 trillion. If we were to exclude Social Security it would be \napproximately $1.6 trillion.\n  Do you know what that means? That means that we would have to cut \nalmost $250 billion a year for the next 7 years.\n  Senator, you will not get a check for your salary, because it will be \nabolished. The FBI will be abolished; the Justice Department will be \nabolished; judges will be abolished; student loans will be abolished; \nhighways will be abolished; the FAA will be abolished; \n[[Page S3084]]  housing will be abolished. It is unfathomable to me \nthat people can look at you with a straight face and say we will \nbalance the budget by the year 2002, not by cutting $1 trillion between \nnow and then, but after we add a half trillion dollars in tax cuts and \nincreased defense spending.\n  Do you want to know something else? I went home and told my \nconstituents that I would like to cut taxes, but I am not going to vote \nfor a middle-class tax cut. I am not going to vote for the President's \nmiddle-class tax cut, and I am not going to vote for the Contract With \nAmerica's middle-class tax cut. Because I can go home and talk sense to \nthe people in my State, and I have never hesitated to do it.\n  Not to make too fine a self-serving point, but this is the fourth \ntime I have voted against the constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget, and I do not think I have gotten less than 60 percent of the \nvote any time I have run since then. Do you know why? When I say I have \na lot of faith in the American people, I mean it.\n  I told people all over Arkansas that I do not favor term limits. I do \nnot favor the balanced budget amendment, and I do not favor a middle-\nclass tax cut that can only do one thing, and that is exacerbate the \nvery problem we pretend to be dealing with here. If we can find $100 \nbillion in cuts in this budget, for God's sake, we should put it on the \ndeficit. People do not expect miracles.\n  But under my proposed alternative amendment, people say, ``Well, the \ndeficit problem is not subject to a legislative fix.'' They are wrong. \nIt is subject to a legislative fix. Do you know the beauty of this \namendment? Look at those charts. The constitutional amendment calls for \na balanced budget by the year 2002, but leaves this body the discretion \nof not doing anything until the year 2002. My amendment says it \nrequires a balanced budget by the year 2002. And when do we start--now. \nNot 2002--now.\n  I do not like the supermajorities. I do not even like filibusters. I \nhave participated in a few, but I really do not like them. And I do not \nlike the requirement of 60 votes for this and 60 votes for that.\n  If my amendment is adopted and then subsequently the Budget Committee \ncomes back to this floor in April or May with a resolution on the \nbudget that does not reduce the deficit in 1996 from what it is in \n1995, I will raise a point of order, and it is going to require 60 \nvotes in this body to overcome that point of order. Now, if that is not \na fair deal, I never heard of one. My proposal is enforceable; the \nconstitutional amendment is not.\n  The 60-vote requirement, which is included in both the constitutional \namendment and my proposal, is not without problems. Franklin Roosevelt \nwas detested by a lot of fairly wealthy people when he first became \nPresident because he started spending money that the Government had to \nborrow. But do you know what he was borrowing it for? To keep this \ncountry out of the hands of communism, which was a threat. Why? Because \npeople were hungry.\n  I am just barely old enough to remember, but I am a depression child. \nMy mother had saved a $1,000--hen and egg and cream money--and lost \nevery dime of it because the Bank of Charleston went broke, and by the \ntime the receivers got through with it, she did not get one nickel. My \nmother never got over that.\n  We lived in a house which did not have natural gas. We burned coal to \nstay warm. My father was making $75 a month when almost everybody else \nin town was making $21 a month, plus getting a little cheese and beans \nat the courthouse on Saturday afternoon. By today's standards, people \ncannot understand that kind of unspeakable poverty--food lines, food \nlines all over the country--25 to 30 percent of the people in this \ncountry out of work.\n  So what did Roosevelt do? He started building public buildings. The \ngymnasium in which I played high school basketball was built by the WPA \nto create jobs. He built roads. We had nothing but dirt roads, except \nthe main highway that went through town 18 feet wide. Everything else \nwas dirt and mud.\n  We lived a block north of Main Street, and when it rained, you could \nnot get home without getting stuck in the mud. In the summer, every \ntime a car went down the street, the dust was insufferable. It choked \nus to death. The Federal Government loaned us and gave us enough money \nto pave our streets, to give us healthy water where people had died all \nsummer long of typhoid fever before.\n  We eventually got indoor plumbing. My brother and I started taking \nfive baths a day when we had indoor bathrooms. We just did not know \npeople lived like that.\n  We built roads, we built public buildings, we got rural \nelectrification. It saved my father's business. He could sell radios \nand electric ranges and refrigerators to country people because the \nGovernment was spending money; yes, going into debt to try to give \npeople a fighting chance to work their way out of that Depression. \nThere were a few New York bankers who thought it was terrible, but I \ncan tell you, there was not one soul in Charleston, AR, who thought it \nwas terrible. That is the reason Roosevelt carried 46 States in 1936.\n  We are not likely to have a depression of that magnitude in this \ncountry again, but let me ask my colleagues, what do you intend to do \nif we have a 10- to 20-percent unemployment rate?\n  Let us assume further that the deficit is beginning to climb because \npeople are out of work, they are not paying taxes and we are having to \npay unemployment insurance and more welfare payments. Our costs are \ngoing up and our revenues are going down.\n  But let us assume we have 41 New York banker types in the U.S. Senate \nwho say, ``I promised my people I will never vote to unbalance that \nbudget.'' That will be an issue. If we pass this constitutional \namendment, I promise you everybody in this country will be running on \nthe proposition, ``You'll never catch me being a part of those 60 votes \nto unbalance the budget.''\n  So you have 41 people here who are insensitive enough not to care \nwhat happens. What do you do then? You have a country on your hands \nthat is a basket case, that has turned its back on everything we really \nbelieve and that has made this country great. It is a dicey thing we \nare voting on.\n  Let me say to my colleagues--some on this side--those of you who say, \n``Well, the Republicans will just beat us up in 1996. If I vote against \nthis thing and I am up for reelection next year, I can just see it now. \nThere will be millions of dollars spent to defeat me,'' and if we only \nget 34 votes, then all 34 of them will be accused of being the deciding \nvote.\n  I am with Harry Truman, if you cannot take the heat, get out of the \nkitchen. Do not mess with the Constitution because you are up for \nreelection in 1996. The people did not send you here to play games. \nThey sent you here to preserve and protect and defend the Constitution. \nWhen you walked down to the well of the Senate on January 3 and held up \nyour hand, you said: ``I hereby swear that I will defend and uphold and \nprotect and preserve the Constitution of the United States.'' You did \nnot say, ``I am going to vote for every trivial cockamamie idea anybody \ncan come up with because it is popular.\n  You think of it, Mr. President, since 1789 when this country adopted \nthe Constitution, Members of Congress have tried over 11,000 times to \nchange the Constitution. You think of it: 11,000.\n  Take the Bill of Rights out, which is the first 10 amendments. They \nwere adopted the same time the Constitution was. Remove those, and in \n205 years, do you know how many times we have tinkered with the \nConstitution? Eighteen times. That speaks well for both Congress and \nthe people.\n  Prohibition was the one time that we slipped up. I was from a devout \nMethodist family and my mother considered liquor as big a demon as we \never had. As far as I know, neither my mother nor my father ever had a \ndrink in their lives. They hated it.\n  In 1919, I guess it was, the Congress submitted a resolution to the \npeople and said, ``Let's make the 18th amendment a prohibition against \ndrinking.'' I am sure my mother and father supported that. Is it not \nironic that they were killed by a drunken driver? But that is not the \npoint.\n  The point is, we were trying to put a kind of social and religious \npolicy about drinking in the Constitution, and people were going to \ndrink. You can put a constitutional amendment outlawing marijuana and \ncocaine, and \n[[Page S3085]]  people will still use marijuana and cocaine. And so it \nwas with prohibition. So by the time Al Capone had turned this country \ninto an absolute bloody, bullet-ridden country, we decided we made a \nmistake and we repealed it. If you don't consider the two amendments \ndealing with prohibition, actually the people have tinkered with the \nConstitution 16 times, though we have had 11,000 opportunities.\n  Mr. President, I have a tendency to get a little too personal \nsometimes during these debates, but I want to be as dramatic as I can \nbe in sounding the alarm about what we are about to do.\n  In 1993, the President of the United States said, ``I committed \nmyself to the people of this country to reduce the deficit,'' and so \nhe, along with the leaders of the Congress, came up with a dramatic \nproposal to cut $500 billion off the deficit over the next 5 years. We \nadopted that proposal. We said we are going to cut a dollar of spending \nfor every dollar in taxes we increase. And so what did we do? We raised \nthe income tax rate on the wealthiest 1.2 percent of the people and \nraised the gasoline tax by less than 5 cents per gallon and cut \nspending by approximately $250 billion.\n  I consider myself a friend of virtually everybody in this body, \nincluding the people who sit on the other side of the aisle, but we \nstood on this floor for days on end pleading with the people on that \nside of the aisle to help us get the deficit under control. We had to \nbring the Vice President over here to break the tie, and we passed it \n51 to 50. And so the deficit in 1993 was about $40 billion less than it \nwas projected to be. The deficit in 1994 was $100 billion less than it \nhad been projected to be. This year, the deficit will be down again, \nand it ought to come down more.\n  The people do not expect miracles, as I said, but if we reduce the \ndeficit by $10 billion from now until the year 2002, I promise you Wall \nStreet, the bond brokers, and the people in Charleston, AR, will be \nrhapsodic.\n  But, in 1993 we had to reduce the deficit with nothing but Democratic \nvotes. Not one single Republican voted for it. They said, ``Why, you \nare raising taxes.'' We did, on the wealthiest 1.2 percent of the \npeople, and we cut a lot of spending that I did not want to vote for. \nAnd so what happened then? We lost a lot of Members on November 8, \n1994, who had voted for it, and whose opponents said, ``He is a tax and \nspender. He is a liberal tax and spender.''\n  But we passed the deficit reduction bill and the deficit is down \ndramatically because we did it. And what happened after that? They \nsaid, ``Well, that's not good enough. Let's put some words in the \nConstitution.''\n  I say stiffen your spines, colleagues. Let us deal with it. Under my \namendment, if the Budget Committee comes out here with a resolution \nthat does not cut the deficit, I will make a point of order and it will \ntake 60 votes for them to pull that off. If they cannot recruit 60 \nvotes, they have to go back to the drawing board and get the deficit \ndown below what it was the preceding year.\n  I have never seen anything that makes better common sense, more \nimminent common sense than this proposal. Not to coin a phrase but to \nemulate our friend from Texas, it is just that simple.\n  So, colleagues, I plead with you. This could very well be the most \nimportant vote ever cast. I have cast some really important votes in \nthe Senate. In the past, we have always had enough votes to defeat this \nthing. It is going to be close. It may pass. And when the year 2002 \ncomes and the deficit is soaring out of sight, which it certainly is \ngoing to do if this Contract With America is passed, I do not know if \nwe will get the blame for it, but I am sure somehow or other we will.\n  I am willing to accept the blame if my amendment is adopted. But when \nit comes to the Constitution, I ask my colleagues to remember what they \nsaid when they held up their right hand with their left hand on the \nBible. They took a solemn oath to defend this sacred document, and not \ntrivialize it with something that is only going to do what Alexander \nHamilton said will be the most degrading, deteriorating thing to \ndemocracy he could imagine, and that is to raise people's expectations \nbeyond any hope of fulfillment, and make them that much more in the \ndark about what needs to be done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The gallery is advised that there will be no showing of approval or \ndisapproval of actions taken in the Chamber.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let us just be honest about it. We can talk \nabout statutorily saying we are going to balance the budget, as we have \nthe last dozen times here on the floor of the Senate and House. The \nfact is every one of those statutes that passed that people were so \nenthusiastic about and said we are going to balance the budget has been \nignored by subsequently passed legislation.\n  Now, look. There has not been one balanced budget in the last 26 \nyears. In fact, there has only been one in the last 36 years. So all of \nthe ranting and raving that we do around here as Members of the Senate \nand beating our breasts about how we should do it now and balance the \nbudget, that is all just so much guff, and we all know it. There have \nonly been seven balanced budgets in the last 60 years--seven.\n  I remember when my colleague--I just ran into him the other day; I \nwas coming back to Washington and ran into my good friend, Harry Byrd, \nwho brought up the Byrd amendment back in, I believe it was, 1978 or \n1979, that required us to balance the budget by 1980 --required us. We \nall voted for it. It passed overwhelmingly. Boy, we were going to do \nsomething about it. It was almost overturned overnight by a simple \nmajority vote.\n  We all beat ourselves on the breasts saying we are going to balance \nthe budget, we are going to do something about this horrendous spending \nof the U.S. Congress, and then we turned right around and continued \nthis process of the last 26 years where we failed to balance the \nbudget, only we have gone even worse and now we have the President's \nbudget where the President has punted the football. I do not think even \nthe President realized what his budgetary people were doing. But that \nbudget does absolutely nothing, nothing about deficits for the next 12 \nyears. That budget assumes we are going to have $190-billion-plus \ndeficits for each of the next 12 years.\n Under his budget, we will reach $6 trillion in debt in the next 5 \nyears: Business as usual.\n\n  I know Senators are very sincere when they come on this floor and \nsay, ``We should do it now. We have the power to balance the budget \nnow.'' How many times have I heard that over the 19 years that I have \nbeen here? And we have not balanced the budget once in those 19 years, \nbecause any simple statute that follows, by majority vote--we could \nhave 26 vote for it and 25 against it--could overrule the balanced \nbudget requisites that others are talking about.\n  The national debt is now over $4.8 trillion. That is more than \n$18,500 that we owe for every man, woman, and child. And our children \nwho are being born today come into this world $18,500 in debt because \nof what Members of Congress have been doing for the last 60 years \nduring which time we have only balanced the budget seven times, as I \nmentioned.\n  The gross annual interest on the debt exceeds $300 billion. If we did \nnot have to pay that interest--if we did not have to pay that \ninterest--my goodness gracious, we would have enough to balance the \nbudget plus a surplus. That interest payment is right down the drain, \nand we keep talking about how we should do it now. Let me tell my \ncolleagues, once again we are faced with a measure which tries to \nbalance the budget on a mere legislative rule.\n  My friend from Arkansas--and he knows he is my friend and I care for \nhim--I know he is sincere in wanting to do that. His motion which seeks \nto amend the Budget Act to provide for additional grounds for a point \nof order. There would be an objection to resolutions, until the year \n2002, which are not on a glidepath to a balanced budget \n[[Page S3086]]  and, starting in the year 2001, for any budget with a \ndeficit. In short, his amendment seeks to do by legislation what the \nbalanced budget amendment would do constitutionally.\n  If a statutory fix--and I acknowledge he is sincere, I acknowledge \nthat he wants to do this; and I believe he would try to do his best to \ndo this--but if a statutory fix would be enough to balance the budget, \nI would be overjoyed. I am the last person in the world who would want \nto amend the Constitution if it was not absolutely necessary. But \nhistory has shown us repeatedly that statutory attempts to balance the \nbudget just do not work.\n  Look at these, from 1921 right up to 1987. We have had the Budget and \nAccounting Act, a statute that said it was going to balance the budget. \nIt did not work. Look at how the debt just kept going up.\n  The Revenue Act of 1964 just did not work. Any subsequent spending \nproposal that could pass by a majority vote overruled that.\n  The Revenue Act of 1978 just did not work. Any subsequent majority \nvote overruled it.\n  The Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978 demanded that we balance the budget. \nMy gosh, it was overturned by a simple majority vote.\n  The Byrd amendment, which I referred to, back in 1978 to balance the \nbudget was overturned by a simple majority vote.\n  The debt limit increase, 1979 was overturned.\n  The Bretton Woods amendment, again overturned.\n  Codification of title 31, overturned.\n  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings; we all knew it was going to work, did we not? \nIt was a bipartisan amendment, it passed both Houses of Congress. It \ndid not work. It worked for a while--there were a few good things about \nit--but ultimately we just, by a majority vote, overturned it.\n  Then we went to Gramm-Rudman-Hollings II, because we could not meet \nthe goals of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings I. So by a simple majority vote we \noverturned it.\n  History has shown us that statutory attempts, as well-intentioned as \nthe statutory attempt of the distinguished Senator from Arkansas is, \njust do not work. It does not take Congress very long to avail itself \nof the opportunity to create exceptions and loopholes and then finally \nto repeal the law altogether. I see no reason why things would be any \ndifferent with the proposal before us now.\n  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings required points of order. Gramm-Rudman-Hollings \nrequired special votes. The sad history of legislative attempts to \nbalance the budget show the need for a constitutional amendment even \nmore. A constitutional amendment forces us to work for a balanced \nbudget. A statutory approach, no matter how cleverly it is written, is \nultimately going to be overruled because these people want to spend. \nThey want to tax more. They get more credit for spending than they do \nfor conserving around here. They can go home and beat their breasts and \nsay how much they have done for the local folks when in fact everybody \nin the country is doing the same thing.\n  Despite our best statutory efforts in the most recent deficit \nreduction plan, a constitutional amendment is required for at least the \nfollowing reasons:\n  Statutes do not purport to correct the structural bias in favor of \ndeficit spending that would be offset by a constitutional amendment. \nThey just do not do it.\n  Statutes are only intended to deal with a temporary crisis, whereas \nthe constitutional amendment will correct the bias that has caused \ndeficits in 55 of the last 63 budget years or budget cycles.\n  The deficit spending bias is not a problem that has lasted, or will \nlast, only 5 years. It has been going on for 63 years, and it demands a \npermanent constitutional solution. Ultimately, no Congress can bind a \nsucceeding Congress by a simple statute. It is just that simple. Any \nbalanced budget statute can be repealed in whole or in part by the \nsimple expedient of adopting another statute, which is what happened in \nevery one of those cases that I showed you on the chart that I had up \nbefore.\n  Statutory limitations remain effective only as long as no majority \ncoalition forms to overcome such statutory constraints. The virtue of a \nconstitutional amendment is that it can invoke a stronger rule to \novercome this spending bias in the Congress of the United States.\n  Our recent history suggests how much we need the strong rule of a \nconstitutional amendment. Gramm-Rudman was to balance the budget by \n1990. It was undone by a series of statutory amendments, not unlike \nwhat my friend and colleague would like to do here. The 1990 budget \nagreement led to record-setting deficits. And that was the year we were \nsupposed to balance the budget. But it led to record-setting deficits.\n  Under the current budget law, the so-called deficit reduction \npackage, we continue high deficits and increasing deficits after a \nmomentary trough. That is after we increased the taxes the most in \nhistory. Sure, the deficit is going to go down, but it is still almost \n$200 billion. It is bound to go down when you increase taxes like that. \nThey also spent more, too.\n  The CBO puts the 1994 deficit at $203 billion. It projects the fiscal \nyear 2004 deficit will be a record $383 billion, in spite of this so-\ncalled deficit reduction package that the President claims and most of \nmy colleagues on the other side claim that they courageously voted for \n$383 billion. Even the latest proposals, as I have mentioned, even the \nlatest budget from President Clinton seems satisfied with a minimum of \n$200 billion in deficit spending--$200 billion in deficit spending as \nfar as the eye can see, every year from here on in. The status quo is \njust plain unacceptable. That is what this battle is all about.\n  Even aside from the inherent weakness of statutory fixes, I have some \nconcerns about the proposal's substance. Section 1 of the motion \nrequires that future budget resolutions be on a glidepath to a balanced \nbudget with ``appropriate'' levels of revenues, outlays, public debt, \net cetera. But it does not say what appropriate levels really are.\n  What in the world is an appropriate level? If the deficit is a penny \nless than the year before, is that appropriate? I am sure my colleague \nwould say no. But how about a dollar? How about $100? How about \n$10,000? How about $1 billion? The motion does not say. Or how about \n$200 billion, which is what the President's budget deficit will be? Is \nthat appropriate?\n  Even if ``appropriate'' was defined, we could not bind future \nCongresses to lowering the deficit by a certain amount each year. The \nfuture Members of Congress would be able to decide for themselves how \nmuch reduction there should be each year, and where that reduction \nwould come from. If the 106th Congress, for example, does not like what \nwe in 1995 project for the year 2000, they could just change it. That \nis their right. It may be their duty as leaders of the country. But it \nwould be irresponsible to try to set those levels now, since we have no \nidea what the national needs or priorities will be in the future.\n  Mr. President, statutory attempts to balance the budget just do not \nwork. We have a long history of them not working. We need the real \nthing, a constitutional amendment to fix the problem once and for all.\n  Let us go over it one more time: Not one balanced budget in the last \n26 years, only seven in the last 63 years. Our national debt is almost \n$5 trillion. In fact, we are now in the 26th day of this debate from \nthe date that we started. Starting on day 1 our deficit then was around \n$4.8 trillion, this bottom red line. It has now increased until on day \n26 our deficit is now going to be $21,565,440,000. While we have been \ndebating this the country is burning. It is burning up with debt. We \nare fiddling while our country is going down the drain and while our \nchildren's and grandchildren's future is being bartered away and thrown \naway by profligate Congress after profligate Congress.\n  The fact of the matter is just in those 26 days our national debt has \ngone up almost $22 billion. We still have the 27th, the 28th, the 29th, \nand the 30th to go yet. So you can figure that by the time we get \nthrough here we are going to be probably $26 billion or more in debt \nthan we were when we started the debate. All the statutes in \n[[Page S3087]]  the world are not going to help us get over that.\n  The national debt has increased $3.6 trillion since the Senate last \npassed basically the same balanced budget amendment back in 1982; $3.6 \ntrillion. We have had two Gramm-Rudman-Hollings statutes, that were \ntougher than the distinguished Senator's statute here, both of which \nbit the dust. In that time we went up $3.6 trillion since we passed the \nbalanced budget amendment in this body in 1982 with 69-votes, two more \nthan we needed. We need 67 this time. I will settle for 67. If we can \nget 67 votes, we are on the verge of helping to save this country. We \nare on the verge of helping to save this country from going right \nstraight into bankruptcy, or to put in simpler terms, where we monetize \nthe debt by printing more money to pay off the debt with cheap money or \nmoney that is worthless but nevertheless capable of paying off the \ndebt; where we break the whole financial standing of the country in the \nworld. That is what is going to happen if we do not do something about \nit.\n  Since 1982, now 13 years, when we passed a balanced budget amendment \nin the Senate, we had 60 percent in the House but not two-thirds. So \n``Tip'' O'Neill and those who governed the House at that time beat us. \nBut here we have the reverse now. We have the House of Representatives \nfor the first time in history has passed this amendment, their \nbipartisan Democrat-Republican consensus amendment, and now it is here \nin the Senate where we can do something about it.\n  This year, 1994, we spent an average of $11.807 million each day on \ngross interest alone. That is $564,000 each hour $564,000 of every day. \nThat is why we had statutory fixes like this one in place.\n  Just the 26 days since we started this debate has cost us in deficit \nspending almost $22 billion. Where is it going to go? I do not think \nanybody can make a good case that statutes alone are going to solve \nthose problems. All the shouting in the world, all the arguing in the \nworld, all the ingenuity in the world is not going to change that fact. \nBut a simple statute that can be amended by another simple statute \nanytime anybody else wants to spend more and any subsequent Congress \nthat wants to spend more--frankly, the American people are catching on.\n  I think that is why there was a sea change in November of this last \nyear. This sea change where they took people in and elected these 11 \nnew Republican Senators here, every one of whom has participated in \nthis debate and every one of whom will vote for the balanced budget \namendment--they elected them because they now know that there is no \nhope to get spending under control unless we pass this balanced budget \namendment. And another statute that is well thought out, as the \nSenator's may be, another statute, and as well-intentioned as it may be \nthat statute is not going to cut any mustard. It will not fare any \nbetter than the statutes that have been passed in the past which were \ningenious. I supported them. I tried my best to do what I could about \ngetting spending under control. But they failed because subsequent \nCongresses overruled them when the going got tough.\n  With the balanced budget amendment, if the going gets tough, we are \ngoing to have the tough get going and we are going to have to stand up \nand do something about this deficit spending for the first time in the \nlast 63 years. That is what is involved here. We all know it.\n  Next Tuesday we will have an opportunity to vote one way or the \nother. I am hoping that my colleagues will support us. It is a \nbipartisan effort. We only need 15 Democrats. We have 52 Republicans \nout of the 53. We only need 15 Democrats out of their 47. If we get \nthem, we will be on our way to getting this country's fiscal house in \norder. If we do not get them, regardless of how many statutes we pass \nit is going to be Katy bar the door, the same thing that we have had \nfor the last 63 years, a lot of empty promises; or, even if they were \nnot empty, a lot of promises that really were not lived up to. I want \nto see us get out of that system and get into a system where we have to \ndo something about deficit spending and do it now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah for not yet moving to table. I have a \nfew remarks I want to make and then I understand he will move to table.\n  There is not anyone in the Senate for whom I have a higher regard or \na better personal relationship--off the floor--than the Senator from \nUtah. He is unfailingly delightful, courteous, accommodating, and I \nappreciate it very much.\n  Let me start off by saying what I said last evening when I first laid \nthis motion down; that is, I am offended by the fact that there are 100 \nSenators in the U.S. Senate but House Joint Resolution 1, the pending \nconstitutional amendment, was adopted by the House and sent to the \nSenate, and they said do not uncross one ``t'' or undot one ``i''. \nOtherwise, do not send it back to us.\n  Think of the arrogance of debating for almost 4 weeks now an \namendment to the Constitution of the United States, where we are told \nby the majority party, ``We will not accept one single change of one \nword.'' James Madison went to Philadelphia knowing precisely what he \nwanted to do, but he had to contend with the likes of John Adams, \nAlexander Hamilton, John Jay, and George Washington. Can you imagine \nthem in Philadelphia saying that? Let us assume that Washington and \nMadison got together and said: Here it is, boys, put your seal of \napproval on it and let us go home. Why, they fought like saber-toothed \ntigers over every word for 119 days. We are told, in 30 days, that we \nmay not make one single change. And indeed we have voted about 20 \ntimes, and every single amendment that has been offered has been \noffered on this side and summarily shelved, tabled, with not even an \nup-or-down vote.\n  I suppose there have been times when my party was in the majority \nthat maybe we have been that insensitive--but not on the Constitution.\n  The Senator from Utah was not here when I described my amendment \nearlier. So I will try to state it again, because some of the \nassumptions the Senator was making are in error. But before doing that, \nlet me say to the Senator that, before he arrived, I pointed out that \nin 1993 we voted in the U.S. Congress to cut the deficit by $500 \nbillion over the next 5 years--half taxes, half spending cuts. Because \nthe economy is better than we anticipated, there will actually be \ncloser to $600 billion in deficit reduction. Tragically, while the \nAmerican people want us to be bipartisan and they want us to work \ntogether--you can be a Democrat and you can be a Republican, but when \nthe chips are down, you ought to collaborate, you ought to cooperate, \njust like when you declare war.\n  The chart the Senator from Utah has used over the last 26 days points \nout that the deficit has risen $23 billion since Congress began debate \non the constitutional amendment. The Senator fails to make two points \nthough. First, the constitutional amendment requires no action until \n2002. Even if the amendment had passed the Congress and been ratified \nby the States on the first day of the debate, the deficit figures on \nthe Senator's chart would be no different. In addition, the figures on \nthe chart would be closer to $30 billion had it not been for the 1993 \ndeficit reduction package voted for only by Democrats, many of whom \nlost their seats--particularly in the House--because they voted for it \nand were accused of being tax-and-spend liberals when they went home. \nIf it had not been for the courage of 50 Democrats and the Vice \nPresident's tie breaking vote in the Senate, the Senator's chart would \nhave to be much taller. I have never cast a vote that I was prouder of.\n  The Senator from Utah made a statement that we have tried legislative \nremedies before and that is the reason we are here debating the \nConstitution. Let me make a couple of points. First, as far as I know, \nwe have never tried a legislative remedy requiring 60 votes to repeal. \nIf 60 votes to eliminate the constitutional balanced budget requirement \nis enough assurance, no one could argue in good faith that the very \nsame 60 vote requirement to eliminate my proposed statutory requirement \nis insufficient.\n  Second, the constitutional amendment calls for a balanced budget by \nthe \n[[Page S3088]]  year 2002 but does not require Congress to do one \nblessed thing for the next 7 years. The Speaker's Contract With America \nin the House says we will do it all in 2002. They say if the Congress \nwill just adopt this and send it to the States and 38 States approve \nit, we will do it in the year 2002.\n  The thing that makes my amendment so much more preferable is that I \nsay let us not wait until 2002. Start now. Cut the deficit this year \nbelow what it was last year. If Congress had done nothing in 1993, the \ndeficit would be approaching $400 billion. However, we have caused the \ndeficit to decline below $200 billion. Even the President's budget, \nwith which I disagree, calls for $190 billion to $200 billion a year \nbetween now and the turn of the century.\n  My amendment says that the Budget Committee must come out here with a \nbudget resolution that contains a glide path towards a balanced budget. \nIf they do not do that, I will raise a point of order and it will take \n60 votes to overrule the point of order. That is exactly what the \nconstitutional amendment calls for, 60 votes, not a simple majority, \nSenator.\n  The Senator says one of the flaws of my proposed amendment is that it \ndoes not say how much we would have to cut the deficit next year. That \nis true. But my amendment says the same thing the constitutional \namendment says--that they not only must cut the deficit below what it \nwas last year, they have to submit a budget that shows we are going to \nhave it balanced by the year 2002--not wait until 38 States ratify this \ncrazy constitutional amendment. Do it now and it will require 60 votes, \njust like the constitutional amendment. It is absolutely a more \nenforceable amendment than the constitutional amendment because it \nrequires us to do it now. It requires us to start reducing the deficit \nnow, not in 2002.\n  I will tell you what I think. I may have said this earlier. I think I \ndid, but I will say it again. If we reduce the deficit $10 billion or \n$15 billion next year, below what it is this year, the American people \nwill be happy. They know that you cannot cut a trillion dollars in \nspending all at once. If we were to reduce the deficit under my \namendment by $10 billion to $15 billion a year for the next 7 years, \nthat would be half the battle won, and you would not have thrown the \neconomy into a tailspin. Can you believe that we are going to wait?\n  I have never seen a constitutional amendment that people were willing \nto vote for, with a serious look on their face, that says we are not \ngoing to do anything until the year 2002, or at least we are not \nobligated to do anything. The beauty of my amendment is that it tracks \nthe constitutional amendment. It says a three-fifths vote will be \nrequired if we do not reduce the deficit every year and balance it by \nthe year 2002. It does not undercut the Constitution, it protects \nSocial Security, and mandates that we start now. My proposed amendment \nought to get 100 votes in the U.S. Senate, but it will not. People will \nwalk up to the door and up to the manager and say, ``What is our vote \non this?'' Well, they will not have to ask, they know what their vote \nis. They know there has been a motion to table every single amendment. \nWhat kind of democracy is that?\n   What kind of thinking is that?\n  Well, we ought to have the ability in our offices to just push a \nbutton ``no'' or ``yes.'' You do not have to listen to the debate. You \ndo not have to think. Just ask, ``What's our vote?'' What a travesty. \nWhat a trivialization of that sacred document we call the Constitution.\n  I have been sitting in that seat for a long time. I can remember \nwalking up and down this aisle in 1981 during the debate on the Reagan \neconomic proposal to cut taxes and increase spending. President Reagan \ntold the American people that those two, in combination, would balance \nthe budget.\n  I stood right here, as I am standing right now, and I said, ``You \npass this budget, you pass this tax cut and this increase in defense, \nand you are going to create deficits big enough to choke a mule.''\n  And only 11 Senators--11--said no, 89 Senators voted yes.\n  The Senator alluded to what happened over the last several years in \nour efforts to balance the budget. I am telling you that my vote on the \n1993 Deficit Reduction Act was one of the most unpopular votes I ever \ncast. Think how easy it is to vote for tax cuts. If you are looking for \napproval ratings back home, you just put your finger to the wind and \nwhatever is popular that day, vote for it. Eleven Senators said this is \npalpable nonsense. And do you know what it turned out to be? Just $3.6 \ntrillion of palpable nonsense.\n  Did you know that if we had defeated that proposal in 1981, the \nbudget would be much closer to being balanced today? If you exclude the \ninterest payments on the debt accumulated during the Reagan and Bush \nadministrations the deficit today would be just $800,000. Think of \nthat.\n  And there was not any one of those 11 Senators that did not know what \nwas popular. Sure, I knew what was popular. I always know what is \npopular. But I can tell you, what is popular today may be patently \nunpopular tomorrow.\n  You pass this constitutional amendment and say, ``Well, we will do it \nall in the year 2002.'' There is not one soul in this body that does \nnot know that that is absolutely impossible. As Alexander Hamilton \nsaid, ``It raises the cynicism level of the people in this country who \nthink that Congress cannot do anything right. And usually it is because \nCongress has not done anything right.''\n  Again, I plead with my colleagues to support a legislative amendment \nthat has more power and effect than the constitutional amendment and \ndoes not tinker with the Constitution.\n  To repeat a statement I made last night, Robert Goldman, of the \nconservative American Enterprise Institute, said something I could not \nagree with more. ``True conservatives do not muck with the \nConstitution.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as always, I enjoyed listening to my \ndistinguished colleague from Arkansas. I know he is sincere and I know \nhe believes this would be a better way to go. I know he is not a \nsupporter of the balanced budget amendment for reasons that he claims \nto be significant. I think he is wrong.\n  There is no use kidding. This is no different, in real terms, from \nother simple statutes that have been passed. The difference between his \nsolution and mine is his could be easily amended. Let us say he gets 60 \nvotes to amend it. Once it is amended, it is gone.\n  The balanced budget amendment is not gone. It is going to be there to \nmaintain that three-fifths requisite if you want to increase spending. \nIt is going to be there to require that constitutional majority if you \nwant to increase taxes. A constitutional amendment is a stronger rule, \nthere is no question about it, than a mere statute.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Arkansas certainly is a good step \ntoward implementing the balanced budget amendment. And I will be \ninterested in working with him on implementing legislation afterwards, \nand that may be the type of implementing legislation we may want to do. \nBut it is no substitute for the balanced budget amendment. I do not \nthink anybody could argue that, because it can be amended by another \nstatute. It is another well-intentioned but easily avoided, weak \nstatutory rule like all the failed attempts of the past. I do not think \nthere is any question about it.\n  As a matter of fact, his point three, that the constitutional \namendment may or may not be enforceable, everybody knows a \nconstitutional amendment is enforceable at the ballot box. Everybody \nknows that we are sworn to uphold the Constitution. If this \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget becomes law, there will \nbe tremendous force by the public at large to enforce that amendment. \nIt certainly does not trivialize and politicize the Constitution, not \nat all. It was carefully put together, carefully crafted. It was done \nby Democrats and Republicans over a period of at least 15 years--really \n38 years if you really want to start talking about when this started. \nAnd it hardly trivializes and politicizes the Constitution.\n  It says, ``The game's over. No longer are you going to be able to \njust do business as usual, the old way of doing things. You are going \nto have to live up to some new ways of doing things.''\n   [[Page S3089]] And that is, within the Constitution, you are going \nto have to balance the budget by the year 2002 or give a very good \nreason why not--or face the voters at the ballot box. That is hardly \ntrivialization.\n  It raids the Social Security trust fund. I suggest to you that is \nblatantly in error because we are raiding the Social Security trust \nfund as we sit here every day. There is a $70 billion surplus this \nyear, every nickel of which is being borrowed in exchange for a \nTreasury bill.\n  If we keep going into bankruptcy the way we are going, our seniors \nwill be the most hurt of all because their dollars that they get on \nSocial Security are not going to be worth anything. It does not require \nmuch of a knowledge of economics to understand that simple principle. \nIf you spend into bankruptcy, that bankrupt company is not able to do \nmuch good from that point on. Well, in this case, it is going to be the \nbankrupt Government. And if it does pay its debts, it will pay it with \nworthless money that they print over and over.\n  If we want to save Social Security and we want to protect Social \nSecurity and stop the raid, then let us pass the balanced budget \namendment that gets our fiscal house in order so that money is worth \nsomething for those seniors when they come along. Let us stop the raid \nof the Social Security trust fund that is going on right now as we \nsubstitute a piece of paper for $70 billion this year that we are \nspending on deficit spending. Because we are going to be over $200 \nbillion in debt this year, additional debt.\n  These are just the days of debt since we started the debate, just to \nhighlight how much every day we are going in debt as we fiddle about \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  I made the point that if we had passed it back in 1982, we would \nprobably be at a balanced budget today or well on our way to it. But, \ninstead, we spent $3.6 trillion more in debt since 1982 in those 13 \nyears.\n  We did pass it in the Senate. It was the House that killed it then. \nThe House has passed it this year and I hope to high heaven that the \nSenate does not kill it this time. It would just be a tragedy if we \nkilled this balanced budget amendment.\n  It says no requirement for action until the year 2002 at the \nearliest. Give me a break. If we pass this next Tuesday, I think we go \ninto action on implementing legislation right off the bat. It may take \na year but the game is over.\n  Even the President is going to have the leverage for the first time \nsince I have been here, to lead the fight to get to a balanced budget \nwithin 7 years. The President will have to, or he will not stand a \nchance of being reelected in 1996. And we will have to, or we will not \nstand a chance of being reelected.\n  I cannot disagree with the Senator's hypothetical, if we do not \nratify this in the next 7 years, if we assume that. But let me say \nsomething. If this vote gets 67 votes next Tuesday evening, Iowa will \nratify it within a minute after it is voted up. Utah and Idaho almost \nwithin the hour. I talked to Doug Wilder, former Democratic Governor of \nVirginia on his radio show today. He is for it. He said Virginia would \nratify within a matter of days.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Does the Senator favor the Contract With America?\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not know what is in the Contract With America.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me name three elements.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not favor all elements.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Contract With America calls for increased defense \nspending, for a middle-class tax cut, and a capital gains tax cut. In \nall, those three elements would cost, over the next 7 years, $471 \nbillion. If we do nothing and adopt the Contract With America the \ndeficit goes up $471 billion over 7 years and more than $700 billion \nover 10 years.\n  The Senator says he wants to start on this deficit the minute we \nfinish debate on the constitutional amendment, and I want to help him. \nThat is the purpose of my proposed amendment. But how on earth can the \nSenator say to the American people we are going to deal with this thing \nwhile we are spending $471 billion more than we are spending now?\n  I must say, Senator, increased spending on defense and cutting taxes \nand balancing the budget--I heard that $3.5 trillion and 14 years ago.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I think the Senator makes a good point, \nanother point in favor of the balanced budget amendment, because if the \neconomics as the Senator stated are true and correct, the minute this \npasses I think everybody will have to revamp. Everybody will have to \nlook at what we can do to reach that glidepath in the year 2002. The \ngame is over.\n  But the fact of the matter is that game will continue to be played, \nwhether by Democrats or Republicans, until this amendment passes. Say \nthis amendment does not pass, and the Senator was successful in passing \nhis statute, I guarantee this game will continue the way it always has.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. May I ask one more question, and then I will leave the \nfloor. I know the Senator wants to move to table my amendment.\n  Let me ask the Senator this question: Is there one thing in the \nconstitutional amendment, one thing, that requires the Senate to do \nanything between now and the year 2002, dealing with the deficit?\n  Mr. HATCH. Of course, there are a number of things, but two I can \nthink of right off the bat. It requires Members to vote if we are going \nto increase the deficit, or if we are going to increase taxes, as soon \nas this amendment is ratified.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mine requires a 60-vote majority.\n  Mr. HATCH. This constitutional amendment requires a 60-vote majority \nin order to increase the deficit, and the constitutional majority to \nincrease taxes.\n  Let me make this point: The average constitutional amendment has been \nratified within 21 months. This one is not the average amendment. I \nthink it will be ratified within 1 year, and probably 9 months. And \nmaybe shorter than that. Regardless of whether it takes 9 months or 21 \nmonths--and I believe it will be ratified--we will have to go to work.\n  And with the Contract With America, as the distinguished Senator \nsaid, I think everybody here is going to have to revamp.\n  Do I support everything in it? I would like to support much of what \nis in there. I will not be supportive of running the United States more \ninto deficit spending. It is that simple.\n  Let me say another thing that I think is important because of what my \ncolleague, my friend said. These motions to table may have been made by \nme or by Senator Dole, but they have been bipartisan motions to table. \nThis amendment is bipartisan. It is a Democratic-Republican consensus \namendment. There has not been one motion to table that has not been \nsupported by Democrats. I admit, very few, but nevertheless by \nDemocrats.\n  All we are asking on this amendment, we are not asking 47 Democrats \nto vote with us. We are just asking for 15 out of 47. We are asking \nless than one-third of the Democrats. We are getting almost 100 percent \nof the Republicans voting for this.\n  Look, there are some Republicans that share some concerns, and I do \ntoo, about how well this will work. But we have all concluded this is \nthe only thing that we have left to do if we are going to get this \ncountry's spending practices under control and help save the country. \nIt is that simple.\n  I do not think anybody fails to understand the serious import of \nthis. I do not mean to keep my friend any longer. I appreciate that he \nis trying to do something good here. I think this is more appropriate \nfor the implementing legislation, and I will be interested in working \nclosely with him if the constitutional amendment passes to get good \nimplementing legislation that will help us get to that glidepath and \nthat balanced budget by the year 2002. Some of his ideas are excellent \nwith regard to the implementing legislation. It is no substitute for \nthe balanced budget amendment. I do not think any person would conclude \nthat it is.\n  It may be some of these ideas may be very beneficial once we pass the \nbalanced budget amendment, and the game is over, and we start trying \nto \n[[Page S3090]]  implement it by getting to that glidepath vote, that \nglidepath balanced budget in the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, if the Senator does not mind, I would like to move to \ntable this amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No rollcall votes will be called until \nTuesday. This rollcall vote will be Tuesday.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, first of all I want to say, before the \nSenator from Arkansas leaves, that I always thought the U.S. Senate \nought to be about great Senators debating the great issues of the day. \nI think that is exactly what we have here today. It is an education and \na privilege to be a part of such a debate with such distinguished \nSenators, the Senator from Utah, and the Senator from my neighboring \nState of Arkansas who I have admired for so long. He is not only, \nprobably, the most eloquent Member of the Senate but one of the most \neloquent people in the country. I think it probably has something to do \nwith the Senator having been a country lawyer at one time. I appreciate \nhim and his observations.\n  I respectfully disagree with his conclusions. I, like the Senator \nfrom Utah, believe that if we were amenable to solving this problem \nwith legislation it would have been done some time ago. Some Members do \nhave concerns about the way we approach these matters. Most Members do \nnot tread easily into these constitutional waters. This is a very \nserious matter.\n  The Framers set the Congress up in a situation where we could, from \ntime to time, revisit our basic document. Thomas Jefferson, who is \nquoted a lot in these proceedings himself, said that he thought every \n20 years or so we ought to perhaps get together and reinvent ourselves.\n  We are not trying to do that, but we are about serious business. And \nwe are doing it by means of a constitutional amendment because we have \ntried everything else and failed. We are struggling for a solution. We \nare struggling for a solution to an impending economic crisis in this \ncountry. That is what it is about.\n  After all of the statements have been made and all the concerns and \nobjections have been raised, that is what it gets down to. Surely, \nalthough we disagree on the solutions, we can all agree on what we are \nfaced with. The assumption, the moral commitment to the next \ngeneration, was in force in this country for a couple of centuries. \nThat is changed now. That is changed.\n  The situation is apparent. The need for firm action is clear. I \nbelieve a constitutional amendment is the only thing, and perhaps the \nlast clear chance we have, in this generation of doing something to \navert the pending economic catastrophe that all people of good faith \nmust conclude that we are headed toward in this country.\n  What is the problem? The Federal Government has run deficits in 33 of \nthe last 34 years. It has run a deficit every single year for the past \n25 years--for an entire generation, Mr. President. It took our Nation \nover 205 years, from 1776 to 1981, to reach a $1 trillion national \ndebt. It took only 11 years to reach $4 trillion, and on the last day \nof 1994, the total Federal debt stood at $4.8 trillion.\n  Deficit financing is clearly harmful and unfair to future \ngenerations. Each year that we endure another $200 billion deficit, it \nwill cost the average child just over $5,000 in extra taxes over his \nworking lifetime just to pay the interest costs.\n  The fiscal year 1995 interest payments on the national debt are \nexpected to be in excess of $300 billion--$310.9 billion. These \ninterest payments are the second largest item in the budget, 20 percent \nof all Federal spending; they represent 92 percent of Social Security \npayments, 52 percent of all individual income tax revenues--interest on \nthe debt.\n  The national debt has now topped $4.7 trillion. The Federal \nGovernment has run deficits in 56 of the last 64 years, and 33, as I \nsaid, of the last 34.\n  During the 1960's, deficits averaged $6 billion per year. During the \n1990's, deficits averaged $248 billion per year. The President just \nsubmitted another budget. It looks like a $200 billion deficit--as they \nused to say, as far as the eye can see.\n  Everyone who has taken an objective look at the situation that is \nfacing us and the situation that is facing children yet unborn in this \ncountry, basically all reach the same conclusion. We can argue over the \nextent or the exact year when the catastrophe is going to hit. But I do \nnot reasonably see how we can disagree over the basic conclusion.\n  The Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform submitted a \nreport last August. As you know, Mr. President, this was headed up by \ntwo distinguished Senators, one Republican and one Democrat. Senator \nDanforth is no longer serving, but Senator Kerrey still is. These are \ntwo very well-respected, thoughtful men in this area.\n  Their report conclusion was very simple, very startling. They have \ncertain recommendations, and we can agree or disagree with various \nitems in their recommendations, as I am sure we will, but they state \nthe following:\n\n       America is at a fiscal crossroads.\n\n  They state:\n\n       If we fail to act, we threaten the financial future of our \n     children and of our Nation.\n       If this country does not respond, Americans 10, 15, and 20 \n     years from now will ask why we had so little foresight.\n\n  They go on to point out that in the year 2012, unless appropriate \npolicy changes are made in the interim, projected outlays for \nentitlements and interest on the national debt will consume all tax \nrevenues collected by the Federal Government. Projected outlays for \nentitlements and interest alone--those two items alone--will consume \nall the tax revenues that we have in this country. That is in 2012. We \ntalk about the next generation; that is not even the next generation. \nThat is practically upon us.\n  The Concord Coalition. Many people in this body are familiar with the \nwork of the Concord Coalition. It is headed up by two former \ndistinguished Senators, Senator Rudman of New Hampshire, and Senator \nTsongas of Massachusetts; another Democrat, another Republican, \nbipartisan. And again, they have a way to balance the budget that will \nresult in a zero deficit by the year 2000.\n  There has been a lot of talk in this body about what are the details \nof your plan; let us see your budget, let us see the details. There are \nenough plans and details and suggestions as to how to balance the \nbudget to fill this room. We are not lacking for plans and details; we \nare lacking for the willpower. Here is what they say will happen if we \ndo nothing:\n\n       If we ignore our mounting debt, if we just wish it would go \n     away and do nothing about it, it will grow and grow like a \n     cancer that will eventually overwhelm our economy and our \n     society. The interest we owe on the debt will skyrocket. We \n     will continue our vicious cycle of having to raise taxes and \n     cut spending and borrow more and more to pay interest upon \n     interest. Our productivity growth will remain stagnant, more \n     of our workers will have to settle for low-paying jobs, and \n     our economy will continue its anemic growth. America will \n     decline as a world power.\n\n  Mr. President, how much more stark can the picture be made? How much \nclearer can the impending crisis that we face in this country be made?\n  This is the reason many, I believe, in this body ran for the U.S. \nSenate and wanted to become a Member of this body. I am among 11 new \nMembers of this body, and I think to a person that we will say that \nthis is one of the reasons we wanted to be here, because as we were \ncoming in, we heard, like Senator Danforth, who I mentioned awhile \nago--I read something very startling in the middle of the campaign when \nhe was talking about his leaving. He said he left with a certain amount \nof sadness because he thought there was really an underlying feeling \nthat the entire body, that the Senate as a body and that the Congress \nas an institution, was really doing something shameful to the next \ngeneration. He regretted the fact, despite all his efforts, he could \nnot do more to alleviate that.\n  That is a feeling many of us have had over the years, those who have \nnot been involved in elected office before. But as we watch this, as \nour grandchildren start coming along, as we see these statistics, as we \nsee these bipartisan commissions and these committees and all of the \nobjective economists \n[[Page S3091]]  who analyze this problem--Pete Peterson wrote a recent \nbook, ``Facing Up,'' a former distinguished Secretary of Commerce, some \nyears ago. He has his own plan, his own proposal. But the most \nimportant part was the analysis of the problem and the impending \ndisaster; that if we did not change our way of doing business in this \ncountry, if we did not face up to what was happening, if we did not get \naway from momentary political considerations about how this is going to \nplay back home, or is some favorite constituent going to get trimmed a \nlittle bit if we have to cut his program back, and how is that going to \nwork in the next election cycle, if we do not get away from that kind \nof thinking that has dominated this town and this body for so long, we \nare never going to solve the problem.\n  There have been many distinguished Members of the U.S. Congress, on \nboth sides of the aisles, in both bodies, who have worked hard to try \nto do something about this. But it has not been enough. Everyone I hear \nspeak on the subject talks about how they have stood tall, how they \nhave fought against the other party. It is always the other party's \nfault. The President of one party, Congress of another party, each side \nwants to say it is the other one's fault.\n  The President does not appropriate the money, but he is the leader, \nand Congress is not the President, but they spend the money. Regardless \nof all that, regardless of whose fault it is, everyone says that they \nstood tall, they did the right thing. I do not know where the problem \nlies, because there obviously have not been enough people over a period \nof time who have been willing to do the right thing and do the obvious \nthing.\n  This is not just a matter of balancing a budget. We could balance the \nbudget next year and we would still have a tremendous problem, because \nthe underlying factors which cause us to continually want to have our \ncake and eat it, too, would be there, and without a constitutional \namendment, it would still get us in the end. We are going to have to do \nso much for so long in this country to get back on the straight and \nnarrow. We cannot do it overnight; we cannot do it with one Congress; \nwe cannot do it with one Senate. Before we solve this problem, probably \nmost of the people in this body will not be here any longer.\n  We are going to have to do it with some structural changes that will \ntake care of the changes that we have in terms of faces and \npersonalities that walk these Halls around here, because we are going \nto have to do a lot of good over a fairly long period of time and we \nhave a structural situation that will force us to do the right thing as \nwe go on out. This is not a one-time problem. We talk in terms of \nbalancing the budget, and we could balance it right quick, but if those \nmotivations were wrong and the short-term political considerations took \nover once again, we would be right back into the problem in short \norder.\n  We have debated this amendment for many days. It has been debated \nbefore. I have not had the benefit as a Member of that debate. Some of \nthe Members who oppose the constitutional amendment say that we are \ngoing too fast; this is supposed to be a deliberative body and that we \nare going too fast.\n  I for one think we ought to take our time when we are dealing with \nissues like this. Frankly, I do not understand why it takes so long to \npass a bill dealing with congressional accountability. I do not \nunderstand why it takes so long to pass a bill dealing with lifting \nunfunded mandates and things of that nature, things, once we get down \nto a vote, that pass in overwhelming numbers. I do not understand why \nit needs to take that long.\n  However, we are dealing with maybe the most important issue that will \nface some of us in our career here in this body and here in this town, \nand I for one would join my colleagues on the other side who say we \nought to take our time on this. I think we have taken our time and we \nhave debated the issue. But it is not just this time. It is not just \nthese last 20-some-odd days we have been considering this amendment. \nThe records indicate that the Senate Committees on the Judiciary have \nconducted hearings on the balanced budget amendment on at least 22 days \nextending back to the 84th Congress as well as reporting seven \ndifferent joint resolutions between the 97th and the 103d Congresses.\n  So it is not like we just took this up and we are dealing with it \nlightly. This has been debated fully, fully, this session of Congress, \nand it has been debated in committee and in the Chamber on many \noccasions before. So, no, I do not think we are moving too fast.\n  Others raise the point that they do not want the courts overly \ninvolved in this process. They are concerned that the courts might wind \nup requiring us to balance the budget if we ignore the Constitution. \nThere has been a lot of debate as to what the courts will likely do or \nnot do and is there a possibility what the courts might do.\n  Mr. President, nobody in this body has any idea what the Court is \ngoing to do. I do not think anybody can predict. And I think that \neverybody would have to acknowledge a very wide range of possibilities \nas to what the Court could do. I think you can talk in terms of what \nthe Court is likely to do, when you look at the dicta of Court \ndecisions that have come down regarding State laws, when you look at \nthe history involving the branches of Government and the reluctance of \nthe Supreme Court to overly involve itself in the details of Congress, \nor overly involve itself in the details of the Presidency for that \nmatter.\n  I remember as a young staff member on the Watergate Committee, as \nminority counsel in the Watergate Committee back in the 1970's when we \nhad United States versus Nixon and the President had to finally turn \nover his tapes, something that probably all of us remember.\n  People remember that the Court required him to turn over the tapes, \nbut people do not often remember the high degree of proof that was \ntaken, or the very unusual circumstances that were present in that \nsituation before the Court would reach that conclusion. The Court was \nvery reluctant to tell the President of the United States that he had \nto turn over his tapes, and it only did so because some direct \nwitnesses had come forward with direct testimony concerning alleged \ncriminal activity.\n  The Court went out of its way, strained to point out that the bar was \nvery high for anyone who wanted to come in and require the Supreme \nCourt to go into the Oval Office of the President and require the \nPresident to turn over documents in his office, or in that case tapes.\n  (Mr. THOMAS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Certainly, that is not directly analogous, but I think \nit is significant. And looking at the history of the Court and their \nreluctance to get into the detailed workings of the other branches of \nGovernment, I personally do not think it is very likely the Supreme \nCourt of the United States would want to be establishing a budget for \nthe U.S. Congress.\n  Is it possible? It might be. But I submit, Mr. President, that as we \nget down into the details of these things, it must be argued and \nthrashed out to make sure we are not overlooking something obvious that \nwe keep in mind what we are about here. Are we willing to risk maybe a \ncourt doing something that we would rather it not do, which we could \nrectify again and come back and address again if that was ever the \ncase, in light of the fact that we are facing the impending bankruptcy \nof the next generation? Should we be arguing about how many angels can \ndance on the head of a pin? Should we be fiddling while Rome and the \nrest of the Nation is burning simply because the flames are not high \nenough for us to fully see yet? I do not think so.\n  So, yes, let us debate what the courts might do with this amendment \nsometime down in the future, but let us not get caught up and that to \nbe determinative when we are facing an economic disaster somewhere down \nthe road not very long if we do not change our way of doing business in \nthis particular town and in this country.\n  The Senator from West Virginia the other day was talking about \nsection 5 of the constitutional amendment. He was concerned that in \ntimes of a declaration of war the amendment requires a constitutional \nmajority of 51 Senators. He thought that hurdle was too high because \nnormally without the amendment on most votes around here it is a \nmajority of those present with \n[[Page S3092]]  the Vice President casting a tie-breaking vote if \ncalled upon.\n  As I listened to that debate, it is very interesting, the \npossibilities are intriguing from an intellectual standpoint. Sitting \nand listening to Senator Byrd of West Virginia is like sitting in a \ngood class of constitutional law. I enjoy it. If we did not have a \nSenator Byrd, we would need to invent one because he brings issues to \nthe floor and to the table that need to be discussed. But again, does \nthis not assume that 50 Senators plus the Vice President would do the \nright thing? He is concerned that we might not get that vote.\n  Here we are, we need to declare war and we might not get the 51 \nvotes. So he assumes, I suppose, that 50 Senators plus the Vice \nPresident would do the right thing and we would get the 51 votes that \nway but under this amendment that 51 Senators would not do the right \nthing.\n  Now, is that not slicing it a little thin in light of what we are \ndealing with here? Is that not belaboring the point? It needs to be \ndiscussed. But is that what this is going to turn on, whether or not we \nhave 50 Senators plus a Vice President on the one hand or 51 Senators \non the other?\n  I must say, Mr. President, it is my opinion that there are enough \ngood people in this Chamber that if we have the kind of situation that \nrequires a declaration of war, we would do the right thing, that we \nwould do the right thing when the circumstances arose.\n  I have listened to arguments, very eloquent arguments by the Senator \nfrom New York [Mr. Moynihan]. And again it is like sitting in a very \ngood classroom to listen to him and his sense of history and the \nvarious parts of history that he has had a part of. He makes some very \ngood points. He points out that the balanced budget amendment deprives \nthe Government of some flexibility.\n  Well, indeed, it does. That is what it is about. It deprives the U.S. \nCongress of some flexibility. It deprives the President of the United \nStates of some flexibility. It says in effect no longer business as \nusual. We are going to do things a little bit differently, and it is \ngoing to be kind of painful and maybe we are going to have put a \nstraitjacket on you, but it is the right thing.\n  That is what it is about. But he makes the further point that it \ndeprives us of the ability to, as I would interpret, fine tune the \neconomy; that, in slow economic times, under good Keynesian theory we \nneed to stimulate the economy and stimulate spending and offset that \nand thereby bring us back into recovery.\n  It occurs to me that proposition and that concern is based upon \ncertain assumptions. No, 1, it assumes that the U.S. Congress or the \nPresident has the ability to foresee far enough in advance what the \neconomic situation is going to be and that they have the ability to \nadopt measures far enough in advance to take effect and to meet those \nemerging conditions somewhere down the road so that they would have the \nproper effect. In fact, that is the second assumption--that these \npolicies, this foresight, would result in not only policies but \npolicies that would have the desired effect.\n  In other words, we are able to pretty much fine tune the economy. We \ncan see what is going to happen and we can basically spend the money \nnecessary--that is what we are talking about--in order to offset it. It \nfurther assumes that this all has to do with fiscal policy and not \nmonetary policy. We all know that the Federal Reserve has the ability \nto raise and lower interest rates, and we all know, certainly, that has \nits effects on the economy. But as I understand the argument, we put \nthat aside, really, and concentrate on the fiscal side, on how much the \nGovernment can spend.\n  Lastly, it assumes that even if we are able to foresee these \nimpending economic conditions, and even if we are able to adopt \npolicies that will address those conditions and that we can have the \nability to, in effect, turn things around and that it would turn things \naround because it had to do with how much the Government spent and not \nwhat the interest rates were, even though all those situations were \npresent, you could not get the three-fifths vote required by this \nconstitutional amendment that would be necessary to waive the \nprovisions of this amendment.\n  I think it is obvious from my comments I do not adopt those \nassumptions. I am certainly not an economist. I respect those who raise \nthese questions and make these points. But in reading my history and in \nlistening to other economists on the other side of the issue--and we \nhave no one-handed economists, you know; it is on the one hand this and \non the other hand that--in reading the other side, many of them point \nout we have not been very successful in times past in fine tuning the \neconomy.\n  In fact, James Bennett, an economist at George Mason University, \nstated recently, ``If anything, I think the Government has made \neconomic cycles worse.'' Bennett and 253 other economists recently \nsigned a letter supporting a balanced budget amendment.\n  So, again, are these valid points to be made? Are we restricting the \nflexibility of the Government somewhat? Yes, we are. Do we know exactly \nwhat the effect of that is going to be? No, we do not.\n  But, on the other hand, do we know exactly how to fine tune the \neconomy, if we had all the flexibility in the world, to make sure we do \nnot have recessions or any downturns in the economy? There is nothing \nthat I can see to indicate that we have that kind of ability.\n  Others raise the issue of Social Security and say, let us take this \noff the table, let us take that off the table--let us take Social \nSecurity off the table. That is the one that gets a lot of people's \nattention because we are all interested in and committed to protecting \nSocial Security. What we are really talking about is what protects \nSocial Security and what does not and what really exposes it. The \namendment, as I understand it, that would take Social Security out of \nthe mix does not protect Social Security. I think we need to understand \nthat.\n  If that amendment were adopted, you could still raise taxes. If that \namendment were adopted, you could still cut benefits of Social \nSecurity. It could simply, then, be off budget, and the present Social \nSecurity surplus would not be included to make the deficit situation \nlook a little bit better. That would be the effect of it.\n  But, again, I think it is an indication and evidence of short-term \nthinking. While that would be the short-term result from a bookkeeping \nstandpoint, it would be a bad longer term result even from a \nbookkeeping standpoint because the Social Security trust fund is going \ninto the red in a few years, and the greatest danger that Social \nSecurity faces is not passing a balanced budget amendment.\n  If we continue on the same trend we are on, if we continue to pile \ndebt upon debt, interest upon interest, where interest is now going to \nbe the second largest expenditure that we have and gaining on the \nfirst, at a time when the demographics are going to catch up on us--\nagain, we are living in a good year situation now. The baby boomers are \nworking. In a few years the baby boomers are going to start retiring \nand we are going to have a shrinking working population supporting a \ngrowing elderly population.\n  As we know, those Social Security payments come from the workers, \ncurrent workers' pockets. If we have a deficit, debt, slow economy/high \ninterest rate situation that is surely facing us in addition to the \nburden of fewer supporting a greater number, that is the true danger to \nSocial Security. Because these young folks, these young working folks, \nthese young kids, they do not want to pay 70 or 80 percent of their \nincome in taxes. They do not feel like that is right. That debt was run \nup, in many cases, before they were even born.\n  The balanced budget amendment, I think, is the only sure way to \nprotect Social Security. Consider a few of these numbers. Interest \npayments on the debt are currently $235 billion. They are expected to \nrise to about $5 trillion by the year 2030. We will start to go into \nthe general trust fund to meet current Social Security liabilities by \nthe year 2010. We will need an additional $850 billion, in the year \n2030 alone, over anticipated Social Security receipts to meet current \nliabilities. So, by the year 2030, we will have Social Security needing \nabout an additional $850 billion at the same time that the \n[[Page S3093]]  interest payments on the debt are exceeding 75 percent \nof the general revenues. The sum of interest payments and Social \nSecurity equals just under $6 trillion; general revenues are expected \nto be just over $6 trillion. Clearly, there is a problem on what we are \nable to fund as that situation plays out.\n  And what are the options under that scenario, if we continue down the \ncurrent path? Certainly cutting Social Security dramatically would be \nan option that these young people at that point might choose. Another \nwould be raising taxes, including Social Security taxes. Another would \nbe keep raising the deficit. Another would be not to fund anything \nelse, such as national defense, infrastructure, Medicare, schools, or \nanything else.\n  We do not have to go down that road. We do not have to go down that \nroad. I respectfully submit that a way to avoid that road is the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I have heard it said during this debate, time and time again, that \npeople do not realize what we are asking of them here, people do not \nrealize the effects of a balanced budget amendment. Once people \nunderstand what is happening, they will be against a balanced budget \namendment. We see charts and details that it will cost this State some \nmoney and it will cost that State some money and we might have to take \nmoney out of this program and another program and all of that.\n  I submit the people out in the country have a pretty good idea what \nis going on. I submit maybe the folks of this body sometimes are the \nlast to find out. I do not think the large majority of people in this \ncountry feel that we can pass a balanced budget amendment or even have \na balanced budget without making some incremental differences in some \nof the things that they have been used to. I do not think that at all. \nI have never in my life met a person I had a conversation with remotely \nconcerning this subject who would not be willing to make some \nincremental adjustments in some program they might benefit from. Not \ndrastic, because it does not have to be drastic now. It will have to be \ndrastic if this scenario plays out. If we continue on the same road, it \nwill be slash and burn and cut and rip apart.\n  But not now. It does not have to be that way. I have never met anyone \nwho would not be willing to make some incremental adjustment to their \nlife if they thought it benefited their kids or if they thought it \nbenefited their grandkids. They do not think that now. People stand up \nand get defensive, and they do not want anything done, not because they \nare not willing to do that. It is because they think it is not going to \nbenefit their kids. First of all, they do not trust the messenger who \nis delivering that message to them. That is us. The U.S. Congress \ncontinues to get comeuppance a little bit now and then.\n  About the change in the election, I am not going to claim credit for \nthat because the Republican Party took over. It will be back down \nagain, regardless. This is a temporary situation, probably \nunfortunately. Public opinion traditionally keeps the U.S. Congress \ndown to the lowest part of the totem pole in terms of institutions in \nthis country. So we come to them now, and under the present \ncircumstances tell them some of these things. They do not trust us. \nThey do not believe us. They do not believe we will do what we say we \nwill do with the money. They know that for every dollar raised in \ntaxes, we increase spending that much more; things of that nature.\n  But I think that, if we did some things to help restore our faith--\nand I think the Congressional Accountability Act was a good start on \nthat--we are going to have an opportunity to do a few more things. We \nwill have an opportunity to vote on a term limits resolution that the \nPresiding Officer is so vitally involved with, and a few other things. \nI think this balanced budget amendment falls in that same category. If \nwe begin to do some of those things to show we are serious, maybe we \nwill develop credibility so we will have people believe us, and so that \nthey will say yes. Yes, I will be willing to make some incremental \nadjustment. I am not stupid. I do not think we can have our cake \nforever and eat it forever, as some Members of this body apparently \nthink people believe out in the country.\n  So, I believe, if we are honest with the American people, if we begin \nto clean up our own act and we begin to take some of the tough measures \nand we are willing to put a little bit of restraint on ourselves so \nthat we cannot continue this taxing and spending our way into \noblivion--it might help in our reelection campaigns, but it is driving \nthe country to a disaster--then I think the people will respond to \nthis. It is not the message that they are concerned with, I think, as \nmuch as it is or has been the messenger.\n  So what if we do not? So many of these points that have been be made \nin this debate over the last several days are not only interesting, but \nsome of the points are valid. There are questions that are not totally \nanswerable as we sit here and have this debate. We must acknowledge \nthat. But the perfect should not be the enemy of the good.\n  This is our last clear chance because we always have to go back to \nthe other side of the ledger. No, we do not know exactly what a court \nwould do. Theoretically, a court might make us do what we said we were \ngoing to do anyway under a constitutional amendment, and that is \nbalance the budget. That is the worst-case scenario, I guess. Yes, we \nmight have an irresponsible Congress which, even though our country was \nin imminent danger, would refuse to give 51 votes to declare war. I \nguess that is theoretically possible. On and on.\n  Mr. President, I submit we have to keep our eye on what we are \nabout--the other side of the ledger. What if the balanced budget \namendment does not pass? What if we do not start exercising some \nspending restraint and begin to get our fiscal house in order? Can \nthere be any doubt that this interest on the debt is going to eat us \nalive? Can there be any doubt? Is there anyone who says that it is not \na disaster waiting to happen? It is going to drive out all the other \nrevenues that would go for savings; it is going to have an effect on \nour savings rate, which now I think is the lowest in the industrialized \nworld; it is going to have an effect on our investment rate, which is \nbecoming one of the lowest investment rates in the industrialized \nworld. That will have an effect on our growth rate. That goes up and \ndown.\n  So if you look long term and compare us with some of the other \ndeveloping countries around the world, our long-term growth rate \nprojections are not a pretty picture. We are coming along pretty good \nright now. But historically, if you look at growth rates coming out of \na recession, it has been about twice what ours is now. There are some \nindicators on the horizon that do not look good--housing starts, of \ncourse; the balance of payments, and things of that nature. But leave \nthat aside. Those things change. But the long-term picture remains the \nsame: The increasing reliance on Federal financing for our debt; the \nincreasing ownership of United States assets in foreign hands, a \nreliance on foreign individuals for our debt. In 1993, it was $41 \nbillion, or more than twice of all of our other foreign aid payments \nthat we have in this country. There is more and more reliance upon \nthat.\n  We have seen what happened to our friends south of the border \nrecently, when those who were putting the money into the country \ndecided to take the money out of the country. If that happens, the \ndollar falls and interest rates go up. We are not guaranteed that \nfinancing, that foreign financing, is going to continue to be there. We \nhave seen it over the last 20 years.\n  Real family income in this country has stagnated. People talk about \nthat a lot. There is no real growth there. What people do not talk \nabout so much, getting back to the young people again, is that for \nyounger families, real income has dropped since 1973.\n  So what are the alternatives? I think we have an insight as to some \nof the things that we could look for if we continue down the current \nroad. Last October, according to a memorandum by the OMB Director, \nAlice Rivlin, dated October 3, 1994, in order to pay for the \nadministration's priorities, Rivlin suggested certain tax-related \noptions, including the following options: Limiting mortgage deductions \nfor second homes; include capital gains on the last income tax returns \nof the deceased; 2.5 \n[[Page S3094]]  percent value-added tax; eliminate the deduction of \nState and local taxes.\n  These are the options the administration is talking about or was \ntalking about forcing upon the American people while adamantly fighting \na balanced budget amendment.\n  On Social Security, the administration confirmed what we have been \nsaying about Social Security, in reality. According to the memo, the \nSocial Security trust fund surplus will be exhausted in 2029. Social \nSecurity will face a cash deficit in 2013, unless taxes are raised or \nbenefits reduced.\n  Possible solutions to save Social Security as presented by the Rivlin \nmemo: Increase normal retirement age to 70 by 2023; tax 85 percent of \nincome and benefits of $25,000 for individuals and $32,000 for couples; \ninclude children's Social Security benefits in parents' taxable income; \nincrease payroll taxes by 0.32 percent starting in 5 years.\n  These are some of the options that were being considered by the \nadministration--this one individual, anyway, who holds a responsible \nposition was considering--if we are going down the same old path and \ncontinuing the same old economic policies that we have.\n These are not the directions the American people want to go in. This \nis the road that we are going on. Can we do it otherwise? The Senator \nfrom Arkansas suggested a statutory solution. I respectfully suggest \nthat that has been tried and failed. It is not exactly like we are \nrunning in here at the last minute and coming up with a solution that \nhas not been well thought out.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator, first of all, if \nhe has any idea as to how long he might be as a matter of process?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I see two or three of my colleagues now on the floor. \nIn light of that, I will be delighted to wrap up here in just a minute \nor so.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator for his answer and for his courtesy.\n  I would like to ask one quick question, if I may. I would assume the \nSenator would agree with me that if one accepts all of the urgency he \nhas cited with respect to the budget, which I accept, and that since \nthere are more than 60 Senators who have already declared they are \ngoing to go vote for this, there is nothing to stop those 60 Senators \nfrom simply agreeing that they will not have a filibuster, that they \nwill come to the floor now, today, and that they will propose a \nbalanced budget with 51 votes and deciding up or down any portion of \nthat budget, is there?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. No, there is nothing that would prevent that.\n  Mr. KERRY. So these Senators can make a decision now to resolve this \nissue of the balanced budget amendment without really going out to the \nStates and taking the time. This could happen today if those same 60 \nSenators wanted to put their action where their vote is?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Theoretically, they could do that; you are absolutely \nright--or we could do that, I might add.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I also add, however, that I think the prospects of that \nhappening are very small. In the first place, when you get down to the \ndetails of working out a solution--as the Senator knows, in times past, \nit has not been an easy situation. The devil indeed is in the details. \nIt is a complex document. There has been no constraint and no \nrequirement that they come to a balanced budget.\n  Under the Senator's scenario, there would still be no requirement, no \nconstraint requiring them to ultimately balance the budget. They have \ngiven it a good try, but walking away from the table has happened \nbefore. The Senator's scenario is one that I would prefer. My concern \nis that I have been watching this process from Tennessee for a few \nyears, and the Senator has been here for a few years and has seen it \ncloser than I have. But I have not observed anything that would cause \nme to believe that that scenario could play out.\n  The Budget Act of 1921 required the President to recommend a balanced \nbudget. The Revenue Act of 1964 basically said it is the sense of the \nCongress that we must balance the budget and balance it soon. The \nRevenue Act of 1978 said it is a matter of national policy that we \nbalance the budget. The Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978 prioritized a \nbalanced Federal budget. The Byrd amendment in 1978 made it law and \nsaid that by fiscal year 1981 receipts must balance with outlays. But \nin that very year there was a $79 billion deficit.\n  As the Members here know much better than I, the Budget Act of 1974 \nwas passed, laying the foundation for the process that we have today. I \nbelieve the thinking was that it required an annual budget resolution \nand people would be afraid to vote for large deficits. That did not \nwork. The very next year, the deficit started skyrocketing. Then there \nwas Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, and you know the history there; the 1990 \nbudget deal, the deficit increased; the 1993 budget deal where the debt \nincreased by $3 trillion.\n  The President submitted another budget that projects $200 billion \ndeficits for as far as the eye can see. I know a lot of Members have \nbeen trying mighty hard over a large number of years. I do not presume \nto challenge that proposition. But as an institution, for whatever \nreason, there is no indication that we have any possibility of really \ngetting a handle on this thing absent a balanced budget amendment. With \nthat, unless the Senator has something else for me, I will yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas, [Mr. Pryor] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I want to compliment our new colleague from \nTennessee. I think our new colleague from Tennessee has made a very \nwise and thoughtful presentation today. I must say I do not agree with \nhis ultimate conclusion and the outcome that he says is going to be the \nanswer to our budget crisis or dilemma that we find ourselves in. I do \nnot find myself in agreement with that conclusion. But I compliment \nhim.\n  I watched his campaign, Mr. President. I watched that campaign from \nacross the Mississippi River. He is our good neighbor. He has been our \ngood neighbor for a number of years. On many occasions, I can remember, \nMr. President, flying from Washington to Nashville, or from Nashville \nto Washington when he was a private citizen. He and I happened to join \non the same airplanes together, and I recall very good conversations \nthat we have had. We established, I hope, the beginnings of a bond of \nfriendship during that period of time. I welcome him to this body, and \nI thank him for his thoughtful presentation.\n  Mr. President, there are a couple of items that the Senator from \nTennessee addressed that, in fact, I would like to ask him about, if I \nmight. One is the issue of the term ``incremental adjustments.'' He \nsays the States and the governments might have to make some \n``incremental adjustments.'' I pose a question to my distinguished \ncolleague on arriving at a definition of what incremental adjustments \nmight be.\n  For example, the Department of the Treasury, on the 12th of January, \nsent information to all of the State Governors on what would occur in \ntheir respective States should the balanced budget amendment pass and \nshould the budget have to be balanced by the year 2002.\n  For example, our neighboring State, the State of Tennessee--and the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee represents it well--says the \nTreasury Department, would have to increase State taxes by 19.5 percent \nacross the board to make up for the loss in grants. I am wondering \nwhether this is an incremental adjustment. I am wondering if the loss \nof $1.9 billion to Tennessee in Medicare benefits would be an \nincremental adjustment; or $989 million per year in lost funding in \nMedicaid; or $78 million in lost highway trust funds are incremental. I \nask my friend from Tennessee, are those incremental adjustments?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I assume the Senator from Arkansas does not believe \nthose are incremental.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I do not believe they are. They are not in Arkansas. They \nmay be across the river in Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I believe when I used that term, I was referring to \nindividuals. I may not have. I think my main point--the main basis was \nthat \n[[Page S3095]]  we are talking about some increases in levels of \nexpenditures that represent cuts in the rates of growth as opposed to \nactually cutting into the substance of the program. I call that \nbasically incremental; in other words, not draconian cuts, but the \nbeginning of some reductions in the rate of increase in some programs.\n  With regard to what the Senator is talking about there, in the first \nplace, with all due respect, I cannot accept the figures from the \nDepartment of the Treasury, who I think would be a little less than \nobjective in this debate we are having and would be very much opposed \nto the balanced budget amendment. But, be that as it may, I do not have \nany idea. I think that Tennessee would lose some revenues. That is my \nown opinion. How much, I do not know. I doubt if the Department of the \nTreasury knows, because you are assuming the same rates of growth. You \nare assuming that the State would not make some other choices and \nthings of that nature. I do not think we can assume that.\n  But I get back to this: We are not talking about a good-news versus a \nbad-news situation. We are not talking about a good choice over a bad \nchoice. We are talking about choosing between two tough choices. I \nwould like to see everybody have everything they want in Tennessee and \nin Arkansas. My concern is what is the effect on Tennesseans, the \neffect on my grandkids living in Tennessee when they get to be working \nage if we do not do something about this runaway fiscal situation that \nwe have in this country.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I applaud my colleague from Tennessee for \nhis answer, because, to some extent, the Senator from Tennessee, in his \nanswer, is making an argument for the amendment that I am about to call \nup.\n  That amendment, basically, says that the States have a right to tell \nCongress how to balance the Federal budget. This is a States rights \namendment. This is an amendment that I am sure my colleague who \ntraveled around Tennessee in that red pickup truck, through those hills \nand hollows of Tennessee that I love to drive through between here and \nArkansas, would have agreed with when he heard those people in \nTennessee say that they wanted just the facts. They wanted the right to \nknow. They wanted the right to tell the Congress their point of view.\n  Well, I have an amendment that is going to do exactly that. This \namendment says that the State legislatures, before voting on whether or \nnot to ratify this constitutional amendment--this presupposes or \npresumes that this amendment will get 67 votes, it might not get 67, \nand it may not be sent out to the States--but if it does, that the \nState legislature will have the right to tell Congress how the pain is \ngoing to be shared.\n  They are going to have the right to petition Congress, so to speak, \nand to tell the Congress of the United States where they want these \ncuts to come from.\n  Of course, the right-to-know amendment went down. Every Republican \nSenator, to the best of my knowledge, with all due respect, voted \nagainst telling people in advance of our vote here as to what is going \nto happen in each respective State. So we are going to try now to give \nthe States the opportunity to tell us, if this amendment passes, how \nthose cuts should be made.\n  I just think that there is a feeling, Mr. President, out there in the \ncountry, that there is some kind of magical plan here in Washington. \nThe Congress is going to wave some secret magic wand and is going to \npass a balanced budget amendment and 38 States are going to ratify that \namendment and all of our problems are going to be over.\n  Well, Mr. President, that is not going to be the case.\n  I just think that we still have an opportunity out in the States to \nshow that, one, we are for States rights; and, two, that we will listen \nto the State legislatures tell us how they want this pain to be \nallocated out in the States.\n  I notice, I say to the distinguished occupant of the Chair, the State \nof Missouri would have to raise taxes, according to the Treasury \nDepartment, across the board by 15.5 percent. This balanced budget \namendment would mean, for Missouri, a $2.4 billion loss in Medicare, $3 \nbillion in grants to local Governments and veterans benefits and \nstudent loans and all down the line.\n  I think the States have a right, Mr. President, to let us know in \nCongress how they prefer that pain to be allocated. This would be \nbefore the vote would occur as to whether the particular State wanted \nto ratify or not.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I am proud to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Does the Senator from Arkansas accept the premise that \nwe are in a dire situation here as far as the next generation or, prior \nto that, the next century, that the Social Security trust fund is going \ninto the red in a few years and the interest on the debt escalating?\n  I think the Senator from Massachusetts acknowledges that. I assume we \nall basically agree we have a real tough situation on our hands.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would answer my friend from Tennessee, I \nknow he was not here then, but in 1982 I supported a balanced budget \namendment. That was after I had voted for President Reagan's program to \ndecrease taxes and increase defense spending. This was a mistake on my \npart. Only 11 Members of the U.S. Senate stood up at a time of great \nnational passion and opposed President Reagan. I supported President \nReagan.\n  In 1982, I voted for the balanced budget amendment. It was worded \ndifferently. In 1986, this Senator voted again for the balanced budget \namendment. It was worded a little bit differently. On two occasions, I \nhave voted in the 1980's to freeze spending, once for 2 years and once \nfor 1 year. I always will think, had we passed these spending freezes \nduring that period, I say to my friend, that we would not be in the \ndire consequences that we are in today.\n  In 1990, I voted a hard vote on the deficit reduction package. In \nAugust of 1993, this Senator voted to decrease the deficit by $500 \nbillion. And I can tell my friend from Tennessee, that was a hard, \nhard, mean vote.\n  And right there, in the middle of that aisle, in my opinion in August \nof 1993, was where we saw the difference between commitment and just \ntalking. On our side, we voted the hard choice.\n  And this is the only way I think we are going to be able, as we might \nsay in Tennessee and Arkansas, to bring that horse back into the barn. \nBecause in the mid-1980's, we let that horse out of the barn. Now how \ndo we bring him back? Do we do it by a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget?\n  The problem is not in the Constitution. The problem is us. And this \nis why I maintain that we have to continue making tough choices here in \nthe legislative branch and not simply pass a balanced budget amendment \nthat is suddenly going to magically trigger in the year 2002, if it is \nratified.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I agree with my friend's analogy about the horse being \nout of the barn. My concern is that the horse is not going to have a \nbarn to come back to before very long.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I would say that we are not going to have a horse if we do \nnot do something. And we are willing to do something and we have \ndemonstrated that we have been willing to do something. We are pleading \nwith our colleagues on the other side of the aisle that we have to do \nsomething.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. May I make a couple of points?\n  With all due respect, I was not here during that vote, but I am very \nmuch aware of it. I am also very much aware that there were two \ndifferent bodies of thought during that vote. One has been expressed \neloquently by the Senator. The other was that the way we take care of \nour fiscal problems in this country is to cut spending and not to raise \ntaxes. And a lot of people looked at the President's approach at that \ntime, the one you voted for, as basically a major cut in defense \nspending and the largest tax increase in the history of the country.\n  So the thought on this side of the aisle, as I read my newspapers \nduring all of that, was that that was not the way to go about it and \nthat it would stifle growth in this country in the long run. My \npersonal opinion is I think it has yet to be played out. Just so we \nhave both theories on the record.\n  I am very much aware of the Senator's point.\n  I guess, however, my main question would be, in light of the \nSenator's good efforts and tireless efforts along these \n[[Page S3096]]  lines and the failure to see those efforts come to \nfruition, regardless of whatever reason--and it is all fun to talk \nabout Democrats and Republicans and the President versus Congress and \nthis administration and that--the fact of the matter is we are \ncontinuing down the same road through both Democrats and Republicans. \nSo my question is: why is it now, in light, for whatever reason, of the \ncontinued failure to balance the budget that now causes my friend from \nArkansas to think that we can do it without the constraint of a \nconstitutional amendment?\n  Mr. PRYOR. First, Mr. President, I would say to my friend the problem \nis not in the Constitution. The problem is in Congress, and it is our \ncommitment and our will. We can balance the budget. We can cure the \ndeficit. We can do it in a number of years if we will make that \ncommitment. We are pleading right now with our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle to join us in that commitment that we helped to make \nin 1993.\n  Let me say when the Senator said we are not going to cut spending, we \nare just going to raise taxes, I know had the Senator been here in \nAugust 1993 when that vote was counted and when the roll, as they say, \nwas called. I know the Senator from Tennessee then would have realized \nthat the budget reconciliation bill contained $250 billion in new \ntaxes, but also an equal amount, $250 billion, in spending cuts.\n  We made that hard decision. We made that hard decision stick, I am \nsorry to say, without our colleagues on the other side.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Spending cuts promised in the future that have not come \nto fruition.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Those spending cuts are beginning to come into fruition. I \nthink what we have seen in the tremendous creation of jobs in the \nprivate sector is the result of the confidence we helped provide in the \neconomy. We basically laid the groundwork in August 1993.\n  I would like to say this, Mr. President: I am going to, in a moment, \ncall up an amendment. But before I do that, I will yield just for 60 \nseconds.\n  I would like to say one thing about the statement of the Senator from \nTennessee. He made a statement that was so correct that I agree 100 \npercent. The Senator from Tennessee earlier in his remarks made the \nstatement, I am not sure I can quote him exactly, I believe the Senator \nsaid, ``This vote on the balanced budget amendment is the most \nimportant vote that we will cast during this term.''\n  I certainly agreed with him as he said it. I agree with him now. I \nthink future generations are going to look back and say that this was \nan important, critical vote in this session of Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield such time as the \nSenator from Michigan desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 273, 310, and 311, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time that I \nbe allowed to call up three amendments en bloc for the purpose of \ncomplying with the 3 o'clock unanimous consent deadline and ask that \nthe three amendments be temporarily laid aside.\n  I hope to come back later this afternoon or Monday and debate my \nthree amendments at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arkansas and the \nmanagers of the bill.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, am I correct in understanding that the \nSenator from Arkansas does have the floor? I will not keep the floor \nlong. I know the Senator from Utah is back on the floor. My \ndistinguished friend from Massachusetts is on the floor seeking \nrecognition.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 307\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 307.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n       ``Sec. 8. It is the intent of Congress that each State \n     should, as a part of its ratification process, submit to \n     Congress recommendations for reductions in direct and \n     indirect Federal funds provided to the State and its \n     residents (based on the State's allocation of Federal funds) \n     necessary to balance the State's share of the Federal \n     deficit.''\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I will not give this entire speech, much to \nthe glee of my comrades in arms here this Friday afternoon, but I will \nsummarize, basically, what this amendment is all about.\n  Next Tuesday, February 28, this body, if it provides 67 votes needed \nto pass this constitutional amendment, the pending balanced budget \namendment will go to be ratified or rejected by our 50 States.\n  This is not just an event or happening that takes place every day or \nevery week around this body. Fortunately, it is very rare. Fortunately, \nwe are putting a high priority on this particular debate, focusing on \nthis particular issue.\n  The Senator from Tennessee eloquently a few moments ago stated what a \ngood debate this has been. And truly, that is the nature, that is the \nsoul of the U.S. Senate, to have debates like this on issues of great \nnational interest such as the balanced budget amendment.\n  Accompanying this amendment when it leaves this body--there will not \nbe with it a budget plan, there will not be a report, there will be no \nstudy that accompanies this amendment, there will be no options for the \nStates, there will be no notion, no inkling, of information that a \nState can use to judge the impact that the balanced budget amendment \nwould have on the people of their respective States.\n  Down there in the Tennessee State Legislature, they will call up this \nbalanced budget amendment, as they will across the river in Arkansas, \nand they are going to be voting on this amendment, Mr. President. And \nthey are not going to have anything to go by as to how it is going to \naffect the State programs or the Federal programs whereby we send money \nto the States for the States to use to provide services.\n  There is going to be nothing. They are going to be voting in the \ndark. Already we have killed the people's right to know how this budget \namendment will impact the people of our country.\n  So my amendment is going to take a different route. My amendment at \nleast is going to create, hopefully, a moral obligation that the people \nof the States, the people of Tennessee, the people of Arkansas, \nMissouri, Utah, and Massachusetts, can go to their State legislature \nand say, ``Send to the Congress the message of how this pain \n[[Page S3097]]  is going to be allocated. Send to the Congress the \nmessage of how this is going to occur whereby we get so many fewer \ndollars.''\n  I think, Mr. President, what we need today more than anything else \naccompanying this amendment, especially out in the States, are the \nfacts. Right now, what they are going to be looking at are a few \nspeeches made on the floor of the House of Representatives, a very \nshort debate I might add, and then several days of speeches made in the \nU.S. Senate. Then, based upon those speeches and those statements and \ndesires from constituents and phone calls and letters, then the \nlegislators from the respective States are going to be voting yes or \nno.\n  The first Republican House majority leader in 40 years was recently \nquoted as saying, ``We have the serious business of passing a balanced \nbudget amendment, and I am profoundly convinced that putting the \ndetails out there would make that virtually impossible.'' He went on to \nsay, ``If the American people understood what this means, it would make \ntheir knees buckle.''\n  Mr. President, I suspect the Republican House majority leader is \nperfectly accurate in this assessment. But I am sure that this is not \nthe way to conduct the business of this country, because I truly \nbelieve that the people of our respective States have the right and \nshould be encouraged to tell Members how they want this pain to be \nshared and how they want these Federal allocations to be made.\n  My amendment is very simple. As part of the ratification process, \neach State legislature would be expected--not required, no mandate--but \nexpected to submit to the Congress recommendations on how to cut \nFederal funds in that particular State. Various committees of the State \nlegislature could hold hearings on the priority they place on Federal \nprograms. Legislatures could deliberate, they could debate the impact \nof cutting these programs on their constituents.\n  We feel that this is a solid amendment, Mr. President. We feel that \nthis particular amendment is one that should be approved and adopted by \nthis body. Some will say, well, wait a minute, would this not have to \ngo back to the House of Representatives? Would this not slow the \nprocess down?\n  Once again, Mr. President, we feel that an amendment like this would \nmerely accelerate the States' knowledge of what was going to happen to \nthem should their State ratify or reject the constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget before their State.\n  So, Mr. President, I am not going to belabor this issue any longer.\n  The point is that State governments have a huge stake in how we reach \na balanced budget in Washington. And they have a right to tell Congress \nhow to do it.\n  I believe such an exercise would be helpful to each State in \npreparing for the impact of a balanced Federal budget. They will invest \ntheir time and energy into this process. And, their ideas on ways to \ncut spending would be invaluable to Congress.\n  Mr. President, we are in a partnership with the States on this issue, \nand quite frankly, we need their help in our eventual task of reducing \nthe deficit--whether or not this amendment ultimately passes.\n  Now, it is curious to me how anyone would vote for legislation when \nhe or she has no idea how it would affect his or her constituents?\n  The answer to this question is, of course, that it is an extremely \npopular and painless way to make people happy while not cutting \nspending one dime. It is popular because it carries a simple and empty \nanswer to all of our deficit problems.\n  Mr. President, Mark Twain once said that ``for every problem there's \na simple solution--and it's wrong.'' Mr. President, the balanced budget \namendment is a simple answer--and it is wrong.\n  While I was home this weekend, Mr. President, I spoke with a trusted \nfriend and long-time State legislator from my State. He told me ``once \nthe people of this country understand what this amendment means, \nthey'll drop it like a hot potato.''\n  Mr. President. I suspect my friend may be right. But the question is \nwhether the people truly understand what they will be voting on. The \ncalls from my State of Arkansas are mostly for a balanced budget \namendment until I tell them about the massive spending reductions \nrequired to balance the budget. According to the U.S. Treasury \nDepartment, in Arkansas, we are looking at:\n  Medicare--over $1 billion in lost benefits per year;\n  Medicaid--$416 million loss in funding per year;\n  Highway Trust Funds--$65 million per year in lost funding; and \ndevastating cuts in veteran's benefits, education, job training, \nhousing, and agriculture programs necessary to actually balance the \nbudget.\n  At first the callers don't believe me. They believe that Social \nSecurity moneys are protected in a trust fund, that Medicare is \nprotected in a trust fund, and highway projects are protected in a \ntrust fund. They believe these trust funds have billions of dollars in \nthem, and that this amendment will not affect them.\n  But this is simply not true, Mr. President, and my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle have proven this time and time again by \nrefusing to exempt these programs from this amendment.\n  When we balance the budget there is no assurance that these programs \nwon't be drastically cut. In fact, it is very likely that they will.\n  Mr. President, I know we must make heavy cuts in Government spending \nto reduce the Federal deficit. I have made the tough votes to reduce \nthe deficit in the past, and I will in the future. But, as written, \nthis constitutional amendment is a back door trick that may very well \nbackfire on us. It could prevent any progress on the deficit in the \nfuture because we are not being honest.\n  The amendment I offer today will help to harness the energies and \nideas of the States, and make our task of reducing the debt a more \ndemocratic process.\n  Mr. President, my friends on the other side of the aisle have \nunanimously deprived the American people of their right to know. Will \nthey also shut off a State's right to tell Congress how to cut Federal \nfunds in their own State?\n  These are the same States who we listen to in formulating national \npolicies promoting the general welfare of our American society on \nissues like crime and welfare. We should also listen to them in this \nprocess as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment No. 307 be \ntemporarily laid aside until Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognition. I ask \nunanimous consent that I be permitted to yield for the purposes of a \nunanimous-consent request of the Senator from West Virginia, and that I \nretain rights to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I object.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield briefly without \nlosing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, may I yield without losing the right to the \nfloor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I object.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KERRY. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from West \nVirginia for the purposes of a question.\n  Mr. BYRD. The question is: Under the previous order that was entered \nhere, is it not required that Senators who wish to call up amendments \nthat will be in order for a vote on next Tuesday must call those \namendments up today prior to the hour of 3 o'clock p.m.?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is my understanding that is the order, \nand that in order to have amendments qualified they must be called up \nby the hour of 3 p.m.\n  Mr. BYRD. Does not the Senator feel that any Senator in this body, \nwhether he is a Senator from the minority or from the majority, has a \nperfect right \n[[Page S3098]]  to try to get his amendments called up today before 3 \np.m., so that they will be in order for a vote on next Tuesday?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have never known in my 11 years in the \nSenate a Senator who was present on the floor who wishes to call an \namendment up--who under a previous order is permitted to do so--from \nbeing prevented from doing so.\n  Mr. BYRD. Does the Senator know that I wish to ask unanimous consent \nthat the following amendments be called up and laid aside --and these \nare already on the list--amendments Nos. 253, 254, 255, 258, and 259; \nand, that in lieu of amendment No. 257 I wanted to ask--which is on the \nlist--ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 252 be called up and \nlaid aside? Does the Senator know that was the request I was about to \nmake?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I did not know that. But now that I do know \nthat, I ask unanimous consent of the Chair to have those specific \namendments called up and be temporarily set aside until such time as I \nhave completed my amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the President.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. I thank \nthe distinguished Senator on the other side, for perhaps he is a member \nof the response team who has not learned some of the usual courtesies \nthat we try to extend to one another around here. I am going to make \nthe unanimous-consent request now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be called up \nand laid aside: amendments Nos. 253, 254, 255, 258, 259; and, that in \nlieu of amendment No. 257, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n252 be called up and laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I again thank the Senator. I thank all \nSenators.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the President, and I particularly want to pay \ntribute to the Senator from West Virginia who has done such an \nextraordinary job helping to pull out this debate.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Arkansas on his comments \nand observations with respect to this amendment.\n  This has been a lengthy but, I think, a valuable, for the most part, \nenlightened debate. I congratulate colleagues on both sides of the \naisle for their tempered and passionate arguments for and against a \nbalanced budget amendment in the Constitution.\n  We have debated this issue before. As the Senator from Arkansas said, \nwe have voted here previously. He previously voted for it. I have \npreviously voted against an amendment to the Constitution, but I was, I \nthink, one of the original cosponsors and one of the first three \nDemocrats to be supportive of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law and have \nvoted for a balanced budget law.\n  As we all know, and as we have heard a number of colleagues recount, \nthe fiscal realities confronting the United States of America are more \ncompelling today than in previous years, and they will be worse in the \nfuture unless Congress summons the courage to do something. And so a \nreexamination of this issue is both important and, I think, \nappropriate.\n  The question before us is whether or not passing this constitutional \namendment, as drafted, shows courage and whether it is the right thing \nfor us to do.\n  Over the past weeks, despite my prior vote, I have gone back to try \nto reevaluate this issue and to weigh it carefully. I have reexamined \nmy own position on this question and I have reviewed all of the \narguments in this debate, closely reading the daily Record, reading and \nrereading historical documents, analyzing the committee hearings and \nthe report language and carefully assessing the impact of this \namendment on Massachusetts and on the country as a whole.\n  As I mentioned in my short colloquy with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Tennessee a few minutes ago, we begin this debate, I think most of \nus, are genuinely in the same place--with a clear understanding of the \nprofound fiscal condition of the Nation.\n  No Senator, I think, will argue that we do not need to make a set of \ntougher choices than we have ever made before. And no one, I think, \nwill argue that we can just continue to go along as we have been going. \nThe numbers do speak for themselves: The national debt now over $4.9 \ntrillion, three times what it was 11 years ago; gross interest on the \nnational debt soon to be the second-largest expenditure in the entire \nbudget, higher than defense spending; and in 1980 remembering that \ninterest payments on the national debt were $52 billion, this year they \nwill be $235 billion, an increase of over 450 percent and over 100 \npercent increase when adjusted for inflation.\n  We all now know the cliched but all too real trend lines, that each \nday we spend $640 million in interest payments, that Federal spending \ncontinues to grow because of automatic increases, and that our lack of \naction does, indeed, threaten generations to come.\n  I am persuaded that with or without an amendment, like it or not, no \none of us here can avoid the fiscal confrontation that faces us, except \ntemporarily. Just like the health care issue which is, in fact, part of \nthe current problem, we cannot avoid the issue, or hide from it, or \nmake it disappear, or wish it away. It is going to get worse and worse \nand an angrier and angrier public is, ultimately, going to hold \nCongress accountable.\n  The question is whether we can summon the courage under any scenario \nthat addresses our fiscal problems, and do what must be done before the \npublic decides to change the players until they force responsible \naction.\n  Mr. President, the amendment before us purports to be that summoning \nof will. I think it is not. Let us be absolutely clear at the outset. \nWe do not need an amendment to the Constitution in order to balance the \nbudget, and everything about this debate has to begin at that point. \nThe truth is--acknowledged in the committee report itself, acknowledged \nin the course of debate--technically, we do not need this amendment in \norder to balance the budget. We do not need an amendment to the \nConstitution. If the more than 60 Senators who are now committed to \nvoting for this amendment would simply agree among themselves that they \nwill not allow a filibuster, that they would vote for cloture and that \n51 votes, majority Government that our Founding Fathers established to \ndo the job, would be allowed to vote on each measure, up or down, then, \nMr. President, we could balance the budget today.\n  I hope America focuses on that, because that is the centerpiece of \nthis debate. It is the centerpiece of what is at stake in Washington. \nNot the question of whether or not we need a piece of paper and words \nthat we transfer from our current politics into the Constitution to \nbalance it, we could do it today, and if those 60 Senators who have \nmade this their Holy Grail, their prime objective, would simply say \n``we will not filibuster, we will have a balanced budget now, we could \ndo it this year, not make yet another promise to America that we will \ndo something 7 years from now.''\n  I would agree to that. I would give my solemn pledge to come to the \nfloor, no filibuster. I do not care if it is a program in Massachusetts \nor a program dear to my heart, I am prepared to let 51 votes decide \nwhether we continue it or cut it, whether we raise the debt or do not, \nwhether we cut taxes, raise taxes, cut a program or increase a program. \nThat is what the Founding Fathers of this country envisioned.\n  Those who call themselves conservatives ought to stop and think hard \nabout what conservation really means and what conservative means with \nrespect to the Constitution that guides our actions in this country. \nAll they have to do is agree: Let 51 votes decide; let the chips fall \nwhere they may; we could do it this year.\n  So the question then is properly put to the U.S. Senate: Why are we \ninsisting on tampering with the Constitution to accomplish what, by \nrights, we could accomplish now, what the American people have a right \nto expect we would accomplish now if we had the will?\n   [[Page S3099]] The proponents of this amendment say that we need \nthis amendment to, No. 1, force discipline on us. I want to quote from \nthe committee report:\n\n       The primary enforcement mechanism is a three-fifths vote to \n     increase the debt ceiling. The committee argues that an \n     amendment to the Constitution ``forces the Government to live \n     within its means.''\n\n  Mr. President, how does it force the Government to live within its \nmeans? In a long colloquy between Senator Johnston and Senator Hatch, \nSenator Hatch acknowledged--in fact, insisted--there will not be court \ncases; this will not go to court, because the court will not have \njurisdiction; the court will not take jurisdiction;\n it will not be justiciable; there will not be standing; there will not \nbe ripeness, a whole set of reasons.\n\n  So, Mr. President, if the Senator from Utah is correct that you \ncannot go to court, then how does this force the Government to live \nwithin its means? If it does not go to court, then the only enforcer is \nthe Senate and the House, and the only enforcement will be the very \nwillpower that is absent today. So here we are with a new modern catch-\n22, only it is a catch-22 that may be written into the Constitution of \nthe United States of America.\n  Now, Mr. President, we tried to clarify the court issue. We tried to \nactually say what the Senator from Utah was promising us. He said it \nwill not go to court. We said if you are so certain that it will not go \nto court, why not write that in--that it will not go to court? But, oh, \nno, there was a block vote preventing us from doing that because, in \nfact, there are those on the other side who want it to go to court, and \nwho want the ambiguity. So we are in effect being asked to write \nambiguity into the Constitution of the United States without an \nunderstanding of what the risks are to the Nation in doing so.\n  Now, that is not the only catch-22. One of the most significant \ncatch-22's is in section 6, and I would like to read from the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment committee report where it says that:\n\n       Congress shall enforce and implement this article by \n     appropriate legislation which may rely on estimates of \n     outlays and receipts. This provision gives Congress an \n     appropriate degree of flexibility in fashioning necessary \n     implementing legislation. For example, Congress could use \n     estimates of receipts or outlays at the beginning of the \n     fiscal year to determine whether the balanced budget \n     requirement of section 1 would be satisfied, so long as the \n     estimates were reasonable and made in good faith.\n\n  Most importantly, Mr. President, it says this:\n\n       In addition, Congress could decide that a deficit caused by \n     a temporary self-correcting drop in receipts or increase in \n     outlays during the fiscal year would not violate the article.\n\n  Get that. We pass the amendment to the Constitution. We say to \nAmerica we are going to have a balanced budget. But right here in the \ndescriptions, in the fine print, there is language that says Congress \ncould decide that a deficit caused by a temporary self-correcting drop \nin receipts or increases would not violate the article. So we come \nright back in and exercise the very same flexibility that we exercise \ntoday, and that has to be measured against their statement that this \namendment to the Constitution ``forces the Government to live within \nits means.'' How, if you are having that flexibility and promoting that \nflexibility, does this force the Government to live within its means?\n  Moreover, the very same paragraph says:\n\n       Similarly, Congress could state that very small or \n     negligible deviations from a balanced budget would not \n     represent a violation of section 1.\n\n  That is the most extraordinary thing of all to me, Mr. President. We \nall know the games that get played around here. Who is going to define \n``very small''? Who is going to define ``negligible''? Why, we are, of \ncourse. And when we define it we will in effect have decided that we \ncan in fact not have a balanced budget. It is right here in the report.\n  America is being promised a balanced budget, but in the very same \nlanguage that America is being promised a balanced budget is one of \nthose small, little sections that says Congress is able to define that \nif you do not have a balanced budget it does not equal a balanced \nbudget problem.\n  I tell you, Joseph Heller would be proud of this. This is catch-22 at \nits best, Mr. President.\n  Now, that is the first reason the proponents say we have to pass it--\nbecause this is going to force the Congress to ``live within its \nmeans.'' But we have learned, No. 1, they will not say whether or not \nthe courts can enforce it, so we do not know if it is really \nenforceable or left to the will of Congress. And they have written in \nsome very specific means by which they can escape from responsibility \nfor truly balancing it.\n  Second, proponents of this amendment say that by this particular \namendment as drafted--because I think you could draft an amendment that \nis better than this, but as this amendment is drafted they say that by \nconstitutionalizing the fiscal principle of a balanced budget a new \nmoral power will overcome the Members of Congress. That is not my \nlanguage. That is their language. They talk about a new moral \nauthority. Let me quote the committee:\n\n       The committee expects fidelity to the Constitution as does \n     the American public. Both the President and Members of \n     Congress swear an oath to uphold the Constitution including \n     any amendments thereto. Honoring this pledge requires \n     respecting the provisions of the proposed amendment.\n\n  The report goes on to say:\n\n       Flagrant disregard of the proposed amendment's clear and \n     simple provisions would constitute nothing less than a \n     betrayal of the public trust. In their campaigns for \n     reelection, elected officials who flout their \n     responsibilities under this amendment will find the process \n     will provide the ultimate enforcement mechanism.\n\n  Mr. President, that is incredible. The first reason that they have \ngiven for passing this is that it is going to force something that in \neffect we have shown cannot really be forced. The second reason is they \nsay it is going to give a new moral authority to the principle that \nevery single one of them has already adopted.\n  Now, Mr. President, needless to say, there is an extraordinary \nstatement of rather pathetic admission in this glorification of new \nmoral authority. Here we are, elected officials, already sworn to \nuphold the Constitution of the United States. Let me read to you from \nthe Constitution of the United States, the preamble:\n\n       We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more \n     perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic \n     Tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the \n     general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to \n     ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish * * *\n\n  Mr. President, we, each of us, already raised our hands, every single \none of us already came to this body swearing to uphold this \nConstitution, which already requires us to look out for the general \nwelfare of the country, and to preserve it for posterity. We have a \nsolemn duty and a responsibility today to deal with this fiscal crisis, \nnot pass some piece of paper that goes on for 7 years into the future. \nWe have that responsibility today under the Constitution. And all that \nis lacking is the courage of those 60 who say this holy grail is worth \npursuing to come to the floor and agree not to filibuster, and let 51 \nvotes uphold the responsibility that we have sworn to uphold.\n  Now, Mr. President, turning to section 8 of article I:\n\n       The Congress shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, \n     Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for \n     the common defence and general Welfare of the United States.\n\n  There, it is, Mr. President, section 8 of the Constitution which \nevery Member of this body has already sworn to uphold provides the \nmoral authority to balance the budget today, requires us to exercise \nthat moral authority today.\n  We should be ashamed of the notion that we have to come here with a \nwhole new process that upsets the very balance of power that was \ncreated by the Founding Fathers of this country. A true conservative \nwould think twice about voting in a way that changes the whole power \nstructure and walks away from the personal responsibility already sworn \nto, to uphold the Constitution, to provide for the general welfare, to \npay the debts and provide for posterity.\n  So I find this rather amazing, that those who already, at the highest \nlevel of Government, have a major responsibility to carry out the \npublic trust, who are already on record in town meeting after town \nmeeting, before \n[[Page S3100]]  editorial board after editorial board, in campaign \npromise after campaign promise. They came to Washington to balance the \nbudget and they have not done it. They have the power today, and they \nhave not exercised it.\n  Here we are, suggesting to the American people that new words on a \npiece of paper, enshrining a different concept, will give them the \nmoral force to accomplish what nothing but the lack of personal moral \ncommitment prevents them from doing today, right now. It seems to me \nthere ought to be as much concern about flouting our current \nresponsibility as there is some prospective future responsibility.\n  Again, I say I am prepared to say no filibuster. I will vote for \ncloture on any motion on any issue whatever with respect to the budget, \nproviding we agree we are going to try to move toward this goal. I am \nprepared to come to the floor and say I will vote for the line-item \nveto and I will vote against the tax cuts. How you can run around \noffering America $700 billion of tax cuts when you are in this kind of \ntrouble, with the exception of what you may need to help the work \nforce--balance it against education and reeducation--is beyond me.\n  What if you were to accept the notion that there is a legitimacy to \nthe argument of having some new moral force? What if you were to accept \nthe notion that perhaps it is worthwhile to have a constitutional \nstatement that says we ought to adopt a fiscal balanced budget \napproach? I think that is possible as a principle. But it seems to me \nif you are going to do that, you ought to deal with the Constitution as \na true conservative in a neutral and fair manner. It seems to me we \nhave an equal responsibility to amend the Constitution in a way that it \ndoes not do more injury than good, in a way that does not ignore the \nfundamental relationships of this democracy, and in a way that does not \ncreate the potential for serious economic problems while never even \nguaranteeing the goal that it sets out to achieve.\n  Tragically, this amendment as it is currently drafted is neither fair \nnor neutral. We have tried on our side to adjust that issue of fairness \nby dealing with the issue of the courts, by dealing with the question \nof capital budget and other issues. At each step, we have been \nrebuffed. I believe this amendment in its current form goes well beyond \nfiscal responsibility and, most importantly, it constitutionalizes the \npolitics of the moment. It takes the immediate political agenda of the \ncurrent majority and constitutionalizes it in a way that may ultimately \ndo violence to the genius of the Constitution and to our form of \ndemocracy.\n  When the veneer is stripped from this amendment before us, I think \nyou can see a deeply troubling political motive that goes beyond just \ntrying to balance the budget, which by definition could not be the only \nreason for this amendment since the proponents know that they already \nhave the authority to just balance the budget. They are in the \nmajority: Balance it.\n  No, I think this amendment goes further than just balancing the \nbudget. It goes to the heart of the democratic process and it is one of \nthe reasons why, in its current form, I have the most difficulty with \nthis amendment, because it carries with it a fundamental shift in the \ndecisionmaking in America. It is, as I said, an attempt to \nconstitutionalize a particular ideology, which is not illegitimate. I \nam not contesting the legitimacy of the belief system. What I am \ncontesting is whether or not you want to take that current, ephemeral \nmajority view and constitutionalize it, which truly runs counter to the \nnotion of being conservative.\n  It shields a momentary ideological party view from the fundamental \ndemocratic concept of majority rule.\n  How does it do that? The proponents of this amendment are insisting \nthat both Houses of Congress find 60 percent of their membership, not \njust 60 percent of those present and voting, but 60 percent of their \nmembership; a fixed number must be found in order to do something, in \nthis case to run a deficit, to raise revenues in any way, whether \nthrough user fees or taxes. And, in doing that, everything I read, \neverything I studied and looked at, says to me: alarm bell, red light. \nStop. Take a look at this. Make a sounder judgment for history and for \nthe future.\n  That would usurp the power of a majority to disagree. Those who are \nusing this amendment as a weapon in an ideological war do not want the \nvotes of those who think differently from them to count as much as \ntheirs. It is that simple. If you believe that you may ever reach a \ndifferent conclusion than they have, they want to make certain that \nyour vote does not count equally by requiring that you have to find a \nsupermajority to fight back.\n  We are here as passing custodians of an extraordinary trust. These \ndesks do not belong to us. These chairs do not. This room does not. We \nare the custodians of the Constitution, an extraordinary document, \nunparalleled in the course of human events. That document is based on \nthe notion of majority rule, and to take that now, and suggest that you \nare going to require a supermajority to stop some particular action \nthat is a mere choice of policy--fiscal policy, at that--is to suggest \nthat those votes do not count as much for something that a current view \nsuggests is popular. It is fundamentally undemocratic. It is \nfundamentally revolutionary in the worst sense of the word.\n  That is not all that I think is wrong, though that ought to be \nenough, conceivably, in this current draft. The amendment also allows \nus to cast a vote that permits us to escape the current responsibility \nand only require that this take place 7 years from now. Which means 7 \nyears from now, you have to find the $322 billion projected as the \ndeficit for 2002, but you do not have to do anything for 7 years.\n  I have been listening to my friends come to the floor and tally up \neach day the amount of interest we are losing just in this debate. That \nis really good television for the purposes of the debate, but what \nhappens to America when this debate is over? What happens next year? \nThe year after? The year after?\n  They are not saying they have to do it now. They only have to do it 7 \nyears from now. This truly becomes the politician's freedom from \nresponsibility act.\n  We were not elected to escape our responsibilities or pass \nlegislative initiatives that further obfuscate the tough choices. If we \nattempt to escape through the passage of this amendment, then I think \nwe fail ourselves and we fail the Framers of the Constitution and, most \nimportant, we fail the American people.\n  I think it is a cruel hoax to suggest to the American people--as the \nContract With America does--you may disagree about the full amount of \ntax cuts, but no one will disagree that there are big tax cuts in that \ncontract, whether it is $700 billion or $500 billion. It is enough to \nstill make it stick in your throat, when you add that to the already \ngargantuan task of finding $1.23 trillion between now and the year \n2002.\n  Mr. President, I think the U.S. Senate really owes the American \npeople a higher level of honesty and we ought to have the courage to \ntell the truth and to do what is right. One of those truths was with \nrespect to Social Security. I do not disagree that Social Security \nneeds fixing. I think Social Security is legitimately on the table with \nrespect to how you adequately fund it into the next century, because \nmore and more Americans are going to be drawing down on it, with fewer \nand fewer paying in. There is a legitimate question of whether or not \nwe can afford to pay out huge sums beyond what people put in. But that \nis a question for the Social Security trust fund, not for balancing the \nbudget. And the promise made to the American people was that this is a \nfund for retirement. It is insurance against poverty, and it should not \nbe used as an instrument to balance the budget. It is obviously \nupsetting that this has not been made as clear as I think it ought to \nbe. I do not see how you can tell senior citizens that you are acting \nin good faith with respect to this effort if you are not willing to \nmake that separation clear--up front.\n  Mr. President, for obvious reasons this is not an easy choice for \nanybody--I think for many people at least. There is a current fervor in \nthe country and anger that says we want to balance the budget; solve \nour fiscal problems; cure it. So there is a quick instinct to want to \ndo what is popular and to say, hey, maybe we ought to pass the balanced \nbudget amendment, throw caution to the wind, and do it. \n[[Page S3101]]  Mr. President, we were sent here to exercise a more \nsignificant responsibility than reacting to current popular perception. \nWe swore to do that when we each stood at the other side of the well, \nraised our hands, and swore to this body and to family and friends and \nNation that we would uphold the Constitution.\n  I think that requirement requires a more sober reflection about what \nthis really does. What does the fine print really do? What is the \nimpact of the courts? We are a Nation that already regurgitates over \ncourt involvement in our lives. The city of Boston came to understand \nthat only too well in the process of court-ordered busing. There is \nalso a national sentiment against the courts making decisions for \npeople who want to make them for themselves.\n  This amendment is not going to improve that situation for Americans, \nif Congress fails to show the will that it could show today. And if the \narguments of the proponents are so true then indeed you have to show \nthat you are able to find some new willpower. What is the difference in \nfinding the willpower from putting it in the Constitution versus \nfinding the willpower from the oath we have already sworn?\n  Mr. President, there is this sense of popular rush to judgment here. \nBut I suggest that we owe the country and the Constitution a slower, \nmore deliberate process in keeping with the notion that this is the \ndeliberative body that is meant to be the check and balance.\n  I have decided to vote against this particular constitutional \namendment, as it is drafted today, principally because I have come to \nbelieve that it is an ill-advised attempt to memorialize in the \nfundamental governing document of this democracy one political party's \nagenda in such a way as to jeopardize majority rule, and change in a \nradical way what the Founding Fathers set out to do.\n  I will do so because this draft leaves a dangerous ambiguity existing \nabout court involvement because it establishes an unrealistic and \nprobably dangerous straitjacket on economic choices to respond to bumps \nand downturns in the economy, and because it sets the American people \nup for more political gimmickry and does so by putting the Constitution \nat risk.\n  Mr. President, as I said, there is a deep concern that we all should \nfeel when we are about to exercise this most significant \nresponsibility. Our Constitution--and I am sure my colleagues feel \nthis--is indeed a magnificent document. I am not suggesting that my \ncolleague on the other side holds a different view of it. I do not \nbelieve that. But we can have different interpretations as to what \nimpact our actions will have on it. I believe that the brilliance, the \nprofound simplicity, and the timeless articulation of fundamental \nprinciples like majority rule are worth keeping.\n  I know that the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator \nByrd, believes that we cannot alter the fundamental governing document \nof this Nation without deep deliberation and compelling reason, and I \nagree with that. Any amending of the Constitution should be done in the \nsame spirit as the writing of the Constitution itself--with an \noverriding commitment to fairness, and to what is in the best interest \nof the Nation.\n  The Federalist Papers speak to us very clearly of that \nresponsibility. I just do not believe that that fairness governs the \ncurrent draft of this constitutional amendment. Indeed, I think that in \nits current draft, because of the problems I have cited, it represents \na kind of Trojan horse, because it has one set of rules for treatment \nof the deficit--the three-fifths majority--and another set of rules for \nthe current majority of the Congress, who may wish to reduce or shift \nsources of revenue. One value of votes for revenue, one value of votes \nfor deficit. That is not what the framers of the Constitution intended.\n  I know my colleagues are coming to the floor and saying how \nfrustrating it is and we want to balance this budget, but we are not \nable to do this, so we have to do that. In fact, Mr. President, we do \nnot have to. All we have to do is get the 60-plus Senators to come and \nagree, no filibuster, 51 votes. You do not have to change the balance \nof 60 and 51. The reason you do that is that there is something else \nthat is trying to be achieved, and it is not the fairness, and it is \nnot the neutrality for the process that the Constitution demands.\n  Mr. President, we obviously cannot amend the Constitution simply \nbecause it is fashionable, and we certainly should not do it as a \nsymbolic gesture to score political points or to further personal \nideology. We ought to do it because there is an overwhelming national \ninterest that cannot be reached without doing it. There is no expert \nthat I have read in all of these documents of this debate who can say \nwith a certainty that this amendment will result in a balanced budget.\n  In fact, most experts say it will not result in a balanced budget, \nand that it may be unenforceable, which results in an extraordinary \ncourt battle that could tip the balance of power in this democracy. Who \nhere can imagine judges deciding whether you build a particular defense \nprogram, or whether you move a bridge or a highway? Who here wants \njudges deciding what portion of the budget to cut and how to raise \ntaxes? There is no expert who has suggested that there will not be some \ncourt cases.\n  There is no expert who has said with any certainty that there is a \ncompelling national interest that can be defined and met by the current \ndraft of this amendment. But the most compelling arguments against this \namendment, as drafted, Mr. President, come from the real experts, the \nframers of the Constitution who, were they here on this floor, I am \nconfident would vote against this amendment because it tampers with the \nConstitution's most fundamental principle of majority rule, and the \npreservation of our ability to act in the national interest in an \nemergency.\n  Mr. President, if fairness were the real consideration here, and if \nyou absolutely felt you had to have a balanced budget amendment that \ncreates this new moral power, then you could do so by passing an \namendment that requires 51 votes with an exception, obviously, for \nstate of war or national emergency, economic and national disaster, and \nyou do not have to do it, clearly, in a way that leaves open the court \nissue. But, you can close the court issue by simply taking them out of \nthe process within the context of the implementing legislation.\n  Mr. President, I believe, if you read the Federalist Papers, they \nmake it about as clear as it could be. In Federalist 22, Hamilton \ncalled a quorum of more than a majority ``poison for a deliberative \nassembly.'' That is what is being created here--what Hamilton called \npoison. He pointedly notes:\n\n       The necessity of unanimity in public bodies, or of \n     something approaching towards it, has been founded upon a \n     supposition that it would contribute to security. But its \n     real operation is to embarrass the administration, to destroy \n     the energy of Government, and to substitute the pleasure, \n     caprice, or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or \n     corrupt junto to the regular deliberations and decisions of a \n     respectable majority.\n\n  That is about as clear as you can get. He goes on to say:\n\n       The public business must in some way or other go forward. \n     If a pertinacious minority, respecting the best mode of \n     conducting it, the majority in order to something may be done \n     must conform to the views of the minority; and thus the sense \n     of the smaller number will overrule that of the greater and \n     give a tone to the national proceedings.\n\n  Hamilton was worried that the requirement of more than a majority \nwould allow the minority to rule simply by not showing up.\n  When you require the fixed number of a House, not the fixed number of \nthose present and voting, you have given to the minority the capacity \nnot even to participate, and by not participating, they win. That is a \ntyranny of the minority. That is not majority rule.\n  Hamilton said, ``Its situation must always savor of weakness, \nsometimes border on anarchy.''\n  Mr. President, Hamilton feared that requiring more than a majority \nwould effectively paralyze the Government's ability to act and could \nresult in anarchy. Harsh and outrageous as that possibility may sound, \nthose who threaten majority rule could threaten the power of the \nFederal Government by limiting its ability to act at all. All of us \nknow how frustrating it can be to bring some issue to the floor, how \nlong it takes, and how easy it is for one or two Members to frustrate \nthe process. If you \n[[Page S3102]]  have to find that magical number, more than the \nmajoritarian rule, you are already shifting the power in a remarkable \nway. A minority could limit the Government's ability to raise revenue, \nhowever unpopular that might be, or its ability to expend funds, and \ntherefore limit what Hamilton called in Federalist 33 ``The most \nimportant of the authorities of the Federal Government.''\n  This amendment as drafted, Mr. President, is political dogma \ndisguised as economic policy. It is the continuation of the ongoing \neffort to demonize certain national interests by demonizing those who \npromote any kind of national program to protect the American concept of \ncommunity.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, is the Senator finished?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much longer will the Senator be?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have probably another 10 or so minutes. I \nknow there is a 3 o'clock deadline. I do not want to delay any of my \ncolleagues. If I could, I will ask unanimous consent that I could \nfinish my comments, and I would be happy to yield for the purpose of \npermitting an amendment to be called up, if I can retain my rights to \nthe floor thereafter.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate my colleague for saying that. At 2:55, would \nit be OK if our colleague would yield so the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia can call up an amendment and I can call up four amendments?\n  Mr. KERRY. I would be happy to delay for a moment now and let my \nfriend from Utah call them up, or anybody else, if there is an \nunderstanding that I can simply return to complete my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Massachusetts?\n  Without objection, the Senator may yield without losing his right to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could ask the Senator, we just need to call these up \nright before the time expires at 3. Ours have to be called up last.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/24/senate-section/article/S3081-5", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senator--except for that \ninterruption--be permitted to complete his remarks today, and then the \nSenator from Missouri be able to complete his remarks, and the Senator \nfrom Florida be able to complete his remarks and then the Senator from \nCalifornia be able to complete her remarks, in that order, following \nthe amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is my fear that this amendment as it is \ncurrently drafted--and I want to emphasize that--begins the process \nthat may permit an erosion of Government's ability to protect certain \ninterests of every American based on a concept of majority rule. It \nbegins to institutionalize a particular judgment, an economic judgment, \nagainst a whole set of other judgments which may, at some point in the \nnot too distant future, be the majority view or general interest of the \ncountry, but not sufficient to gain 60 votes--but, nevertheless, \nsufficient to have 51 votes. They could be precluded from then \nrepresenting those interests. That is, I think, upon reflection, a \ngenuine threat to the notion of the democratic process.\n  I do not question the sincerity or the intention of those who believe \nthat this is a bad idea whose time has come. But, Mr. President, I \nthink we have to wonder whether we are not on a very dangerous path to \nfundamental changes in how we govern without the due process that our \ndemocracy demands.\n  The potential of minority rule on an issue as fundamental as raising \nrevenues, I think, begins a dangerous process of beginning to dissolve \nwhatever is left of America's spirit of community by limiting our \nability to make decisions that go beyond city limits and State borders, \nand that may, in fact, be very unpopular, but we have to, if we are \ngoing to serve the Nation, preserve the flexibility and capacity for \nthat kind of unpopular decision to be made.\n  So this debate is not really about specifically spending cuts. It is \nnot about good economic policy. It is about the proliferation into the \nConstitution itself of a particular philosophy of the moment that \nalmost suggests that the concept of community is lesser than the \nconcept of individual interests. I do not believe that, Mr. President. \nI think if we are going to maintain the community the Founding Fathers \nconceived of, then you have to maintain the majoritarian approach.\n  Mr. President, an awful lot of people a lot wiser than me have, \nfrankly, found fault with this amendment based on that perception; that \nthere is a shift in the balance of power between the branches of \nGovernment and that that is dangerous.\n  Walter Dellinger, an Assistant Attorney General, testified that:\n\n       Should the measure be enforced by the judiciary, it would \n     produce an unprecedented restructuring of the balance of \n     power between the branches of government. If it proves \n     unenforceable, it would create quite a different but equally \n     troubling hazard by writing an empty promise into the \n     fundamental charter of our Government. It would breathe \n     cynicism about our Government and diminish respect for the \n     Constitution of the United States and the rule of law.\n\n  He goes on to say that,\n\n       The Constitution, as written by the framers, did not \n     contain choices. It rather empowered people to enact the \n     choices,\n\nspecifically, the kind of choices that I read that we have sworn to \nmake in section 8 of article I.\n  He argues that a balanced budget amendment simply declares that \noutlays shall not exceed expenditures without ever explaining how this \ndesirable state of affairs is going to come about and without \nspecifying who among the Government officials should be empowered to \nensure that the amendment is not violated or, if violated, how the \nNation is brought into compliance.\n  The distinguished Harvard law school professor, Archibald Cox, \nopposes such an amendment for four reasons.\n  First, he said,\n\n       The amendment would damage the Constitution by introducing \n     matters foreign to its fundamental and traditional purposes. \n     It would undermine confidence in the Constitution by holding \n     out an appearance of guarantees that will surely prove \n     illusory. It would spawn disputes and charges of violation \n     without providing either the means of resolving disputes or \n     remedies for the actual threatened violations, except to \n     bring in the courts. And that exception,\n\nhe said,\n\n     [[Page S3103]] brings me to the last point, that the \n     amendment risks bringing the courts into a field for which \n     they are totally unequipped by experience.\n\n  On the politics of this amendment and the ruling of the majority on \npolitical issues, Professor Cox said,\n\n       Deciding whether or when to balance the budget or whether \n     or when to risk a deficit calls for a judgment of policy, the \n     kind of political judgment wisely left by the Founding \n     Fathers to the majoritarian processes of representative \n     government.\n\n  Mr. President, constitutional scholars have lined up against this \namendment and have presented powerful arguments that raise serious \nquestions about the impact of what we are about to do.\n  Another scholar, Kathleen Sullivan, expressed concerns about placing \neconomic theory in the governing document of the Nation. She said, ``I \noppose the amendment because I believe it would seriously undermine our \nestablished constitutional framework if it were adopted and enforced. \nEither way,'' she said, ``these constitutional harms would far outweigh \nthe meager benefits the amendment is likely to bring about in advancing \nits distinguished sponsors' entirely worthy goal of achieving national \nfiscal discipline.'' She goes on to quote Justice Holmes, saying that:\n\n       He was right when he warned: ``The Constitution ought not \n     embody a particular economic theory, be it that of Spencer or \n     Keynes.''\n\n  And about majority rule, she quotes Madison from Federalist 58, who \nargued that ``requiring the supermajority to pass ordinary legislation \nturns democracy on its head.''\n  Mr. President, the scholar that I was commenting on, Kathleen \nSullivan, said about the issue of majority rule that in Federalist 58, \nMadison himself said that requiring a supermajority to pass ordinary \nlegislation turns democracy on its head, and she jokingly but \naccurately pointed out the single most predictable consequence of a \nbalanced budget amendment might well be a period of full employment for \nlawyers.\n  Mr. President, I believe Prof. Charles Fried of Harvard Law School \nhas made one of the most compelling arguments against this amendment as \nit currently appears before the Senate. He said:\n\n       Majority rule is the rule that best expresses democracy. It \n     best expresses it for health care, for defense, for the \n     writing of criminal legislation with death penalties and for \n     the passing of budgets--whether in surplus, in balance, or in \n     deficit. To put this all more practically, the balanced \n     budget amendment would just make it that much harder to \n     govern, giving those who want to put obstacles in the way of \n     government new opportunities for obstruction.\n\n  Professor Fried points out a balanced budget amendment would give \n``Any president a far better claim to impound funds than that which was \nasserted some 20 years ago by President Nixon,'' because the \nPresident's warrant would be drawn from, as President Nixon said it \nwas, inherent powers of the Presidency. He could point to the \nConstitution itself and then he could argue it is his duty to do so.\n  Mr. President, it is not inconsequential if the President of the \nUnited States is permitted to impound. We will have created yet another \nshift in the balance of power, which I believe Members here would want \nto think twice about, no matter who is in the Presidency or which party \ncontrols the White House.\n  Professor Fried says passage of this amendment would inevitably \ninvolve the courts in what he calls ``subtle and intricate legal \nquestions, and the litigation that would ensue would be gruesome, \nintrusive, and not at all edifying.''\n  He argues, Mr. President, against this amendment and I think everyone \nknows that Prof. Charles Fried, former solicitor general, is certainly \none of the more conservative members of the legal profession. He argues \nagainst this amendment as ``Undemocratic and against the spirit of the \nConstitution.'' He says that when our Constitution withdraws a subject \nmatter from majority rule, as it does in the Bill of Rights and the \n14th amendment, it does so because there are things which no government \nmay ever do. It may never abridge freedom of speech, no matter how \nstrong the majority, and therefore it is withdrawn from majority rule.\n  His point is this: In no issue on which it is legitimately in the \npurview of this Government to rule is anything but a simple majority \never required with respect to policy issues.\n  Mr. President, majority rule ought to be held as the sacred standard \nof this body. If not, then we embark on a course that could be \ndangerous, indeed.\n  Dr. Fried said something that gave me pause beyond what I have \nquoted. In a most dramatic and compelling statement before the \ncommittee that summarizes the fundamental flaws of this current draft \nof the balanced budget amendment, he said something that I hope would \ngive each person some pause no matter what their position on this \namendment is.\n  It is a particular perspective about what we are about to do. \nProfessor Fried said:\n\n       A balanced budget in any form, if it is workable, is a bad \n     idea. The reason is simply that the political judgments \n     underlying the amendment, sound and important though they \n     are, are just that--political judgments--and as such they \n     should not be withdrawn from the vicissitudes of ordinary \n     majoritarian politics that the Constitution establishes as \n     the general rule for our public life as a Nation. I am not \n     entitled to have my bias against Government spending \n     enshrined in the Constitution to frustrate the will of my \n     fellow citizens expressed by a majority of our \n     representatives.\n\n  I think that is a simple but powerful observation that goes to the \nheart of what is about to happen here, if this amendment is passed. We \nwill enshrine a national bias against a particular choice of fiscal \npolicy for all time; notwithstanding, however, that the political \nlandscape may change.\n  The Constitution, Mr. President, as we all know, survives beyond each \nperson here. And it ought to remain the same beacon of democracy that \nit has been for all time. It should not be a hodgepodge of popular \ngimmicks from one generation to the other. It should not become a means \nof addressing every difficult problem that we face as a people, and as \na Nation. And it certainly should not be used as a cover for the \nunwillingness of Congress to exercise the will that it has the power to \nexercise today.\n  So, Mr. President, it is my hope that those few people who may remain \nundecided will think hard, in the hours ahead, about the weight of the \nConstitution and the history that we, in the Senate, are responsible \nfor. It is my hope that, in the end, people will choose not to burden \nthe Constitution with this particular moment's idea, but rather to come \nto the floor of the U.S. Senate prepared to do what we have the power \nto do today.\n  I would close simply by repeating what I said previously: I am \nprepared to stay here now--through the next months--with an \nunderstanding that we will not have a filibuster, but that we will come \nup with a budget that sets us on the course to a balanced budget. Let \n51 votes decide. If the American people decide that they are unhappy \nwith that judgment, then the next election can be about just that.\n  We should not continue to use the process of delay for a small \ncluster of people on either side of the fence to frustrate the capacity \nof this body to make a judgment in the interests of the country, \nwhether that judgment may be correct or incorrect. It is not for a \nsmall group to decide now that the judgment cannot be made at all. That \nfrustrates the intent of the framers of the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, we do not have to pass an amendment. We could just get \n60 people to sign a letter, each of them saying, ``I am committing, \nthis year, to passing a balanced budget over the next 7 years, 10 \nyears, 15 years and guaranteeing that the expenditure line and the \nrevenue line of this country are turned around and brought together at \nsome point in time.''\n  It seems to me that all we have to do is read the Constitution of the \nUnited States, once again. All we have to do is understand that \nwhatever increased moral authority people believe they will get by \npassing this amendment, if the courts are not able to make the \njudgment--if the courts are, God save us all-- but if they are not, \nthis will ultimately hinge on whether we have to enforce section 6 to \nmake this real. That comes down, to an exercise of the very same \nconstitutional power we have today, when each Member swore here to \nuphold the Constitution, provide for the common defense, and promote \nthe general welfare, and when we swore we would exercise our power \n[[Page S3104]]  under section 8 to pay the debts and provide for the \ncommon defense and general welfare of the United States.\n  We have the constitutional authority and power today. We lack the \nwill. I hope the American people understand that this gimmick will not \nprovide for the will that each of us should have come with to this \ninstitution in the first place.\n  Mr. President, I repeat: I am prepared for the first time to vote for \na line-item veto. I am prepared to vote against the tax cuts with the \nexception of education, which I think is critical, and I am prepared to \npose further cuts than are currently on the table.\n  But I am also prepared to find revenue, if it is needed, in an effort \nto be real about this and avoid the continued gimmickry which \nfrustrates the will of the American people.\n  Mr. President, are we at the moment that we should turn to the \namendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Are there further amendments to \nbe called up under the unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the hour of 3 o'clock has arrived, and no \nfurther amendments can be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. No further amendments \nare in order.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am grateful for this opportunity to \nmake remarks about the most important action that we will be taking \nduring this session of the U.S. Congress: A vote on a balanced budget \namendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  Of course, there have been a number of reasons elevated for our \ninspection by those who oppose the amendment, and I think inspection is \nwhat they deserve.\n  There are those who say that there are no problems with the \nConstitution, there are only problems with us as Members of the Senate. \nThat is what constitutions are for. Rules are designed to correct \nproblems in the way the players play the game. There are no problems \nwith the rules of the basketball game, but you have to have a rule \nagainst fouling or the game gets out of hand.\n  Mr. President, the Constitution of the United States is full of ways \nof correcting abuses which would otherwise occur--because we would have \nproblems as Members of the Senate in making correct judgments--absent \nthe parameters of the Constitution.\n  When the Constitution of the United States starts in the Bill of \nRights by saying ``Congress shall have no power,'' it recognizes that \nthe problem may be in Congress, and that the way to correct it is to \nhave a framework which forbids Congress from engaging in the abuses \nwhich are hurting the American people or which might hurt the American \npeople.\n  So for Members of this body to suggest that we do not need an \namendment to the Constitution--because the problem is a problem of this \nbody, or the individuals who populate this body, Mr. President--is to \nsuggest that, ``Well, we don't need a Constitution, we just all have to \nact appropriately.''\n  It reminds me of the famous phrase out of Tammany Hall: ``What is the \nConstitution among friends? Ignore it, we don't need it, we can just \nall act properly.''\n  Constitutions, charters of government, are--and have been from the \nMagna Carta forward--established on the basis of an understanding that \npeople will not always act properly and, therefore, we need the \nrestriction, we need the confinement, we need the guidance, we need the \ndirection, we need the regulation of a document that protects us from \nabuses.\n  Interestingly enough, the balanced budget amendment is not really a \nprotection for us against abuses. Oh, yes, we have been abused, but \nthose who have been abused most dramatically are those who are not here \nyet. They are the children of the next generation. They are the \nindividuals who have not yet gone to school, let alone gone to work. \nThey are the people whose wages we are now spending before they even go \nto work. We are spending them to satisfy our appetite for program after \nprogram, for policy after policy, for interest group after interest \ngroup, in a wild credit card binge across America, buying votes for the \nnext election to the U.S. Congress, be it the House of Representatives \nor the Senate.\n  We must curtail that, Mr. President. It is suggested by our friends--\nas the esteemed Senator from Massachusetts just a few moments ago \nsuggested--that it is undemocratic to have a provision in the \nConstitution which would require that 60 votes in the Senate be \nrequired in the event you wanted to go into debt, asserting that it is \nundemocratic not to let the representatives of over 50 votes be able to \nhave equal weight.\n  But I am worried about the votes of the next generation. I think it \nis undemocratic for this body to encumber the next generation, to say \nto the children of the next century they will not have an opportunity \nto decide how the tax revenues of their America will be spent because \nwe will spend their taxes for them now.\n  We are talking about a fundamental problem here. It is a problem of \ntaxation without representation and, yes, the problem is in the Senate, \nthe problem is in human nature. And one of the reasons you have \nconstitutions is not to say that if everyone acts at their best and \nhighest level of responsibility we would not need it. The reason is \nthat we know that there will be times of weakness, when in spite of all \nthe good intentions, those good intentions will not lead us to do the \nright thing.\n  That is why the first amendment to the Constitution says, ``Congress \nshall make no law,'' and as you get to the amendments added on through \nthe amendment process, over and over again we have seen the wisdom of \nsaying that Congress shall not be able to impair principles which are \nimportant to the future of this democracy. And that is where we are at \nthis very moment in time.\n  It is fundamentally important, Mr. President, that we say about the \nnext generation that we will build a hedge between them and the \nspending habits of the U.S. Congress so that we in this body do not \nspend their birthright. Taxation without representation was the core, \nit was the kernel of the revolution, which grew and finally flourished \nin freedom--which has not only found its way from the Atlantic to the \nPacific, but has found its way around the globe, nation after nation \nmodeled on what we did here in America. But that revolution was a \nfundamental response to authorities somewhere else taxing us without \nrepresentation.\n  I submit that that is exactly what we in this body have been doing by \njeopardizing the future of the next generation. We have simply said to \nthe next generation--without telling them because they are not here to \nhear us--that we are going to spend your money this way and we hope you \nare productive when you get here, because when you earn the money, it \nwill be taken to pay for the excesses, to pay for the desires, to pay \nfor the programs, to pay for our catering to special interests in our \ngeneration.\n  It is time we stop that. It is true that we could stop it without an \namendment to the Constitution, but will we--or have we?\n  Over and over again in the debate, we have had it brought to our \nattention that through the eighties and even in the seventies and even \nas early as the sixties, there were resolutions of this body and there \nwere laws enacted that would pry us out of the pattern of deficit \nspending--but absent a strong wall in the Constitution to protect those \nyet unborn generations, we have always managed to find our way to do \nwhat is expedient for the next election--not the next generation. It is \ntime now for us to make such a commitment.\n  The idea that the pending amendment to the Constitution somehow would \nimpair us from doing all the responsible things that our colleagues \nhave said they would like to do--and I commend the Senator from \nMassachusetts for his willingness to say that he will support a line-\nitem veto and that he will support cloture on it so that we can get \nreal votes on expenditures--is inaccurate. Nothing in this proposed \namendment, nothing in this resolution, \n[[Page S3106]]  would stop any Member of the Senate from engaging in \nthat kind of responsible behavior in the next days and weeks and months \nto come.\n  Mr. President, nothing in this amendment would stop this body, in \nconjunction with the House of Representatives, with the cooperation of \nthe President of the United States, from implementing a balanced budget \nat an earlier time. Nothing in this proposed amendment to the \nConstitution would impair a responsible Congress from doing what it \nought to do.\n  So we have all the authority to do what is right that we have ever \nhad--but our problem has not been the absence of authority to do what \nis right. Our problem is the absence of a prohibition against doing \nwhat is wrong. And in the absence of that prohibition against doing \nwhat is wrong--spending the resources of the next generation--we find \nourselves over and over again deeper and deeper in debt.\n  The President of the United States last year indicated that there \nwould be reduced deficits and there would be a continuing decline in \nthe level of deficits, and that commitment lasted almost a full year. \nThen this year's budget came out, and did we find ourselves with \nreduced deficits on a steady decline toward a balanced budget? No, \nthere was simply a concession. The big white towel came out of the \ncorner into the middle of the ring and we conceded that there would be \ndeficits over $200 billion on average for the next decade, and who \nknows what thereafter.\n  Again, the problem is not that we already have the authority to do \nwhat is right, the problem is that we are not prohibited from doing \nwhat is wrong. And what is wrong is spending the resources, spending \nthe inheritance, spending the birthright, of the next generation. It is \nspending my kids' wages before they graduate from college. It is \nspending my grandchildren's opportunity to be productive in a world \neconomy that is going to demand productivity, and if they are spending \nall of their resources on interest on our debt, if they have to tax \npeople and businesses to pay for prior years' excesses--our excesses--\nthey are not going to be competitive in a marketplace that requires \nproductivity.\n  No, Mr. President. We, and they, will find ourselves sliding back \ninto the backwater of the swamp of those nations that are incapable of \nbeing on the cutting edge.\n  It is time for us as a body to make a commitment to America's future. \nIt is time for us to say, yes, the budget was balanced for well over \n150 years except in time of war. It was a tacit agreement, it was an \nunderstanding, it was honored as if it were in the Constitution--but we \ndo not have, apparently, the stature or the will or the capacity to do \nit now.\n  Nothing in the proposed amendment would keep us from doing it. But \nlet us just ensure that we build this firewall between the next \ngeneration and the spending habits of the U.S. Congress, that we build \na bulwark and we save those grandchildren--the next generation--from \nour spending habits. Let us say that as for us, as for me and my house, \nas for the Senate, as for this Government, as for this Nation, we will \nbe responsible.\n  If the 1994 elections meant anything, I think they meant that the \npeople of the United States rejected a Congress that was arrogant--a \nCongress so arrogant that it passed laws for other people to live by \nbut that the Congress did not have to live by, a Congress so arrogant \nthat it would tell State and local governments what to do, thinking \nthat it had been elected to do State and local tasks as well as \nnational tasks, and a Congress so arrogant that it spends the money of \nthe next generation as well as the resources of its own.\n  I think the people of America expect us to repudiate that behavior \npattern, Mr. President. But frankly, they expect us to enact a \nconstitutional amendment to assure them the pattern does not happen \nagain. Time after time, they have listened to the U.S. Congress \nrepudiate ways that were going to balance the budget. They have heard \nproposals indicating that there would be special withholdings to make \nsure that it did not happen, and time after time they have watched--\nsometimes when the curtain was drawn, sometimes when it was in full \nview--they have watched the U.S. Congress, having made a solemn oath, \nhaving made a legal commitment in a statute, turn around and change \nthat statute.\n  The tragedy is that the U.S. Congress can change the rules for the \nU.S. Congress, and so a statute is not enough, a resolution is not \nenough, a sense of the Senate is not enough. The tragedy is that we can \nchange our own rules, and we have changed them over and over again. \nThat is the tragedy.\n  However, there is also beauty, Mr. President. The beauty is that the \nU.S. Congress cannot change the U.S. Constitution by itself, and so \nwhere we failed as a body in the past because we were always able to \nchange the rules in the law, I believe we now have a chance for success \nif we put the pending rule in the Constitution--for this is not the \ntransitory whim of just a majority in the Senate.\n  For this resolution to become the law of the land in the Constitution \nof the United States, it will take the ratification of three-quarters \nof the States, of the United States of America, to change it and adjust \nit. To erode it or impair it would take a similar consensus by all the \nStates as well as this Congress.\n  And I believe at any of those junctures during the last three decades \nwhen the Congress weakened, we would not have found three-quarters of \nthe States willing to weaken with them. Not on your life. The people of \nAmerica would have said, stay the course. Let us make sure we maintain \nour commitment to a balanced budget.\n  It is time for us to enact the balanced budget amendment because it \nwould stay the course, Mr. President.\n  Yes, the problem is a problem with the Congress. But the way to \nremedy the problem with the Congress is to build a wall between the \nCongress and the next generation.\n  Just to take us back for a moment in history, this Nation was founded \nas a result of a commitment that it was morally wrong and politically \nimproper for one group to tax another group without its consent. The \nnet result of the Currency and Revenue Act of 1764, undertaken by the \nBritish to end the smuggling trade on molasses as well as to raise \nadditional revenue, was to give British sugargrowers an effective \nmonopoly on the colonial sugar market, and it irritated the colonists, \nit irritated Americans because we were being taxed without \nrepresentation.\n  The Stamp Act of 1765, well known to every schoolchild, extended to \nAmerica a broadly based form of direct taxation that had long been in \nuse in Great Britain, and the colonists simply said ``no taxation \nwithout representation.'' It is a principle embedded in the very depths \nof American history and in our character.\n  Patrick Henry, in response to that Stamp Act of 1765, said, ``The \ncolonists are entitled to all privileges and immunities of natural born \ncitizens, to all intents and purposes as if they had been abiding in \nand born within the realm of England''--meaning no taxation without \nrepresentation, a fundamental guarantee as old as the founding \ndocuments in Great Britain.\n  The Townshend duties of 1767 were passed to raise revenues on imports \nto this country, widely used imports like tea and window glass. And you \nknow what happened with the Tea Act of 1773. And over and over again--\nthe Coercive Act of 1774. All of these became a part of the very fabric \nof American life as did our resistance to taxation without \nrepresentation.\n  And what are we doing when we have deficit spending? Are we taxing \nourselves? No. We are taxing the next generation over and over and over \nagain, thousands of dollars. Every man, woman, and child born in the \nUnited States comes into this world not with a clean slate but with a \ndebt load. And we must make sure that when the Statue of Liberty holds \nhigh her lamp beside the golden door, it is not a lamp eliminated by a \ndebtor nation; that it is a lamp of opportunity, not a lamp of \nresponsibility to pay off the debts of previous generations.\n  A rising $4.9 trillion debt amounts to taxation without \nrepresentation. There is no other way to categorize it. I think of the \nyoung person, not old enough to vote, in the American Revolution, \nNathan Hale, captured by the British. They handle him in the rough \njustice of wartime, and they decide to hang him as a traitor to the \ncrown. And before he dies, he inspires us with the words, ``I regret \nthat I have but one life \n[[Page S3107]]  to give for my country.'' Nathan Hale, looking to the \nfuture, is willing to sacrifice himself. What a contrast, Mr. \nPresident, to where we stand in the United States today. Looking only \nto ourselves, we are willing to sacrifice the future.\n  Nathan Hale says, ``I regret that I have but one life to give for my \ncountry.'' In this body we say we regret we have but one next \ngeneration to mortgage for our appetites.\n  We must cease. We cannot continue. It is beyond what free people \nshould do to one another. But even more importantly, we should be \nunwilling to provide a debt load which will burden the next generation.\n  Mr. President, this is the single most important responsibility we \nhave. It is a responsibility that relates to the ability of this \ncountry and the next generation to be successful, for us to succeed \nrather than sink; for us to survive and to be a swimmer rather than a \nfailure. That is what we need. We need to build a system which allows \nthose who follow us to have the kind of opportunity we have enjoyed.\n  We have already talked about the fact that those on the other side of \nthe aisle have said to us there are no problems with the Constitution, \nthere are only problems with Members of the Senate. The truth of the \nmatter is that is what Constitutions are for, to make sure that problem \nareas that are inherent in human nature do not find their way into \npolicy. Let us keep those flaws out of policy and let us stop this \npractice of spending the next generation's resources before they are \nborn.\n  Those opposed to the pending amendment have also complained that it \nrequires a supermajority in order to raise the debt, or to abandon the \nprinciple of a balanced budget. They say such a requirement is \nundemocratic, that we should just be able to spend more than we take in \nif we have an even majority or a bare majority. In my judgment, what is \nundemocratic is to keep obligating the next generation, to keep \nobligating those who are yet unborn by spending their money.\n  The real tragedy is that the U.S. Senate--in all of its attempts to \ncome up with a way to curtail spending, to stop itself from its \nspending binge, after setting enactment after enactment, after \nexpressing itself over and over again--has each and every time \nsubsequently come along and undone the deal, taken apart the framework \nand said we are going to let ourselves go, now that we are really \nhungry.\n  The problem is the Senate and the House, with a law, a mere statute, \ncannot bind the next Congress. What is an even bigger problem, though, \nis that while we as a body cannot bind the next Senate, we can bind the \nnext generation to debt. So while we cannot bind ourselves to \ndiscipline, we continue binding the next generation to debt, over and \nover and over again. It is time for us to remedy that by enacting the \nkind of framework, the firewall, the bulwark, the barrier between the \nspending habits of the U.S. Congress and the well-being of the next \ngeneration of American citizens.\n  Mr. President, there have been those who have said we do not need \nanything to do with economic policy in the Constitution. As a matter of \nfact, it was one of the distinguished Members of this House who said \nthe U.S. Constitution is decidedly not a charter of economic policy. \nFor the first time it would be writing into the Constitution economic \npolicy.\n  I went through the U.S. Constitution, seeking to find specific areas \nwhere we talked about things that would have direct economic impact. It \nis almost impossible to find a part of the Constitution that does not \nhave economic impact. I submit, whether you are talking about section \n8, which provides for us to be able to pay our debts, or whether you \nare talking about section 7 of article I, that talks about bills for \nraising revenue that shall start in the House of Representatives, or \nwhether you are talking about the ability to raise and support armies \nbut no appropriation of money can last for more than 2 years.\n  That is an interesting part of our Constitution, to find in article I \nthe language, and I read it:\n\n       To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money \n     to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two years.\n\n  The idea that we would not commit future generations, we would not \ncommit too far in advance, that we would not place a burden on those \nwho were not represented in the Congress is intriguing--could it be \nthat 2 years is the length of a congressional term? You would expect \nthat the next Congress would not have to live under the debt or the \nrequirement of the previous Congress.\n  My view is, when it comes to spending, is that we have always been \nwilling to be pretty close about spending. We do not allow the Senate, \nfor instance, which is not elected every 2 years, to be the originators \nof spending measures. Spending measures must originate in the House of \nRepresentatives, where the people are face-to-face with their \nRepresentatives every 2 years.\n  The Constitution is full of economic considerations. I went through \nit. The next page has more underlining, and the next one even more to \nhighlight economically related items in the Constitution. More text is \neconomically related than is not.\n  As a matter of fact, this entire document--the Constitution--is full \nof things that relate to our economy. The amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution which provided for the progressive income tax is a matter \nhaving perhaps the most direct economic impact of any single event in \nthe history of the United States, and is part of the Constitution. The \nsuggestion that something, because it has economic impact, does not \nbelong in the Constitution of the United States is hollow, it is empty, \nbecause there are sections following sections, and sections upon \nsections and there are subsections and there are amendments and \nsubparts of amendments that all relate to economic considerations. The \nvery structure of the Constitution has to do with the economy of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, one of the things you need to have for a good economy \nis a stable government. And we have the most stable government of any \ngovernment in the world. Why? Because it is in the Constitution that we \nhave two Houses, and that one of the Houses is the Senate, and that by \ndesign it does not have the same willingness to make quick changes as \nthe House, and that it would be a brake--or a more deliberative body \nthan the House--while the House is very closely associated with the \npeople, and perhaps more responsive to moods or fads in society which \nnevertheless might be good public policy.\n  We have had this joint way of doing things which has led to \ngovernmental stability. Is there an economic provision in the \nConstitution? It provided a basis for a sound economy. Without it, I \nwonder whether the United States would have flourished to the extent \nthat we have flourished, economically or socially.\n  In my judgment, every word in the U.S. Constitution is a word that \nprovides the basis for an economy and a set of opportunities that \ndefine the character of this Nation. And the economy cannot be taken \nout of the Constitution.\n  Of course, the balanced budget amendment is far more than just \nsomething related to the economy. As George Will said in his book \n``Restoration\":\n\n       Proscribing deficits is different because deficits are \n     political and moral events, not merely economic events.\n\n  Mr. President, a balanced budget amendment would do something of \nfundamental significance. It would protect important rights of an \nunrepresented group--the next generation. If the Constitution of the \nUnited States is not supposed to protect the rights of the \nunrepresented--and those who are helpless--what is the Constitution \nfor?\n  The Constitution was indeed designed, was enacted, and was embraced \nby the American people--and has been and will be--because it protects \nus against abuses of power. It should also protect the important rights \nof an unrepresented group, as George Will puts it, the ``unborn \ngenerations that must bear the burden of the debts.''\n  The amendment would block a form of confiscation of property, of \ntaxation without representation, of confiscation without due process of \nlaw. As I recall from my law school training--it has been a few years \nago--but I believe the fifth amendment has something to say about \ntaking without just compensation.\n   [[Page S3108]] So here we find, Mr. President, that the \nConstitution--while it is full of documents and sections and clauses \nwhich have an impact on economics--is not only an economic document, it \nis a political and moral document, as well. Protecting the rights of \nthose individuals who need protection is part and parcel of what the \ndocument is all about. And protecting them from what? Most frequently, \nprotecting them from the U.S. Congress. Over and over again we read it: \nCongress shall make no law; the Congress shall not impair. That is the \nlanguage of the Constitution.\n  Yes, the pending provision would have a financial and economic impact \non this country. But it has a political and moral impact as well. It \nprotects freedom. It protects freedom from debt--something certainly \nworth protecting.\n  Let me just say that there is more to this amendment than protecting \nthe next generation. We need it to teach the current generation. One of \nthe aspects of government which is very important and fundamental to \nour society is the fact that government teaches.\n  We train our children--and rightly so--that government defines what \nis legal and what is illegal. And that they had better listen to what \nthe Government says. Because, if you do bad things, you will do your \ntime, as well. You will ruin your life. You will impair your freedom. \nYou will destroy your opportunity.\n  Government is set up as the arbiter of what is legal and what is \nillegal. And children rightly begin to look to the Government as a \nmoral arbiter of what is valuable, what is good, what is to be \naccepted, and what is not good, what is to be rejected. When people in \na society look at their Government and conclude that their Government \ndoes not pay its debts, what does that teach? Does it teach \nresponsibility?\n  We as a culture have a crisis concerning people accepting \nresponsibility. They look at the Government, which they have been told \nis the arbiter of right and wrong. And what do we learn? What we are \nlearning from the Government is, ``Oh, don't worry about it. Just take \nthe credit card and go on a binge, and hope the next generation pays \nfor it.''\n  The truth of matter is, we are learning irresponsibility. It not only \ndestroys the character within us, but it destroys the opportunity of \nthe next generation. It not only destroys their economic opportunity, \nit suggests to them the sinister failure of a moral certainty, which is \nthat we should pay our own debts.\n  Anyone who thinks we should abandon the idea of having government act \nas a good example for our citizens ought to take a look at the news \nmagazines for the recent weeks. Take a look at Newsweek a couple of \nweeks ago, Newsweek or Time. Forgive me for not distinguishing. The \ncover story was about the absence of shame in society, about no one \nhaving a sense of what is right or wrong, no one having a sense of \nresponsibility. Take a look at the front page of U.S. News & World \nReport today. It is about men who forsake their families, who do not \ntake care of their obligations, who act irresponsibly.\n  Mr. President, We preside over a Government that has forsaken the \nfamilies of the future, which has mortgaged the next generation's \ninheritance and birthright. How can we expect our society to be moral \nand responsible when we--those who have been elected to lead the \nsociety--lead it with classic irresponsibility, abdicating our \nresponsibility to limit ourselves to the resources we have? We just \ntoss that principle away, pull up to the table, roll up our sleeves \nwith knife and fork, using our card--and their credit. And we impair \nand cheat the next generation.\n  This is the major challenge for those of us in the U.S. Congress this \nyear. It is to reverse the concept that somehow the Congress is better \nthan everyone else, that somehow the Congress does not have to live by \nthe laws. We have taken a major step. In the Congressional \nAccountability Act we said we would live under the laws we passed for \nothers. In the unfunded mandates law--which passed in the Senate and \nanother version in the House, on which we are working to collaborate \nand work out the details--we said, yes; we are not even going to try to \ntell other people what to do through unfunded mandates.\n  We need to come to a further conclusion, Mr. President, and that is \nthat we are not going to spend the wages, we are not going to spend the \nresources, we are not going to continue to sustain a policy which will \nput every newborn child in America in multi-thousand-dollar debt. We \nsimply have to stop it. We have to say to the American people, we are \nnot so good that we can spend the next generation's money. We are not \nso wise that we can make all their decisions for them. We have to say \nwith a sense of humility that it is time for us to live like the \naverage family. It is time for us to have a balanced budget like the \naverage family has a balanced budget.\n  Some people say average families have debt. But there is no provision \nwhereby any average family can impose debt on the next generation. You \nhave to be able to pay it off, or you go bankrupt. No father can say, \n``My grandchildren will pay for what I am doing now.'' And should any \nfather do so? Of course not. The average family has to have a plan to \npay.\n  We do not have a plan to pay. State governments, sure, they have \ndebt. But they have a plan to pay. And every day, they owe less than \nthey did the day before, as they are paying off the debt. If they pay \noff the debt before the asset--such as a bridge or a building--is used \nor consumed, they actually have paid for such items in advance.\n  But we in Congress do not have a plan to pay. We have a plan to play. \nAnd the plan to play was outlined in the President's budget which came \nto us. We are playing with the next generation's resources, $200 \nmillion--excuse me--$200 billion. I was in State government too long. \nWe only had millions instead of billions. What a tragedy; $200 billion \na year. We admit it. This is what we intend to do to you. We announce \nin advance with some pride that for the next 10 years we are going to \nkeep doing it.\n  It is something that we should stop. Yes, Nathan Hale said, ``I \nregret but that I have but one life to give for my country.'' We have \nbeen saying that we regret but that we have but one unborn generation \nto mortgage for our appetite. It must stop, Mr. President.\n  The Declaration of Independence for the United States of America \nincluded dramatic language which talked about the fact that individuals \nwere committed to providing for the future a set of opportunities that \nwould allow for personal growth and development, for the achievement of \nobjectives and goals.\n  The last line of the Declaration of Independence for the United \nStates of America is an interesting line.\n  The last line reads: ``We mutually pledge to each other our lives, \nour fortunes, and our sacred honor.''\n  How would we feel about the Declaration of Independence, Mr. \nPresident, if we were to read down through the document and come to the \nlast line and it were to say, ``We mutually pledge to have a good time, \nto spend the next generation's money, and to get reelected by serving \nthe special interests of today with the resources of the unborn?'' We \nwould dishonor that document so rapidly, we would repudiate it so \nthoroughly. But that more accurately describes the conduct of the \nCongress in recent times.\n  It is time for us to enact the balanced budget amendment. And while \nwe are enacting the balanced budget amendment, it is time for us again \nto put our John Hancocks on the pledge that closed the Declaration of \nIndependence. It is time for us to say that we mutually pledge to each \nother our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor, and by doing so, \nprovide the same level of opportunities for those who follow us as \nthose who went before us have indeed provided for us now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from South Carolina \nfor a unanimous consent request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/24/senate-section/article/S3102-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3108-S3131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, before the Senator from Florida speaks, \nI ask unanimous consent that I be recognized to speak following the \nremarks of \n[[Page S3109]]  the Senator from California, Senator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I have listened to the debate on the issue \nof the balanced budget amendment now for several hours today and, \nfrankly, off and on for the last several weeks. Many of my colleagues \nhave done an excellent job of providing expert opinion as to why a \nbalanced budget amendment should be passed, or why it should be \ndefeated. Those experts include economists, constitutional scholars, \nand past great legislators. But the remarks that I am going to make \ntoday are not based on experts. They are going to be based on my own \npersonal observations. They will be based on my own convictions and on \nsome of my own readings.\n  There is a very interesting set of books entitled ``The Debate on the \nConstitution.'' I was really stunned when I read through this series of \ndocuments and speeches and learned of the fear people had of the \nConstitution. That document put forward for their ratification \nterrified many of the citizens of our Nation at that time. It terrified \nthem that a great, new central government was going to grow up in their \nmidst, and that this great, new government would, in fact, either \ndestroy or limit their individual rights. I cannot help but draw the \nconclusion, after those readings--and observing from my own personal \nexperiences in the 12 years that I have served in the Congress--6 years \nin the House and 6 years in the Senate--that we have today developed a \nGovernment that, in essence, is out of control.\n  My own personal reason for becoming involved in politics originated \nafter spending 16 years in the banking business. Prior to that time I \nhad no idea whatsoever that I would end up in politics as a Member of \nCongress and then of the U.S. Senate. I entered politics because I \nbecame so frustrated and so angry with what the Government was doing to \nthe banking business--the business in which I was involved. Virtually \nevery single day I heard from the Comptroller of the Currency, the \nFDIC, the Federal Reserve, or the U.S. Treasury, about the things that \nI could do and could not do, as a banker. It even reached the point--I \nbelieve it was in 1979 or maybe 1980--when all bank presidents received \na letter that specifically told them what kinds of loans they could \nmake and what kinds of loans they could not make.\n  To show you the degree to which this Government control extended \nitself, this letter provided that banks could lend money for home \nimprovements if the home improvement was going to be the addition of a \nneeded room; but it did not for the addition of a swimming pool. That \nis the extent that Government had intruded into the operations of \nprivate business in America in the late 1970s and early 1980s. So, \nagain, I am reflecting on my own personal conviction that there must be \na restraint on Government, and that is what this debate is about.\n  I think the message of the 1994 election was pretty clear. Even \nthough some Republicans have a tendency to see the election as being a \nmandate for Republicans, I would say that the mandate was a little bit \nmore specific than that. It was a mandate to control Government. It was \na mandate to follow a set of ideas of less taxing, less spending, less \nGovernment, and more freedom. I think it is important for us to think \nabout that message of 1994 as not necessarily being a wave of \nRepublicanism, but a wave of saying we want our lives back, our \nfreedoms back, and we want Government off our backs. This is a \nfundamental debate. It is a debate between those who believe in more \nGovernment and those of us who believe in less Government.\n  I have told the story of my first vote in the Congress many, many \ntimes throughout my stay here. I tell about this story because I want \nto make the point that there is more to this debate about a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget than economics. The \nfirst vote that I cast as a Member of the House of Representatives in \nJanuary of 1983 was a very big deal for me because I had never cast a \nvote in a legislative body before then. Politics and legislative bodies \nwere all brand new to me. It was a very, very exciting moment, and I \nthought it was an important moment. As I look back, I realize that the \nissue we were debating that first day in the House back in 1983 was not \nan issue that was going to change the direction of the world; it was \nnot going to have great significance on the country or, for that \nmatter, great significance with respect to the House of \nRepresentatives. The question that was being posed that day was whether \nwe should add a new committee to the Congress of the United States. I \nmust say to you that I came here already with a preconceived idea that \nwe had too many committees; that the staffs were, frankly, getting too \nlarge; that we were spending too much money on the legislative \noperations of Government, and that we did not need this committee. But \nbecause I was brand new, I thought maybe this question was not quite so \nsimple and that I should check with some of my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to get a sense of what they were going to do.\n  As I wandered around the floor, the message I got back was, ``Connie, \nwe do not need another committee. We already have too many of them.'' \nIn fact, they said to me, ``This is a select committee and they do not \nwrite legislation. They are really platforms for politicians to make \npublic statements, and we are spending too much money. The committees \nare out of control, the staffs are getting too large. We do not need \nanother committee in the House of Representatives.''\n  So I went over and cast my first vote. In the House, they use a \ncomputerized card to record votes. I put my card in and pushed the \n``no'' button and I looked back over where the Speaker sits. \nEverybody's name is awash in lights across the back of the room. I \nlooked up there thinking--after listening to my colleagues--that this \nboard was going to be awash in red lights voting ``no.'' Well, out of \n435 Members of the House, I think about 34 of us voted against the \naddition of another committee.\n  There are a couple of things I did not mention to you. First, the \nname of the committee was the Select Committee on Families and \nChildren. The other thing I was told, as I wandered around the floor as \nthat brand new freshman legislator filled with excitement and \nenthusiasm and idealism was, ``Connie, you do not vote against \nsomething called `families and children' and go back home and run for \nreelection.''\n  Now, to me, that story says it all. It says if there is not some form \nof outside constraint on the ability of Members of the Congress to \nspend the taxpayers' dollars, we will end up with exactly what we are \ngetting.\n  Earlier today, I heard the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nsay, basically, that we do not need this amendment; we can just go \nforward and do the things that we know we should be doing without this \nrestraint--without this requirement in the Constitution.\n  Well, in one of the books I was reading this past week I came across \na statement that I think many of us have heard from time to time. I did \nnot realize it was an old Chinese saying. But it said something to the \neffect: If you do the same thing over and over and over again reaching \nthe same result and each time expect that there is going to be a \ndifferent outcome, this is insanity.\n  Again, I have made this comment to the people in the State of \nFlorida, that it is insane for us to continue, year after year after \nyear after year, to continue operating under the same process that has \nfailed us. So it seems to me that logic dictates that we ought to be \nadjusting the process because it is only in changing this process that \nwe will bring about change. And, as I said earlier, change is what the \n1994 election was all about.\n  Interestingly, as I stand here both of my grandfathers come to mind. \nThe desk I am standing over was handed over to me by Senator Phil Gramm \nin January 1989, was the desk that my grandfather, Morris Sheppard, sat \nat when he was in the U.S. Senate from 1912 to 1941. And, the baseball \nthat I hold in my hand is a baseball that was signed by my grandfather, \nwhose name so many people recognize, Connie Mack, who was born in 1862. \nHe signed this baseball in 1929. Since then my father has signed it, I \nhave signed it, and \n[[Page S3110]]  my son, who is now 27, just recently signed it last \nyear.\n  I thought about bringing this baseball to the floor of the U.S. \nSenate because I had the opportunity again during the debate on this \namendment to observe the distinguished Senator from West Virginia refer \nto a contract that he had signed many, many years ago. What it brought \nto my mind is how our Nation has changed from one generation to the \nnext; how different America is from the country that my grandfather was \nborn into in 1862; and how different the Nation is compared to what it \nwas like when my father was born and when I was born and when my son \nwas born.\n  I think about what this Nation is going to be like for my \ngrandchildren, three of which I have at this moment, 10, 8, and 1\\1/2\\. \nI wonder what kind of future is in store for them if we do not make \nsome significant changes in the way we do business.\n  I looked back at some of the historical fiscal records of this \ncountry. In 1929, when my grandfather signed this ball, I looked up the \nlevel of Federal spending. Calculated in 1994 dollars Federal spending \nin 1929 was the equivalent of $29.9 billion. In 1941, Federal spending \nwas $174 billion. In 1961, it was $520 billion. And in 1994 it was \n$1.46 trillion.\n  Another point I should make is that, in 1929, the debt was about $480 \nmillion--$480 million. By 1994, the national debt had reached $4.643 \ntrillion.\n  If we keep this up, what kind of future will we leave our children? \nWhat will it mean to them?\n  The previous speaker spoke very eloquently about what will happen to \nfuture generations because of what we have already done and how much \nworse it will be if we fail to do something to change the direction in \nwhich we are headed.\n  It also struck me, as I listened to the discussion, how our country \nhas changed from generation to generation and how much our country has \nchanged from 1776 to 1862 to the present. If we fail to recognize that \nour society is one of change, I guess one could conclude that we should \nnot change the Constitution.\n  Both previous speakers used the term, ``moral obligation'' in \nreference to the Constitution suggesting that it is a moral document. I \nam suggesting that I think we ought to recognize our society has \nchanged and continues to change. Unfortunately, we have moved away from \na group of people who believed in the idea of personal responsibility \nto those who have fostered an entitlement mentality today.\n  I would suggest that what we have done for the last 25 years is a \nreflection of who we are; that somehow or another we think we can live \ngeneration to generation passing on huge amounts of debt with no \nconsequences. And I think everyone understands that that is just \nfundamentally wrong.\n  Again, there are those who are going to say to us, ``We don't need \nthis constitutional amendment to do what is right.'' I would make the \nargument that after having served these last 12 years and being \ninvolved on the House side in helping to pass the Gramm-Rudman \nlegislation, we do not have the resolve to impose limitations on \nourselves. As you may recall Gramm-Rudman was a statute, an attempt to \ncontrol spending which the Congress merely changed when it became too \ndifficult to get the job done.\n  So the conclusion that I have come to is that the only way to \neffectively control what the Congress does with respect to spending the \ntaxpayers' money is to put an outside restraint on them. Without this \nrestraint we risk losing those personal freedoms that have made this \ncountry great.\n  Oh, I know, today there will be people who will say, ``Aren't you \ngoing a little overboard to suggest that our Nation and our individual \nfreedoms might be at risk because of our decision to continue to \noverspend and to run deficits?''\n  I do not think so at all.\n  What we are involved in--we have heard the term many times --is an \nexperiment in self-government. We are involved in an experiment in \ndemocracy.\n  We need to understand that this is a continual experiment in \ndemocracy. Ours is a constantly changing nation, a nation whose values \nand whose morals have been changing. If we do not address and adapt to \nthat change, then we are putting the next generation at risk.\n  I think that when we come down to the final vote, we are going to \nhave the necessary votes to pass this constitutional amendment. And \nwhen we look back, I think that we will find the turning point was when \nPresident Clinton submitted his budget for fiscal year 1996.\n  I am not going to put this in a partisan perspective, because I \nrecognize the claim can be made that Presidents Bush and Reagan did \nexactly the same thing in submitting budgets which failed to address \nour debt problem. But, what is different about this debate is that the \ncountry finally recognized that a constitutional amendment had to be \npassed, that it was an absolute requirement which we as a nation, as a \nsociety, and as a Congress had to put in place a series of budget \ndecisions to get us to a balanced budget.\n  My hometown newspaper referred to the President's budget proposal by \nsaying: ``Clinton to GOP: You Cut the Budget.'' It went on to say, \n``Republicans Ready and Willing.''\n  I think that those who had been arguing all along that we can balance \nthe budget without a constitutional restraint saw in the \nadministration's budget proposal that this was simply not the case. \nThey recognized that we were going to get the same old thing, over and \nover again. If we wanted the status quo, then we got it in the budget \nthat was presented to the Congress by President Clinton.\n  I want to refer, also, to a chart that I have used in the past. Many \nmay remember this book, entitled ``Bankruptcy 1995.'' There is a very \ninteresting chart in it referred to as the ``Hockey Stick Chart'' \nbecause it plotted the total debt over a period of time from 1970 to \nthe year 2000. It illustrated that at some point the total debt just \ngoes straight up, absolutely out of control.\n  I remember when I read this book, it started off with a series of \nexamples of what would happen when a country's debt gets out of \ncontrol, and the choices that would face a society, such as monetizing \nthe debt. What really has come back to my mind is the story that was \ntold as to what happened in some of the Latin American countries in the \npast, and what they said would happen to the United States. The message \nwas: ``If you fail to get control of your spending and your deficits \nand your debt in America, the same thing could happen to you.''\n  I remember reading through this. It was fairly dramatic. Think about \nwhat it would be like if you woke up in the morning to talk with your \nmother and dad, who had received an emergency telephone call the night \nbefore from the place where they were working, telling them that it was \nno longer necessary for them to come in because there was no company \nleft. The company went bankrupt because of certain things that happened \nas a result of monetizing the debt. Inflation skyrocketed to the point \nwhere the cost of the basic necessities of life--food, housing, health \ncare--no longer could be afforded, because they went spiraling out of \ncontrol as a result of uncontrolled debt.\n  It is interesting how people react to this story. They think this \ncould never happen in America. This is America. This is the Nation that \nled the world through World War I, and World War II. We defended \nfreedom all over the world. We are looked upon as the beacon of hope \nand opportunity around the world. This could never happen in America.\n  I guess the reason that I wanted to come back to this is because of \nwhat is happening in Mexico today. To draw the conclusion that the \nprice that Mexico is paying for its economic disorder is not a price \nthat we would have to pay for our economic disorder is fundamentally \nunsound. We are fooling ourselves if we think we can continue on this \nbinge. We are fooling ourselves if we think we will solve the problem \njust by trying the same old process that has failed us year after year \nafter year.\n  Mr. President, I conclude my remarks by saying that this is a \nfundamental debate which is taking place here in the U.S. Senate. It is \na debate about those who believe more government will solve our \nproblem, and those \n[[Page S3111]]  who believe that less government, less taxing, and less \nspending, will give more freedom. I have concluded that freedom is the \ncore of all human progress. It must be defended. The only way we can \ndefend it economically is to put into place a constitutional amendment \nthat requires a balanced budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By a previous unanimous consent request, the \nSenator from California was to have time. She is absent from the floor. \nI now recognize by previous unanimous consent the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield to me to ask a \nquestion?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. FORD. Is the unanimous consent for those who are able to speak \nthe rest of the afternoon, or is this the last speaker under the \nunanimous-consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This is the last person who is sequenced to \nspeak.\n  Mr. FORD. I will not make a request, but try to attempt to get the \nfloor in my own recognition.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to continue the debate on \nthis historic opportunity to adopt House Joint Resolution 1, the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Over the past 3 weeks we have heard many eloquent speakers on the \nneed to pass a balanced budget amendment and bring this Nation's fiscal \npolicy under control. It has been especially encouraging to see our \nfreshman colleagues take to the floor and urge this body to adopt a \nbalanced budget amendment. Many of their campaigns were centered on the \npremise that the Federal Government has grown too large, spends too \nmuch money and must be curtailed to operate within its means.\n  Mr. President, we have been considering this proposal for 26 days. \nThere has been significant debate and compelling arguments on the need \nfor a balanced budget amendment. I would just note that during our \ndebate over the past 26 days, the Federal debt has grown over $21.5 \nbillion.\n  Undoubtedly, it is the desire of every member who supports the \nbalanced budget amendment to see the Federal budget deficit eliminated \nthat we may begin to cut away at the Federal debt which currently \nstands at $4.8 trillion. Without a balanced budget amendment, there has \nbeen little pressure on the Congress to make tough legislative choices \non Federal spending and the Federal deficit has continued to grow. With \na balanced budget amendment as part of the Constitution, the Congress \nwould be mandated to follow a sound fiscal policy. The Congress would \nfinally understand the reality that there are a finite number of tax \ndollars available for public spending and various proposals would \ncompete on merit and need, not popularity.\n  The balanced budget amendment would instill an urgent need for \nlegislative accountability as Congress considers various proposals for \nincreased Federal spending. Currently, there is no real check on \nrunaway Federal spending, and there will never be a shortage of \nlegislation creating new Federal programs or efforts to increase \nspending in existing programs. Without a balanced budget amendment, \nbudget deficits over the long term will continue to rise and the \nFederal debt will continue to grow. The Congress has not shown the \nfortitude to address, in a meaningful way, the budget deficit and the \nFederal debt. There have been times when legislative gestures were made \nto bring spending within our means but those efforts were short-lived. \nStatutes to reduce Federal spending have not been enough. They are too \neasily cast aside and the Congress rolls along on its path of fiscal \nirresponsibility.\n  I am convinced that without the mandate of a balanced budget \namendment, Federal spending will continue to eclipse receipts and the \nAmerican people will continue to shoulder inordinate tax burdens to \nsustain an indefensible congressional appetite for spending. In 1950, \nan average American family with two children sent $1 out of every $50 \nit earned to the Federal Government. Today, the average American family \nis sending $1 out of every $4 it earns to the Federal Government. Under \ncurrent budget projections, there is no reason to believe that these \nstatistics will improve.\n  Mr. President, we can trace the debate on a balanced budget\n   amendment back in our history for 200 years. A defining moment may \nwell have been the appointment of Thomas Jefferson as Minister to \nFrance. Thomas Jefferson was abroad when the Constitution was written \nand he did not attend the constitutional convention. If Jefferson had \nbeen in attendance, it is quite possible that he would have been \nsuccessful in having language placed in the Constitution to limit the \nspending authority of the Federal government. Upon studying the \nConstitution, Thomas Jefferson wrote in a letter of a change he so \nfervently believed should become part of the Constitution. He wrote the \nfollowing and I quote,\n\n       I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our \n     Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for \n     the reduction of the administration of our government to the \n     genuine principles of its Constitution. I mean an additional \n     article taking from the government the power of borrowing.\n\n  Further, Jefferson stated and I quote, ``If there is one omission I \nfear in the document called the Constitution, it is that we did not \nrestrict the power of government to borrow money.'' President Jefferson \nalso stated, ``I place economy among the first and most important of \nrepublican virtues, and public debt as the greatest of the dangers to \nbe feared.''\n  President John Quincy Adams stated, ``Stewards of the pubic money \nshould never suffer without urgent necessity to be transcended the \nmaxim of keeping the expenditures of the year within the limits of its \nreceipts.''\n  --and incidentally, he was the only President ever born in South \nCarolina--\n  Another former president Andrew Jackson stated the following:\n       Once the budget is balanced and the debts paid off, our \n     population will be relieved from a considerable portion of \n     its present burdens and will find * * * additional means for \n     the display of individual enterprise. We should look at the \n     national debt, as just as it is, not as a national blessing \n     but as a heavy burden on the industry of the country to be \n     discharged without unnecessary delay.\n  President Harrison described unnecessary public debt as ``criminal.''\n  President Woodrow Wilson stated, ``Money being spent without new \ntaxation and appropriation without accompanying taxation is as bad as \ntaxation without representation.''\n  President Calvin Coolidge stated the following:\n\n       The Nation must make financial sacrifices accompanied by a \n     stern self denial in public expenditures until we have \n     conquered the disabilities of our public finance * * * we \n     must keep our budget balanced for each year.\n\n  Mr. President, early American Presidents and public leaders \nunderstood the dangers of excessive public debt. For almost 150 years, \nbalanced budgets or budget surpluses were the fiscal norm followed by \nthe Federal Government. The unwritten rule followed by Presidents and \nlegislators until recently in our Nation's history was to achieve \nbalanced budgets except in wartime. But the role and the size of the \nFederal Government has gown out of control. In the past three decades, \nthe Federal Government has run deficits in every year except one. \nFurther, the Federal Government has run\n deficits in 56 of the last 64 years.\n\n  Mr. President, during the 1960's, deficits were averaging around $6 \nbillion per year. The following decade, the 1970's, saw deficits rise \nand they averaged $36 billion per year. In the last decade, the 1980's, \ndeficits continued to rise and averaged $156 billion per year. So far, \nin the 1990's, deficits have averaged $259 billion per year.\n  The Federal debt has grown as deficits have continued to grow and the \ndebt now stands at $4.8 trillion. It took this Nation over 200 years to \nrun the first trillion dollar debt yet we have recently been adding \nanother trillion dollars to our debt about every 5 years.\n  I have been deeply concerned during my time in the Senate over the \ngrowth of the Federal Government. It has been too easy for the Congress \nto pass legislation creating new Federal programs and spending more tax \ndollars whenever there is a call for Federal intervention. Of course, \nthe Federal Government has an appropriate role to protect \n[[Page S3112]]  the citizens of this Nation, but it is not realistic to \nbelieve that Washington should respond to every perceived problem with \na new Federal approach. This Nation has drifted from its original \nfoundations as a national government of limited authority. I believe \nthe adoption of a balanced budget amendment will do much to return us \nto a more decentralized Federal Government of limited authority and the \nmandates of such an amendment will increase legislative accountability. \nA balanced budget amendment is the single most important addition we \ncan propose to the Constitution to begin reducing the size of the \nFederal Government.\n  Mr. President, we have seen the national debt and deficits rise \nbecause in large part, the Federal Government has grown. The first $100 \nbillion Federal budget in the history of the Nation occurred in 1962. \nThis was almost 180 years after the Nation was founded. Yet, it took \nonly 9 years, from 1962 to 1971, for the Federal budget to reach $200 \nbillion. Then, the Federal budget continued to skyrocket; $300 billion \nin 1975, $500 billion in 1979, $800 billion in 1983, and the first $1 \ntrillion budget in 1987. The budget for fiscal year 1995 was over $1.5 \ntrillion. Federal spending has gripped Congress as a narcotic but it is \ntime to break the habit and restore order to the fiscal policy of this \nNation.\n  It is incumbent upon this body to send the balanced budget amendment \nto the American people for ratification. I am pleased that we have \nreached agreement to vote on final passage on February 28, next \nTuesday. The vote on final passage on House Joint Resolution 1 could \nwell be the most important vote we will face as Senators as its \nadoption is essential for protecting our liberties as a free nation. I \nhope we do not fail the American people on this historic opportunity \nand instead present to the States our proposed amendment to mandate \nbalanced budgets. It is time to act to secure the future for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I just want to say in closing, what other way can we \nbalance the budget? The Congress has not shown the fortitude, it has \nnot shown the willingness and it has not balanced the budget. How can \nwe make them do it? There is no way I know to make the Congress balance \nits budget except a constitutional amendment.\n  We have tried all other ways. They have failed. The balanced budget \namendment put in the Constitution will tell the Congress it cannot \nspend more than it takes in, and then we will get the budget balanced. \nOnce we balance it, I hope we can keep it balanced. If we have this \nconstitutional amendment, we will have to keep the budget balanced.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Members of this body will vote on \nTuesday on the balanced budget amendment, and I am very thankful for \nthat. There are increasing indications that Senators have, of course, \nlearned from the last election last November, and that from their \nconstituents who want this amendment now that the American people want \na change from the past, because formerly this amendment was bottled up \nyear after year in one House or the other.\n  I hope it tells the people of our country that they can make a \ndifference. They expressed in the last election that they wanted a \ndifference, and I think it gives credibility to the election process \nwhen people who are elected understand why they were elected and want \nto carry out the mandate of that election.\n  Year after year, this constitutional amendment was voted down in one \nHouse or the other, or both. Year after year, the budget deficit \nincreased and our children and grandchildren have been left holding the \nbag, and the American people, I think, expressed in the last election \nthey want that to stop.\n  Many Members had concluded for many years that Americans would never \nwant a balanced budget because of the cuts that might affect programs \nthat they relied on, that they benefited from and in which they felt \nsome security. But the American people, I believe, are less selfish \nthan that.\n  Every day we see new indications that Americans are willing to cut \nspending to balance the budget. For instance, it is becoming clearer \nthat a balanced budget can be attained with less pain than some have \nsuggested. Today, DRI-McGraw Hill, which has been called the world's \nleading nonpartisan economic analysis and forecasting firm, has \nconcluded that the amendment will add credibility to budgeting. This \ncredibility will lead to lower interest rates and a stronger economy.\n  This same firm found that the lower interest rates that would come as \na result of the constitutional amendment can create half the necessary \nsavings that is going to take us to balance the budget. This is the \ncase because interest on the debt is such a large portion of the \nbudget.\n  As these facts become known, Americans are learning that they can \nlive with the reductions in the growth of Federal spending that will be \nnecessary if the balanced budget amendment is adopted. They are willing \nto do their part to prevent future generations from being saddled with \nan unconscionable amount of debt. They are willing to do so even if it \nmeans that some Federal spending that they support will be affected. \nImportantly, the willingness to take the necessary steps to balance the \nbudget derives from the whole populace, I believe, not just a few.\n  This week, I received a letter from a person by the name of Andrew \nAlexander, the library director in Mason City, IA. As a librarian, Mr. \nAlexander receives funding for his budget from the Library Services and \nConstruction Act. Obviously, one would expect that as a recipient of \nFederal grants his position would be against Congress adopting this \namendment and changing the level, whatsoever, of funding in that \nprogram.\n  Of course, he could certainly make an argument that was not based \nsolely upon bureaucratic self-preservation, because we know that \nlibraries are important, education is important and it would be \npossible to very sincerely argue that the Federal Government should \nthen continue to help local libraries.\n  But that is not what Mr. Alexander argued to me in his letter. He \nasked me and asked me to ask my colleagues in the Senate to discontinue \nall Federal funding for local libraries. Although he recognizes that \nthe Library Services and Construction Act was passed with good \nintentions, it has produced, in his words, ``bad or negligibly good \nresults.''\n  He goes on to say: ``The Federal Government has no business involving \nitself in a function that has historically been very much the \nresponsibility of local government.''\n  I would like to mention that Mr. Alexander told me in this letter, \n``I am a lifelong Democrat.'' He goes on to say, ``I voted Republican \nlast November because I am certain that if we do not stop spending more \nthan we take in, we will, in fact, be the ruin of our children and \ntheir children.''\n  So, Mr. President, it is letters like this that show me, and \nhopefully the rest of my colleagues in this body, that the American \npeople have a greater understanding of the problem than cynics give \nthem credit for. Americans of all political persuasions are realizing \nthat the role of the Federal Government must be limited. They know that \nnot all Federal programs have delivered what they promised. They also \nknow the tremendous sums of money that are spent on these programs, any \none that can probably be justified standing by itself, but adding up to \na total spending exceeding $200 billion. You can easily see that some, \nor a part, of these programs cannot be justified.\n  At the same time, the public knows that it is not paying for all of \nthese programs. That is very clear. They know that the deficit and the \nnational debt are out of hand and that for a small difference in their \nlifestyle, this very day, the destruction of the economic future of our \nNation and the preservation of our freedom and our society can be \navoided. They are willing to make that commitment. Oddly enough, until \nlately, some of them were not willing to do it, but now they are, as \nour budget and fiscal situation gets worse and worse.\n   [[Page S3113]] I believe that this same realization is coming to \ncertain Senators who may not have always supported the balanced budget \namendment in the past. Additional Senators are understanding that the \nAmerican people will support the changes that will flow from the \nbalanced budget amendment. I think our colleagues--realizing that the \nAmerican people out there are seeing how bad the situation is, are \nseeing these programs cannot continue to be funded at an unconscionably \nhigh level and a deficit level--are being fortified by this change of \nview at the grassroots and are seeing the public will stand behind them \nif they make the tough commitment to make sure the balanced budget \namendment is adopted so the fiscal discipline will come, as it has to \ncome after its adoption.\n  So I appreciate the commitments from Senators who are signing onto \nthis amendment every day to support this amendment as the debate \ncontinues. We have tried every other approach. Every other approach has \nfailed: Gramm-Rudman I and II, the bipartisan budget agreement of 1990, \nthe Clinton budget agreement of 1993.\n  I have spoken before about my first involvement in legislation to \nbalance the budget. When Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia was a Member \nof this body, he and I worked together--I was a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives--to pass a simple law that says the Federal Government \nshall not spend more than it takes in. That was a very well-intended \nbut, quite frankly as I look back now, a very weak response because \nunder our Constitution succeeding Congresses can obliterate anything \nthat a preceding Congress has done. So, each of the cases I have \ngiven--the Byrd-Grassley law, Gramm-Rudman I, Gramm-Rudman II, and the \nother budget agreements of the 1990's--have failed because they can be \nchanged so easily.\n  Whereas a constitutional amendment, though difficult to get adopted \nin the first place, is also difficult to change. So it will not be \nchanged by a simple unwillingness of a body to follow its mandate, \nbecause we take an oath to uphold that Constitution. We see the \nrestraint that a constitutional provision brings to States, and in \nState legislatures controlled by conservative Republicans or even \nliberal Democrats that oath and the rule of law applies. And there is \nbetter fiscal policy there than what we have at the Federal level.\n  So only the balanced budget amendment, then, will respond to the \ninformed judgment of the American people that the role of the Federal \nGovernment must be rethought. Programs will have to compete with other \nprograms once we do not have the capability, willy-nilly, of borrowing \nfrom the future generations. When the total must be paid for, choices \nwill have to be made. It will no longer be sufficient that intentions \nbehind the programs might happen to be just somehow very good or, the \nusual explanation, the needs are so great.\n  This is a view held not only by Republicans but by Democrats and \nindependents as well. A new day will come when we have a constitutional \namendment disciplining our spending appetites. The Senate passage of \nthe balanced budget amendment will show Americans that we have listened \nto the people and we have their long-term interests in mind. The people \nhave been ahead of the Senate. Now it appears we are catching up, as a \nresult of the last election. The American people have spoken loud and \nclear. They should be commended for making their views known and they \nshould also be commended for taking a stand for responsibility.\n  They should also understand that, out there at the grassroots of \nAmerica, as they express their views to us personally, as they express \ntheir views through the election process, they can make a difference. \nIf we adopt this amendment, it is one more example that people who want \nchange are going to get that change.\n  So I think once again the American people have spoken and, in the \nprocess of speaking, they are showing that they are smarter than the \npundits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I have had an interesting \nday listening to the comments on the Senate floor by various and sundry \nSenators, where some have taken a part of history, Madison, Hamilton; \nsome on the street, grassroots, all of that. So it is a mix. I was glad \nto listen and to get a feel.\n  This body, in my opinion, is blessed with some former Governors. One \nof those spoke today, the new Senator from Missouri. I thought he made \nan excellent speech. I enjoyed his comments, his delivery, and his \ncontent. But being a former Governor, he should understand that he had \nto work with the legislature. He had ideas and thoughts, he had \nprograms and commitments he made in his campaign that he wanted to get \nthrough the Missouri legislature. And he found, I am sure, people on \ndifferent occasions who did not agree with him. Some did not agree with \nhim for personal reasons. Some did not agree with him for political \nreasons. Some did not agree with him on philosophical reasons.\n  So that is where we find ourselves today. You know that every once in \na while you have a hung jury in the court system. Eleven to one and you \nhave a hung jury. One person believes and feels that an individual is \nnot guilty and, therefore, that person votes that way so you have a \nhung jury--11 to 1. That is our system. It worked pretty well. It \nworked pretty well.\n  A couple of things bother me, Mr. President. I guess you might as \nwell get them out of your chest, out of your heart, out of your head \nhere. There will be no trouble passing this constitutional amendment--I \nvoted for it twice--but this is not the same amendment that I voted \nfor. This does not have the restriction on the Federal courts which was \naccepted, I believe, almost unanimously the last time we had a \nconstitutional amendment up last year. It was offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Missouri, by the way, Senator Danforth, and \nthat constitutional amendment was voted on. My good friend, long-time \nfriend, distinguished Senator--I do not think anyone doubts his \nintegrity or his loyalty to this country--Senator Nunn from Georgia, \nsaid last night if his amendment, which is the Danforth amendment of \nlast year, is not accepted, then he just cannot vote for the \nconstitutional amendment when the courts will tell you whose taxes to \nraise, whose taxes to cut, what program to extend, what program to cut. \nIf they have that ability he just cannot vote for this amendment.\n  I suspect if that amendment is accepted, the constitutional amendment \nwill pass. But if you are going to stonewall, I do not believe there \nhas been a Republican vote for a Democratic amendment that has been \nproposed on this constitutional amendment. I may be wrong. Maybe on the \njudicial question of Senator Johnston, and that is the question that \nbothers my friend from Georgia, Mr. Nunn. But that is the only one. I \nbelieve that is the only one.\n  To say that we are going to take the Social Security trust fund that \nso many people are depending on, and we are going to use that, put it \nin the general fund and help balance the budget--I do not know whether \nI am different or my constituents are different. I can learn a lot at \nthe barber shop. At the barber shop 2 weeks ago, there were a lot of \nyoung fathers there bringing their sons in to have a haircut. There I \nsat waiting for mine. These young fathers I knew--and I probably knew \nthem from a young age--asked me about only one thing.\n  They said: Senator, we are for balancing the budget. We think we \nought to reduce the cost of Government. We ought to reduce our taxes, \nif we can. We are willing to accept a freeze on our taxes. But Social \nSecurity? Mom and Dad are drawing Social Security. They have a small \npension or 401-K or something from their previous employment. The check \nfrom Social Security, that they had been paying into for years and \nyears, is now in jeopardy because of the constitutional amendment. If I \ndo not fly, I do not pay the airport improvement trust fund tax. But \nthat will go into the general fund, also. The highway trust fund will \ngo into the general fund as such to be used. All of the trust funds now \nare going to be used in order to try to balance the budget. I get the \nargument. If we do not do that, Social Security is not going to mean \nanything, anyhow.\n   [[Page S3114]] Well, I do not know about that. But let us get back \nto the Social Security. You have to pay Social Security if you work. It \ncomes out of your pay, whether you want it or not. It is matched by \nyour employer. If you are self-employed, you pay the whole thing. That \nis mandatory. We have to change the Social Security system. We need a \nmeans test. We can do that without it being in the constitutional \namendment, saying we will not use that surplus. We can still change the \nstructure of the Social Security system.\n  I hear a lot about dropping that 85-percent tax. If you make $34,000 \nor $44,000, for a couple, drop it back to 50 percent, the couple says, \nthen still charge 85 percent, but take the difference between the 50 \nand 85 and put it in a Social Security trust fund so it will be there \nin the future for others that come behind us.\n  It makes some sense to me. All kinds of propositions are being \noffered, but no one on that side. The Republican side will vote to say \nno, we are not going to use the Social Security trust fund to balance \nthe budget. We want them to continue to pay their taxes, continue to \npay their Social Security, continue to pay their gasoline tax, continue \nto pay their airplane tax, continue to pay all of that to go into \nbalancing the budget. They are designated taxes. I do not think any of \nus are fussing too much about the tax on your airplane ticket. Some \nmay. We are not fussing too much about the gasoline tax. But there is \nsomething very, very personal about Social Security taxes. It is there \nfor the future. It is there for retirement. It is there so they will \nnot be a burden on their children.\n  So when we refuse to do that, then some in this body have just said \nthey refuse to support the amendment. Somehow it is hard for me to \nunderstand why that is not accepted, and we will go ahead and pass the \namendment. Everyone in this body knows that it would pass this body if \nthat was acceptable.\n  Second, to keep the courts out--several Senators in this body are \nswallowing awfully hard to cast every vote against Social Security, \nagainst the proposition that we do not want the courts telling us what \nto do. They are swallowing awfully hard. That vote is coming back. We \nwill have it. The votes on Tuesday about Social Security and about the \ncourts will tell you whether this amendment is going to pass or not. I \nwant to vote for it. I want to vote for it. But you are stopping me \nfrom voting for it because of two little items. I am getting a little \nbit harassed, I guess--or worried--because very time a good amendment \ncomes up, the floor manager says, ``Senator, you have a good idea. I \nwish we could put it in this amendment. But we do not want to send it \nback to the House. The House has steamrolled everything they brought up \nover there.''\n  Why are you afraid to send it back? What is the reason that you will \nnot send it back? I believe with all my heart that if you send the \nSocial Security portion back and take the courts out of telling us what \nto do, the House will pass it in the flick of an eye. So why will you \nnot include it? I do not know. They just do not want to send it back to \nthe House.\n  ``Senator, we will work with you after we pass this amendment. You \nhave a good idea. We will try to get it done. I look forward to working \nwith you, trying to solve this,'' when you know the implementing \nlanguage can be changed every day. And the statements by the leadership \non these sense of the Senate, or whatever it might be, sounds good; \nvotes, in order to take care of it. You have a judicial resolution out \nhere now or a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to try to salve the pain. \nI think we have had enough of that. They do not want to send it back to \nthe House.\n  I hear a lot about we do not have the intestinal fortitude to make \nthe decisions to balance the budget. My friend from Iowa, who just \nspoke before me, mentioned the Clinton budget of 1993. I want to tell \nyou, there was not much intestinal fortitude that came across that \naisle right there. We raised taxes on the top 2 percent. We cut them on \nothers. We cut programs and reduced the deficit by $700 billion over 5 \nyears. That is about the round figure. But we did not get a Republican \nvote, and even lost a Democrat or two. But we did not get a Republican \nvote.\n  Are the Republicans trying to tell this Senator that we have to have \na constitutional amendment that forces us to balance the budget? We \nhave had one experience already during this administration. That \nexperience was a hard-fought experience. Sure, we raised taxes. That is \nwhat everybody said we are going to have to do. Sure, we cut programs. \nThat is what everybody said we had to do. And we are going to reduce \nthe employment of the Federal Government by 272,000 people.\n  We have already reduced over 100,000 employees of the Federal \nGovernment. We are reducing Government. So it is very difficult for me \nto see why you will not accept at least two proposals. I think that the \nsupermajority, three-fifths, for deficit spending in a time of \nemergency is trying to go against what the framers of the Constitution \nhave said. It has been good for a long time, a simple majority. The \nVice President has a right to break the tie, and then we can go on \nabout our business. But, no, we have to have three-fifths in order to \ndeficit spend, and we have to have 51 Senators. We exclude the Vice \nPresident from his constitutional position of breaking ties in the \nSenate under this constitutional amendment. We have to have 51 \nSenators.\n  I thought it was a good debate when we said that the 51 votes then \ncould be used to take money from other programs and put it into the \ndefense of this country. I do not know how long it would take us to do \nthat, going through the House and the Senate, arguing over whether we \nare going to take money from nutrition programs, WIC programs, housing \nprograms, whatever, and put it into defense. But you need 51 Senators \nand, I guess, 218 Members of the House to do that. In that debate, it \nwas brought up that it has to be done every fiscal year. So that is \nfrom October 1 to September 30. What if it came up on September 1 and \nwe had less than 30 days left and 11 months of the money had been spent \nfor that fiscal year? There would be no more money left. You can take \nall the money for Government use for other programs and try to put it \ninto the defense of this country. So they say if we have a problem with \nthe defense of this country and if we were being attacked, there would \nnot be any trouble getting the money. We have to be prepared sometimes \nto prevent it from happening. We have to make that decision.\n  I have tried my best to stay out of the partisan political position \nthat this is obviously trying to put people in. I understand what is \nhappening here. I have tried to approach this question as best I could \nas a Kentuckian and as an American. I only ask two questions: Why can \nwe not accede to exempting the Social Security trust fund? Why can we \nnot allow an amendment to go on this constitutional amendment to keep \nthe courts out of telling us who to tax and who not to tax and who to \nincrease and who to decrease, and what programs to cut and what \nprograms not to cut? I hear people say that is not what this thing \ndoes. Why is there all this nervousness? You can feel it around this \nChamber when you start talking about the courts. It was a close, hard \nvote, 51 to 47, I think was the vote. This amendment would sail through \nhere--sail through--and we are only asking two questions. Is that so \nhard to accept? Is that so hard to accede to? Is it too hard for some \nof those that apparently want to harm people, unless they are rich--the \nrich will not care too much about Social Security. But the average \nAmerican out there, particularly those who have retired or are about to \nretire, are certainly worried about having their Social Security. Their \nfamilies are worried about their mothers and fathers having Social \nSecurity.\n  I had a Sunday school teacher, one of the best Christians I guess I \nhave ever known, outside of my wife and family, Beryl Brown. He was one \nof the strongest Republicans and nicest fellows I have ever met. Every \nonce in a while, he would compliment the Democrats for having Social \nSecurity. That is about the only thing he said nice about Democrats or \nthe Democratic Party, that we started Social Security. He said, ``The \nreason it is good and I think it is a program that ought to stay is \nthat Mama and I can stay home. We do not have to worry about moving in \nwith our family. We can enjoy ourselves, have a little garden out in \nthe \n[[Page S3115]]  backyard and have enough income to get along.'' That is \nSocial Security.\n  If you are rich, it does not make any difference. But if you worked \nhard all your life and you expect a few years of having your own way \nand playing with your grandchildren and doing all those things, then \nSocial Security is important. But I see that question slammed every day \nin this Chamber. If you are going to be against the elderly and against \nthe young folks, with the reduction of WIC, nutrition programs, \neducation, Social Security, well, somehow or another I believe it will \ncome back to haunt us, and it will not take long. But if those two \nitems are in there, I think you can accomplish what you want.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that I have explained my position a little \nbit. There are not enough votes to pass the amendment as of this \nmoment. I wish there were enough votes, because if there were enough \nvotes, you would have Social Security trust fund excluded, the surplus, \nwhich the recipients are depending on, and you would say we would not \nbe yielding what our forefathers gave to us to protect, and that is \ngiving a piece of the legislative branch of Government to the courts; \nand, second, when we get to the line-item veto, we will be giving that \nportion of it to the Executive, and we slowly but surely erode what the \nforefathers said we ought to have, which is three branches of \nGovernment--executive, legislative, and judiciary. They are all there \nfor a purpose and they have all worked very well.\n  We are putting fiscal policy in the Constitution. I understand that \nthere are other things that relate to the economy in the Constitution. \nBut just two questions is all the people ask. There is a difference and \nthere is a holdout. There is a holdout. We have 51 that are saying we \nwant to take Social Security and put it into the trust fund and pay the \nbudget deficit off. We have, maybe, 15 more--14 probably now--that want \nto agree with that, or will agree with that, for various and sundry \nreasons. This could be a hung jury--11 to 1--and so be it, Mr. \nPresident. So be it.\n  I see other Senators are here wishing to speak. I will not take any \nmore time of my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Vermont Mr. \nJeffords, is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have listened to the very eloquent \nstatements of my good friend from Kentucky. Certainly, all of us \nunderstand the need for the protection of the Social Security System. \nCertainly, I, like others, was torn when I had to vote on amendments \nthat would be sacrosanct and separate from the possibilities of being \ntampered with by the balanced budget amendment.\n  However, I can make the same kind of arguments on behalf of the \nchildren of this country for nutrition and the reasons why we should \nmake sure that we do nothing that will endanger their ability to be \nprotected from cuts which might damage their future.\n  In a moment, I will talk about the care we must take when we make \ncuts, because if we do not recognize that education is so important to \nthe foundation of our society and our economy, if we make mindless and \nunwarranted cuts in that, we will be counterproductive in the ability \nof us to balance the budget.\n  However, I came to the conclusion in deciding to vote for the \nbalanced budget amendment that we had to leave ourselves open to all \noptions and that we could not pick and choose those things for which we \nought to try to protect. And I understand and realize that it would be \nmuch easier for us to separate Social Security from it.\n  Mr. President, on February 13, I came down to the floor to discuss my \nposition on the balanced budget amendment. I outlined the concerns that \nincreased debt load places on our economy and our future generations \nand how the interest payments we are making now on the budget are \nthreatening everything else, now having exceeded the defense \nexpenditures and the discretionary expenditures. I outlined at that \ntime that in the past, in 1982, when I had been in the House only some \n8 years, I was first faced with the balanced budget amendment. I said \nat that time, ``I won't vote for it because we can't wait 7 years for \nthe budget to be balanced.''\n  At that time, we had just had a very important bill passed which \ngreatly reduced the taxes of this Nation. I was the only Republican \nthat opposed that amendment which made drastic cuts in our taxes, and I \nstated at that time that I was afraid that what we had done would lead \nto huge deficits in the future. I took a lot of abuse at that time for \nthat vote. But, as history has shown, that vote probably was one that \nwas the best judgment I could have exercised at the time.\n  But, as we now know, it is important for us to pass the balanced \nbudget amendment. We must begin to balance the budget and to outline \nour priorities. So we must be careful not to make balancing the budget \nmore difficult.\n  Today, I will talk about the need to be careful on how we cut, \nespecially in the field of education. I am the chairman of the Senate \nEducation Subcommittee and, therefore, have a particular responsibility \nto make sure that what we do from this point on does not in any way \ninhibit the ability of this Nation to be able to meet its commitments \nto its young, but most importantly its commitments to this Nation that \nwe maintain our ability to be the most competitive and the most \neconomically sound nation in the world.\n  I am afraid, as I look across the Congress to see where cuts are \nbeing made. I also recognize the future needs of our Nation especially \nin the area of education. For without immediate attention by this \nNation on our educational system, we are facing incredibe danger for \nour economic future. We cannot move forward without recognizing that \ncuts within the educational system may well prove to be \ncounterproductive--counterproductive in that they will reduce the \npotential revenues that we would otherwise have and that they will only \nincrease the social costs that we are presently experiencing.\n  So let me now, as we go into the 21st century, take a look at where \nwe are with respect to education and the need for us, a Nation, to \nplace ourselves in more competitive position within the international \neconomic community.\n  In order for our country to remain viable in the global economy we \nmust not only be free from crippling interest payments on our debt, but \nwe must also prioritize our spending so that we maneuver ourselves to \nbe ready to face the challenges of the new millennium. If we do not act \nnow, we will destroy the dreams that we cherish--good health, a good \neducation, a good job, and a good retirement.\n  Some have proposed that we reduce the deficit simply by making \nacross-the-board cuts on all programs. Such cuts might provide a \nsolution to our financial woes in the short term, but they only \nexacerbate the deficit in the long term. Here is why. If we cut back on \nprograms for education and training, we lose our competitive edge in \nthe marketplace, resulting in a lower standard of living, fewer high \npaying jobs, less Federal revenues in taxes, and, naturally, a larger \ndeficit.\n  On the other hand, if we work to improve our education system, we not \nonly increase our national productivity, but our standard of living \nwill increase, resulting in greater Federal revenues and a decreased \nneed to invest in our social programs.\n  In Michael Crichton's recent book, ``Disclosure,'' the main \ncharacter's professional advancement is threatened by the appointment \nof a woman as his supervisor. He is so distracted by the immediate \nproblem of sexual harassment that he only belatedly understands the \nadvice from an anonymous ally.\n  That advice--to solve the problem. And he keeps repeating, ``Just \nsolve the problem.''\n  I believe this advice applies to the larger problem that we face \ntoday. If we solve the larger problem, then this will solve those \nimmediate ones that we look at with respect to our inability to fund \nthe various programs we all desire to fund. For if we do not improve \nour educational system, and if we are unable to solve the deficit \nproblem, we can not ensure that we have the capacity to provide for the \nprograms we need. And then we will find that the problem of balancing \nour budget is unsolvable and that this Nation will disappear in the \nnext millennium as a lesser nation.\n\n[[Page S3116]]\n\n  The way to solve the problem of our deficit is not, as some suggest, \nmindless across-the-board cuts. Solutions to our financial woes are \nlong-term investments--specifically in our education system. By not \nsolving the problem of reduced productivity and higher costs through \neducation failures, interest payments will keep increasing, tax \nrevenues will keep decreasing, and our deficit will only grow larger. \nMore mindless cuts is not the answer. Instead, thoughtful investments \nand adequate resources are the solution to our long-term fiscal \nconcerns.\n  Consider for a moment the education spending patterns over the last \ndecade. Since the beginning of the 1980's overall Federal support for \neducation, after adjusting for inflation, has decreased by 5 percent. \nFunds for elementary and secondary education declined 15 percent, while \npostsecondary education funds declined 24 percent. Where has that led \nus? Certainly, not to the first class education system we all support. \nIn fact, using the six education goals developed by a bipartisan group \nof Governors in 1989 as our barometer, we are not close to reaching our \nmark of excellence in education.\n  Among the goals for our future is that our children come to school \nready to learn, that they come without hunger, and that they come with \nthe capacity to be able to understand the education that they are going \nto be faced with. That means they must first be fed, immunized, and, \nhopefully, have had some preschool experience. However, only 45 percent \nof young children from low-income families are enrolled in preschool \nprograms and only 55 percent of infants have been fully immunized, \nprotecting them against childhood diseases. Head Start continues to \nonly serve one-fourth of all eligible children in this Nation.\n  We also recognize that educated people who can compete in the global \nmarketplace require a mastery in challenging core subject areas--such \nas math and science--and that all adults be literate and prepared for \nlife-long learning. Unfortunately, in these basic areas, we are far \nfrom the finish line.\n  The 1993 National Assessment of Educational Progress indicates more \nthan 75 percent of students at all grade levels failed to achieve even \nthe basic level of proficiency, and over 60 percent failed to meet the \nproficiency level in English.\n  In international comparisons, American students consistently score \nbelow most other industrialized nations.\n  In the 1992 international assessment of education progress U.S. 13-\nyear-olds scored second to last among the nations in mathematics \nachievement, and similarly in science.\n  More recently, a report recently came out that investigated the \nliteracy of children that graduate from high school. The report found \nthat 51 percent of the students now graduating from our high schools \nwere functionally illiterate. That is, incapable of handling an entry-\nlevel job with their educational achievement.\n  Make no mistake about it. These disturbing statistics are not about \nsomeone else's children. They are not someone else's problem. These are \nour children. These are our problems. Our future work-force and our \nfuture leaders. The quality of our public schools in America, is \ndirectly related to the standard of living of each and every citizen. \nWithout a strong investment in education, this Nation will not be able \nto maintain an adequate number of highly-skilled workers, these workers \nare necessary if our country is to maintain a competitive position \nwithin the global marketplace.\n  To give you a quick idea of why curing our educational ills is \ncritical and key to our future, we will examine a yearly cost of our \nfailing educational system. The total cost of our failure in education \nto our economy has been estimated to be one-half trillion dollars each \nyear to our economy.\n  The lost revenue alone has been estimated to be about $125 billion. \nThat is, if the educational levels were where they should be, the \nincome to the Nation, relative to furnishing our budget, could be \nhigher by $125 billion, putting us a long ways towards being able to \nhave the budget balanced.\n  For example, American business spends approximately $200 billion a \nyear to perform training for employees which is necessary to provide \nthose individual minimum skills required to perform on the job, skills \nmost of which should have been taught in the schools.\n  The Department of Education estimates that 30 million Americans are \nfunctionally illiterate, another 46 million are marginally literate. \nThis creates a significant problem for our economy. ``Combating \nIlliteracy In The Workplace,'' by Robert Goddard, puts the cost of this \nilliteracy at a staggering $225 billion a year. This includes lost \nproductivity, unrealized taxes, crime, welfare, health, housing, and \nother social costs.\n  We pay for our failed educational system every time an individual \ndrops out of high school. Lack of a high school degree costs an \nindividual $440,000 in lifetime earnings. These lost earnings often \ndrive these individuals into welfare, crime, and drugs. Up to 80 \npercent of our people that are incarcerated in our State jails are \nfunctionally illiterate, school dropouts.\n  Federal expenditures for welfare were $208 billion in the fiscal year \n1992. The cost of incarceration, which I mentioned, is $25 billion per \nyear and growing, and the medical costs of violent crime is another $18 \nbillion per year. Illegal drugs cost the economy $238 billion a year, \nas estimated by Brandeis University. These difficult circumstances \nperpetuate themselves generation after generation.\n  I think most Americans agree, and in poll after poll people cite the \nquality of education as a paramount concern. The support for education \nin these polls is often cited as one of the most important roles of \nGovernment. Americans understand intuitively that investing wisely in \neducation is the key to our future success and the best possible \nnational investment we can make for the country. The evidence is clear: \nCountries which spend more on education per pupil have higher levels of \nper capita GDP. Institutions like Motorola report corporate savings of \n$30 to $35 for every dollar on training. That is 3,000- to 3,500-\npercent rate of return. But most of that education, if you read the \nreport, was to make their students literate to put them in a position \nwhere they could read.\n  They found, amazingly in their study, they were having trouble with \ntheir employees answering simple math problems and they could not \nbelieve they do not have the capacity to do the math, when they found \nout the problem was they could not read the problems. Thus they had to \nteach them how to read to do simple math problems. That is the state of \nthe situation, and that is Motorola, one who can be selective in their \nemployees.\n  People, as rational consumers, also realize investing in their own \neducation leads to substantially higher lifetime earnings. A person \nwith a bachelor's degree earns over 1.5 times of the person with a high \nschool degree. A professional degree earns over 350 percent higher \nlifetime earnings than a high school diploma in itself.\n  While we recognize both intuitively and through research the economic \nrewards of education, we do not simultaneously invest the funds \nnecessary to support the position. Many of my colleagues, while \nacknowledging the importance of educational investments, argue that \nthrowing money at education is not the solution. I could not agree \nmore. Increasing educational expenditures in itself will not solve our \ncountry's educational deficiencies.\n  We have a responsibility to invest educational dollars wisely, \nincluding more active congressional oversight over Federal initiatives. \nSimultaneously, we must also reinvigorate our schools by demanding that \nstudents learn to high academic standards.\n  Why? Because the status quo in our schools has failed. Too many of \nour graduates finish school without knowing the three R's, much less \nmore rigorous academic standards. Clearly, there is no room for \nfederally mandated standards. We should be providing incentives for \nStates and communities to set high goals for student achievement--pupil \nby pupil, and school by school.\n  More importantly, they must know what standards this Nation must \nreach, if we are going to be able to continue to compete \ninternationally. It is one thing to believe that our education, as most \npeople in this country do, has improved over the time they were in \nschool, and I find that is true for myself. I am amazed that the \nstudents in \n[[Page S3117]]  high schools are taking subjects which I did not get \nuntil college.\n  What they do not realize, for instance, in a recent report on the \ncomparison of our students to other nation's students we fared poorly. \nOne example is with Taiwanese students. These students when they \ngraduate are 2 years ahead of our students in many subjects, such as in \nmath. Is it any wonder we come out last in these tests, or next to \nlast?\n  What is important is that we know and that the States know that we do \nhave a problem. That this Nation is faced with a very serious \neducational problem, and if we do not do something about it, we will \nnot be the Nation we must and should be in the next generation.\n  So we must be sure that when we begin to reduce the budget to try and \nbalance it that we do not do counterproductive cuts which will decrease \nour revenues and increase our social costs. Rather than cutting the \ndeficit it will increase the deficit.\n  This last dream can only be realized by setting high priorities on \neducation and educational investment. These increases are essential if \nour country wishes to remain viable into and throughout the next \ncentury.\n  Next, Mr. President, I would like to mention something else which I \nthink is incredibly important. I think that we must realize if we are \ngoing to bring this deficit under control we must do something about \nescalating health care costs. This is an area that I and many of my \nfellow Members have been deeply involved in. I would say that we must \nrealize that if we do begin to tackle our national health care problem, \nthere is no hope for bringing the federal deficit under control.\n  Mr. President, one of the only ways we can balance the budget is by \ngetting the Federal health care expenditures under control. For \nexample, CBO estimates that if we do not address the health care \nexpenditures, the debt will grow by $1.4 trillion by the beginning of \nthe next century, due to health care costs.\n  The chart I have here for my colleagues to look at demonstrates what \nwill happen if we do not get health care costs under control. I point \nout that the red line indicates current health care trends for Federal \nexpenditures.\n  Mr. President, 2 years ago I introduced a bill, worked very hard to \ndemonstrate that health care expenditures can be brought under control. \nIf this bill was passed into law that Federal health care expenditures \ncould be brought under control and that the anticipated national debt \ncould be reduced by $1.4 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  That yellow line on the chart demonstrates what could be done if my \nplan was accepted last year. But that is not the only plan. That plan \nworked by shifting the burden of hospital care back to the States, \ncapping our Federal expenditures and allowing the States through \nmanaged care and other processes to bring this under control.\n  However, now it is important that we look at other measures. For \ninstance, we found out this past year that with the Clinton bill, and \nbills like it which tried to go too far, we were not ready nor was our \nsociety ready to go that far.\n  Let us take a look before we do that, take a look at why it is \nimportant that we do try and get the health care expenditures under \ncontrol.\n  First of all, let us take a look at the entitlements and mandates. \nThis chart demonstrates in red what is happening to items such as \nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, as we move into the next \ncentury. It demonstrates clearly that if we do not balance the budget, \nwe cannot get the costs under control, and if we do not take care of \nour entitlements, we never will.\n  The next chart shows the biggest component which is increasing at the \nmost rapid rate, which is in yellow, is Medicare and Medicaid. As you \ncan see, where that was a relatively small growth up through 1985, \nstarting in 1985 things just escalated out of control.\n  My point is that Federal health care has to be brought under control \nor there is no hope of balancing the budget. As I indicated in a bill 2 \nyears ago, there is a method to do it. I am working now on another one \nthat uses the private sector to demonstrate it can be done. Federal \nhealth care spending is projected to increase from 3.3 percent of the \neconomy today--this is important, too--to over 11 percent by 2030.\n  The growth of Federal health care costs poses an immediate and \ncritical drain on our budget and thwarts our ability to balance the \nbudget. The CBO projects that entitlement spending will be 58 percent \nof total Federal outlays by the year 2003, from 47 percent today. This \nrepresents an astounding 11 percent increase over 8 years.\n  For unless appropriate policy changes are made by the year 2003, less \nthan 15 cents of every dollar the Federal Government spends will be \navailable for nondefense discretionary programs. And that includes \neducation and programs for the poor, elderly, and disadvantaged \nAmericans. We cannot let that happen.\n  First, I want to outline some of the problems we face as we work to \nsolve this dilemma. Medicare enrollment has been growing at an average \nannual rate of 2.2 percent per year since 1975, and is expected to grow \nat an annual rate of 2.1 percent through 1996. As the baby boomer \ngeneration reaches 65, beginning in the year 2010, the rate will rise \neven more. In fact, it will rise substantially more.\n  Total Medicare expenditures have grown from $34 billion in 1980 to \n$160 billion in 1994. This means an average growth rate of 11.7 percent \nover this period. The CBO projects that Medicare expenditures will grow \nfrom $176 billion in 1995 to $286 billion in the year 2000. This \nrepresents an average annual growth rate of 10.2 percent over the next \n5 years.\n  Mr. President, this trend cannot continue or we will only expect this \ngrowth rate to continue to explode as our population ages and, again, \nthe baby boomers will be, into the next century, raising the costs and \nthe number of people to be treated by a substantial number. But if we \nwork hard, we can start to get our Federal health expenditures under \ncontrol.\n  Second, Medicaid is also affecting our ability to balance the budget. \nTotal Medicaid expenditures have grown from $41 billion in 1984 to $138 \nbillion in 1994. The average annual growth rate from 1984 through 1990 \nwas 9.8 percent, while the average annual growth rate from 1994 was \n17.7 percent, an astounding jump.\n  The CBO projects Medicaid expenditures will grow from $157 billion in \n1995 to $262 billion in the year 2000. This represents a compound \nannual growth rate of 10.8 percent over the next 5 years. Currently, \nMedicaid consumes approximately 18 percent of State spending and \napproximately 6 percent of Federal spending. Like Medicare, we cannot \nallow this trend to continue.\n  If we are going to reach the goal, and I believe we can, we must get \nhealth care costs under control. I expect and believe we can do that. I \nam working toward that, and I know others are, too, but we must \nremember we cannot do it without solving the health care crisis and \nimproving the educational system.\n  Finally, I would like to raise another spectrum with respect to the \nneeds of what we must do to balance the budget and get health care \ncosts under control, and that is in respect to the fourth dream which I \nmentioned, to start with, and that is that we have a good retirement.\n  Just to give an idea of why it is incredibly important that we bring \nhealth care expenditures under control, some 10 years ago, the amount \nof money in an average benefit package was about 50 percent health care \nand about 50 percent pensions. Twenty years ago, 35 percent was for \nhealth care and 65 percent was for pensions. Now it is 21 percent for \npensions and 79 percent of each benefit package for health care. If you \nalso take a look, as others have been working on, as to what is going \nto happen to Social Security in the next century, if you add to that \nthis dimension, that little money now being put into pension plans, the \nproblems of the elderly will be exacerbated.\n  So, in wrapping up and finalizing, I reluctantly back the balanced \nbudget amendment. I do so with the firm conviction that if we improve \nour educational system, we do not mindlessly cut or eliminate programs, \nwe can prepare ourselves for the next century. We can, to a large \nextent, allow our economy to continue to expand, thereby allowing our \nnation to grow its way out of this deficit problem, with increased \n[[Page S3118]]  revenues and lower Federal spending on some programs.\n  More importantly, in the immediate area, we must dedicate ourselves \nthis year to finding a solution to health care reform. If we do that, \nas I know we can, if we have the courage to do it because it will \nrequire shifts and it will require the understanding of the elderly \npopulation that they will be cared for in a betterand more efficient \nway, we will be able to bring the budget deficit under control in the \nnot too distant future. I am hopeful that we can. For that reason, I \nwill support the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair and wish the President a good \nafternoon.\n  Mr. President, I know it is late and much has been said about the \nbalanced budget amendment before this body. I am going to say some \nmore.\n  In 4 days, debate on the constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget will come to a close and finally we will cast our vote \ndetermining the fate of this historic amendment. We spent the entire \nmonth of February debating this amendment, and during this debate, we \nhave considered and weighed the role the judiciary may play in \ninterpreting and enforcing the amendment. We have considered how the \namendment will affect benefit programs that have been created by \nstatute, including Social Security. And we have debated the voting \nrules of the House and Senate with regard to waiving the balanced \nbudget requirement.\n  Throughout the debate, I believe the Senate has lived up to its \nreputation as the world's greatest and deliberative body. We have \nexamined in fine detail all of the nuances and interpretations of the \nlanguage of the amendment and have sought to allow all sides of the \nissue to be aired and debated.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, \nwho was just on the floor--I am sorry he cannot hear these words of \npraise, but I mean them genuinely--has been a superb advocate for this \namendment. He, along with our colleague on the other side, Senator \nSimon, are to be commended for their diligence and commitment in \nleading the Senate throughout this debate.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, is \nto be commended for his extraordinary work in leading opposition to the \namendment.\n  Senator Byrd first entered the Senate the year before my State of \nAlaska joined the Union. When he entered the Senate in 1958, his \ncolleagues on this floor at that time included the illustrious Senators \nJohn Kennedy, Everett Dirksen, Lyndon Johnson, and William Fulbright, \nto name just four.\n Senator Byrd's determination and commitment throughout this debate \nwill long be remembered by Members as well as historians of the U.S. \nSenate.\n\n  But let us delve into our deficit history for just a moment. After \nlistening and participating in this debate for the last month, I am \nconvinced of one thing, both the proponents and opponents of the \nconstitutional amendment believe that we cannot sustain the economic \nprosperity of this Nation if we continue indefinitely to run these \nextraordinary deficits. Our differences are solely about the means \nnecessary to end the deficits, not the end in itself.\n  The opponents of the amendment believe we need not amend the organic \ndocument covering this Nation, namely the Constitution, in order to \nbalance the budget. This Senator believes that nothing short of \namending the Constitution will change our addiction to spending and \nliving beyond our means. In reaching this conclusion I rely simply on \nhistory.\n  I would suggest to you, Mr. President, we simply do not have the \nself-discipline. You remember the extended debates on military base \nclosings--how can we close bases in our own States? We agonized, we \nwent on and on and on. Obviously, we could support the closure of a \nbase in another State, but not in our own States. So we reached the \nconclusion the only way we could do it is to leave the entire matter up \nto a qualified board and they would select and reprioritize, and then \nwe would be left with the responsibility of simply voting up or down on \nthe package--and it worked.\n  That is really about where we are on this issue. We have tried to cut \nspending, we have tried to increase revenue, and we continually run \ndeficits to the point where we have to acknowledge that nothing else \nworks. This will mandate a balanced budget over a period of time.\n  Let us look at history. For more than one-third of a century, 34 out \nof the last 35 years, our Government has run a continuous and unending \nstring of deficits. If you and I did that, our checks would be bouncing \nall over the place. What have we done? We have simply added to the \ndeficit.\n  We go through a curious process around here called a budget. We get \nour revenues and we get our expenses. They do not balance. So \neverything else we need we get by adding to the deficit.\n  Even if we adopt this amendment next week, it is almost a certainty, \na near certainty at least, that the unending string of deficits are \ngoing to continue for a while, into the year 2000 or thereabouts. If we \nadopt the amendment, however, we will surely be forced to lower the \ndeficits in the next 5 years below the currently projected levels, and \nvirtually everybody agrees on that. But the reality that must be faced \nis that by the end of this century--and that is less than 5 years from \nnow--the United States will have run a deficit for four decades. We \nhave become hooked on it. Four decades of deficits, and the result is \nthat today our national debt is more than $4.8 trillion.\n  I do not know of any person who can really imagine what $4.8 trillion \nreally is, but let me try to put it into perspective. A $4.8 trillion \ndebt means that every man, woman and child in America owes Uncle Sam \n$18,400. A family of four owes $74,800.\n  If we do not begin to turn things around, the national debt will then \njump to nearly $6.7 trillion in 5 years--if we do not begin to turn it \naround. In 5 years it will jump from $4.8 trillion to $6.7 trillion. \nThat would mean that every man, woman and child in America would owe \nUncle Sam $24,170 instead of $18,700. And the family of four would move \nup and owe almost $97,000.\n  We have not been blind to these deficits. We have debated them. \nHistorians will note for the last 10 years Congress and the President \nhave sought to find solutions. We have sought to find remedies to the \ndeficits. We have passed statutes. We have passed reconciliation bills \nand sequestration provisions, all in the name of getting our deficit to \nzero. On three occasions over the past 10 years, legislators on both \nsides of the aisle have sat down with the President and hammered out \nso-called solutions to solve the deficit, and on every single occasion \nthe promise of a zero deficit has simply evaporated away because we in \nCongress have never had the political courage to do the one thing that \nwould bring down the deficit, and that is to reduce spending.\n  Yes, we have voted to raise taxes on more than one occasion, but we \nhave never, ever cut, frozen, or capped spending. We have to do one or \nthe other. It is just that simple. Some would suggest if we do not cut \nspending, we do not raise revenues, there is some other alternative. \nSome have suggested, given enough attorneys to study the problem, there \nmight be another alternative. But I can tell you--not as an attorney \nbut as a former banker--there is not any other alternative. You do one \nof those two things, you cut spending or you increase revenues.\n  We have never faced up to the challenge of runaway entitlements which \ntoday account for 55 percent of Federal spending and will grow to 59 \npercent by the end of this century. Quite the contrary, we have \ngenerally placed entitlement spending simply off limits in all the \nbudget deals that have been negotiated over the past 10 years. And we \nall know why. It is simply that we do not have the self-discipline to \nmake those cuts.\n  What we do not consider, however, is the result; that if we do not \nface up to this obligation, getting this under control, our monetary \nsystem as we know it today will ultimately collapse. There is \nabsolutely no question about it.\n  That is a pretty big order when you recognize you have to have a \nhealthy economy, you have to have a sound \n[[Page S3119]]  monetary system in order to meet the social obligations \nof our society. I have many letters from my State of Alaska, people \nexpressing concern over cuts and what these cuts might mean to \nprograms. Obviously, through the block grants giving the States more \nresponsibility, we can make the process more efficient. We can take out \nthe fat that results from administering these programs from the Federal \nGovernment and give that responsibility to the States, and they can do \nit much better. But the point is that in order to meet those social \nobligations we have to have a healthy economy, one based on sound \nfiscal principles and a dictate of a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, I know we have not had many charts around here in the \nlast week or so, so I am going to spring three charts with one for \ndessert for good measure at the end.\n  These three charts record the history of our ``get-tough\" budget \nagreements over the past 10 years. The first chart shows the promises \nand the reality of Gramm-Rudman I, which we adopted in 1985. As you can \nsee, Gramm-Rudman I was supposed to bring us to a zero deficit--down at \nthe bottom--a zero deficit over a 6-year period starting in 1986 and \nending in 1991. From a projected high of $172 billion, which is where \nwe were in 1986, the deficit was supposed to come down by $36 billion \neach year. But in reality by 1991, instead of a zero deficit we were at \na record $269 billion deficit. That is our first effort. It did not \nwork because we did not cut real spending. The commitment was there, \nthe will was there, it looked good on a piece of paper and looked good \non a chart at the time we adopted it, but it did not happen because we \ndid not have the commitment to make the real cuts.\n  So then we made the second promise to the American people, and this \nis the second chart, and it shows the revision which we made to Gramm-\nRudman in 1987.\n  Why did we make the revision? We simply had to because the original \nversion was not working. In that year, we revised the original targets, \nchanged the targets. New targets are up now, and this time we promised \nagain a zero deficit by 1993. Promises are cheap around here, Mr. \nPresident. Quite frankly, this was a more astounding failure than the \noriginal Gramm-Rudman. It was not the fault of Senator Gramm or former \nSenator Rudman but of Congress which simply found enough ways to get \naround the law that when the deficit was supposed to be $100 billion in \n1990, it turned out to be more than double to $221 billion.\n  Of course, by 1990, it was clear that none of the targets would even \nbe remotely met. So at that time, we will all recall, President Bush \nentered into a summit agreement, broke his no-tax pledge--some people \nsay that cost him the election--and the American public was again led \nto believe that we were finally getting a handle on the deficit.\n  So what we have done here now is we have simply switched this thing \naround. When we needed to change the targets because Gramm-Rudman was \nnot working, we went back to another budget deal. And what did we \naccomplish? Absolutely nothing.\n  I had the privilege of being down at the White House at the time, or \nshortly thereafter when President Bush made the decision on the tax \nincrease, broke his no-tax pledge. He was absolutely convinced that he \nwould get support from our friends across the aisle, the Democrats, if \nhe went halfway on a modest tax increase. He believed that was the only \nway he could get support for cuts in Government spending, and he \ngenuinely believed that. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind. But \nit did not happen. It did not happen again, and it probably cost him \nthat election.\n  Well, let us move to the third chart now because it is a progression \nof where we are. The third chart again shows how the deficit was \nsupposed to come down, supposed to come down, as a result of the 1990 \nagreement. What this chart shows is that by this year, this year, the \nbudget deficit was expected to be only $83 billion. Does that sound \nfamiliar, $83 billion in 1995? In fact, as the chart shows, the actual \ndeficit is $109 billion higher at $192 billion.\n  Now, that is the progression. That is where we have come. What these \ncharts show is that there is no reason for the public to put its trust \nin the congressional ability to come up with a budget plan that will \neliminate the deficit. We have done it. We have looked at the charts. \nWe have seen the results. The results are quite the contrary.\n  In the 10 years since we enacted the first Gramm-Rudman law, spending \nincreased more than 53 percent, from $990 billion to more than $1.5 \ntrillion. Interest payments increased more than 70 percent from $136 to \n$235 billion, and the national debt more than doubled from $2.1 to more \nthan $4.8 trillion.\n  We are not kidding the American public. They have seen this charade. \nThey have observed accumulated debt has gone up to $4.8 trillion, and \nthey are fed up. They say enough is enough. What is even more \ndiscouraging, Mr. President, is that this administration which opposes \nthis amendment and which, 2 years ago, was able to get our friends \nacross the aisle to go along with the largest tax increase in history, \nin my opinion, has completely abandoned the goal of bringing the \ndeficit under control.\n  During the month that we have debated this amendment, the \nadministration has submitted its fiscal year 1996 budget. Its latest \nbudget shows an unending stream of rising deficits and debt, and I do \nnot find a solution, not a solution is recommended, not a single word \nabout how to reshape entitlements is contained in the President's \nbudget. Instead, what the President now recommends is an increase, an \nincrease of about 24 percent in Federal spending between now and the \nyear 2000--an increase of 24 percent.\n  How does the President propose to pay for increased spending? It is \nvery easy, Mr. President. The President of the United States proposes \nto pay for increased spending by adding to the debt. That is how we got \n$4.8 trillion accumulated debt. His deficit spending adds nearly $1 \ntrillion of additional debt on top of our $4.8 trillion. That brings us \nup to $5.8, almost $6 trillion. And the only category of Federal \nspending that he proposes to cut that is identifiable is again our \ndefense budget.\n  In fact, if you exclude defense spending from President Clinton's \nbudget, actual Federal spending will increase 37 percent by the year \n2000.\n  Quite frankly, the budget presented by the President provides the \nbest evidence that the only way we are going to balance the Federal \nbudget, the only way, Mr. President, is to add a constitutional \namendment requiring that the Federal budget be balanced. It is a \nprocess of deduction. We have tried all the other alternatives. They \nhave not worked. We have not tried this. It will work. If the balanced \nbudget amendment was now a part of our Constitution, the President \ncurrently would be in violation of his oath of office, if he submitted \na budget that looked anything remotely like the budget he sent us 3 \nweeks ago.\n  Now, Mr. President, the question has been asked, well, are we broke? \nThe answer is yes, this country is broke. We are dead broke, and I will \ntell you why. We simply can no longer labor under the assumption that \nit is business as usual in Washington; that we assume every year we can \nrun deficits, each year a deficit. That means we spend more than we \ngenerate in revenues, so each year we are running a deficit of $150 to \n$250 or $350 billion.\n  Now, this all adds up, and this debt has today brought us to the \npoint where for the very first time in our history, we are now forced \nto borrow from the credit markets for the sole purpose of paying \ninterest on the debt.\n  Now, it may surprise some people to know that over the next 10 years, \nwe would be running a surplus in the Federal budget in every year if we \ndid not have to pay $200 to $400 billion annual interest on that debt \nthat has resulted in our chronic inability to bring revenue and \nspending into balance.\n  This is the dessert chart, Mr. President, that I promised you, the \nchart of last resort. This chart shows the devastating state of the \nFederal budget over the next 10 years. It shows that in every year \nbetween 1995 and the year 2000, every single one, all Government \nborrowing, all of it, Mr. President, all of our borrowing is for the \nsingle purpose of paying interest on that debt.\n  If you look at the bottom line, you will see what happens to that \ndebt. That debt is increasing from $4.6 trillion, 4.9, 5.2, 5.6, 5.9, \n6.3, 6.7, 7.0, 7.4, 7.8, $8.2 trillion. And do you know why, Mr. \n[[Page S3120]]  President? Because the interest each year on our \naccumulated debt is more than our debt each year. That is why we are \nbroke, Mr. President. We are broke. We could finance defense spending, \nMedicare, Social Security, all other Government functions over this \nperiod and still accumulate a surplus of $360 billion if we were not \nsaddled by this extraordinary debt that is going to go from $4.6 \nbillion in 1994 to $8.2 trillion in the year 2004.\n  As the chart shows, in 1994 our deficit was $203 billion, precisely \nthe amount of interest we had to pay. In other words, our entire \ndeficit in 1994 consisted of interest on that debt. Without that debt \nservice burden, we would not have had to auction a single Treasury note \nor bond in the market. In 1995, we would be running a surplus of $59 \nbillion, if we did not have to service the debt. Instead, as the chart \nshows, our $176 billion deficit results directly from the fact that our \ninterest costs are $235 billion. The same holds true in every year \nthrough the year 2004.\n  So if you look at this chart long enough, you will recognize the \nreality that, if we do not take this action now, this is what we can \nexpect. Only it might get worse because these interest costs are based \non current forecasts. Current forecasts suggest a little volatility can \nbe unsettling. I can remember the prime rate in this country in \nDecember of 1980, 20.5 percent. These rates are somewhere between 6 \npercent and 7.5 percent. So you can imagine what would happen. And it \ncould happen again, Mr. President, and it would throw this chart higher \nthan this roof.\n  So I contend we are broke. We are borrowing just to cover our \ninterest costs. We are subject to the shifting winds of international \ninvestment which flow from economic policies that may change in Bonn or \nLondon, or an earthquake in Japan, all of which have a direct effect on \nwhat the U.S. Government has to pay to service this unending sea of \ndebt.\n  Can you imagine just for a moment what would happen if the owners of \nour debt, the holders of those Treasury bills--of which 18 percent of \nthe total balance of this $4.8 trillion is held by foreigners--decided \nto call it in, call it in, just $300 billion or $500 billion on our \ndebt? How would we pay the owners? We could not, Mr. President, unless \nwe inflated our dollar to the point that what $1 buys today would \nactually be worth 50 cents or less. That is what happens. We are close \nto it.\n  Mr. President, this is a warning signal of what can happen when debt \ngets out of hand. We have seen it as late as the last few weeks with \nour neighbors to the south in Mexico. I would not attempt, of course, \nto even compare our two economies. Ours is far healthier, better based, \nstronger than Mexico, and there is no comparison between the importance \nand the stability of the dollar and the peso on the world currency \nmarket.\n  But I would also note that Mexico's crisis is a crisis of investor \nconfidence. The result of that crisis is that Mexico this week had to \npay 45 percent interest on the rollover of a small portion of its \ninternational debt. Why did it have to pay 45 percent? Because the risk \nwas so great. Do you know what investment does? It goes after the \nhighest return and the least risk. And the calculation was that Mexico \nwas a high risk and, to get the dollars, they had to pay a higher rate \nof return.\n  Mr. President, it is not just happening in the south; it is happening \nin the north. Take a good look at Canada. Our neighbors in Canada are \nthe most heavily taxed people in the Western Hemisphere. Do you know \nwhat they are paying for interest on their national debt? Twenty \npercent of the total budget of Canada is interest on their accumulated \ndebt. Canada runs a health care system, a national health care system, \nthat is an absolute, unmitigated disaster. It is a Government-run \nhealth care system. There is no control from the standpoint of having \nan inducement to reduce costs if you are a Canadian citizen because \nthere is no direct benefit of such reduction to you. You can go in \ntoday, go in tomorrow, and on and on. We must learn from what is \nhappening around us.\n  The only way to get out from under this sea of red ink is to adopt \nthe balanced budget amendment. And I think putting a simplistic and \nrealistic acknowledgment that we have tried everything else and it does \nnot work is the proof in the pudding. The public knows that no family \nor business can survive for long when, year in and year out, the \nprincipal of its debt grows, and all of its borrowing is dedicated to \npay off the debt holders. That is where we are going.\n  So, Mr. President, when future generations look back on the decisions \nwe made in this last decade of the 20th century, I know they will \nappreciate the wisdom of the people and the Congress in adding the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution because it is the only \nviable choice we have. For this amendment stands for the proposition \nthat future generations are entitled to economic freedom, unburdened by \nfinancial debts of past generations. It is our responsibility to end \nthe practice of sending unpaid bills on to our children and our \ngrandchildren. That is a principle that belongs in the Constitution, in \nthe same sense freedom of speech and press belongs in the Constitution.\n  So let us make no more excuses, Mr. President. Let us not use the \nexcuse that we have to know where the cuts are before we can vote for \nthis amendment. That is simply a copout for inaction. We have seen \nenough copouts. We cannot continue this spending. We are either going \nto have to take in more revenue or make the cuts. The public \nunderstands that. And the public will be watching each of our votes. We \nwill have to stand up and be counted on this one.\n  What the public does not understand is why this body, this Senate, is \nnot moving in the manner in which the House of Representatives did in \npassing the balanced budget amendment.\n  So I urge my colleagues to reflect on a very simple reality as \nevidenced by the charts. We have tried everything else. It has not \nworked. It is getting late in the game. And if we do not do it now, it \nmay be simply too late forever for our monetary system as we know it \ntoday.\n  I thank the Chair for its indulgence. I wish my colleagues a good \nday.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I first wish to commend my distinguished \ncolleague from Alaska for a very excellent discussion. I was privileged \nto join him here on the floor and, frankly, I learned a good deal from \nthat. It was very well prepared and very well delivered.\n  Mr. President, I observe the distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia momentarily on the floor. I am hopeful that he can join me for \na colloquy after I give my remarks.\n  Mr. President, I have been a cosponsor of the pending measure since \nits inception, and throughout my 16-plus years in the U.S. Senate I \nhave invariably supported legislative initiatives calling for a \nbalanced budget.\n  I do so, Mr. President, because not only do I firmly believe in the \nfiscal ramifications but, equally important, this constitutional \namendment, as it goes to our 50 States, will provide an education for \nall of our citizens as to the complexity of budgeting,\n and the difficulty of achieving a balanced budget, such that assuming \nthis becomes eventually the law of the land, the people of the United \nStates will have a far better understanding when we have to make those \ncuts which affect them individually. In some instances, it will hurt, \nbut hopefully they will understand we are doing this for the benefit of \nall, particularly future generations. This debate will occur, of \ncourse, in the State legislatures. Each member of that legislature will \nhave to go to the village greens of his or her respective community and \nhold that debate in the town halls. This coming Saturday night, in my \nState, I will go down to Shenandoah County, VA, and there in the \nfirehouse--which is the largest structure for a gathering in this \nmarvelous rural county in the historic valley of Virginia--I am going \nto talk extensively about this very measure and the thoroughness with \nwhich the Senate of the United States is considering this measure. I \nonly wish that I could tell them that, with absolute certainty, the \nSenate will adopt it next week. I am optimistic, as are others, but I \nwish I could share that with my constituents on Saturday night.\n   [[Page S3121]] My constituents, and others, have waited patiently \nthese many years, because the State of Virginia is solidly behind it. I \ntalked with my colleague, the junior Senator from Virginia, today and I \nam very hopeful that Virginia will have two votes next week for the \nbalanced budget. Senator Robb appeared earlier today--a bipartisan \nappearance, which indicates that next week Virginia will get two votes, \nMr. President, for this very important piece of legislation.\n  As I have followed, along with my colleagues, very carefully this \nweek, this debate, it sort of comes down to the argument that we need \nit because we look the public squarely in the eye and say we cannot do \nit; we cannot do it unless we have the constitutional amendment. That \nis a very candid admission. But by our votes next week, we make that \nadmission to ourselves and to every citizen of this great Nation.\n  People say, ``Are you sure you cannot do it? Have you ever tried to \ndo it?''\n  Well, I want to share with you a bit of interesting history. To the \nbest of my knowledge, it has not been mentioned thus far in this \ndebate. The Commonwealth of Virginia is among those States which \nrequire balanced budgets. My partner in this institution, when I first \narrived in 1979, was Harry F. Byrd, Jr., whose father, Harry F. Byrd, \nSr., had served many terms prior to him. Basically, he succeeded his \nfather. The Byrd family was known as fiscal conservatives. Therefore, \nit was quite proper for Senator Byrd, in 1978--actually the year before \nI arrived in the Senate--to offer an amendment--S. 2152--which he \nattached to the Bretton Woods Agreement Act. The Bretton Woods Act \nauthorized the United States to participate in a supplemental financing \nfacility of the International Monetary Fund. That is not relevant. It \nhappened to be a vehicle for the Byrd amendment. Senator Byrd, Jr., \ncontended that only by bringing the cost of Government under control \ncould we bring the cost of living under control.\n  You might ask, why was he so troubled in 1978? He was troubled \nbecause there was double-digit inflation, not the relatively, \ncomparatively low rate of inflation today, but there was double-digit \ninflation in 1978. It was Senator Harry F. Byrd's view that if we put \nin a balanced budget amendment, we could begin to bring that inflation \nunder control. The majority of the U.S. Senate agreed with him. The \ntext of this amendment was very simple and straightforward.\n  I quote:\n\n       Beginning with the fiscal year 1981--\n\n  Mind you, this was calendar 1978. We were then in fiscal 1979. So \nSenator Byrd recognized it would take at least 2 years to begin to \nratchet down this excessive spending.\n  So his law said:\n\n       Beginning with fiscal year 1981, the total budget outlays \n     of the Federal Government shall not exceed its receipts.\n\n  It was a very short amendment. Repeating:\n\n       Beginning with fiscal year 1981, the total budget outlays \n     of the Federal Government shall not exceed its receipts.\n\n  Another interesting feature is that my distinguished colleague spoke \nvery briefly--and I refer you to the Congressional Record of July 31, \n1978, page S23411. This was his speech, one paragraph:\n\n       If this amendment is adopted, it would be a matter of \n     record on the part of the Senate for a balanced budget \n     beginning in the fiscal year 1981.\n\n  Later that same day, Mr. President, the amendment passed the U.S. \nSenate by a vote of 58 to 28. Curiously, 14 colleagues were not voting. \nThe Senate, within hours after the introduction of the amendment, \nadopted it 58 to 28. I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this \npoint in the Record the vote on that amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Vote on the Byrd Amendment, July 31, 1978\n\n\n                               yeas (58)\n\n                         Democrats (28 or 55%)\n\n     Allen\n     Bayh\n     Bentsen\n     Biden\n     Burdick\n     Byrd, Harry F., Jr.\n     Cannon\n     Chiles\n     Church\n     DeConcini\n     Durkin\n     Eastland\n     Ford\n     Hollings\n     Huddleston\n     Leahy\n     Magnuson\n     Matsunaga\n     McIntyre\n     Melcher\n     Morgan\n     Moynihan\n     Nunn\n     Proxmire\n     Randolph\n     Stone\n     Talmadge\n     Zorinsky\n\n                        Republicans (30 or 86%)\n\n     Baker\n     Bartlett\n     Bellmon\n     Brooke\n     Chafee\n     Danforth\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Garn\n     Hansen\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield, Mark O.\n     Hayakawa\n     Neinz\n     Helms\n     Laxalt\n     Lugar\n     McClure\n     Packwood\n     Percy\n     Roth\n     Schmitt\n     Schweiker\n     Scott\n     Stafford\n     Stevens\n     Thurmond\n     Tower\n     Wallop\n     Young\n\n\n                               nays (28)\n\n                         Democrats (23 or 45%)\n\n     Byrd, Robert C.\n     Clark\n     Cranston\n     Culver\n     Eaglton\n     Glenn\n     Gravel\n     Hart\n     Hatfield, Paul G.\n     Hodges\n     Humphrey\n     Jacskon\n     Kennedy\n     Long\n     McGovern\n     Metzenbaum\n     Nelson\n     Ribicoff\n     Riegle\n     Sarbanes\n     Sparkman\n     Stevenson\n     Williams\n\n                        (Republicans (5 or 14%)\n\n     Case\n     Javits\n     Mathias\n     Pearson\n     Weicker\n\n\n                            not voting (14)\n\n                             Democrats (11)\n\n     Abourezk\n     Anderson\n     Bumpers\n     Haskell\n     Hathaway\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Muski\n     Pell\n     Sasser\n     Stennis\n\n                            Republicans (3)\n\n     Curtis\n     Goldwater\n     Griffin\n  Mr. WARNER. It is very interesting, because if you were to correlate \nthose that voted for the Byrd amendment who are still in the U.S. \nSenate today--and I would like to read off a few names: Senator Biden, \nSenator Ford, Senator Hollings, Senator Leahy, Senator Moynihan, \nSenator Nunn, and Senator Mark Hatfield, and others of the Republican \nside. I mention Senator Hatfield because this Senator does not know \nwhat he might do regarding this amendment. But Senator Hatfield voted \nfor this. It is interesting to note those who are in the Senate today \nthat voted against it then: Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, \nSenator Glenn, Senator Kennedy, Senator Sarbanes. It is remarkable to \nsee how the composition has changed in that relatively brief period. \nSome of the term limit folks might want to look at that someday. There \nis the vote. The amendment went in midday and, in a matter of hours, it \nwas voted on--the same day. The debate was one paragraph long by \nSenator Byrd. No colleague got up to dispute the value of it, and it \npassed.\n  On October 10--I remind you, this was July 31 when the amendment \npassed the Senate--that language became section 7 of Public Law 95-435, \nsigned by the President as the law of the land. Very clear. This \nCongress bound itself to the Byrd amendment. It became the law of the \nland. We had a balanced budget amendment controlling this body, \nbeginning in fiscal year of 1981.\n  In 1980, the Congress readdressed the Byrd amendment, and it was \nmodified again in the Bretton Woods Agreement Act of 1980, on October \n7, 1980, to read as follows:\n  ``The Congress reaffirms its commitment that beginning with FY 1981 \nthe total outlays of the Federal Government shall''--I underline \n``shall''--``not exceed its receipts.''\n  Reaffirmation, once again. Now, it becomes interesting. We are \ngetting to that point where the amendment which is binding on the \nCongress and the word ``shall'' is once again reexamined by the \nCongress. The year is 1982, as part of the recodification case of title \n31, U.S. Code, public law 97-258, September 13, 1982, 96 statute 907, \nthe Byrd amendment was restated, but restated in a different form.\n  I go to the code and read the Byrd amendment as it is the law today:\n\n       Congress reaffirms its commitment that budget outlays of \n     the United States Government for a fiscal year may be not \n     more than the receipts of the Government for that year.\n\n  [[Page S3122]] Mr. President, the key is the word ``may''--examining, \nof course, how we interpret the laws. ``Shall'' was binding. ``May\" \nbecame permissive. There is a very clear record of how this body got \nright up to where it was going to bind it and quietly slipped in the \nword ``may'' substituting for ``shall.''\n  What better example of how this institution, having come to grips \nwith this issue, having voted with this issue twice, then quietly and \nsurreptitiously changed one word, basically, to make it permissive.\n  That was the end of the Byrd amendment. That is why I and others are \nhere and have been for these many days, to urge this body once again to \nadopt, in slightly different form, the wisdom of the Byrd amendment and \nmake it binding on this, the Congress of the United States. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, before the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia [Mr. Warner] leaves the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would be very happy to listen to my \ndistinguished colleague.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator pays me great honor and flattery \nto think that at this late hour, the Senator from Virginia would listen \nto me for even a short length of time.\n  I want to comment, in view of the fact that he has mentioned the \nillustrious names of Harry Flood Byrd, Sr., and Harry Flood Byrd, Jr. I \nhad the great honor and privilege and pleasure to serve with both Harry \nByrd, Sr., and Harry Byrd, Jr.\n  This is somewhat coincidental, perhaps, as I was saying to Senator \nWarner just a little earlier. I have just received a letter from a \nconstituent of mine who lives at Salem, WV. It mentions the name of \nHarry F. Byrd, Sr. I shall read the letter. It was written on the 14th \nof February. It reached my office on the 17th of February.\n\n       Senator Byrd: Enclosed is a letter I thought might be \n     enjoyable for you to read. You also may keep it, if you wish. \n     Years ago my children and I were going to Baltimore, \n     Maryland, and went past your father's orchard. I stopped and \n     allowed my children to pick up an apple each, and one for me, \n     as I assumed the ones had fallen.\n       Regardless, I came home and fully decided that I had stolen \n     the apples. Today we could be shot for doing this. I was poor \n     and had dimes to pay for the apples. I have saved this letter \n     because he touched my heart by it. The dimes, I am sure, was \n     picked up by my kids maybe me. Who knows.\n       I loved him and I feel you are just about like him. I think \n     you are doing a fine job. Thank you. Dorothea Moses.\n       P.S., I'm old now and write uphill.\n\n  Well, of course, I am not the son of Harry Byrd, Sr. I wrote the \nlady, thanked her for the letter, and stated that I came up in the home \nof a poor coal miner in southern West Virginia, although I served with \nboth Harry Byrd, Jr. and Harry Byrd, Sr.\n  Here is the letter that Harry Byrd, Sr., wrote to the lady, in \nresponse, dated September 18, 1947:\n\n       Mrs. Dorothea Moses, Salem.\n       My dear Mrs. Moses: I just received your letter which I \n     deeply appreciate. This is the first time I have ever been \n     offered 10 cents apiece for my apples.\n       I am gratified by the sense of honesty which prompted you \n     to send me payment for the apples which, however, I herewith \n     return with the hope that you enjoyed them, although I fear \n     they were not ripe enough for eating purposes. But best \n     wishes, I am faithfully yours, Harry Byrd, Sr.\n\n  Mr. President, I think that was a remarkable letter from a very \nremarkable United States Senator, one whom I admired a great, great \ndeal. I think this was a remarkable constituent, who, upon returning to \nher home in Baltimore, MD, decided she ought to pay for the few apples \nthat her children and she had picked up off the ground. The letter \nspeaks for itself.\n  So, I am going to take the liberty of providing this correspondence \nto Harry Byrd, Jr., for whom I have an admiration equal to the \nadmiration I had for his father.\n  I think that this is a pretty remarkable story, and I am sure that \nHarry Byrd, Jr., will enjoy reading this letter from a bygone age when \npeople were honest, although they were poor, and felt that they ought \nto make a remittance even when apples were picked up off the ground of \nthe orchard's owner. How that must have thrilled Harry Byrd, Sr., to \nreceive that kind of letter from that honest woman.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for \ntelling that story. I have always been heartened in this institution \nand this body by the manner in which the senior Senator from West \nVirginia has always invariably paid great respect to his former \ncolleagues,\n and particularly the rendition of stories. If my colleagues will \nindulge me for a brief story. I think of the time I met Harry Byrd, Sr. \nMy family had interest in property very near the Byrd home, which is in \nBerryville, VA. I own a farm now that has sort of been in my family one \nway or another--I have owned it now 30-some odd years. It is in White \nPost, which is just a few miles from the Byrd orchards.\n\n  On my farm are orchards. And, indeed, for some period of time, Harry \nByrd, Sr.'s grandson operated with me the apple orchards. So much for \nthat.\n  I remember visiting one time in July; it was very hot. But it was an \nannual event where Byrd, Sr. would go to his orchard and invite the \npeople from all over the community to come and listen to him talk about \nwhat occurred in the Congress of the United States. Of course, in those \nearly days, the Congress often went home in July. It occurred year \nafter year in the same manner.\n  He would back up an old apple truck. He would get up on the back of \nthe truck and the people would gather under the trees. He always wore a \nwhite suit. Does the senior Senator from West Virginia remember that \nwhite suit?\n  Senator Byrd had a high-pitched voice. I suppose you might say--and I \ndo not mean to denigrate--he had a little bit of a sweep to it, a high \npitch. You had to kind of lean forward to listen, but you could hear \nit. I was just a young man sitting out there listening with all the \npeople.\n  It is interesting, his staff were always dressed in dark blue suits, \nso you could see the white suit among the dark ones. Then there were \nall the folks who worked in the orchards who had on the bib overalls, \nand the farmers would come from miles around. They would bring a picnic \nlunch. They wanted to hear this speech.\n  He did the same thing every year. He would bring down a copy of the \nbudget, the budget document. It would be down on the ground, and he \nwould say, ``Young man, put the budget document up on the rear of the \ntruck here, right up here on this little podium so I can tell the \npeople about it.''\n  And the young man would reach down and he could not lift it. He would \nsay, ``It will take two young men to raise the budget,'' and sure \nenough, eventually it would get up on the apple crates. He just used \nthe old apple crates. He put that budget down, and he would start \norating about the excessive spending in the United States and would go \npage after page after page after page, saying each page is hundreds of \nthousands of dollars, and we would all listen in absolute silence.\n  The Byrd family, senior and junior, without parallel in this \ninstitution, stood for fiscal responsibility of the United States of \nAmerica. This brief statute which was enacted by the Congress of the \nUnited States on two occasions, which is binding, shall ever remain a \nhallmark to father and son and their fiscal responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. President, I have received a copy of a resolution enacted by the \nLegislature of West Virginia, Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 16. The \nresolution requests that the Congress provide information with respect \nto this constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which will \nindicate what actions will be taken by the Congress in order to achieve \na balanced budget, if this amendment is adopted. In other words, the \nWest Virginia legislature asserts a ``right to know.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         State of West Virginia\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 16\n\n            (By Senators Tomblin, Mr. President, and Chafin)\n\n       Urging Congress to provide full information about the \n     effect of a proposed balanced budget amendment on the people \n     and government of West Virginia before submitting it to the \n     Legislature for ratification.\n        [[Page S3123]] Whereas, The constitution of the United \n     States of America is the most perfect example of a contract \n     between a people and their government; and\n       Whereas, The congress of the United States is currently \n     considering an amendment to the constitution, known as the \n     ``Balanced Budget Amendment''; and\n       Whereas, The House of Representatives has already approved \n     its version of such a balanced budget amendment; and\n       Whereas, The House of Representatives approved its version \n     without obtaining a projection of how it would be \n     implemented; and\n       Whereas, The House of Representatives rejected a version of \n     the balanced budget amendment, offered by Representative Bob \n     Wise of West Virginia, that would have protected against cuts \n     in social security and would have allowed for both a capital \n     and operating budget; and\n       Whereas, The proposal for a balanced budget amendment is \n     now under active consideration in the United States Senate; \n     and\n       Whereas, United States Senators Robert C. Byrd and John D. \n     Rockefeller IV of West Virginia have called for a ``right to \n     know'' provision so that the senators would know before they \n     vote how a balanced budget would be achieved; and\n       Whereas, The treasury department of the United States has \n     projected that a balanced budget amendment implemented by \n     across-the-board cuts would reduce federal grants to West \n     Virginia state government by $765 million dollars, requiring \n     the Legislature to increase state taxes to compensate for \n     such losses or eliminate the programs and services currently \n     provided to our citizens by federal funds; and\n       Whereas, Many citizens of West Virginia would likely suffer \n     from cuts imposed to meet the requirements of the proposed \n     balanced budget amendment, including thousands of our \n     citizens who receive social security, veterans benefits, \n     medicare, medicaid and other essential benefits; and\n       Whereas, Through the efforts of Senator Robert C. Byrd and \n     other members of our congressional delegation appropriations \n     have been made for numerous projects in West Virginia, \n     including completion of the Appalachian corridor highway \n     system, relocation of the federal bureau of investigation \n     center to West Virginia and a myriad of other projects; and\n       Whereas, These benefits and projects are vital to the \n     economic development and well being of the people of our \n     state and deserve to be protected if the constitution is \n     amended to require a balanced budget; and\n       Whereas, West Virginia receives $1.45 in federal benefits \n     for each dollar in federal taxes; and\n       Whereas, On a per capita basis, each man, woman and child \n     receives approximately $2,000 dollars more in benefits from \n     the federal government than he or she pays in federal taxes; \n     and\n       Whereas, A proposal to balance the federal budget by \n     returning the programs to the states would mean that West \n     Virginia would be required to either raise its taxes by \n     $2,000 dollars for each man, woman and child or eliminate the \n     programs and services currently provided to our citizens by \n     federal funds; and\n       Whereas, The balanced budget amendment would be submitted \n     to the Legislature for ratification if approved by the \n     congress; and\n       Whereas, This Legislature will be unable to establish its \n     own budget without knowing what reductions will be made by \n     the congress to effect the balanced budget amendment; and\n       Whereas, This Legislature therefore has a right to know \n     what effect the proposed balanced budget amendment would have \n     on state government, but more importantly, on the people of \n     our state; therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of West Virginia:\n       That the Legislature recognizes that a balanced federal \n     budget is a desirable objective; and, be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Legislature commends the \n     president and the congress for their efforts toward this \n     objective by supporting and enacting legislation that will \n     result in the reduction of the federal deficit for three \n     years in a row; and, be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Legislature will be asked to \n     vote for ratification of a balanced budget amendment to the \n     constitution if such a measure is submitted to the states by \n     the congress; and, be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Legislature, acting on behalf of \n     the citizens of West Virginia in deciding whether to ratify \n     such an amendment, is entitled to be fully informed of its \n     consequences on our people; and, be it\n       Further Resolved, That the congress is hereby urged to \n     submit such an amendment to the States for ratification only \n     if congress provides a detailed projection of what reductions \n     will be made in the federal budget and how these will affect \n     the government and people of West Virginia, including but not \n     limited to, the effect on social security benefits, veterans \n     benefits, medicare, medicaid, education, highway moneys, \n     including completion of the Appalachian corridor system, and \n     other programs necessary for the health and well-being of the \n     people of our state; and, be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Clerk of the Senate is hereby \n     requested to forward a copy of this resolution to the \n     president of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives and each member of the West Virginia \n     congressional delegation.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, earlier today, the distinguished senior \nSenator from the State of Tennessee referred to my comments a day or so \nago when I spoke on the constitutional amendment, with specific \nreference to section 5. The distinguished Senator from Tennessee, I \nthink, did not really understand what I said with respect to section 5 \nof the constitutional amendment.\n  I quote the distinguished Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Thompson]:\n  ``He''--meaning this Senator from West Virginia--``He was concerned \nthat in times of a declaration of war, the amendment requires a \nconstitutional majority of 51 Senators.''\n  Of course, that is not the case. As I understand section 5, it does \nnot require a constitutional majority of 51 Senators to declare war. \nThe able Senator from Tennessee clearly misunderstood what I said--he \nmust have. And so I let it go at that, because the amendment certainly \ndoes not require that. Section 5 of the amendment does not require a \nconstitutional majority of 51 Senators to declare war and I never so \nstated, unless I was misquoted.\n  Going on, the senior Senator from Tennessee said: ``He,'' meaning the \nSenator from West Virginia,\n\n       He thought that hurdle was too high because normally \n     without the amendment, on most votes around here it is the \n     majority of those present with the Vice President casting a \n     tie-breaking vote if called upon.\n\n  I continue to quote the words of the Senator from Tennessee:\n\n       As I listened to that debate, it is very interesting, the \n     possibilities are intriguing from an intellectual standpoint. \n     Sitting and listening to Senator Byrd of West Virginia is \n     like sitting in a good class of constitutional law. I enjoy \n     it. If we did not have a Senator Byrd, we would need to \n     invent one because he brings issues to the floor and to the \n     table that need to be discussed. But again, does this not \n     assume that 50 Senators plus the Vice President would do the \n     right thing? He--\n\n  meaning Senator Byrd from West Virginia--\n\n       He is concerned we might not get that vote.\n       Here we are, we need to declare war and we might not get \n     the 51 votes. So he--\n\n  meaning Senator Byrd.\n\n     assumes, I suppose, that 50 Senators plus the Vice President \n     would do the right thing and we would get the 51 votes that \n     way, but under this amendment that 51 Senators would not do \n     the right thing.\n       Now, is that not slicing it a little thin in light of what \n     we are dealing with here? Is that not belaboring the point? \n     It needs to be discussed. But is that what this is going to \n     turn on, whether or not we have 50 Senators plus a Vice \n     President, on the one hand, or 51 Senators on the other?\n       I must say, Mr. President, it is my opinion that there are \n     enough good people in this Chamber that if we have the kind \n     of situation that requires a declaration of war, we would do \n     the right thing, that we would do the right thing when the \n     circumstances arose.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Tennessee misunderstood the direction \nand the thrust of my remarks. I was not saying that under the balanced \nbudget amendment, a majority of the whole number present would be \nneeded to vote for a declaration of war. I did not say that at all, and \nthe amendment does not say it. Either Mr. Thompson misunderstood me or \nhe misunderstands the verbiage in section 5.\n  It is an honest mistake on his part, but I thought I should set the \nrecord clear. I am not under any illusions that the amendment requires \n51 Senators to vote to declare war. It does nothing of the kind. A \nsimple majority of those Senators voting, a quorum being present, is \nsufficient to adopt a declaration of war, both now and under the \namendment.\n  The thrust of my concerns went to the second portion of that \namendment, which did not deal with a declaration of war but, rather, \ndealt with the situation in which a military threat to our Nation's \nsecurity might exist; in which case, in order to lift the strictures of \nthe constitutional amendment that is being debated, a majority of the \nwhole number of Members of both Houses would then be required--in which \ncase, I took the position that the minisupermajority requirement could \nput our Nation in further peril and also have the effect, if he should \ncast a vote in a tie situation, of negating that Vice President's vote, \nthe Vice President not being a Member of the Senate. So much for that.\n   [[Page S3124]] Mr. President, let us take a look at what may be in \nstore for the Nation should the amendment be drafted into the \nConstitution; namely, that the amendment may be enforced. I see \nproblems with the amendment, which I have mentioned to some degree \nearlier and which I shall refer to here again briefly. The problem with \nthe amendment, if it is enforced, is that it creates very serious \nproblems. If it is not enforced, on the other hand, it still creates \nserious problems.\n  Suppose at the end of the second fiscal year following the \nratification of the amendment, the Office of Management and Budget \nannounces that the total outlays for the United States will exceed \ntotal receipts for that year by, say, $50 billion. Suppose further, \nthat the President is advised by White House counsel and the Director \nof the Office of Management and Budget that he is obligated by the new \namendment to take whatever action is necessary to bring the outlays \ninto line with the receipts.\n  Suppose he is exhorted by his advisers to use a line-item veto, even \nthough the Constitution under which we have operated for over 200 years \ndoes not give him that authority. He could be prevailed upon by his OMB \ndirector and others to assume that the new amendment to the \nConstitution inherently gives him the authority to take whatever action \nis needed to bring the budget into balance, to make outlays balance \nwith the receipts.\n  What will happen to the outlays of the various departments? Will \ndefense contracts be held up? If moneys are impounded by the President, \nor if a line-item veto authority, which he does not have today under \nthe original Constitution, should be assumed, or enhanced rescissions \nauthority, which is worse than the line-item veto, were to be assumed, \nwill checks to people who are unemployed be withheld? Will Medicare \npayments be stopped? Will Medicaid be cut back? Will Social Security \nchecks be put on hold? Will the President impound moneys that have been \nmandated by the Congress to be spent, even though he would be acting in \nviolation of the 1974 Budget and Impoundment Control Act? This sounds \nlike a sure prescription for an Imperial Presidency.\n  The President, any President, could feel the compulsion to obey the \nmandate ``implicit'' in the Constitution as amended by this balanced \nbudget amendment, believing that it contained inherent authority to \nexercise enhanced revisions authority, line-item veto authority, and \nimpoundment authority, and he would be certainly advised by his \ncounsel, I should think, to proceed to reduce outlays, thus sharing the \npower over the purse that is currently vested in Congress by article I \nof the Constitution, article I, section 8, the power that is given to \nthe Congress to raise revenue, and by section 9 of article I to \nappropriate money. He would believe himself to be authorized to cut \nwhatever programs and projects he chose to cut while leaving untouched \nthose projects he supported. By holding programs and projects hostage, \nhe would be in a position to suspend a Damocles sword over the heads of \nSenators and Representatives with respect to projects and matters \nimportant to their States and districts.\n  Moreover, he could use this leverage to bring legislators into line \non matters other than those affecting the budget. Confirmation votes on \nfuture Clarence Thomases could bring tremendous pressure on Senators by \nsuch enhanced Presidential powers. He could threaten this or threaten \nthat, and I, as a Senator, might or might not buckle under that \npressure. I have had pressures from Presidents, like Lyndon Johnson, \nwho really knew how to twist arms. It was pretty hard to say no to a \nPresident who, like Lyndon Johnson, was the former majority leader of \nthis Senate, who had much to do in those days with putting me on the \nAppropriations Committee, but I said no. What it meant was about 30 \nminutes of excruciating torture, after which I felt that my clothes \nneeded washing and drying. I felt that I had been put through a clothes \nwringer.\n  Confirmation votes on future Clarence Thomases or future treaty votes \nwould be a President's to collect, merely by threatening to line-item \nveto or impound monies concerning programs supported by certain Members \nof Congress. A President could also use this power effectively with \nrespect to cutting capital gains taxes or achieving other cherished \ngoals.\n  I suggest, if any Senator is interested in reading about one of those \narm-twisting sessions that I had with the late President Lyndon B. \nJohnson, the Senator read from the second volume of my history on the \nUnited States Senate, 1789 to 1989. It is all laid out there.\n  The road would be paved for the courts then--get this--to get into \nthe act of balancing the budget. Beneficiaries of programs arbitrarily \ncut back by the President's actions could go into the courts and demand \nthat the cuts be restored, and the claimants of such payments could \nvery well, in some circumstances, at least, establish standing to sue.\n  If the courts concluded that it was necessary to impose a tax in \norder to bring receipts up to the level of outlays, the taxpayers would \nhave standing to apply for relief. And if ever there could be a \nlawyers' paradise, the millennium would be here.\n  One might denominate this amendment as the constitutional amendment \nto benefit lawyers. In saying that, I do not speak with any disrespect \ntoward lawyers. I would prefer to call it the constitutional amendment \nfor minority rule. I may have more to say on that at another time.\n  Montesquieu, in his ``Spirit of the Laws,'' stated, ``of the three \npowers . . . the Judiciary is next to nothing.'' Meaning of the three \npowers: The executive, the legislative and the judiciary. Montesquieu \nsaid, ``of the three powers . . . the Judiciary is next to nothing.'' \nHe also said, ``There is no liberty, if the power of judging be not \nseparated from the legislative and executive powers.''\n  Hamilton agreed with Montesquieu in the Federalist Paper, Number 78, \nwherein Hamilton went on to state: ``The executive not only dispenses \nthe honors but holds the sword of the community. The legislature not \nonly commands the purse, but prescribes the rules by which the duties \nand rights of every citizen are to be regulated. The judiciary, on the \ncontrary, has no influence over either the sword or the purse . . . The \njudiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of \npower.'' That was Hamilton.\n  The amendment on which we are about to vote within the next few days \nwould turn Montesquieu's and Hamilton's world topsy-turvy, upside down. \nThe judiciary could become the strongest of the three departments of \ngovernment and thus hold influence over both the sword and the purse. \nConstitutional government as we have known it for over 200 years, based \nupon the separation of powers and checks and balances concepts, would \nperish from the Earth.\n  That is one course that we may find ourselves travelling.\n  The Peoples' Branch would atrophy. Representative government would no \nlonger exist. Unelected members of the courts would wield the power of \nthe purse. The Constitutional mandate, section 9 of article I of the \nConstitution, that ``no money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \nconsequence of appropriations made by law,'' would be changed, and, \ninstead, we would be treated to the spectacle of appropriations made by \njudicial fiat.\n  The American people fought one revolution over the principle of \n``taxation without representation,'' and now we are about to vote on an \namendment to the Constitution which could easily result in unelected \njudges mandating higher taxes--judges who are appointed for life \nmandating higher taxes. If we think the people would be upset with \nCongress for increasing their taxes, just imagine what their feelings \nwill be when their taxes are hiked by unelected judges who are \nappointed with life tenures. Could we be sowing the seeds for another \nrevolution by adopting this amendment? If there were ever a Pandora's \nbox with evils imprisoned therein to bring misfortune to our country, \nthis would surely be it. If the amendment is enforced, the powers of \nthe legislature will flow to the executive and to the judiciary, and we \nwill have destroyed a government of separation of powers and checks and \nbalances.\n  Contemplate that, for 200 years--206 years, our Nation has operated \nunder \n[[Page S3125]]  the Constitution that was written by the illustrious \nFramers in Philadelphia in 1787, and that, by the adoption of this \namendment and by its subsequent ratification by the States--if the \nStates do ratify it in the requisite number as set forth in the \noriginal Constitution--we will have destroyed, I think, the \nconstitutional form of Government that our forefathers gave us. It will \ncertainly be in danger, great danger. So the handiwork of the Framers \nwill finally have been ill served.\n\n       I saw them tearing a building down,\n       A group of men in a busy town;\n       With a ``Ho, heave, ho'' and a lusty yell,\n       They swung a beam and the sidewall fell.\n       I said to the foreman, ``Are these men skilled\n       The type you'd hire if you had to build?\"\n       He laughed, and then he said, ``No, indeed,\n       Just common labor is all I need;\n       I can easily wreck in a day or two,\n       That which takes builders years to do.''\n       I said to myself as I walked away,\n       ``Which of these roles am I trying to play?\n       Am I a builder who works with care,\n       Building my life by the rule and square?\n       Am I shaping my deeds by a well-laid plan,\n       Patiently building the best I can?\n       Or am I a wrecker who walks the town,\n       Content with the labor of tearing down?\"\n\n  Mr. President, the lines from The Masonic Craftsmen are well \ndescriptive of the situation if this balanced budget amendment is ever \nnailed into the original Constitution as an amendment. I shudder to \nthink that that prospect may very well be close at hand.\n  If, on the other hand, the Constitutional provision is not enforced, \nwe will have made the Constitution promise something that it cannot \nfulfill, and it will henceforth become a mere piece of paper, relegated \nto the dustbin of history.\n  What will actually happen in the event of the adoption and \nratification of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution remains \nto be seen.\n  Nobody knows. I do not know precisely what will happen. I have \noutlined two very sad prospects--one if the amendment is enforced, the \nother if it is not enforced--as to what may be in the offing in the \nevent this constitutional amendment were to be adopted and ratified. \nWe, of course, cannot be absolutely sure, but why should we take such \nrisks? Republican Senators will not tell us how they intend to carry \nout the mandate of the constitutional amendment on the balanced budget. \nI happen to believe that if the amendment is grafted on to the \nConstitution, there will be efforts to enforce it, and this will mean \nthat we no longer have a government by the people, but, instead, the \npeople will be governed by a black-robed Office of Management and \nBudget, run by one Chief Director and eight associate directors \nappointed for life, with control over both the sword and the purse.\n  There will be no rams' bellies by which we may ride out of that \ndilemma, as Odysseus did when he and his companions escaped from the \ncavern of Polyphemus.\n  In escaping from that cavern, Odysseus instructed his companions to \nhold onto the bellies of the rams as they went out of the cave to \ngraze, Polyphemus, the chief of the Cyclopes, having been blinded by \nthe fire of a piece of wood that Odysseus had plunged into the giant's \neye. They escaped by holding onto the bellies of the rams.\n  The giant laid his hands on the tops of the rams as they went out of \nthe cave. He never thought to feel under the bellies.\n  Odysseus and his remaining few companions--those that had not ended \nup in the stomach of Polyphemus--had found a way to escape by holding \nonto the rams' bellies. Well, Senators, we will not have any rams' \nbellies here by which we may ride out of this dilemma. And unlike \nOdysseus in Homer's epic, while we may be able to escape the violent \nwhirlpool of Charybdis, we will still be devoured by Scylla, except, \nunlike Homer's Scylla, which had 12 legs, and 6 hideous heads bearing 3 \nrows of teeth each, ours will be a monster with 18 legs, and 9 heads \nbearing 2 rows of teeth each. Ours will no longer be a government of \nlaws; instead, it will become a government of judicial fiats. Is this \nwhat Washington and his starving men at Valley Forge fought for? Was it \nfor this that Americans shed their blood at Lexington and Concord, and \nat Saratoga? Was this what Nathan Hale had in mind when he gave the \nonly life he had for his country? Did our forefathers pledge their \nlives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to throw off the \ntyrannical hand of George III, only to be ruled by the heavy hand of a \njudicial oligarchy?\n  Mr. President, when the Constitutional Convention had completed its \nwork in 1787, Benjamin Franklin, one of the Framers of the great \ndocument, was approached by a lady who asked the question, ``Dr. \nFranklin, what have you given us?'' Franklin answered, ``A republic, \nmadam, if you can keep it.''\n  Mr. President, this amendment carries the seeds for the destruction \nof the American Constitutional republic as it was handed down to us by \nour forefathers. I say it carries the seed of destruction. I am \nconcerned about the future of this Republic. And there are Members on \nboth sides of the aisle who are going to vote for this amendment, come \nnext Tuesday, who have expressed to me privately their serious doubts \nwith regard to the balanced budget amendment.\n  I know of no magic herb by which we may prove ourselves invulnerable \nto the seductive charms of this ``quick-fix'' amendment. I can only \nhope that Members will fill their ears with wax so that they will not \nbe lured by the siren's song and will ignore the pleas until the danger \nis safely past.\n  Each of us upon being elected to the office of Senator subscribes, by \noath or affirmation, to support and defend the Constitution of the \nUnited States. It is a solemn oath. We do not swear before God and man \nthat we will support and defend a political party. We do not swear that \nwe will support and defend a so-called Contract With America, but only \nthat we will support and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n  Of course, we all understand that the Constitution provides a \nprocess, in Article V, for its own amending, and while I, or any other \nSenator, may be willing to amend the Constitution in one particular or \nanother, what we have here is an amendment which, for all intents and \npurposes, could result in the destruction of a government of checks and \nbalances, a government of separation of powers. We are, therefore, \ntalking about the very bottom bedrock of our Constitutional form of \ngovernment. Take away the checks and balances, which could be the \nresult of this amendment; take away the separation of powers, which \ncould be the result of this amendment; then we will no longer have a \ngovernment of the people, by the people, and for the people. We will \nhave a government of three branches, in which the peoples' branch, the \nlegislative, will become a mere vestigial leftover from a bygone day, \nshorn of its power over the purse and no longer able to fulfill the \nfunctions for which it was created.\n  Make no mistake about it. Senators will never be able to wash this \nstain from their hands.\n  Mr. President, I am not assured by those Senators who say that we can \navoid the intrusion by the courts into the realm of budget making, \nsimply by resorting to the provision that allows a three-fifths vote to \napprove a specific excess of outlays over receipts. I am not sure about \nthat at all. Most of those who support this provision are among those \nSenators and Representatives who will never vote for a tax increase, \ncome what may.\n  I do not like to vote for a tax increase. That is not an easy vote. \nBut there come times when we have to have an increase in taxes. If we \never really bring these budget deficits under control and begin making \npayments on the principal of the debt, I have no doubt that there are \ngoing to have to be some revenue increases. Yet, there are Senators who \nsay they will never vote for a tax increase. They will always depend \nupon someone else to supply the three-fifths of the whole number of \neach House.\n  What this really is, is a prescription for minority rule. Ours would \nbecome a government by minority. That is minority rule--no ifs, ands, \nor buts about it. Are two-thirds of the Members of this Senate ready to \nsubmit themselves to such a stultifying prospect?\n  We are all deeply concerned about the budget deficits, the national \ndebt, and the growing interest on that national debt. I want to see our \nbudget deficits brought down. I want to see our budget brought into \nbalance, especially in those years when we do not have to have a budget \ndeficit in order to deal with an economic decline in the \n[[Page S3126]]  economy, or an ongoing recession. I want to see our \nbudget brought into balance as much as does any other Senator. Every \nSenator in this body wants to see these deficits brought under control.\n  A national debt rapidly approaching $5 trillion, and with the sky as \nthe limit if we do not do something to curtail it, is a terrible legacy \nto leave to our children. We have to do something about it, and it will \nbe painful. It may require us to increase taxes. But it will be an even \nmore awesome legacy to leave to our children and grandchildren, if we \ndestroy the foundations of our constitutional system of checks and \nbalances, sweep away the peoples' power over the purse exercised \nthrough their elected representatives in Congress, and undermine the \nfaith of the Nation in the Constitution itself.\n  I hope that we will ponder this constitutional amendment over this \nweekend as we have never thought about it before. I have heard many \ncomments from people on the outside--for example, from representatives \nof the media--about this debate. Those comments have been favorable \nwith respect to the fact that the Senate has indeed taken the time to \nstudy the amendment, to debate it, to deliberate, and to try to correct \nwhat many of us see as flaws in the amendment.\n  I believe that was the role that the forefathers intended for the \nSenate to play. This constitutional amendment to balance the budget was \nadopted in the House of Representatives after only 2 days of debate. \nThat is appalling. That is an appalling spectacle--to have a \nconstitutional amendment adopted in the other body after only 2 days of \ndebate! But in the Senate, come next Tuesday, it will have been before \nthe Senate for 30 days. I thank the majority leader, and I compliment \nhim for the respect he has thus far shown for the fact that this is a \nconstitutional amendment, and that this is the United States Senate, \nand that this is the role that the United States Senate was supposed to \nplay. That was the role the Framers had in mind from the very \nbeginning--that the Senate would be a deliberative body. Many times we \ndo not deliberate much here anymore. But in this situation, there has \nbeen considerable deliberation.\n  I think that the Framers would be pleased that this Senate has at \nleast slowed down a stampede to enact this constitutional amendment in \na hurry. There have been efforts to amend it, but we have failed thus \nfar. I do hope, however, that the amendment that is being offered by \nSenator Nunn will be agreed to next week. Senator Johnston's amendment \nwas rejected on a tabling motion. Senator Nunn's amendment is different \nonly in a slight respect from the amendment that was offered by Senator \nJohnston. I hope that the amendment by Senator Nunn will be adopted. It \naddresses that very serious and solemn and terrible prospect that the \ncourts might intervene if this amendment were to be adopted and \nenforced. There is nothing in the balanced budget amendment that either \ninvites or forbids the courts to enforce this amendment.\n  I intend to support Senator Nunn's amendment. I am not sure that even \nhis amendment will provide all of the answers, because much is left to \nthe implementing legislation that the Congress will be authorized to \nwrite to enforce the balanced budget amendment. The implementing \nlegislation may itself carry many seeds for the destruction of the \nconstitutional system of checks and balances and separation of powers \nthat we have known for 206 years.\n  Implementing legislation might not even be passed. After all, such \nimplementing legislation has to go to the desk of the President. A \nPresident may veto it in a given situation. It would require two-thirds \nof both bodies to override his veto. Or the implementing legislation \nthat is enacted in one Congress may be amended in a subsequent \nCongress. Even the amendment by Mr. Nunn does not protect us--when I \nsay us, I mean the public--from events which could very well create \nchaos in the economy and change the constitutional form of government \nthat has served the American people so well. Power could still flow \nfrom the legislative to the executive branch.\n  But at least, Senator Nunn's amendment addresses itself to one of the \npossible dangers, and it really goes to show that this balanced budget \namendment is very much like a balloon. If you squeeze the balloon at \none end, it pops out bigger on the other. If you squeeze at that end, \nthen it pops out and makes the balloon larger in another place. If we \ncure one flaw here, we open up other flaws. That just goes to show that \nthis ``quick fix'' really cannot be fixed.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Utah [Mr. \nHatch] for remaining at his post of duty and listening to my remarks on \nthis occasion. He has worked hard on this constitutional amendment. He \nis entitled to a great deal of respect for his efforts to get out of a \nvery, very tough and difficult and complex problem. Unless he wishes to \nask me a question, I will yield to----\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have not yielded yet, but I am available if the Senator \nwishes to respond to my words.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, I want to compliment the \nSenator. I have seen him work this floor very faithfully, \nintelligently, and I believe honestly throughout this debate. We happen \nto differ. I believe that when you press a balloon on one end, it \nexpands on the other end, and when you press it on the other top, it \nexpands on the bottom. But it still contains the future of our country. \nI also believe that the distinguished Senator, as sincere as he is--and \nhe is sincere, and I know that; he has my respect--is saying that this \namendment leads us into a lot of difficulties. But I have to say that \nwe are in a lot of difficulties.\n  Mr. BYRD. I did not hear the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I say we are in a lot of difficulties. Many of us feel \nthat though this bipartisan consensus amendment is not perfect in \nanybody's eyes, that it is the most perfect we can do, and that it is \nthe only way we are going to get spending under control in this \ncountry. But I think the distinguished Senator from West Virginia has \nbeen eloquent throughout this debate. He has been constitutionally apt \nin many respects. And although I differ with him on some of the \ninterpretations, I compliment him for his knowledge, his foresight and \nhis own explanations of how the Constitution is considered.\n  It is to me, too. I feel very, very deeply about it. I feel deeply \nabout my dear colleague's point of view. I do not have any desire to \nprolong this this evening, but I just want to compliment the Senator \nfor his comments, for his hard efforts, for his willingness to be on \nthis floor and to do what he has done with the amendments he has \nbrought forward and the intelligent way in which he has discussed them, \nand for the courteous manner and kindness shown. I really personally \nappreciate it.\n  I did not think my esteem could be any higher than it is for the \nSenator. But it is. It is higher.\n  Mr. President, I just want to say in closing here this evening, I \nwould like to shut the Senate down, but I understand the Senator from \nMaryland wants to speak. I would like to get the floor as soon as the \nSenator from West Virginia is through so I can get legislative matters \nstraightened out here.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am about to yield the floor if the Senator does not wish \nto ask any questions.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not.\n  Mr. BYRD. I appreciate his kind comments. They are very sincere.\n  Mr. HATCH. It never, never ceases to amaze me how the Senator can \njust call up poetry like he did here this evening, and a wealth of \nknowledge about history and especially the history of the Senate.\n  I have to say I was moved by the distinguished Senator's discussion \nof the Harry Byrd letter and Mrs. Moses' letter. I think what the \nSenator does in bringing things like that to the attention of everybody \nperpetuates the importance and the feelings and the basic goodness of \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. BYRD. As the Senator knows, ``I'll cavil on the ninth part of a \nhair,'' and ``I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.''\n  Sometimes I think we probably overdo the expressions of affection in \nthis body. However, I do appreciate the kind words the Senator has \nexpressed. I had hoped we might, even at this late hour, engage in \ndebate. But I do not \n[[Page S3127]]  want to insist on it. I will close my remarks with \nrespect to our mutual affection. The Senator knows that, for him ``my \naffection hath an unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.''\n  Let us hope that on next Tuesday Senators will remember the words of \nLord Nelson, who lost his life in the Battle of Trafalgar. His last \nwords were, ``Thank God, I have done my duty.''\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have to confess that I believe that the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia always does his duty. I \npersonally appreciate it, even when I disagree.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia has presented us with \nthe triple threat from the balanced budget amendment of: First, an \nimperial Presidency; second, an all-powerful judiciary; and third, the \nseeds of revolution. Possibly, he suggests, the Constitution itself \nwill be relegated to the dustbin of history.\n  This is strange indeed given that the amendment itself gives Congress \nthe power and duty to enforce and implement the balanced budget \namendment.\n  I would ask what continuing on the path we are on would do to the \nConstitution or the Nation. If President Clinton's predictions are \ncorrect that the generation that is beginning now will be taxed at the \nnet tax rate of 82 percent that all will be tranquility? Or will we see \ntax revolts that will make the Boston Tea Party look like a Beacon Hill \nhigh tea. What does taxation without representation mean if not leaving \nmammoth taxes to generations who cannot vote yet?\n  And what will happen to a republic with national debt growing at the \nrate it is now indefinitely? Ask Argentina, Italy--some point to Weimar \nGermany as a model of the inflation and the economic and political \nchaos that could ensue from our path of profligate spending.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is a choice between doing what we are \ndoing now and changing the way Washington does business. I have heard \nsome on this floor say that this amendment would not pass if we could \nvote in secret. Well, that is precisely the problem, the problem that \nthe voters asked us to fix last November.\n  I have explained repeatedly during this debate why this amendment \nwould not involve the courts in activity infringing on the powers \ngranted to Congress in article I of the Constitution.\n  This balanced budget amendment indeed contains the seeds of \nliberation for the rising generation and generations yet unborn. It \ncontains the seeds of liberation from the shackles of insupportable \nimpossible debt and oppressive taxation--the seeds of liberation from \nan increasingly unresponsive but increasingly intrusive Federal \nGovernment. The balanced budget amendment contains the seeds of \nliberation from a government which consumes tomorrow's wealth to \nsatisfy today's desires.\n  Mr. President, let us adopt the balanced budget amendment to continue \nthe principles of the American Revolution and Constitution, the \nprinciples of freedom--political and economic--for future generations \nof Americans.\n  Does the Senator from Maryland want to speak?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to speak for probably 5 to \n10 minutes. There were some points made earlier in the day I would like \nto respond to.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his courtesies.\n  Mr. President, I want to address the point about the danger that the \nbalanced budget amendment might well do to our economy in time of an \neconomic downturn.\n  I think this point very much needs to be emphasized. In fact, there \nwas an article in the New York Times only a day or two ago that was \nheaded, ``The Pitfalls of a Balanced Budget, Dismantling a Decades-Old \nSystem for Softening Recessions.''\n  In the course of that article it is stated ``If the amendment is \nenacted, the side effect would be huge. A system that has softened \nrecessions since the 1930's would be dismantled.''\n  Now, I want to just point to this chart and then I want to quote a \ncouple of highly respected economic thinkers in our country. What this \nchart shows is the change in real GDP beginning back in the late 1800's \nand coming forward until today.\n  What this chart shows is there were tremendous fluctuations in the \neconomy until the post-World War II period. The economy would, in the \nlate 1800's and the first half of this century, go, as one can easily \nsee, up and down like a roller coaster, often going very deeply into a \nnegative growth situation.\n  These are the boom and bust cycles that those who have read American \nhistory are familiar with. These were the panics. What happened is, \nafter the Great Depression, as a consequence of the Great Depression, \nwe began to change our thinking and to develop what are called \nautomatic stabilizers. I will elaborate on that in a moment as to what \nthat means. But the consequence of doing that was to markedly change \nthe depth of the business cycle. As we can see, since World War II, \nalthough we continue to have fluctuations in the economy, we no longer \nhave the very deep plunges into very significant negative growth.\n  Now, Charles Schultze, whom all of us know and who is a highly \nrespected economist, stated a couple of years ago in testifying about \nthe then-balanced budget amendment proposal that was before the \nCongress:\n\n       A Balanced Budget Amendment Would Be Bad Economics. Federal \n     revenues automatically fall and expenditures for unemployment \n     compensation rise when recessions occur. The deficit \n     necessarily rises. This budgetary behavior is a very \n     important economic stabilizer. It helps sustain private \n     incomes during recessions and thus keep sales, employment, \n     and production better maintained than they otherwise would \n     be.\n\n  Now, I just want to comment on this. It is very important to \nunderstand that, as we go into a recession, we automatically start \nrunning a deficit because we lose tax revenues. People have lost their \njobs. They are unemployed. So we have less revenues coming in. And we \nstart making payments out of the Treasury--unemployment benefits, food \nstamps, medical care--and the combination of that means that the \ndeficit grows, but that helps to offset the downward momentum.\n  Now, what we used to do in the old days, we would try to balance the \nbudget in that circumstance when the economy was going soft, we would \ntry to balance the budget and, of course, that would only drive the \neconomy even further down.\n  So, as Mr. Schultze stated and I just repeat it:\n\n       Federal revenues automatically fall and expenditures for \n     unemployment compensation rise when recessions occur.\n       The deficit necessarily rises. This budgetary behavior is a \nvery important economic stabilizer. It helps sustain private incomes \nduring recessions and, thus, keep sales, employment and production \nbetter maintained than they otherwise would be.\n\n  And he goes on to say:\n\n       The American economy in the postwar years has been far more \n     stable than it was between the Civil War and the Second World \n     War, even if we exclude the Great Depression from the \n     comparison.\n\n  Now this is exactly what this chart shows, although it does not go \nback quite as far as the Civil War. But clearly what this chart \ndemonstrates, as Mr. Schultze states, is that the American economy in \nthe postwar years has been far more stable than it was between the \nCivil War and the Second World War. You can see the tremendous \nfluctuations we used to have in the economy as compared to what has \noccurred since World War II.\n  Mr. Schultze goes on to say:\n\n       In the period between the Civil War and the First World \n     War, the American economy spent about half the time in \n     expansion and half in contraction. In the period since 1946, \n     the economy spent 80 percent of the time expanding and only \n     20 percent contracting. In the years after the Second World \n     War, fluctuations in the American economy around its long-\n     term growth trend were only half as large as they were in the \n     period 1871 to 1914. Many people who have studied the period \n     credit an important part of the improved economic performance \n     to the automatic stabilizing characteristics of the Federal \n     budget.\n       Under the constitutional amendment proposed in H.J.Res. \n     268--\n\n  Which was the proposal at the time, the counterpart to what is before \nus now--\n\n     this stabilizing force would be seriously threatened. The \n     first year of a recession would turn an initially balanced \n     budget into \n     [[Page S3128]]  deficit. But under the proposed \n     constitutional amendment, Congress would be required to bring \n     a budget for the next year back into balance by large tax \n     increases or spending imposed as the recession was still \n     underway.\n\n  Of course, imposing those tax increases or spending cuts, in order to \neliminate the deficit which the onset of the recession had brought \nabout would, of course, only make the recession worse. They would drive \nthe economy even further down, as these tremendous negative growth \nperiods which occurred in the first part of this century clearly \nindicate.\n  This is not a desirable economic performance, and the automatic \nstabilizers, which we have run in the postwar period, have enabled us \nto avoid that. While we have had ups and downs in the economy, they \noccur almost entirely in the positive growth area. We do not have the \ndeep plunges into negative growth which marked economic performance in \nthe first part of this century and, indeed, ever since the economy \nbecame, as it were, a complicated, complex modern economy. So if we had \ngone back to the Civil War, we would have had these movements up and \ndown as well.\n  Laura Tyson, in an article in the Washington Post--and I ask \nunanimous consent that that article be printed in the Record at the end \nof my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is entitled ``It's a Recipe for Economic Chaos.''\n\n       Continued progress on reducing the deficit is sound \n     economic policy, but a constitutional amendment requiring \n     annual balance of the Federal budget is not.\n\n  Let me repeat that because I agree very strongly with it.\n\n       Continued progress on reducing the deficit is sound \n     economic policy, but a constitutional amendment requiring \n     annual balance of the Federal budget is not. An economic \n     slowdown automatically depresses tax revenues and increases \n     Government spending on such programs as unemployment \n     compensation, food stamps, and welfare. Such temporary \n     increases in the deficit act as automatic stabilizers \n     offsetting some of the reduction in the purchasing power of \n     the private sector and cushioning the economy's slide.\n       Moreover, they do so quickly and automatically without the \n     need for lengthy debates about the state of the economy and \n     the appropriate policy response.\n       By the same token, when the economy strengthens again, the \n     automatic stabilizers work in the opposite direction. Tax \n     revenues rise, spending for unemployment benefits and other \n     social safety net programs falls, and the deficit narrows.\n\n  Now, the marked diminution of the fluctuations in the economy shown \non this chart in the post-World War II period reflects the automatic \nworkings of these stabilizers through the business cycle. It \ndemonstrates the benefit we have derived from the application of these \nautomatic stabilizers in the post-World War II period. This is a \ndramatic illustration of the advantages of having broken out of the \nthinking that said we had to balance the budget every year and, \ntherefore, led to efforts to balance it at a time of economic downturn \nwhich only intensifies the problem.\n  Ms. Tyson goes on to say:\n\n       A balanced budget amendment would throw the automatic \n     stabilizers into reverse. Congress would be required to raise \n     tax rates or cut spending programs in the face of a recession \n     to counteract temporary increases in the deficit. Rather than \n     moderating the normal ups and downs of the business cycle, \n     fiscal policy would be required to aggravate them.\n\n  Which is exactly what had been happening in the past, and we now have \nmanaged to avoid.\n  Mr. BYRD. So will not then the chart show for the next several years, \nafter the point where we now are, the same chart would show these lines \nthat are zigzagging and fluctuating above the horizontal line, it \nwould, in effect, show them down here.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right. You go into a downturn, and instead of \nhaving these automatic stabilizers to counteract that, the roller \ncoaster would start down and you would simply be intensifying it.\n  People have to understand, what these downward lines mean, this \nnegative growth means millions of people unemployed. This means small \nbusinesses going into bankruptcy. What these lines mean, in every \ninstance in which these occurred, if you went back and looked at what \nwas happening in the economy, there was massive economic dislocation: \nPeople losing their jobs, businesses going into bankruptcy, farms being \nforeclosed. We have not experienced that in recent times and, as a \nconsequence, people begin to take it for granted.\n  But it is not inevitable.\n  It must be understood, one of the reasons it has not happened is \nbecause we have had a counteracting policy to prevent these deep \ndeclines from taking place.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. BYRD. So the effect then, if I understand what the Senator is \nsaying, I think he is making a vital point here, which would be that we \nwould return to a situation as the chart indicates for the earlier \nyears, going back more than 50 years.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia is \ncorrect. We would be back into these up and down cycles. As Charles \nSchultze said in his quote, which I think is very important:\n\n       In the period between the Civil War and the First World \n     War, the American economy spent about half the time in \n     expansion and half in contraction. In the period since 1946, \n     the economy spent 80 percent of the time expanding and only \n     20 percent contracting.\n\n  When it did contract, it avoided going into these very deep plunges \nwhich used to occur. We used to call those ``panics,'' ``busts.'' The \neconomy was devastated. You would have the panic of 1893 or the panic \nof 1922, and so forth. And we have avoided that in the post-World War \nII period. We have had some ups and downs; we have what we call \nrecessions. We have not had a depression. We have managed to avoid \nthat.\n  Let me just read what Alice Rivlin had to say today. She is a very \nthoughtful woman, and those who know her realize that she is what is \ncalled a ``deficit hawk.'' She has been anxious to get the deficit \ndown, has worked hard to get the deficit down. Today at a news \nconference she made the following statement:\n\n       This discussion is not about whether the budget should be \n     balanced, on the average. It is about whether we should write \n     into the Constitution that the budget should be balanced \n     every year. No one can fault the Clinton administration for \n     not being serious about deficit reduction; we believe the \n     deficit is too high, that it must come down. We have brought \n     it down a lot; we want to bring it down more.\n       But we do not believe that we should write a requirement \n     for balance every year into the Constitution. The real \n     problem with doing that is that it would make swings in the \n     economy bigger.\n       The Federal deficit has acted as a cushion that dampen \n     recessions, make them less wide, less bad for people.\n       When the economy slows down, two things happen. One is, \n     there are more people who are eligible for unemployment \n     insurance and food stamps and the kinds of things that help \n     people when they are in trouble. So expenditures for those \n     things go up. More importantly, when people earn less and \n     they lose their jobs, they don't pay as much income tax, so \n     the Federal revenues go down.\n       With spending going up and revenues going down a lot in the \n     beginning of a recession, what you find is a deficit \n     widening--automatically; it just happens. And automatically, \n     it offsets the horrendous effects of that recession.\n       Now, what would happen if you had to counteract that \n     effect? The Constitution would say, unless you had a \n     supermajority to override it, that you would have to do one \n     of two things. You would have to cut spending to correct that \n     deficit, and people would have less income, . . . or you \n     would have to raise taxes, which would mean people would have \n     less income. So the recession gets worse. We would have \n     bigger swings in the economy, a deeper recession.\n       Now, that's not just a theory, you can really see it. You \n     can see it in what has happened to recessions over the last \n     couple of decades.\n       If you look back in our history, the economy went up and \n     down by huge swings. In the period, especially the period \n     since World War II when these automatic stabilizers have been \n     in effect . . . we've still had recessions, but we have had \n     much smaller ones than we otherwise would have had.\n       If we pass a balanced budget amendment to the \n     Constitution--\n\n  And I say to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia this is \nexactly to his point.\n\n       If we pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, \n     we are saying we want to go back to those days when the \n     economy had huge swings, and many more people were out of \n     work in a recession than are out of work in modern \n     recessions.\n\n  [[Page S3129]] Now, Mr. President, this issue is not being given a \nlot of attention in this debate. It is very clear that by having these \nautomatic stabilizers in the budget, we have been able to avoid very \ndire economic times.\n  This amendment would preclude the automatic response which now takes \nplace and which begins to happen before people even begin to recognize \nthat the economy may be in trouble. As soon as the economy starts \nexperiencing some trouble, this cushioning effect automatically starts \nhappening.\n  It is asserted by proponents of the amendment that sixty votes to \nwaive its provisions would be obtained. 60 votes. Maybe, maybe not. I \ndaresay, in any event, you will not come anywhere close to getting them \nuntil it is manifest that the economy is in difficulty, namely until we \nhave moved down the downward curve a considerable part of the way. And \nat that time, of course, you are really playing catch up. You are \ntrying to pull back this downward momentum instead of having offset it \nright in the beginning.\n  Now, I want to underscore these deep downward lines, on this chart. \nYou say, well, this is negative growth, this is GDP taking a nosedive. \nPeople say, ``Well, what does all that mean?''\n  What it means in real human terms, what these deep plunges in growth \nto negative levels of 5, 10 percent, in the Great Depression even 15 \npercent, literally means is millions unemployed; it means small \nbusiness bankruptcies the likes of which we have not seen in roughly \nthe last 60 years; it means farm foreclosures.\n  Now, these are real life problems, and we run an incredible risk with \nthe proposal that is before us of going back to that kind of business \ncycle. As the New York Times article said:\n\n       If the amendment is enacted, the side effect would be huge: \n     a system that has softened recessions since the 1930's would \n     be dismantled.\n       The problem is that the balanced budget amendment is a \n     heavy-handed solution and risky. The biggest risk is to the \n     Nation's automatic stabilizers which have made recessions \n     less severe than they were in the century before World War \n     II. The stabilizers, an outgrowth of Keynesian economics, \n     work this way: When the economy weakens, outlays \n     automatically rise for unemployment pay, food stamps, \n     welfare, and Medicaid. Simultaneously, as incomes fall, so do \n     corporate and individual income tax payments. Both elements \n     make more money available for spending, thus helping to pull \n     the economy out of its slump. Under the balanced budget \n     amendment, Congress and the administration would be required \n     to get the budget quickly back into balance through spending \n     cuts, higher tax rates, or a combination of the two, perhaps \n     even in the midst of a recession.\n      The Government would become almost inevitably a destabilizer \n     of the economy, rather than a stabilizer.\n\n  Now, in economic terms that is the real concern. I have spoken \nearlier about the fact that this amendment does not distinguish between \na capital budget and an operating budget, and the serious implications \nof that in economic terms and with respect to investing in our future.\n  But what I just wanted to come to the floor and address this evening \nat the close of the day--since some question was raised earlier about \nwhether policy had worked to counteract the economic cycle--was this \nvery graphic description, and these comments which I have quoted by \nsome very able people.\n  I think this observation of Charles Schultze, I just want to quote it \nagain:\n\n       The American economy in the postwar years has been far more \n     stable than it was between the Civil War and the Second World \n     War, even if we exclude the Great Depression from the \n     comparison. In the period between the Civil War and the First \n     World War, the American economy spent about half the time in \n     expansion and half in contraction. In the period since 1946 \n     the economy spent 80 percent of the time expanding and only \n     20 percent contracting. Many people have studied the period \n     and credit an important part of the improved economic \n     performance to the automatic stabilizing characteristics of \n     the Federal budget.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not want to go back to the kinds of fluctuations \nin the economy we experienced in the pre-World War II period, and that \nis one of the reasons that I oppose the balanced budget amendment and \nvery much hope it will be defeated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Washington Post, February 7, 1995\n\n                    It's a Recipe for Economic Chaos\n\n                       (By Laura D'Andrea Tyson)\n\n       Continued progress on reducing the deficit is sound \n     economic policy, but a constitutional amendment requiring \n     annual balance of the federal budget is not. The fallacy in \n     the logic behind the balanced budget amendment begins with \n     the premise that the size of the federal deficit is the \n     result of conscious policy decisions. This is only partly the \n     case. The pace of economic activity also plays an important \n     role in determining the deficit. An economic slow-down \n     automatically depresses tax revenues and increases government \n     spending on such programs as unemployment compensation, food \n     stamps and welfare.\n       Such temporary increases in the deficit act as ``automatic \n     stabilizers,'' offsetting some of the reduction in the \n     purchasing power of the private sector and cushioning the \n     economy's slide.\n       Moreover they do so quickly and automatically, without the \n     need for lengthy debates about the state of the economy and \n     the appropriate policy response.\n       By the same token, when the economy strengthens again, the \n     automatic stabilizers work in the other direction: tax \n     revenues rise, spending for unemployment benefits and other \n     social safety net programs fall, and the deficit narrows.\n       A balanced budget amendment would throw the automatic \n     stabilizers into reverse. Congress would be required to raise \n     tax rates or cut spending programs in the face of a recession \n     to counteract temporary increases in the deficit. Rather than \n     moderating the normal ups and downs of the business cycle, \n     fiscal policy would be required to aggravate them.\n       A simple example from recent economic history should serve \n     as a cautionary tale. In fiscal year 1991, the economy's \n     unanticipated slowdown caused actual government spending for \n     unemployment insurance and related items to exceed the \n     budgeted amount by $6 billion, and actual revenues to fall \n     short of the budgeted amount by some $67 billion. In a \n     balanced-budget world, Congress would have been required to \n     offset the resulting shift of more than $70 billion in the \n     deficit by a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts that \n     by themselves would have sharply worsened the economic down-\n     turn--resulting in an additional loss of 1\\1/4\\ percent of \n     GDP and 750,000 jobs.\n       The version of the amendment passed by the House has no \n     special ``escape clause'' for recessions--only the general \n     provision that the budget could be in deficit if three-fifths \n     of both the House and Senate agree. This is a far cry from an \n     automatic stabilizer. It is easy to imagine a well-organized \n     minority in either House of Congress holding this provision \n     hostage to its particular political agenda.\n       In a balanced-budget world--with fiscal policy enjoined to \n     destabilize rather than stabilize the economy--all \n     responsibility for counteracting the economic effects of the \n     business cycle would be placed at the doorstep of the Federal \n     Reserve. The Fed could attempt to meet this increased \n     responsibility by pushing interest rates down more \n     aggressively when the economy softens and raising them more \n     vigorously when it strengthens. But there are several reasons \n     why the Fed would not be able to moderate the ups and downs \n     of the business cycle on its own as well as it can with the \n     help of the automatic fiscal stabilizers.\n       First, monetary policy affects the economy indirectly and \n     with notoriously long lags, making it difficult to time the \n     desired effects with precision. By contrast, the automatic \n     stabilizers of fiscal policy swing into action as soon as the \n     economy begins to slow, often well before the Federal Reserve \n     even recognizes the need for compensating action.\n       Second, the Fed could become handcuffed in the event of a \n     major recession--its scope for action limited by the fact \n     that it can push short-term interest rates no lower than \n     zero, and probably not even that low. By historical \n     standards, the spread between today's short rates of 6 \n     percent and zero leaves uncomfortably little room for \n     maneuver. Between the middle of 1990 and the end of 1992, the \n     Fed reduced the short-term interest rate it controls by a \n     cumulative total of 5\\1/4\\ percentage points. Even so, the \n     economy sank into a recession from which it has only recently \n     fully recovered--a recession whose severity was moderated by \n     the very automatic stabilizers of fiscal policy the balanced \n     budget amendment would destroy.\n       Third, the more aggressive actions required of the Fed to \n     limit the increase in the variability of output and \n     employment could actually increase the volatility of \n     financial markets--an ironic possibility, given that many of \n     the amendment's proponents may well believe they are \n     promoting financial stability.\n       Finally, a balanced budget amendment would create an \n     automatic and undesirable link between interest rates and \n     fiscal policy. An unanticipated increase in interest rates \n     would boost federal interest expense and thus the deficit. \n     The balanced budget amendments under consideration would \n     require that such an unanticipated increase in the deficit be \n     offset within the fiscal year!\n       In other words, independent monetary policy decisions by \n     the Federal Reserve would require immediate and painful \n     budgetary adjustments. Where would they come from? Not from \n     interest payments and not, with such short notice, from \n     entitlement programs. Rather they would have to come from \n     either a tax increase or from cuts or possible shutdowns in \n     discretionary programs whose \n     [[Page S3130]]  funds had not yet been obligated. This is not \n     a sensible way to establish budgetary priorities or maintain \n     the healthy interaction and independence of monetary and \n     fiscal policy.\n       One of the great discoveries of modern economics is the \n     role that fiscal policy can play in moderating the business \n     cycle. Few if any members of the Senate about to vote on a \n     balanced budget amendment experienced the tragic human costs \n     of the Great Depression, costs made more severe by President \n     Herbert Hoover's well-intentioned but misguided efforts to \n     balance the budget. Unfortunately, the huge deficits \n     inherited from the last decade of fiscal profligacy have \n     rendered discretionary changes in fiscal policy in response \n     to the business cycle all but impossible. Now many of those \n     responsible for the massive run-up in debt during the 1980s \n     are leading the charge to eliminate the automatic stabilizer \n     as well by voting for a balanced budget amendment.\n       Instead of undermining the government's ability to moderate \n     the economy's cyclical fluctuations by passing such an \n     amendment, why not simply make the hard choices and cast the \n     courageous votes required to reduce the deficit--the kind of \n     hard choices and courageous votes delivered by members of the \n     103d Congress when they passed the administration's $505 \n     billion deficit reduction package?\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the arguments of the Senator from Maryland \nare not arguments against balancing the budget, but to have a rainy day \nfund available built from surpluses made in the good years to soften \nthe business cycle.\n  The real economic harm to Americans are the stagnant wages, high \ninterest rates, and high taxes all piled on the backs of working \nAmericans as a consequence of yearly current consumption unrelated to \nthe swings to the business cycle.\n  There is some irony in the Senator's reference to an article by \nPresident Clinton's Economic Adviser Laura Tyson saying that tax \nincreases and speeding cuts world deepen a recession when has boss, \nPresident Clinton, said tax increases and spending cuts would lead to a \nrecovery when he fought for his tax bill in 1993.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Maryland has made again the objection \nto the balanced budget amendment that the business cycle and the \nautomatic stabilizers suggest that we should run deficits in bad years \nto dampen the effect of recessions or depressions. His argument seems \nto suggest that cyclical deficits are normal and good. The problem is \nthat our deficits have become large, structural, and permanent.\n  Our deficits do not follow the business cycle in either size or \nfrequency. They continue to go up, year after year. Surely we have had \nmove than one business cycle since 1969, yet we have not balanced the \nbudget in that time.\n                           amendment no. 267\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to express my support of the \namendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] last \nnight which would specifically provide that the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution does not provide the President of the \nUnited States with unilateral power to impound funds or raise taxes. \nThis amendment will be voted on next Tuesday and I hope it will be \nadopted.\n  Mr. President, this amendment raises interesting questions because \nthe opponents have repeatedly said that they do not believe that the \nbalanced budget amendment, as drafted, should be interpreted to give \nthe President the power to impound funds or raise taxes.\n  Many have stated they would oppose giving that kind of power to the \nexecutive branch, even through the implementing legislation.\n  The Judiciary Committee's majority report states, unequivocally, ``it \nis not the intent of the committee to grant the President any \nimpoundment authority'' under the proposed balanced budget amendment.\n  Yet, these same Members have strenuously opposed an amendment which \nwould clarify this issue once and for all, by making it clear that \nneither the balanced budget amendment, nor any implementing legislation \nenacted pursuant to its authority can give the executive branch the \nunilateral authority to bring the budget into balance by raising taxes \nor impounding funds.\n  It seems to me you can't have it both ways: you can not argue you \ndon't support giving the President these sweeping powers and at the \nsame time fight against an amendment which would make it clear that the \nbalanced budget amendment does not provide such authority to the \nexecutive branch.\n  Mr. President, it is particularly important that this issue be \nsettled now, clearly and in a forthright manner, because it raises very \nserious and profound questions about how this country will be governed \nif this constitutional amendment is adopted.\n  The question of Executive power under this amendment, like the \nquestion of the role of the courts, is one that ought to be answered \nnow, before the amendment is added to our Constitution, not sometime \nlater, in the distant future.\n  The people of this country have the right to know in advance whether \nthis amendment will allow a fundamental restructuring of the balance of \npower and responsibilities between the three branches of Government.\n  The State legislators, who have an important responsibility when they \nvote whether or not to ratify this proposed amendment, ought to have \nthis question resolved before they cast their votes.\n  If this amendment can be construed to give the President the right \nto, for example, withhold Social Security checks, or salaries of \nmilitary and civilian employees of the Federal Government, or grants to \nState and local governments in order to meet the constitutional mandate \nfor a balanced budget, then we ought to know that in advance.\n  Mr. President, the pending amendment to make it clear that the \nbalanced budget amendment does not grant these sweeping powers to the \nexecutive branch is not about whether you are for or against the \nbalanced budget amendment--it is about whether the proposed \nconstitutional amendment is drafted in a way that can result in a \nfundamental change in the way this country is governed.\n  The balance of powers between the three branches of Government--\nlegislative, executive, and judicial--is a concept which is fundamental \nto our system of Government. It has stood us well for more than 200 \nyears. Our democracy has survived and thrived because the checks and \nbalances contained in our Constitution has prevented any one of these \nbranches from becoming dominant.\n  Without adoption of the pending amendment, that balance could be \nfundamentally altered.\n  Mr. President, let me stress again the issue here is not about \nwhether you support or oppose the balanced budget amendment. It is \nabout whether you believe that the President should have the power to \nimpound funds or raise taxes on the American people at his or her sole \ndiscretion.\n  The concentration of this type of power in the hands of the executive \nis not something that I believe the people of this country want to see \nhappen. They want to see their elected officials use some fiscal \ndiscipline and restraint to bring our Federal budget into balance. They \nwant us to stop deficit spending and increasing the national debt--a \ndebt that will be passed on to their children and grandchildren.\n  I do not believe that these concerns about fiscal responsibility \nmeans that the American people want to see the emergence of an imperial \nPresidency.\n  I do not believe that they want this President or the next to have \nthe power to unilaterally impound funds or raise taxes.\n  If the proponents of the amendment truly believe that the amendment \ndoes not bestow those powers on the President, then they ought to be \nwilling to accept this amendment.\n  Their resistance gives this Senator a great deal of concern, \nparticularly in light of the strong legal arguments that have been \npresented indicating that the proposed balanced budget amendment could \nwell be construed by the courts and the executive branch to bestow on \nthe President extraordinary powers to impound funds or raise taxes in \nthe event that the constitutionally mandated budget balanced has not \nbeen achieved.\n  Mr. President, this is not a risk that we should expose ourselves to \nwhen a simple solution--adoption of the pending amendment--will resolve \nthe question.\n  A number of legal scholars have concluded that without such an \namendment to the balanced budget amendment, the President would have \nsuch \n[[Page S3131]]  powers to enforce the constitutional mandate of a \nbalanced budget. Their arguments, which I will summarize briefly, make \na good deal of sense and we ought to heed their warnings.\n  These scholars note that the balanced budget amendment which the \nSenate is now considering is silent on the issue of how it will be \nenforced.\n  The amendment itself provides simply that total outlays cannot exceed \ntotal receipts in a fiscal year, unless each House of Congress approves \na specific deficit by a three-fifths vote. The amendment, however, does \nnot specify what action can be taken if an unconstitutional deficit \narises, either because of the inaction of the legislative and executive \nbranches, or because of unforeseen changes in economic factors.\n  At the same time, proponents argue that the balanced budget amendment \nis self-enforcing. The Judiciary Committee report states, ``both the \nPresident and Members of Congress swear an oath to uphold the \nConstitution, including any amendments thereto.''\n  As to how the President is expected to carry out that responsibility, \nparticularly in the case of a recalcitrant Congress, the committee \nreport simply states that it is not their intent to grant the President \nany impoundment authority, and that, in any event, Congress has the \npower under section 6 of the amendment to pass legislation that \nspecifically denies impoundment powers to the President.\n  The implication of these passages in the committee report is clearly \nthat the proponents of the amendment recognize the very real risk that \nthe proposed amendment opens the door to a President acting to impound \nfunds or raise taxes to meet the constitutional mandate of a balanced \nbudget and that they hope that Congress will proscribe that authority \nin implementing legislation.\n  That is a thin argument upon which to rest such a profound issue as \nmaintaining the constitutional balance of powers.\n  If Congress failed to pass legislation to preclude a President from \ntaking unilateral action to bring a budget into balance by either \nimpounding funds or raising taxes or Congress passed such legislation, \nbut a President vetoed it and his or her veto was not overridden, there \nis every reason to believe that such authority would be there for a \nstrong executive to take under the guise of carrying out his or her \nconstitutional obligations.\n  Indeed, a President might well feel compelled to veto such \nlegislation for the very reason that it would tie his or her hands in \nseeking to comply with the constitutional mandate to prevent outlays \nfrom exceeding revenues in any given fiscal year.\n  The Constitution, article II, section 3, obligates the President of \nthe United States to ``take care that the Laws be faithfully \nexecuted.'' A commonsense reading of the proposed balanced budget \namendment and the obligation of the President to faithfully execute the \nlaw means that the President must act to either impounds funds or raise \ntaxes if the total outlays of the Federal Government exceed the total \nrevenues in any fiscal year.\n  A broad range of respected legal scholars have reached that \nconclusion.\n  Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger testified before the \nJudiciary Committee that the proposed constitutional amendment would \nauthorize the President to impound funds to insure that the outlays did \nnot exceed revenues.\n  Harvard University law professor Charles Fried, who served as \nSolicitor General during the Reagan administration, testified that \nsection 1 of the proposed amendment ``would offer a President ample \nwarrant to impound appropriated funds'' in a year when actual revenues \nfell below projects and a bigger than authorized deficit occurred.\n  Other legal scholars who have reached similar conclusions include \nformer Attorney General Nicholas de B. Katzenbach, Stanford University \nLaw School Professor Kathleen Sullivan, Yale University Law School \nProfessor Burke Marshall, and Harvard University Law School Professor \nLaurence Tribe.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to stress that we are not \ntalking here about the President exercising something along the lines \nof a line-item veto. Legislation which would give the President line-\nitem veto authority to remove spending items from appropriation bills \nand provide Congress the opportunity to override those vetoes has \npassed the other body and will soon be debated in the Senate. The \nJudiciary Committee has also already held hearings last month on \nproposed constitutional amendments to provide the President with line-\nitem veto authority.\n  What we are talking about here, however, is not a line-item veto, but \nthe power of the President to take whatever steps he or she deems \nnecessary, including impounding funds and raising taxes without any \nreview by Congress in order to meet the constitutional mandate of a \nbalanced budget. That is a very different process from a line-item veto \nauthority and one which would vest the executive branch with \nunprecedented fiscal powers.\n  Mr. President, although much of the discussion regarding the \nPresidential powers to faithfully execute the requirements of a \nbalanced budget amendment have focused upon the issue of impoundment \nauthority, there is no reason to conclude that a President would not \nhave equal powers to achieve a balanced budget by unilaterally raising \ntaxes, duties or fees in order to generate the revenues needed to avoid \nan unconstitutional deficit. That is certainly not a result most \nproponents of the balanced budget amendment would like to see happen. \nThe only sure way to prevent it is to adopt the pending amendment which \nwould foreclose that option.\n  Mr. President, the best way to ensure that the balanced budget \namendment is not interpreted to give Presidents the power to \nunilaterally impound social security checks or raise taxes on middle \nclass workers is simple--put it in writing.\n  Adoption of this amendment will make it clear that the balanced \nbudget amendment does not, in fact, authorize the President to exercise \nthis kind of unprecedented power. Those who oppose this amendment have \ngiven no good reason why they are not willing to accept this amendment.\n  They ask that the American people accept, on good faith, that they \n``do not intend'' to give the President these powers.

A bill to establish as the nuclear energy policy of the \nUnited States that no new civilian nuclear power reactors shall be \nbuilt until adequate waste emplacement capacity is available, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 the nuclear energy policy act of 1995\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I address a subject that \nhas received too little attention here. I'm talking about nuclear \nwaste. Since the Senate's last major action on this issue, 8 years have \npassed, extremely little progress has been made, and more questions \nhave been raised than resolved. I propose an approach designed to keep \nus from ending up embroiled in another nuclear waste crisis, and to \nthat end today I introduce the Nuclear Energy Policy Act of 1995.\n  The nuclear waste issue is coming to a boil throughout our country. \nWe all know that--and hear every day about--the Department of Energy's \ndifficulties in figuring out what to do with our high-level nuclear \nwastes.\n  My own State of Minnesota has been at the forefront of this complex \nissue. The legislature last year decided to allow some dry-cask storage \nof high-level nuclear waste on the site of the Prairie Island nuclear \nplant. During the debate, people were confused by the advertisements \nand varying claims the different sides made about the permanency and \nsafety of such a waste dump, and about alternatives to nuclear power \nelectricity generation. And the Federal Government did not help \nMinnesotans make that decision. In fact, while the battle was raging in \nMinnesota, the Director of DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste \nManagement was telling the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee that if Minnesota was to allow dry-casks at Prairie Island, \nhe could not guarantee that the waste would ever leave. And Minnesotans \nwere then and still are all too aware that if Yucca Mountain fails to \nqualify as a permanent repository, there is no Federal policy for what \nto do with the waste then.\n  And we also have no policy concerning future nuclear power plants. We \nhave no policy protecting us from a second nuclear waste crisis.\n  Today I introduce a bill that provides that policy. It should have \nbeen the first law Congress passed upon entering the Atomic Age. It is \nnothing short of common sense.\n  The bill I introduce today simply requires that we build no more \nnuclear power plants until we have some place to permanently store the \nwaste they will generate. That's all there is to it.\n  There is nothing radical about this idea. It is not a partisan idea--\njust look at the list of original cosponsors: two Democrats and two \nRepublicans. All this bill does is put the nuclear cart back behind the \nhorse, where it belongs.\n  It is true that no utility has yet stepped forward to site a new \nnuclear power plant, and that is exactly why now is the time to pass \nthis law. Once utilities make a huge investment in siting, licensing, \nand building new plants, the pressure upon Congress to provide a waste-\ndisposal option for them becomes immense. Unfortunately, if Congress \nacts under such pressure, it might not come up with the best \nresolution. Let's ensure that for future plants, we deal with the waste \nissue in a deliberate way, free from pressure applied by utilities with \nvested interests.\n  I want to make this point crystal clear: this bill would not impact \nany existing plants. It would apply only to plants that would be \nconstructed after the date of enactment. It would, therefore, not apply \nto renewal of existing licenses.\n  Here is the current commercial high-level nuclear waste situation in \na nutshell: we have DOE, by Congressional mandate, putting all of its \neggs in the Yucca Mountain basket. Even when Yucca Mountain is on-\nline--if ever--it will be able to hold only the waste that has been and \nwill be generated by our current generation of reactors.\n  Where will the waste from a new generation of reactors be disposed \nof? This bill requires that we answer this question before that second \ngeneration is born.\n  This bill does not judge the deep geologic repository approach that \nthe DOE is currently pursuing. Nor does it make any mention of a \nmonitored retrievable storage facility. It only says that we ought to \nalways have enough permanent storage capacity to take care of the waste \nthat will be generated by a new nuclear power plant.\n  It is not enough to have a plan for adequate storage. It is also not \nenough to have begun construction on a storage facility. It is not even \nenough to have finished building but not yet licensed a storage \nfacility. The permanent storage facility must be sited, built, and \nlicensed for operation before construction may begin on a new plant \nunder this bill.\n  The bill is written that way because of the huge difference between \nthe \n[[Page S3133]]  planning and building of a waste facility on the one \nhand, and its actually accepting waste on the other. With politically \ncharged issues like nuclear waste, it is wise to make absolutely \ncertain that there is water in the pool before jumping in, rather than \njust turning on the spigot, taking a deep breath, and diving.\n  I urge Senators to support this important legislation. It is time to \nuse a little common sense.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 473\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nuclear Energy Policy Act of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) a national energy policy that allows the construction \n     and operation of new civilian nuclear power reactors may \n     serve to aggravate the problem of management of high-level \n     nuclear waste including spent nuclear fuel from the reactors;\n       (2) the creation of the nuclear waste has a direct effect \n     on the amount of nuclear waste transported in interstate \n     commerce; and\n       (3) it is not in the public interest, and it should not be \n     the policy of the United States, to allow the construction or \n     operation in the United States of any additional civilian \n     nuclear power reactor unless a facility for the permanent \n     emplacement of the waste exists with enough capacity for the \n     waste that the reactor is reasonably expected to generate in \n     its lifetime.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to ensure that the United States \n     does not aggravate the nuclear waste problem by permitting \n     the creation of a new generation of civilian nuclear power \n     reactors without adequate capacity in a permanent waste \n     emplacement facility by establishing as the nuclear energy \n     policy of the United States that no new civilian nuclear \n     power reactor shall be built until adequate waste emplacement \n     capacity is available.\n\n     SEC. 4. NUCLEAR ENERGY POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) Adequate Emplacement Facility.--No civilian nuclear \n     power reactor shall be built after the date of enactment of \n     this Act until--\n       (1) there is a facility licensed by the United States for \n     the permanent emplacement of high-level radioactive waste \n     (including spent nuclear fuel) from the reactor; and\n       (2) there is an adequate volume of capacity within the \n     emplacement facility to accept all of the high-level \n     radioactive waste (including spent nuclear fuel) that will be \n     generated by the reactor during the reasonably foreseeable \n     operational lifetime of the reactor.\n       (b) Generation of Spent Fuel.--At no time shall the \n     aggregate volume of high-level radioactive waste (including \n     spent nuclear fuel) that is generated, or reasonably expected \n     to be generated, by all civilian power reactors on which \n     federally authorized construction was begun after the date of \n     enactment of this Act exceed the total volume of capacity \n     available in facilities licensed by the United States for the \n     permanent emplacement of the high-level radioactive waste \n     (including spent nuclear fuel).\n\n     SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       Any affected citizen may enforce this Act by bringing a \n     civil action in the United States district court for the \n     district in which the person resides or in the United States \n     District Court for the District of Columbia.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MACK (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 474. A bill to provide a veterans bill of rights; to the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                the veterans bill of rights act of 1995\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today my colleague from Florida, \nSenator Bob Graham, and I are introducing legislation to ensure that \nall veterans have access to the same care and benefits provided by the \nU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs regardless of race, ethnicity, sex, \nreligion, age, or geographic location.\n  Under the Veterans Bill of Rights Act, veterans in all States will \nhave equal access to such services as VA medical facilities, treatment, \nand personnel; VA home loan guaranty assistance, job training \nassistance, the administrative claims process, and equal treatment in \nthe handling of claims for benefits.\n  While equal access to these essential veterans benefits and services \nis implied, in reality, it is not always the case. My home State of \nFlorida, for example, has the most 100 percent service-connected \ndisabled veterans in the United States. It is also home to the second \nlargest overall veterans population. Consequently, the demand for \nservices from the Department of Veterans Affairs is far greater than \nother States. Florida's veterans population, however, has far less \naccess to medical care and other benefits than nearly every other \nState. In fact, veterans in Florida are forced to wait months for \nappointments at VA medical centers and outpatient clinics while \nveterans in other States have no waiting lines. That's wrong, and it \nmust be changed.\n  Our Government made a contract with the men and women who bravely \nserved our country in times of need. The contract guaranteed that the \nFederal Government would provide for them in return for their service. \nMany who honored this contract were injured or disabled. The Federal \nGovernment must live up to its' end of the contract by providing \nequitable treatment regardless of where the veteran lives.\n  Veterans in many States, like those who reside and vacation in \nFlorida, do not receive their fair share of benefits. The Veterans Bill \nof Rights corrects this inequity, and I strongly urge my colleagues to \ncosponsor this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 474\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Bill of Rights \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ADMINISTRATION OF RIGHTS AND BENEFITS.\n\n       The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall take any action \n     necessary to ensure that any rights and benefits provided \n     under title 38, United States Code, to veterans who qualify \n     for the rights and benefits--\n       (1) are made available to the veterans in any one State or \n     geographic location to the same extent as the rights and \n     benefits are made available to the veterans in any other \n     State or geographic location; and\n       (2) are not denied to any veteran on the basis of race, \n     ethnicity, sex, religion, age, or geographic location.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITION.\n\n       For purposes of this Act, the term ``State'' has the same \n     meaning given such term in section 101(20) of title 38, \n     United States Code.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/24/senate-section/article/S3132-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3133-S3134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 s. 197\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bumpers, the name of the Senator from Arkansas \n[Mr. Pryor] was added as a cosponsor of S. 197, a bill to establish the \nCarl Garner Federal Lands Cleanup Day, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 s. 216\n\n  At the request of Mr. Inouye, the name of the Senator from Texas \n[Mrs. Hutchison] was added as a cosponsor of S. 216, a bill to repeal \nthe reduction in the deductible portion of expenses for business meals \nand entertainment.\n\n\n                                 s. 240\n\n  At the request of Mr. Domenici, the name of the Senator from Indiana \n[Mr. Lugar] was added as a cosponsor of S. 240, a bill to amend the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 to establish a filing deadline and to \nprovide certain safeguards to ensure that the interests of investors \nare well protected under the implied private action provisions of the \nAct.\n\n\n                                 s. 256\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the name of the Senator from Idaho [Mr. \nCraig] was added as a cosponsor of S. 256, a bill to amend title 10, \nUnited States Code, to establish procedures for determining the status \nof certain missing members of the Armed Forces and certain civilians, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 s. 269\n\n  At the request of Mr. Simpson, the names of the Senator from Kansas \n[Mrs. Kassebaum] and the Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 269, a bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality \nAct to increase control over immigration to the United States by \nincreasing border patrol and investigator personnel;

Res. 79\n\n       Whereas, the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \n     democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was invested \n     in the people;\n       Whereas, the Founding Fathers of the United States of \n     America drew heavily upon the political experience and \n     philosophy of ancient Greece in forming our representative \n     democracy;\n       Whereas, these and other ideals have forged a close bond \n     between our two nations and their peoples;\n       Whereas, March 25, 1995 marks the 174th anniversary of the \n     beginning of the revolution which freed the Greek people from \n     the Ottoman Empire; and\n       Whereas, it is proper and desirable to celebrate with the \n     Greek people, and to reaffirm the democratic principles from \n     which our two great nations were born: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the United States of America \n     assembled, that March 25, 1995 is designated as ``Greek \n     Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and \n     American Democracy.'' The President is requested to issue a \n     proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to \n     observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I am submitting along with \nSenators Lautenberg, D'Amato, and Simon a resolution to designate March \n25, 1995, as ``Greek Independence Day: A Celebration of Greek and \nAmerican Democracy.''\n  One hundred and seventy-four years ago, the Greeks began the \nrevolution that would free them from the Ottoman Empire and return \nGreece to is democratic heritage. It was, of course, the ancient Greeks \nwho developed the concept of democracy in which the supreme power to \ngovern was vested in the people. Our Founding Fathers drew heavily upon \nthe political and philosophical experience of ancient Greece in forming \nour representative democracy. Thomas Jefferson proclaimed that, ``to \nthe ancient Greeks * * * we are all indebted for the light which led \nourselves out of Gothic darkness.'' It is fitting, then, that we should \nrecognize the anniversary of the beginning of their efforts to return \nto that democratic tradition.\n  The democratic form of government is only one of the most obvious of \nthe many benefits we have gained from the Greek people. The ancient \nGreeks contributed a great deal to the modern world, particularly to \nthe United States of America, in the areas of art, philosophy, science, \nand law. Today, Greek-Americans continue to enrich our culture and make \nvaluable contributions to American society, business, and government.\n  It is my hope that strong support for this resolution in the Senate \nwill serve as a clear goodwill gesture to the people of Greece with \nwhom we have enjoyed such a close bond throughout history. Similar \nresolutions have been signed into law each of the past several years, \nwith overwhelming support in both the House of Representatives and the \nSenate. Accordingly, I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this important resolution.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/24/senate-section/article/S3134-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3134-S3135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 80--RELATIVE TO THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Reid) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs:\n\n                               S. Res. 80\n\n       Whereas the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal \n     Reserve System has increased interest rates 7 times during \n     the 12 months preceding the date of adoption of this \n     resolution, despite the absence of any serious threat of \n     inflation;\n       Whereas the inflation rate declined to very modest levels \n     during the 4 years preceding the date of adoption of this \n     resolution;\n       Whereas the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System maintains that the Consumer Price Index overstates the \n     true rate of inflation by as much as 50 percent;\n       Whereas increases in short-term interest rates have been \n     accompanied by increases in long-term interest rates, \n     reversing the downward trend that helped strengthen the \n     national economy;\n       Whereas such higher interest rates will have a devastating \n     impact on the economy, including home builders, homebuyers, \n     and homeowners;\n       Whereas higher interest rates will increase the Federal \n     deficit by adding $171,000,000,000, over 5 years, to pay the \n     interest on the national debt;\n       Whereas the housing industry is one of the most interest \n     rate sensitive sectors of the economy;\n       Whereas some home mortgage payments have increased by \n     hundreds of dollars per month because of the increase in \n     interest rates by the Federal Open Market Committee;\n       Whereas the interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage \n     increased from approximately 7 percent since February 4, \n     1994, to the level of 9 percent 12 months later, increasing \n     the monthly payment on a $100,000 home mortgage loan by more \n     than $140 per month;\n       Whereas homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages will \n     spend an estimated aggregate increase of $12,000,000,000 to \n     $15,000,000,000, in monthly payments during 1995;\n       Whereas the National Association of Home Builders estimates \n     that a 1 percentage point increase in mortgage interest rates \n     means that approximately 4,000,000 households could not \n     qualify to purchase a median-priced home: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) additional interest rate increase at this time could \n     risk throwing the economy into a recession;\n       (2) the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \n     should act with caution so as not to risk another recession; \n     and\n       (3) the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \n     should carefully weigh the effects of interest rate increases \n     on homeowners, homebuyers, home builders, and American \n     taxpayers when evaluating interest rate policy.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday Federal Reserve Board Chairman \nAlan Greenspan testified before Congress that the Fed's recent actions \nto increase interest rates were achieving their intended goal: to put \nthe brakes on economic growth in this country. He also left room for \nthe Fed to raise interest rates even further to deal with inflationary \npressures. Well, I say enough is enough. No more interest rate hikes.\n  The Fed says it has raised short-term interest rates by a full three \npercentage points this past year to combat inflation. But what \ninflation? Like Don Quixote on a mission to root out an imaginary \nenemy, the Fed has made inflation the invisible foe it seeks to defeat. \nIn fact, the evidence shows that inflation has actually been falling \nfor the past four years.\n  [[Page S3135]] What the Fed has actually accomplished with higher \ninterest rates is to put at risk those most vulnerable to interest rate \nchange including homeowners, homebuyers, and home builders.\n  Just look at what's happening to middle-income Americans in \ncommunities all across this country as a result of the Fed's actions.\n  The interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage has jumped from 7 \npercent to 9 percent in less than a year.\n  A homeowner carrying a $100,000 fixed mortgage is paying almost $150 \nmore a month now for that loan than just a year ago.\n  Homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages will spend an estimated $12 \nto $15 billion more in total monthly payments this year.\n  The National Association of Home Builders estimates that a one \npercentage point increase in mortgage rates will prevent four million \nfamilies from realizing their dream of owning their own home. That is 4 \nmillion broken dreams.\n  Higher interest rates will increase the Federal deficit by adding \n$171 billion, over 5 years, to pay the interest we must pay on the \nnational debt.\n  That's why I am submitting today a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, \nwhich puts the Fed on notice. Stop the interest rate increase. Do not \nrisk another recession. Consider the interests of the homeowners, \nhomebuyers, home builders, taxpayers, and others who wind up bearing \nthe burden of these actions.\n  If you're as exasperated as I am with the Federal Reserve Board \nactions that put a hammer lock on middle-income families and the \nbusinesses that serve them, I hope that you will join me in \ncosponsoring this resolution. The threat is not inflation, which has \ndecreased four years in a row. The threat we face is that of throwing \nour economy into another recession.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/24/senate-section/article/S3134-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I recently learned that the New \nHampshire State Senate and House of Representatives adopted a joint \nresolution in support of keeping the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in New \nHampshire open at its full operating capacity. As we approach the \nrelease date of the Department of Defense's base closure list for the \n1995 round, I would like to take this time to associate myself with the \nstrong support expressed in the resolution passed by my State's \nlegislature and signed by Gov. Stephen Merrill. Furthermore, I ask that \nthe full text of that resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The State resolution follows:\n           Senate Joint Resolution 1--State of New Hampshire\n\n       Whereas, the Department of the Navy has maintained the \n     Portsmouth Naval Shipyard since June 12, 1800; and\n       Whereas, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard has performed in an \n     exemplary manner throughout its almost 2 centuries of \n     history; and\n       Whereas, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is one of the most \n     modern facilities available in the United States for the \n     repair, overhauling, and refueling of naval vessels; and\n       Whereas, the communities located near the Portsmouth Naval \n     Shipyard, in Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts offer an \n     abundance of highly trained, skilled and experienced workers \n     who have an outstanding work ethic; and\n       Whereas, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is uniquely and \n     strategically located for the continued defense of our \n     country; and\n       Whereas, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is known for its \n     leadership in the environmental field and has worked hard to \n     be a partner with the surrounding communities; and\n       Whereas, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard has an aggressive \n     pollution prevention program which determines how to \n     eliminate pollution at its source by preventing hazardous \n     waste from entering the waste system; and\n       Whereas, the previous closure of Pease Air Force Base has \n     had an extremely negative economic impact on the seacoast \n     region with recovery from that loss taking much longer than \n     anticipated; and\n       Whereas, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard contributes \n     approximately $594,700,000 in personal income and this loss \n     would contribute to the further contraction of the economic \n     base of the region; and\n       Whereas, the closure of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard would \n     have a devastating impact on an area much larger than the \n     seacoast with that impact being much greater than that caused \n     by the closure of Pease Air Force Base; and\n       Whereas, the state of New Hampshire is firmly committed to \n     actively supporting the continuation of the United States \n     Naval Shipyard at Portsmouth; now, therefore, be it Resolved \n     by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court \n     convened;\n       That the general court of New Hampshire respectfully \n     recommends and urges the Congress of the United States to \n     continue to operate, develop, diversify, and make fullest use \n     of the United States Naval Shipyard at Portsmouth, New \n     Hampshire;\n       That the general court further urges the Congress of the \n     United States to take all necessary action to ensure that the \n     Portsmouth Naval Shipyard remains an integral component in a \n     post-cold war defense strategy; and\n       That copies of this resolution signed by the governor, the \n     president of the Senate and the Speaker of the House be \n     forwarded by the Senate clerk to the President of the United \n     States, Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, President of the United States Senate, the \n     Secretary of Defense, and to each member of the New Hampshire \n     and Maine Congressional delegations.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/24/senate-section/article/S3135-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3135-S3136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO FRANCIS MARION ``FRANK'' HENDLEY II\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nlate Francis Marion ``Frank'' Hendley II, on the occasion of his 78th \nbirthday on February 24, 1995.\n  [[Page S3136]] Frank was born on February 24, 1917, in Birmingham, \nAL. After distinguished service with the Coast Guard in the South \nPacific during World War II, Frank moved to Indiana, where he lived \nfrom 1946 to 1952. As regional manager for Gordon Foods Co., he ws \ninstrumental in changing the Gordon Foods Co. slogan from ``Trucks \nServing the South'' to ``Trucks Serving the Best.''\n  Frank was elected the first national president of the Hendley Family \nAssociation, Inc., on November 22, 1975. He led the association with \ndistinction during his tenure as president from 1976 through 1977. \nSubsequent to his passing on November 15, 1986, he has been honored by \nthe legislatures of the seven States in which he resided, including \nKentucky, California, Georgia, Tennessee, and Florida, as well as the \ncities of Indianapolis and Beech Grove.\n  It is with pleasure that I offer this tribute to a loyal and true \npatriot who served his family and his country with great \ndistinction.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/24/senate-section/article/S3135-4", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               RETIREMENT OF MAJ. GEN. DARRELL V MANNING\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, on February 25, 1995, Maj. Gen. \nDarrell V Manning will retire as the adjutant general of Idaho and the \ncommanding general of the Idaho National Guard. The State of Idaho and \nthe Nation will lose the service of a true patriot when General Manning \nretires.\n  A native of Idaho, General Manning has an accomplished record of \nservice to Idaho and the Nation. He has served in the active duty Air \nForce, the Idaho Air National Guard, the Idaho House of \nRepresentatives, the Idaho State Senate, and the Idaho Transportation \nDepartment as director. As a member of the Idaho Legislature, General \nManning was a noted master of parliamentary procedures.\n  As commanding general of the Idaho National Guard, General Manning \nhas overseen the transformation that has resulted in the Idaho National \nGuard being recognized as a world-class organization for the training \nand preparation of soldiers and airmen. Under General Manning's \ncommand, the Idaho Air National Guard has flown two unprecedented 6-\nmonth tours of duty to Saudi Arabia to enforce the no-fly-zone over \nsouthern Iraq. In addition, on December 1, 1994, the Idaho National \nGuard flew to Turkey for a 4-month deployment to enforce the no-fly-\nzone over northern Iraq. As a result of the first of these three \ndeployments, Dr. Sheila Widnall, the Secretary of the Air Force, \ntraveled to Gowen Field 1 year ago to present the Idaho Air National \nGuard with the Air Force's Outstanding Unit Award.\n  And, too, under General Manning the Army National Guard has proven \nits readiness and competence in annual training exercises time and time \nagain. For example, the Idaho National Guard's Apache Battalion was \nstood up and certified combat ready in record time under General \nManning's watch. In addition, the 116th Armor Brigade was selected as \none of Army's 15 enhanced combat brigades. The Idaho Army National \nGuard also completed the development of one of the Nation's most \ntechnologically advanced armor ranges in an environmentally sensitive \nand balanced way.\n  While General Manning has shown himself to be an exceptional military \nleader, he has also demonstrated a strength of character and discipline \nI have come to know and respect. Let me give you one example. Every \nyear, the Adjutant Generals Association of the United States [AGAUS] \nmeets to discuss issues confronting the National Guard. At these annual \nmeetings, a number of adjutant generals deliver lectures on special \ntopics. At the 1993 meeting, General Manning delivered a lecture on \nethics and morality. In my mind, the Adjutant Generals Association \ncould not have found a better speaker.\n  Since that meeting of the AGAUS, I have met with a number of National \nGuard leaders, including the current director of the National Guard \nBureau, and each of these officers has praised the content and \nrelevancy of General Manning's lecture.\n  In my view, the Nation will not only say goodbye to an outstanding \ncommanding officer when General Manning retires, but we will also be \nsaying our farewells to a man of principle, character, and integrity. \nFor these reasons, I want to pay a special tribute to Maj. Gen. Darrell \nV Manning.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/24/senate-section/article/S3136-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH.
