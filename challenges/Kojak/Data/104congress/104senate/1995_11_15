Mr. President, I am here today to question this \nadministration and the scaring of our veterans in this country. I was \nin Amarillo, TX, last Saturday and I was talking to a disabled veteran \nwho depends very much on his veterans pension for himself and his \nfamily. He said, ``Are we going to be paid?'' because the news media \nwere saying no.\n  I said, ``Of course you will be paid.'' There is no way that a \nveteran's pension is any different from a welfare recipient's stipend \nor a Medicare part B payment. There is no difference whatsoever. Yet, \namazingly to me, the Veterans' Administration is telling people who \ncall that, in fact, veterans benefits will not be paid.\n  Mr. President, I question a President who says if, in fact, this \nstalemate continues, which, of course, we hope it will not, but if it \ndoes, that he will prioritize the payment of welfare recipients over \nthe payment of our veterans who have served our country. It is \nunthinkable.\n\n  However, just to make sure that this does not happen, I talked to \nSenator Alan Simpson this morning, who is the chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee. He is going to cosponsor with me--it will be the \nSimpson-Hutchison bill--a bill that will, in fact, direct this \nadministration to pay veterans benefits. We are going to direct this \nadministration to put veterans in the same category as welfare \nrecipients, Social Security recipients, hospitalization under Medicare \nrecipients, and Medicare part B doctors payments as well. It should not \neven be a question.\n  Nevertheless, in order to make sure that this administration cannot \nplay games with the veterans of this country, Senator Simpson and I are \ngoing to introduce a bill as soon as we can get it written, this \nafternoon, that will make sure that the veterans of this country will \nnot have to worry if, in fact, this stalemate continues.\n  I wish the President of the United States would immediately say it is \nnot necessary to pass this kind of law. I hope the President will be \nable to put out a little release this afternoon that says the veterans \ndo not have to worry. The incoming cashflow is there and the President \nknows it. The head of the Veterans' Administration knows it. There is \nno reason to have these scare tactics used on the veterans of our \ncountry who have served our country and who deserve to be put in the \nhighest of all categories. And, yet, this President is doing that. I \ncall on him to say our bill, which is being readied right now, is not \nnecessary and the veterans do not have to worry. He can do it with the \nstroke of a pen or a mere press release.\n  The priority is set. There is no question. I have consulted every \ncongressional expert, every resource, every historical circumstance \nthat I can find. Veterans have never been threatened. There is no \nreason for them to be threatened now.\n  Mr. President, Senator Simpson and I are going to introduce this \nlegislation \n\n[[Page S17046]]\nthis afternoon. I hope it is not necessary, but we are going to make \nsure that games will not be played with the veterans of this country. I \nthank the Senator from North Carolina for yielding me this time for \nthis very important subject.\n  I just want to say to the veterans of America, we will take care of \nyou. We will make sure that our commitment to you is kept. It is the \nhighest priority that I have.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, first I ask the distinguished Senator from \nTexas if she and Senator Simpson would add my name as a cosponsor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Certainly.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, will the Senator from North Carolina \nyield for a moment so I can propound a unanimous consent?\n  Mr. HELMS. I am sorry, I did not hear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is asking if you \nwill yield for a moment so he can offer a unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. HELMS. Just so the time is not charged to me.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be recognized \nto speak after the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. KYL. Reserving the right to object, the Senator from Wisconsin \nwas here before I was, but I would like to add to that request that I \nbe recognized following the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to add to that request that I be allowed to \nfollow the Senator from Arizona and after that the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am going to have to object. Senator \nFaircloth is the cosponsor of the bill that I am about to introduce. I \nthink he is entitled to be heard, too.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection to the request.\n  The Senator from North Carolina is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  MR. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Helms and Mr. Faircloth pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1413 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to be \nallowed to speak for up to 5 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/15/senate-section/article/S17045-6", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17046-S17047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EXECUTIONS IN NIGERIA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last Friday nine leaders of the Movement \nfor the Survival of the Ogoni People [MOSOP], including renowned \nplaywright Ken Saro-Wiwa, were executed by the brutal Nigerian military \nregime. The human rights leaders and environmental activists were \nhanged after a blatantly unfair trial, and in the face of numerous \ninternational appeals to General Abacha to commute the death sentences. \nThat Nigeria carried out these executions during the meeting of the \nCommonwealth countries in New Zealand, which they attended, is \nparticularly chilling. What a failure of international policy toward \nNigeria.\n  This latest gross human rights violation is convincing evidence that \nGeneral Abacha, the military leader who seized control of Nigeria in \n1993, has no interest in overseeing a 3-year transition to genuine \ndemocratic rule as he announced in his notorious October 1 \nproclamation. Instead, it appears he is seeking to obliterate--by \nkilling--any opposition that could possibly challenge his authority.\n  The political situation in Nigeria is undoubtedly fragile and \ndifficult. Since its independence from Britain in 1960, Nigeria has \nbeen held together by the military, and in fact it has enjoyed civilian \nrule for only short, punctuated periods in its entire history. Then, as \nthe rest of Africa was sweeping toward democracy, Nigeria too held \nPresidential elections in 1993. They produced a major sea change in \nNigerian politics when a Southern Yoruba, Moshood Abiola, was elected \nPresident, after years of domination of the political structure by \nnorthern Hausa/Fawlani. It was this shake-up that ultimately \nprecipitated Abacha's takeover of the government in 1994.\n  Since then, he has ruled the Government with a corrupt hand. While \nmuch of Africa is producing good news, Abacha's Nigeria stands in stark \ncontrast. Nigeria's 110 million people live under a totalitarian \nregime. National and State elected officials have been removed from \noffice, political parties dissolved, newspapers shut down, labor unions \ndisbanded, and thousands detained for their political opinions. This \nsummer he commuted the death sentences of General Obasanjo and others, \nbut his mercy extended only to life imprisonment.\n  Now Abacha has killed Ken Saro-Wiwa and some of the most well-known \nhuman rights and environmental activists, after a flagrantly unfair \ntrial, and despite international pleas to retry the defendants. Some \nobservers have said the executions last week were a function of a \ndomestic military crisis where Abacha had to look strong, lest he face \nrevolt from his own troops. While I could be sympathetic to Abacha's \nchallenge of keeping his country together, this cannot justify nine \nexecutions: indeed, such abuse can only lead to further instability in \nNigeria.\n  The environmental and human rights movement for which Ken Saro Wiwa \nlost his life goes back to 1990, when the first seeds of anger against \nforeign oil companies began surfacing in Ogoniland. The 6 million \nOgonis living among the rich swamps, fertile farmland, and gorgeous \nrainforests of the Niger River delta has been poor forever. But as oil \ncompanies plundered their land, seeking resources, polluting their \nwater, uprooting the soil--leaving the Ogonis with nothing but \nthousands of ugly oilwells and deteriorated pipelines--the indigenous \npopulation began protesting. At first, they were peaceful \ndemonstrations, but then Shell Oil called out the notoriously brutal \npolice force to massacre 80 people and destroy 495 homes. The \ncommunities held Shell responsible for choosing to contact the police \nrather than even to begin to negotiate with them.\n  That spawned a strong protest movement, and by 1992, when Shell still \nrefused to engage the Ogonis, the police were once again called out, \nand shot 30 people.\n  This is when Ken Saro-Wiwa founded the Movement for the Survival of \nthe Ogoni People. In its constitution, MOSOP called for compensation \nfor loss of their resources to Shell. MOSOP also called for self-\ndetermination of Ogoniland, the demand that made Saro-Wiwa threatening \nto the government.\n  As the Ogonis were being tortured by arson, beatings, and forced \nresettlement by the Government, Shell Oil removed itself from \nresponsibility and shoved the issue off as a domestic Nigerian problem, \nin which it could not engage.\n  When elections were held in 1993, the Ogonis split their vote: while \nolder more conservative folks favored Abiola, Saro-Wiwa and younger \nactivists supported a boycott of the elections as a farce. With this \ndisplay of defiance, the Nigerian military government essentially moved \ninto occupy Ogoniland. During a public discussion on whether the Ogonis \nwould send representatives to Abacha's constitutional conference, four \nOgoni chiefs were killed.\n  Saro-Wiwa and eight others were charged with the murder of the \nchiefs. Many believe Abacha used the deaths as a pretext to eliminate \nhis most outspoken and effective opposition.\n  A military tribunal was established especially for this trial, a \ntribunal which, according to State Department and other observers of \nthis case, was neither impartial nor independent. Further, the \ndefendants were not permitted access to a lawyer of their choice, and \nthere is even evidence that witnesses were paid off to testify against \nSaro-Wiwa. After all this, there was no right of appeal.\n  Predictably, the defendants were found guilty and sentenced to death. \nAfter a flurry of international activity, which included several phone \ncalls and faxes to Nigerian officials from United States Senators, such \nas myself, which were never answered--the Provisional Ruling Council, \nheaded by Abacha, confirmed the sentences. Once again, we called the \nU.N. Ambassador, appealed to our administration, wrote letters to \nNigeria urging Abacha to commute the \n\n[[Page S17047]]\ndeath sentences and re-try the defendants in accordance with \ninternationally recognized human rights standards. To our shock, the \nexecutions were carried out 48 hours later.\n  This kind of behavior, this kind of brutality is unconscionable. It \ncalls out for a tough international response. Later this week, I will \nbe joining a bi-partisan group of Senators in introducing sanctions \nlegislation against Nigeria. While details are still be worked out, the \nbill is intended to ratchet up the pressure against General Abacha. His \nmurderous regime must be stopped and isolated. The continued butchery \nof his country can only destabilize the region, harm international \ninterests in the continent, and force suffering upon the 110 million \npeople of Nigeria.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/15/senate-section/article/S17046-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS MUST WORK TOGETHER\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this morning I was asked by a reporter from a \nradio station why the President and Congress cannot work out this \nbudget impasse, why the Government has to shut down.\n  That is a good question, and it deserves an answer. Of course, the \nanswer is we will work it out, but it is going to take a little time, \nand here is why.\n  Yesterday, my offices received about 600 telephone calls from \nconstituents, and they were running about 10 to 1 in favor of the \nCongress staying the course to achieve a balanced budget in 7 years.\n  The letters and the phone calls, all had a common theme: Do not give \nin. Do this for our grandchildren. We need a balanced budget. We have \nto get the fiscal house in order. Do not cave in to the President.\n  Those were the general sentiments of the people who were calling my \noffice yesterday, and today, just before I came to the floor, I noted \nthe same general theme and the same relationship of numbers in these \ncalls.\n  So many of us, particularly those of us who were elected in the last \nelection and heard the message from the people that they want to stop \nbusiness as usual in Washington, DC, and get the Federal budget \nbalanced, are committed to achieving a balanced budget in 7 years. I do \nnot understand why the President will not concede that point.\n  I think part of the reason why it is taking time is that the \nPresident is looking good in the polls and op-ed pieces, and so on. He \nis finally standing firm for something, and so he is getting a lot of \npress. So there is not a great deal of pressure on the President to \nconcede anything at this point, and that is why we have the impasse. We \nfeel the pressure from our constituents to stay the course and have a \nbalanced budget and, on the other hand, the President is not willing to \nagree to a balanced budget.\n  The first thing the President said when he vetoed the bill which \nwould allow the Government to keep on operating was that he did it \nbecause we had Medicare cuts in the legislation.\n  That is not true. The Medicare legislation which we included with the \nbill to keep the Government running, because we knew the President \nwould veto it if it was part of our reconciliation bill, called the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995, that bill provides for precisely the same \npercentage of premium payment for part B Medicare as you have today and \nyou have had for the last 5 years. The President would like, he says, \nto reduce that to 25 percent of premium instead of 31 percent. But that \nis the difference between the two of us as to the percent. We are not \nincreasing the percent of premium. It is at 31.5 percent today. It will \nbe 31.5 percent under our bill, and so that is not true.\n\n  I submit, by the way, that in the end the President will have to \nagree with us that it is fair to ask the seniors who are paying \nvoluntarily for part B Medicare benefits to pay 31 percent of it after \nour children and our grandchildren are paying the other 68 or 69 \npercent. I submit that it is an unfair burden to ask them to pay any \nmore of the part B Medicare.\n  So the bottom line here is the balanced budget. The President has \nsaid he agrees with the balanced budget, but he just does not agree \nwith the numbers we would use to calculate it. And yet the numbers are \nprecisely the numbers he asked us to use in his State of the Union \nspeech, the Congressional Budget Office numbers. He said those were \nmore accurate.\n  We said, OK, we will use them. Now that we have used them, he said, \nno, he wants to use a different set of numbers. And some people have \nsaid it is the rosy scenario numbers which would enable us to get a \nbalanced budget without making some of the tough decisions which we \nhave tried to make.\n  Let me conclude by noting why it is so important for us to have a \nbalanced budget. If we can achieve this balanced budget by the year \n2002, we will have reduced interest rates by about 2 percent in this \ncountry, and that means that a family of four with a $75,000 home \nmortgage, for example, a $15,000 car loan, an $11,000 student loan, \ncould save about $2,000 a year in interest costs. My grandson Jonathan \nwas just born this year, and he immediately took a burden of $187,000 \njust to pay the interest on the national debt during his lifetime. That \nis unfair.\n  What this debate is all about is stopping the spending in Washington, \nDC, that creates this kind of liability for our children and \ngrandchildren. It is time to stop handing the blank credit card to the \nbig spenders in this city.\n  And so what this impasse between the President and the Congress is \nall about is getting to a balanced budget in the year 2002, reducing \ninterest rates so that our citizens can enjoy the savings that are \nachieved as a result and stopping this additional spending which \nrequires our children and grandchildren to continue to pay for our \ndebts.\n\n  Mr. President, I find it ironic that at the very time we are trying \nto get to this balanced budget in the year 2002, the President is \ntalking about committing an additional $2 billion to the quagmire in \nBosnia without congressional authorization of any kind in direct \nviolation of the principle that the Congress and the President should \nboth consult before we commit United States troops to this kind of an \noperation.\n  And so I find it ironic that that is the action the President is \ntaking at the same time that he shut the Government down by vetoing the \nlegislation and refusing to agree with us to balance the budget in 7 \nyears.\n  It is time to get serious about balancing the Federal budget.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/15/senate-section/article/S17047-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17047-S17048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BUDGET PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President I have great respect for my friend from \nArizona. It is interesting, and this is a good example of the \ndifferences in the way we approach things. He is talking about \nspending, and he is absolutely right. We need to cut spending. \nEverybody agrees with that. There is no disagreement about goals. We \nought to have a balanced budget. Nobody disagrees with that. I happen \nto think we ought to spend money in education and other investments. \nThe Senator from Arizona and I have had a debate on this floor about \nstar wars. He thinks we ought to build star wars. We will have that \ndebate again later, I guess, but everybody seems to have their own set \nof priorities. It is interesting to me; this whole disagreement is \nbeing recast as a question of whether some want to balance the budget. \nThat is not the question. Everybody wants to balance the budget. The \nquestion is what plan to do you use to get there.\n  I say this to my colleagues, that the journey we are on at the \nmoment, that is, the journey that leads to the shutdown of the Federal \nGovernment, is not a spur-of-the-moment trip.\n  It has been planned for and packed. Back in April, April 3, Speaker \nGingrich vowed to ``create a titanic legislative standoff with [the \nPresident] by adding vetoed bills to must-pass legislation increasing \nthe national debt ceiling.''\n  September: ``I don't care what the price is,'' Speaker Gingrich says. \n``I don't care if we have no executive offices and no bonds for 30 \ndays--not this time,'' he says. Speaker Gingrich has said he would \nforce the Government to miss interest and principal payments for the \nfirst time ever to force Democrat Clinton's administration to agree to \nhis 7-year deficit reduction. \n\n[[Page S17048]]\n\n  The point is, this is not an accident; this is a destination that has \nbeen long planned. There are some around here who now gloat about it, \nthat they have caused a shutdown. They may well cause a debt default. \nIt is my judgment there is no good reason for anybody to gloat. There \nis no credit in this set of circumstances. We need to solve these \nproblems together.\n  I want to tell you what the problem is in the differences in \npriorities. The 7-year plan--and I have no problem with 7 years--the 7-\nyear plan to balance the budget is a plan that is fundamentally unfair. \nLet me describe it this way: You take the poorest 20 percent of the \npeople and you say to them, ``We are going to burden you with 80 \npercent of all the spending cuts.'' To the poorest 20 percent of the \nAmerican people, we are going to say, ``We are going to burden you with \n80 percent of the spending cuts.''\n  Then you turn to the wealthiest 20 percent of the American people and \nsay, ``Guess what, get ready to smile. We are going to give you 80 \npercent of the tax cuts.'' The poorest 20 percent is burdened with most \nof the spending cuts, and the top 20 percent is rewarded with tax cuts.\n  Now, I do not know what school you attend to take a course in \nfairness that comes out that way, but it is a school that ought not be \naccredited. That is what this debate is about.\n  The other side says, ``Well, we're for the middle class.'' I did not \nknow what they meant until I saw one of our colleagues on the House \nside, a Congressman from Pennsylvania, and he said his salary of \n$133,000, plus a $50,000 pension that he also gets, ``doesn't make me \nrich.'' He said, ``That doesn't make me middle class. In my opinion, \nI'm lower middle class.''\n  This Republican Congressman said, ``When I see someone who is making \nfrom $300,000 to $750,000 a year, now, that's middle class.'' I guess \nnow I understand what they mean when they say they are here to help the \nmiddle class--somebody making $600,000, $700,000 a year. Well, you \nknow, there are a lot of folks that are not middle class making \n$600,000 or $700,000 a year in this country.\n\n  Ronald Reagan, when he proposed a budget plan, he said, ``We're going \nto have a safety net for the most vulnerable Americans, and there will \nbe seven things in the safety net. We're not going to cut them--Head \nStart, Medicare, Social Security, veterans, SSI, school lunches and \nsummer jobs for youth.''\n  Guess what? Six of these are under the budget knife. Six of what \nRonald Reagan said was in the safety net over a dozen years ago are now \nunder the budget knife of this crowd.\n  No, this is not about whether there should be a balanced budget. Of \ncourse there should. It is about the priorities. It is about describing \n$600,000-a-year people as middle income and saying, ``By the way, we're \nhelping the middle-income folks.'' What about the people that work all \nday, every day, for 8, 10 hours, work hard, come home, take care of \ntheir family, making $20,000, $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 a year, and \nthen discover that much of what they rely on is gone, going to make it \nharder for them to send their kids to college, going to kick some of \ntheir kids off the Head Start Program--55,000 of those kids. Every one \nhas a name. They are told, no Head Start Program; 600,000 summer youth \ndo not get a job because we cannot afford it. But we are off building \nstar wars and B-2 bombers.\n  No, these priorities are wrong. We ought to balance this budget and \nwe ought to do it soon, but we ought to get the priorities squared \naway. Let us not talk about middle-income families as $600,000 a year \nand give them a big, fat tax break and say, ``By the way, we're here to \nhelp the middle-income folks.''\n  What a bunch of nonsense. There is no school in America that teaches \nus this is the definition of ``middle income.''\n  There is nothing wrong with someone making $600,000. God bless them. \nI wish everybody could do that. But there is something wrong to tell \nvulnerable people, kids, families who are struggling, that we cannot \nafford you, but we can build B-2 bombers and star wars because that is \nwhere our priorities are. Those are bad priorities, and we ought to \nchange.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I want to certainly applaud the Senator \nfrom North Dakota for his words because they are right on target. This \nis day two of a partial shutdown of the Government of the United States \nof America. And, yes, we know it is not impacting too many Americans \nyet, but it is hurting some veterans, Social Security recipients, those \nwho use our national parks, museums, and monuments, those who need to \ntravel and need to get their passports for business who have already \npaid for their airline tickets and cannot get their passports.\n  There are environmental laws that are on the books that are not being \nenforced because they are not deemed ``essential emergencies.'' That is \ndangerous. And I might say, there are hundreds of thousands of American \nworkers staying home who chose to work for the Federal Government \nbecause they believe that is a proud place to work, and they do not \nknow if they will get their pay. I think they are asking a very \nlegitimate question, and that is: What about the pay of Members of \nCongress? What about that?\n  Well, unless the House acts as the Senate did and passes the no-\nbudget, no-pay bill that I authored with Congressman Dick Durbin, \nMembers of Congress will get their pay--oh, yes, do not worry--while \nthey send to the President debt extensions and continuing resolutions \nloaded down with political blackmail. They are getting their pay. They \nare getting their pay.\n  Newt Gingrich said in April, we are going to ``create a titanic \nlegislative standoff with President Clinton by adding vetoed bills to \nmust-pass legislation increasing the national debt ceiling.'' And that \nis what he has done. But he has protected his own flock of supporters \nover there. And I hope people are ringing his phone off the hook, \ntelling him to pass the no budget, no pay. It was supported here by \nSenator Dole and Senator Daschle, and it passed here twice. Today, the \nHouse has a chance to join us because it is in the DC appropriations \nbill. It is in the conference, and it turns out that Senator Jeffords \nand Senator Kohl are going to push it. Congressman Durbin is on that \nconference. All the Members of Congress have to do is vote to send the \nPresident a short-term continuing appropriations bill clean, not loaded \ndown with the budget fights because those budget fights are coming.\n  Why have we not had them yet? Because this Republican Congress has \nnot done its work. They have not finished the appropriations bills. \nThey have not finished the reconciliation bill. When they do, it will \nbe vetoed by this President because of its cruel cuts in Medicare, its \ncruel cuts in Medicare, its repeal of national standards for nursing \nhomes, its deep cuts in environmental protection, its deep cuts in \neducation.\n  This President and the Democrats in this body want to have a balanced \nbudget, but we want to do it the right way, not the wrong way. We are \nnot going to steal from Medicare and Medicaid and education and give a \ntax cut to those earning millions of dollars a year.\n  Under their plan, if you earn $350,000 a year you are going to get \nback $5,500 a year. Oh, but Members of Congress are getting paid while \nthis standoff happens, while a million workers are wondering if they \ncan pay their rent. And I can tell you, if not this, what is our job? \nIf not to come together and keep the Government running, what is our \njob? This is not a ball game.\n  This is the greatest Nation in the world. When I was a stockbroker, I \nwatched the financial markets, and they shivered when the President got \nsick or there was any threat of instability.\n  I am going to show you a quote. The Washington Post wrote on November \n15: ``Newt's Nightmare for America. Budget gridlock could send stock \nprices down as much as 20 percent and lead to higher interest rates and \na weaker dollar.'' \n\n[[Page S17049]]\n\n  Is this why we should be getting paid? We should not be getting paid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FORD. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. What is the timeframe \nnow?

Mr. President, to the ancient Greek philosophers, the \nEarth was the centerpoint of the entire universe. We were fixed in one \nposition, while the Sun, Moon and planets revolved around us.\n  It was, at the very least, an egotistical assumption.\n  But it held, for about a thousand years, in fact, until Copernicus \ncame along in the 16th century with a radical idea of his own. This \nPolish monk who moonlighted as an astronomer decided that the Greeks \nhad it completely backward--that the Sun, in fact, was the central \nheavenly object and that the Earth, Moon, and their planetary cousins \norbited around it.\n  Even though he was dismissed as a heretic at the time, his \nrevolutionary notion eventually changed the course of science forever.\n  Well, about 350 years have gone by and today, once again, some long-\nheld beliefs about what actually revolves around what are being \nchallenged. And this time, we are talking about the Federal Government.\n  Over the course of this century, the Federal Government has gradually \ndeveloped the attitude that it rests at the center of the Nation's \npolitical power.\n  The people exist to service it.\n  The States exist to service it.\n  After 40 years of especially excessive growth, everything today seems \nto revolve around the Federal Government, and the Government has spent \nbillions of dollars, building up trillions of dollars of debt, trying \nto justify its existence and all the money we have continually poured \ninto it.\n  That is in spite of the Constitution, and the very protections built \ninto it by the Founding Fathers to keep a bloated, arrogant, intrusive \nFederal Government from taking hold.\n  In 1995, this Congress has the revolutionary idea that things worked \nbetter back in the old days, that the Federal Government should revolve \naround the people and the States, not the other way around.\n  Our commitment to making that fundamental change is the driving force \nbehind our plan to balance the budget by the year 2002. Unfortunately, \ntrying to convince President Clinton that a balanced budget is worth \nfighting for is what this temporary Government shutdown is all about.\n  To Congress, a balanced budget within 7 years is nonnegotiable, as it \nshould be. To President Clinton, it is a political poker chip. He \npromised during his 1992 campaign that he would eliminate the deficit \nin 5 years.\n  Since taking office, he has proposed goals ranging from 10 years down \nto 7, but in the two budget plans he has actually submitted to \nCongress, the budget never even comes close to balance.\n  And yet he strode into a news conference yesterday to announce that: \n``I proposed to Congress a balanced budget, but Congress refused to \naccept it.''\n  He used the phrase ``balance the budget'' 16 times in his brief \nstatement, then walked away without facing the tough questions that \nwould have followed, or should have followed, if the press would want \nto make the President accountable for his statements.\n  What he neglected to mention is that his so-called balanced budgets \nwere so ridiculously out of balance that they did not get a single \nvote--Republican or Democrat--when they were brought before this \nChamber.\n  Mr. President, I have received more than 500 telephone calls from my \nMinnesota constituents over the last 3 days, and the overwhelming \nmajority of them--seven to one--agree with Congress. ``Stick by your \nguns and balance the budget,'' they are saying.\n  Mark and Sally Crowell of Burnsville, MN felt so strongly about it \nthat they sent me this fax yesterday--something they said they did on \nbehalf of their four children. The fax says:\n\n       If President Clinton doesn't want to balance the budget and \n     wants to shut down the government, we guess we are going to \n     have to put up with it for a while.\n       They--the Democrats--have had 40 years to get it right and \n     have shown that they have no intention of balancing the \n     budget. Balance it for our children!\n\n  Nobody wants a prolonged Government shutdown. Federal workers deserve \nbetter than that. The Americans who rely on Government services deserve \nbetter than that. Most of all, the taxpayers deserve better than that.\n  But until we can get past all the campaign rhetoric, threats, and \nflat-out lies we are hearing from the White House--and until we get a \ncommitment that we will have a balanced budget within 7 years--I am \nafraid we are not left with much of a choice.\n  Mr. President, we have debunked a lot of the world's great myths over \nthe last 350 years:\n  We now know that the Earth revolves around the Sun, just as \nCopernicus suggested.\n  If you sail toward the horizon, you will not fall off the edge of the \nworld.\n  Man can build a flying machine and even take it to the Moon, which, \nby the way, is not made out of green cheese after all.\n  All that is left to prove is that Elvis really is dead and that \nPresident Clinton does support a balanced budget.\n  The first one should be easy, but empty rhetoric aside, it is going \nto take a lot more evidence than we have seen over the past week to \nconvince Congress and the American people that President Clinton is \ntruly serious about wanting a balanced budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/15/senate-section/article/S17049-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17049-S17050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           A BALANCED BUDGET--SOMETHING TO HAND OUR CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, if we are going to be quoting, let us start \noff with the President. Candidate Clinton said he would balance the \nbudget in 5 years. President Clinton says it cannot be done. Yes, he \nwould embrace a 7-year budget agreement. Now that is not any good \nanymore. He said he wanted a 10-year plan--I am not real sure--but all \nwith a caveat of, ``Yes, I would use and want to use CBO figures,'' \nreal assumptions. He said that in his State of the Union Address. Now \nthat is off the table.\n  Basically, what we are saying here is what is on the table: Balance \nthe budget in 7 years using CBO's assumption and real economics. That \nis all we are asking. I do not think that is too much. It is because we \nhave a very deep feeling and support for education. It is because this \nside of the aisle is very supportive of and deeply cares for Medicare \nthat we want to save it. We do not stick our head in the sand. Medicare \nspending will actually go up some 45 percent in the next 7 years, and \nyou say we do not care? Medicaid continues to go up. Welfare continues \nto go up, even with reform.\n  And we care for children and grandchildren. Instead of handing them a \nbill that their country is so far in debt they never will see the \nbottom--we are spending $1 billion a day in interest on the national \ndebt now, and to those who would not support a balanced budget, are you \nsaying that you want your benefits now at the expense of your children \nor your grandchildren? That is the funniest parent I have ever seen, or \ngrandparent.\n  By not taking the meaningful steps to confront the problems we have \nnow \n\n[[Page S17050]]\nis irresponsible and, I think, probably one of the great facades that \nhas been cast on the American people.\n  The message over here has been constant since last year. You can talk \nabout Medicare, welfare, the county fair--I do not care what you want \nto talk about. Basically, we are talking about a balanced budget. We \nare talking about something we can hand our children that they can deal \nwith. It is because people ran for public office and made a promise to \nAmerica that we will balance the budget and now the other side says, \n``We don't want you to keep your promises.''\n  It is very, very simple. There is nothing, there is nothing, there is \njust nothing that is not simple about this whole presentation.\n  So while we are quoting quotes and we see the message, one has been \nconsistent, one has not, because maybe the compass sort of goes awry \nevery now and again. The American people have learned one thing--that \nthey do not want business as usual. In the past couple of months, we \nhave heard a lot about the drastic cuts in Medicare. Well, where did we \ngo to school? In the last 7 years, if we spent $900 billion in Medicare \nand in the next 7 years we will spend $1.6 trillion in Medicare--a 45 \npercent increase--is that a cut? Not where I went to school. A 45 \npercent increase by the year 2002, and we still balance the budget. The \nsame goes for Medicaid.\n  Let us talk about the tax package. Candidate Clinton called for a tax \ncut for the middle class during the campaign of 1992. And then in 1993 \nhe gave this country a tax package that was the largest tax increase in \nthe history of the country. In Houston, he says: Maybe I raised your \ntaxes a little too much, and I sort of cooled this economy a little too \nmuch.\n  Well, in this package, we are trying to help some families. Seventy-\nfive percent or the tax cuts go to families with children. We care \nabout children. There is a $500 per child tax credit. There are IRA \nreforms, and also reforms in estate planning, estate taxes, that keeps \nfarms and ranches and small businesses and families functioning. There \nis an alternative minimum tax reform that creates jobs and does \nsomething about investment, providing an expanding economy.\n  Let us talk a little bit about those death taxes, those estate taxes. \nIt is a form of double taxation. Capital gains is a form of a--let us \ncall it a voluntary tax. Everybody participates in capital gains. If \nyou own anything that appreciates in value, it is capital gains--\nanything, such as your home, or whatever, you participate in capital \ngains. It is a voluntary tax. You do not have to pay it because you do \nnot have to sell. I think that is a lot of difference. When we look at \na farm or ranch and everybody says, ``Do something for the family \nfarm,'' this is what you can do; we can let them hang on to it and let \nthe next generation farm it or ranch it. That is the way it should be.\n  Let us not be led astray and be quoting different quotes because of \nthe message, and do not shoot the messenger. There has been one \nconsistent message: Now is the time to get our fiscal house in order.\n  I come here from county government. We had to balance it there. \nSometimes it would become tough because maybe you did not get \neverything covered, but you found a way to get through it. We even \nlived through an initiative in Montana called I-105. We could not levy \nany more mils because people were tired of their tax bill.\n\n  I will say to those folks who do not want any reforms at all, if you \ndo not think something has to be done over the entitlements, I have a \nlittle fellow out here in Springfield, VA, that takes care of my car. \nIf you say to him, ``I want to raise your taxes,'' and he says, ``OK, \nyou do it,'' then I will probably go along with you. Right now, he has \nall the taxes he can handle, and he is just making $25,000 a year. He \nhas a couple of kids and wants to pay for a home. I think he needs a \npart of the American dream, too.\n  So we do not care? I think we care a lot. We do not care for \nMedicare? I think we care a lot. We care enough to sacrifice so that we \ncan save it, so that it will be there for my children and their \nchildren. That is what this discussion is all about. That is what it is \nall about.\n  Let us talk about the package that has been presented. It is a CR, \ncontinuing resolution, and it says, Mr. President, agree to a 7-year \nbalanced budget and use CBO figures, real assumptions, and use real \neconomics, and we will put everybody back to work. But this is the time \nto balance the budget with the least amount of pain.\n  So it is because we do care that we go through this. Somebody has to \nstep up and take responsibility. Sometimes that gets to be a little \ntough. We hear a lot of rhetoric, a lot of rhetoric that really \ninflames the landscape so that no negotiations can take place at all. I \ndo not propose to do that. What I propose to do is the responsible \nthing. I think this is the responsible thing.\n  I always go back to what my dad said. Fathers teach us a lot of \nthings about discipline, discipline in the family, discipline in your \ncompany, and discipline in your job. I can remember when our first \nchild was born and dad was just a farmer down in Northwest Missouri. I \ndo not see how most kids make it to be good kids anyway because they \nare being raised by amateurs. But I asked dad, ``How tough do you have \nto be on your kids disciplinewise?'' He said, ``It all depends how much \nyou love them.'' I have never forgotten that, and I have never \nforgotten that in Government either. It all depends on how much we love \nthis country, how much we want to put her on solid footing, to be both \nthe political and economic leader in this world, because these young \npeople deserve a future, and they cannot do it if they are borrowed up \nto their eyes.\n  So this is responsible. This is because we love this country very \nmuch. This is the time to do it with the least amount of pain. Let us \njust do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from South Carolina \nis recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nfor 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am reminded that Patrick Henry said, \n```Peace, peace.' Everywhere, men cry `peace.' But there is no peace.'' \nNow the colleagues on the other side of the aisle cry ``balanced \nbudget, balanced budget,'' but there is no balanced budget.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the Record \nan article entitled ``Polls get in the Way of Washington's Work,'' from \nthis morning's Post and Courier.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Post and Courier, Wednesday, Nov. 15, 1995]\n\n               Polls Get in the Way of Washington's Work\n\n                      (By Sen. Ernest F. Hollings)\n\n       The silent scandal that permeates Washington is the \n     pollster charade. As in Newsweek's Conventional Wisdom Watch, \n     today's Washington is based on who's up and who's down in the \n     polls. Everyone--the president, Congress and the media--\n     participates. The result? Nothing gets done and no one really \n     expects anything to get done. Meanwhile, the nation's real \n     needs are ignored. There is no genuine plan to guide us. And \n     plans to put us on a pay-as-you-go basis are simply pollster-\n     driven budget schemes fashioned to get politicians past the \n     next election.\n       John F. Kennedy started it all 35 years ago in West \n     Virginia. Lou Harris' polls identified hot-button issues of \n     concern and Jack Kennedy played them like a Stradivarius. \n     Political polling immediately became the order of the day. \n     Now even the media wittingly are the engines behind the \n     oppressive reliance on polls. No longer do reporters bow to \n     the who, what, where, when, how and why of fact and accuracy. \n     Instead, they kowtow to pollsters to elicit pithy partisan \n     responses that stem from polls.\n       The pollster begins each day with ``divide and conquer.'' \n     Voters immediately are divided into age, sex, race, \n     education, working or retired, married or single, veteran or \n     military, city, suburb or rural. No one is considered an \n     American. They have to be Asian-American, African-American, \n     Irish-American.\n       Division is the pollster mentality, but dissembling is the \n     pollster's art. No pollster has served a day in office. But \n     they'll tell you in a minute that you can't break the Sacred \n     Code of the Pollster. If you want to get--and stay--in \n     office.\n       Never take a firm position. If you do, you'll divide \n     voters.\n     \n[[Page S17051]]\n\n       Favoring a proposition will put you at odds with those who \n     oppose.\n       Opposing will separate you from those who favor.\n       To influence the most voters possible, firmly say that \n     you're ``concerned'' about any issue so you appear \n     understanding and appease both sides.\n       Aha! Now any way you slice it, you've identified with the \n     voter. With this kind of soundbite mentality permeating the \n     airwaves, it's easy to understands why there is no leadership \n     in Washington.\n       Lee Atwater taught that negative politics is the positive \n     path to political victory. As a result, one of the first \n     ``musts'' for a candidate today is to order negative research \n     on opponents--and himself. Why? To have a prepared answer for \n     any past mistakes or inconsistencies and to be able to unload \n     on an opponent at the end of the campaign when voters finally \n     are interested and there's no time to respond.\n       Pollsters also teach both incumbents and challengers to \n     preach change. That's why all candidates sound the same. \n     Republicans and Democrats are all for cutting spending and \n     against taxes; for prisons and against crime; for jobs and \n     against welfare; for education and the environment. And, of \n     course, everyone is for the family. With this emphasis on \n     change and negative politics, the logic of the pollster \n     paradigm is that government is the enemy and problem, not the \n     solution. As such, everyone serving in government must be \n     ousted. Thus, there's the cry for term limits.\n       The media's job is to expose this nonsense. But instead of \n     living up to this responsibility, the media have joined the \n     scam. They feast on polls and partisanship. Rather than \n     reporting the news of the day, they make the news with \n     their own polls. Questions by reporters don't delve into \n     an issue but focus on the poll or partisan aspects of the \n     issue. What they want is conflict.\n       These days, the pollster charade in the media continues \n     with the ludicrous notion that spending cuts alone can \n     eliminate the deficit. Or worse--that cutting taxes can \n     eliminate the deficit. Nothing could be further from the \n     truth. Since Ronald Reagan's ``voodoo'' that tax cuts could \n     bring in more revenue and eliminate the deficit, the national \n     debt quintupled from less that $1 trillion to almost $5 \n     trillion. And instead of eliminating waste in government, we \n     created the biggest waste of all--$348 billion a year in \n     interest costs. Since we can't avoid paying interest costs, \n     we borrow a billion dollars daily, which automatically \n     increases spending a billion, increases the debt a billion \n     and increases interest costs. Every day the cycle starts \n     again.\n       Both President Clinton's and Speaker Gingrich's budget \n     plans to get rid of this waste are mere ruses to get past \n     next year's election. But Washington politicians figure--who \n     cares? Who will be around seven years from now? And the media \n     lets them get by with it. Our 1995 budget was $1.52 trillion. \n     The 1996 Clinton budget is $1.63 trillion. The 1996 Gingrich \n     congressional budget is $1.60 trillion. Both budgets increase \n     spending. Neither keeps up with the $1 billion daily \n     increases in the national debt. Over the seven years, \n     spending exceeds revenues by more than $1 trillion. The media \n     know this yet continue to report ``a balance budget by the \n     year 2002.''\n       Now comes the bogus proposal to balance the budget by \n     reducing cost-of-living increases for Social Security and by \n     raiding Medicare. By law, Social Security funds are in trust \n     and are not to be used to offset the deficit. Similarly, the \n     Medicare trust funds for hospital costs is in the black, but \n     may go into the red by 2002. In other words, both Social \n     Security and Medicare are paid for and in surplus. What is \n     not paid for this minute is defense, education, farm \n     subsidies, environmental protection, veteran's benefits, law \n     enforcement--general government. We readily increase billions \n     for defense and other programs but are unwilling to pay for \n     it. Thus continues the borrowing, spending and downward \n     spiral that increases the deficit. We have fiscal cancer and \n     nobody wants to talk about it.\n       To put a tourniquet on this deficit-debt hemorrhage, we \n     need spending cuts, spending freezes, a closing of tax \n     loopholes, denying new programs and tax increases. But \n     proposals to do this go unreported. As such, the public \n     believes spending cuts alone will do the job. And the media \n     validate bogus plans to cut taxes as serious moves to balance \n     the budget. That we really are broke is ignored.\n       Rather than being pollster pawns, the media should serve as \n     an institutional memory to give us perspective. With the Cold \n     War over, it's time to rebuild our economy. More than ever, a \n     strong government is needed--for education, job training \n     research, housing, transportation, technical development and \n     inner-city needs.\n       But the media treat government as the enemy.\n       In a silent conspiracy with pollsters and Washington \n     politicians, the media masquerade opinion polls as fact and \n     validate the politics that any tax increase is poison. All \n     the time, the rebuilding of America goes wanting and neither \n     the Clinton nor the Dole/Gingrich forces can talk sense. The \n     train wreck is a media production.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It pretty well explains the reason for our dilemma. Let \nme address comments of the Senator from Montana, and others, who have \nmade the argument that President Clinton does not want a balanced \nbudget. Those who have the unmitigated gall to come and contend that \nreally ought to be embarrassed. They know no shame.\n  For openers, we should note that President Clinton came to the \nPresidency having balanced 10 budgets in a row down in Arkansas. Some \nof my colleagues that bellow and scream and whine and cry have never \nseen a balanced budget. But the President did it. That was one of the \nClinton campaign's clarion calls, that he knew how to put Government on \na pay-as-you-go basis.\n  What did he do when he came to town? He cut spending and put us on a \npath that has led to significant reductions in the Federal budget \ndeficit. Even the opposition contends that it cannot be balanced except \nin 7 years. But let me address the issue of responsibility. That is \nwhat Republicans claim now--that they are responsible and the President \nis irresponsible. I think somewhere, sometime, somehow the record \nshould show exactly who caused these deficits and who is not \nresponsible for the deficit. You can not accuse President Lyndon \nJohnson of causing the deficit. He left office at the end of 1968 with \na surplus. Ever heard that word around here? Not just ``balanced,'' but \ntotally in the black.\n  I say in passing that President Nixon did not cause these deficits \nthat we grapple with now. Likewise, President Ford worked his dead-\nlevel best even holding a budget summit to try and bring down the \ndeficits. After Ford, President Carter worked to reduce the deficit \nthat he had inherited from President Ford.\n  Mr. President, it was not until we got to voodoo, Kemp-Roth \nReaganomics, that we started this nonsense. President Reagan gave us \nthe first $100 billion deficit in the history of the land. He gave us \nthe first $200 billion deficit in the history of the land. President \nBush gave us the first $300 billion deficit in the history of the land. \nAnd at the close of his administration, President Bush was fast \napproaching a $400 billion deficit. That is where the deficits have \ncome from.\n  I speak advisedly. President Bush voted for every dollar spent during \nhis 4 years. Not this Senator. Not the distinguished Presiding Officer. \nBut I can guarantee that of the 44 vetoes under President Bush, not a \nred cent of spending was ever vetoed.\n  So now we know from whence we came, piling up annual shortfalls until \nthey approached almost $400 billion deficits. President Clinton comes \nto town and what did he do? He put together a package to reduce the \ndeficit $500 billion over 5 years. That is the one person that cannot \nbe accused of causing the deficit--William Jefferson Clinton.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer as well as this Senator from \nSouth Carolina could be accused. We were here at the time that deficits \nsoared up, up, and away. The expression used by my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle is that the President's program leaves us with \n$200 billion deficits ``for as far as the eye can see.''\n  Heavens above, President Clinton did not cause it. He was down in \nLittle Rock. The first thing he did when he came to town was to say \nthat we are going to start balancing the budget. Here was a Democrat \nwho said we are going to tax gasoline. We are going to tax liquor. We \nare going to close corporate loopholes.\n  And not a peep was heard from that crowd over there. We could not get \na single vote in the U.S. Senate from our Republican colleagues. We \ncould not get a single vote in the U.S. House of Representatives from \nour Republican colleagues.\n  Now, having caused the trouble, they act like they never heard of it \nand charge that President Clinton does not want a balanced budget. But \nwhat did he do? On top of the $57 billion in Medicare cuts that were \npart of his deficit reduction package, he followed up with a proposal \nto cut another $120 billion as part of comprehensive health care \nreform. But my colleagues on the other side of the aisle countered, \n``Why change the best health care system in the world?'' Now they say \nthat unless we cut $270 billion Medicare will be broke.\n  Let me quote for the Record from the 1994 report of the Medicare \ntrustees.\n\n\n[[Page S17052]]\n\n       The trust fund ratio, defined as the ratio of assets at the \n     beginning of the year to disbursements during the year, was \n     131 percent in 1993 and then under the intermediate \n     assumptions is projected to decline steadily until the fund \n     is completely exhausted in 2001.\n\n  This year the same board says that exhaustion will not occur until \n2002, as a direct result of the deficit reduction package that we \nenacted in 1993.\n  President Clinton did that. Not one Republican on the other side of \nthe aisle had anything to do with it. They ought to be ashamed of \nthemselves, having caused the problem, fussing with the fellow who had \nnothing to do with the problem, who is trying his best.\n  And the Republicans say that because he is up in the polls, he will \nnot take a stand. He has taken a stand. It is they who would not. It is \nall political applesauce. They have been threatening all year, ``We \nwill close down the Government.'' Read this morning's Washington Post.\n  The Washington Post editorials say, why do you need the FDA? Forget \npharmaceuticals. Why do you need the EPA? We can get clean water. That \nis freedom. I never heard such nonsense.\n  Close down the Government, they say. And they are reveling in it, \ntrying to act now like they are responsible. And every time we meet, \nthey have to get the gang of 73 satisfied who came to Government with a \npledge not to serve.\n  They ought to get rid of the entire crowd. They ought to understand \nthe charge. The truth of the matter is they have not done a thing to \nhelp us. We tried in the Budget Committee to show the extreme nonsense \nof having a $245 billion tax cut. Heavens above, we do not have enough \nrevenue. That is why we have a deficit.\n  When they proposed this in the Budget Committee, we said ``Let's not \nhave the tax cut until we balance the budget.'' They all voted ``no.'' \nWe said, ``Let's have the economic dividend go to Medicare if that's \nthe problem?'' Red-faced, they replied, ``Let's change the subject.''\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee constantly says ``Well, that is \nthe way they did it before; that is the way they did it.'' Well, I \nthought the election message of last November a year ago was that we \nwere going to have change. It is the same act, same scene; same \nplayers.\n  We said in 1981 we were going to balance the budget by 1984. In 1985 \nwe had a similar document which said we would have a balanced budget by \n1990.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Then in 1990, heavens above, you know what we said? \nThey said in 1990 that by September 30, 1995, we would have a surplus \nof $20.5 billion. Look at the budget document.\n  And now the chairman of the Budget Committee tries to justify his \nactions by saying, ``Well, that is what you all have done before.'' \nThat is the trouble. We keep telling the American people that we are \ngetting together on a balanced budget. Then when they finally get \ntogether they say, ``Oops, something else happened.'' They have no idea \nof actually balancing the budget.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat this point the budget tables along with my ``Dear Colleague'' letter \nof which each Senator, each Congressman, I sent to them.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     BUDGET TABLES--SENATOR HOLLINGS                    \n                      [Dollar amounts in billions]                      \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 U.S.                 Gross             \n            Year                budget      Real     Federal     Gross  \n                              (outlays)   deficit      debt     interest\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1945........................      $92.7  .........     $260.1  .........\n1946........................       55.2     -$10.9      271.0  .........\n1947........................       34.5      +13.9      257.1  .........\n1948........................       29.8       +5.1      252.0  .........\n1949........................       38.8       -0.6      252.6  .........\n1950........................       42.6       -4.3      256.9  .........\n1951........................       45.5       +1.6      255.3  .........\n1952........................       67.7       -3.8      259.1  .........\n1953........................       76.1       -6.9      266.0  .........\n1954........................       70.9       -4.8      270.8  .........\n1955........................       68.4       -3.6      274.4  .........\n1956........................       70.6       +1.7      272.7  .........\n1957........................       76.6       +0.4      272.3  .........\n1958........................       82.4       -7.4      279.7  .........\n1959........................       92.1       -7.8      287.5  .........\n1960........................       92.2       -3.0      290.5  .........\n1961........................       97.7       -2.1      292.6  .........\n1962........................      106.8      -10.3      302.9        9.1\n1963........................      111.3       -7.4      310.3        9.9\n1964........................      118.5       -5.8      316.1       10.7\n1965........................      118.2       -6.2      322.3       11.3\n1966........................      134.5       -6.2      328.5       12.0\n1967........................      157.5      -11.9      340.4       13.4\n1968........................      178.1      -28.3      368.7       14.6\n1969........................      183.6       +2.9      365.8       16.6\n1970........................      195.6      -15.1      380.9       19.3\n1971........................      210.2      -27.3      408.2       21.0\n1972........................      230.7      -27.7      435.9       21.8\n1973........................      245.7      -30.4      466.3       24.2\n1974........................      269.4      -17.6      483.9       29.3\n1975........................      332.3      -58.0      541.9       32.7\n1976........................      371.8      -87.1      629.0       37.1\n1977........................      409.2      -77.4      706.4       41.9\n1978........................      458.7      -70.2      776.6       48.7\n1979........................      503.5      -52.9      829.5       59.9\n1980........................      590.9      -79.6      909.1       74.8\n1981........................      678.2      -85.7      994.8       95.5\n1982........................      745.8     -142.5    1,137.3      117.2\n1983........................      808.4     -234.4    1,371.7      128.7\n1984........................      851.8     -193.0    1,564.7      153.9\n1985........................      946.4     -252.9    1,817.6      178.9\n1986........................      990.3     -303.0    2,120.6      190.3\n1987........................    1,003.9     -225.5    2,346.1      195.3\n1988........................    1,064.1     -255.2    2,601.3      214.1\n1989........................    1.143.2     -266.7    2,868.0      240.9\n1990........................    1,252.7     -338.6    3,206.6      264.7\n1991........................    1,323.8     -391.9    3,598.5      285.5\n1992........................    1,380.9     -403.6    4,002.1      292.3\n1993........................    1,408.2     -349.3    4,351.4      292.5\n1994........................    1,460.6     -292.3    4,643.7      296.3\n1995........................    1,518.0     -283.3    4,927.0      336.0\n1996CBOest..................    1,602.0     -311.1    5,238.0     348.0 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Historical Tables, Budget of the U.S. Government FY 1996;         \n  Beginning in 1962, CBO's 1995 Economic and Budget Outlook. 10/10/95.  \n\n  \n                                                                    ____\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 1, 1995.\n       Dear Colleague: In 1987, in the Budget Committee, a \n     bipartisan group of 8 Senators voted for a 5% value-added-tax \n     to eliminate the deficit and debt. Like everyone else, these \n     8 Senators abhorred taxes--but there was no other way. \n     Beginning in the 80's, they had tried a spending freeze--then \n     a freeze plus cuts across the board with Gramm-Rudman-\n     Hollings--then a freeze, cuts, and tax loophole closings with \n     the Tax Reform Act of 1986. But the debt with increased \n     interest costs was growing faster than these combined cuts. \n     The only way to put a tourniquet on this hemorrhage of \n     spending and put an end to deficit spending was to apply a \n     freeze, cuts, loophole closings and a tax increase. This was \n     8 years ago. Now the problem has exploded. In 1980, the debt \n     was less than $1 trillion--now, quintupled to $5 trillion; \n     interest costs on the debt were $75 billion--now, estimated \n     at $348 billion. To this challenge comes the GOP plan to \n     balance the budget--not with a tax increase but with a tax \n     cut. Ludicrous! Let the facts and figures of the plan speak \n     for themselves:\n       1. Each year, spending increases;\n       2. Spending increases exceed the increase in revenues for 7 \n     years by over $1 trillion;\n       3. The debt grows by $1.8 trillion;\n       4. Interest costs approximate $500 billion.\n       Enclosed you will find the undisputed budget figures of the \n     plan. Remember, in 1981, President Reagan submitted a three \n     year plan indicating a balance by 1984. Then, at the end of \n     1985, President Reagan endorsed a five year plan (Gramm-\n     Rudman-Hollings) showing a balance in 1991. In 1990, the \n     across-the-board cuts of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings were repealed \n     and replaced with spending caps and a totally inadequate tax \n     increase. This 1990 plan of President Bush showed a surplus \n     by 1995 of $20,500,000,000.\n       Periodically, we Democrats and Republicans conspire to \n     ``balance the budget'' to get by the next election. We know \n     it can't be done without a tax increase but the media \n     conveniently goes along.

They ought to put me in charge of the CIA. I know how \nto keep things secret.\n  But just as the title of my budget tables say, ``here we go again''. \nSame thing we did in 1981. Same thing we did in 1985. Same thing we did \nin 1990. Here we go again in 1995, saying the budget is balanced when \ntheir budget is not even near balance and they know it. They know it.\n  They spend $636 billion of surpluses in the Social Security trust \nfund. That is not eliminating deficits. That is moving the deficit from \nthe general fund to the Social Security trust fund to make it appear \nlike we are eliminating deficits. Not so.\n  Today, we owe Social Security $484 billion. Spending another $636 \nbillion under their plan, we will owe over $1 trillion. So we will come \nin the year 2002 and say, ``Oh, what a smart boy am I, I have Medicare \nsolvent.'' And then they will look over and say, ``Ye gads, I put \nSocial Security into bankruptcy.'' We will owe it $1 trillion. Who has \nthe plan to raise $1 trillion in revenues in 2002?\n  Mr. President, we are fiddling while Rome burns and they know it. The \nGOP budget is nothing more then a political document to get by next \nyear's election--excuse me, next year's election and the election in \n2000. That is how arrogant they are. Avoid the tough decisions to get \nby two Presidential elections.\n  Do you know how much they are supposed to cut in spending in the year \n2002? Mr. President, $347 billion. Right now in debating the fiscal \nyear 1996 appropriations bills, with all the attention, with the \nGovernment closed down, we are having difficulty saving $45 billion. \nBut in the last year, they have to save $347 billion. The reason that \nthis whole charade is transpiring is that they are trying to force-feed \nthe President what they cannot pass by a majority vote.\n  I am on these committees. I know. Do you think Republicans are \nopposed to legal services? I joined with the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico to restore the funding.\n  Do you think the Republicans really want to abolish the Department of \nCommerce? I know. We joined in to strike that language. We let the \nSenator who was trying to kill the Department make the motion, for some \nkind of political advantage. It was embarrassing, but that is what they \nwanted to do, and I wanted to preserve the Department.\n  My point is that Republicans and Democrats are not for all these cuts \nand they know it. That is why 10 of the 13 appropriations bills have \nnot passed. And it is Thanksgiving. We have the ``Grinch That Stole \nChristmas.'' Now we've got the Gingrich that is going to steal \nThanksgiving with this nonsense. That is exactly what is going on. They \ncannot get their bills through the Congress, so they are piling it all \nup in a budget and saying, ``Mr. President, take it or leave it.'' \nSince he does not take it, ``Oh, you are not for a balanced budget.''\n  They ought to give it to him in an orderly process, let him veto it, \nand let them get two-thirds. Let us have the democratic process, the \norderly process of legislation here on the floor of the national \nCongress and stop all this one-upmanship about who is going to win and \nwho is going to lose in the polls. It is downright embarrassing.\n  They cannot get it through the Congress. That is why they have not \npassed the appropriations bills. They cannot pass those appropriations \nbills because we have right-thinking Members on the Republican side as \nwell as the Democratic side who do not want to do away with technology. \nThey do not want to do away with the Minority Business Administration.\n  I can go down the list of things on both sides of the aisle. They did \nnot want to do away with the Department of Energy; with the Department \nof Education.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's additional time has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask to proceed just for a couple of minutes more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator may proceed.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. My point is they planned this scenario all year long. \nThey had no idea of passing any appropriations bills. Last December I \nsaw it on TV, and they were going to pass their bills and they were \ngoing to do this and that. But as we have already seen, they cannot \npass a defense appropriations bill. Defense has been voted down, right \nover there with the gang of 73.\n  I am on State, Justice, Commerce and they cannot get that bill \nenacted. So, not being able to pass them using their own troops, they \njust load them on to a debt bill and a continuing resolution. This is \nreally just a terrible shame for Government to be conducted in this \nfashion. All to save that Presidential gang of 73. You see, the 73 \ncontrol the Speaker, the Speaker controls Gramm, Gramm controls Dole, \nand Dole controls the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici. I feel sorry for my friend from New Mexico.\n  I hear statements that I know he does not agree with. I see votes \nthat I know he does not agree with. All of these tricks--changing the \nCPI, back-loading the cuts, using the Social Security surpluses, \ncreating a Medicare lockbox--are a bad mistake. I would not vote for \nit. President Clinton ought not to sign it. He ought to veto it. He \nknows that is just a document for the next two Presidential elections, \nto get them in office next November.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn] is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S17054]]\n\n\n                            THE DEBT CEILING\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I wish to talk for a few minutes about the \ndebt ceiling bill, what happened to it, and an amendment that was on it \nwhen it came to the floor.\n  First, I want to make a couple of comments so that the public will \nunderstand exactly what this is all about.\n  In general terms, we are talking about the balanced budget. There is \nnot a soul in this Chamber, elected or otherwise, who would not agree \nthat we want a balanced budget. I certainly agree with that. The \nquestion is, how do we get to that?\n  We, on the Democratic side, were concerned about this back 2 years \nago, in 1993, when we passed the President's proposal for the budget. \nThere was a lot of difficulty passing that. It meant the committee \nchairs, of which I was one, had to go through and analyze everything to \nmeet the objectives that were assigned as part of the debt reduction \nprocess.\n  We did that. That was in the summer of 1993. The budget deficit at \nthat time was running right at $300 billion a year and going up. What \nhappened? We passed a $500 billion deficit reduction program and it was \ntough. We passed it without one single Republican vote--not a one. In \nthe Senate, it was a 50-50 tie vote and the Vice President broke that \ntie.\n  There were all sorts of dire predictions from the other side. I can \nremember some of the debate here. ``We are going to see millions \nunemployed. If this passes, it will be a terrible bill. Everything bad \nis going to happen.''\n  What happened? We were running right at $300 billion a year at that \ntime. Last year, it went down to $246 billion, and now down to about \n$192 billion. We were on the right path toward a balanced budget.\n  For the first time since Harry Truman we have had a reduced budget \ndeficit 3 years in a row. So it has been working. We went from $300 \nbillion to $246 billion to $192 billion. The problem is--and I am \ncritical of our own administration and the Democrats and everybody else \nfor not taking action that will keep that trend going. Instead of \nleveling off we should be trying to further reduce those annual \ndeficits and keep us on the right track. It is not as though we have \nseen things run away in the last 3 years. I think the President \ndeserves a lot of credit. He is not getting much from the other side, \nof course. The people over in the House in particular, some of the \nleadership over there just dismiss the fact for 3 years in a row, the \nfirst time since Harry Truman, we have had declining deficits.\n  What has happened now? As part of this so-called Contract With \nAmerica, they want to give a $245 billion tax break as a crown jewel. \nWe are giving a $245 billion tax break, and the figures are that almost \nhalf, a little over half of that goes to people already making $100,000 \na year.\n  When I point that out to people back home in Ohio, they are \nincredulous that we could be permitting that to be considered, whether \nthe cuts come from Medicare, Medicaid, education, or environmental \nprotection. Basically, those are not areas that the American people \nwant to give up and say that we are just going to whack with a two-\nedged sword, or swing machetes back and forth and whack those programs. \nThe American people do not agree with that.\n  So we have come to an impasse. We can put up with it for a few days. \nHowever, I understand that Speaker Gingrich told his staff in the House \nas reported on CNN about an hour and a half ago, that we could look \nforward to maybe 90 days of this.\n  I hope that he is not serious about that because, if he is, this will \nget far beyond just being a domestic problem in the United States of \nAmerica. We are the leading world currency. We are the leading economy \nin this whole world. And if ever there begins to be doubt and if ever \nthere begins to be lack of trust in the good faith and credit of the \nUnited States of America around the world by letting this impasse run \n90 days, we are in deep trouble.\n  Everybody wants a balanced budget. As I understand it, what we are \ndown to now is they said to the President, ``Well, we will agree to \nprovide a clean continuing resolution if you will agree to a balanced \nbudget over 7 years using CBO assumptions.'' I understand that the \nPresident agrees that we are going to balance this budget, the real \nquestion is how.\n  The President, as I understand it, made an offer back that said, \n``Well, OK, let's make it 7 to 10 years,'' using mutually agreed upon \neconomic assumptions. And they turned it down. He has to come up with 7 \nyears or else.\n  That is just flat ideological blackmail. There is no other term that \nyou can put onto it. I think this has gotten to be a bit ridiculous.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for another 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, now to get down to a specific. We had two \ncontinuing resolution limit proposals yesterday in which we proposed a \nstraight, clean spending extension to go to the President--nothing else \non it, no amendments. Government gets back in operation and away we go, \nand that is it. There was objection on the other side to that.\n  The debt ceiling question is very simple. Everyone knows that a debt \nlimit extension is must legislation. You have to have it or everything \nelse in Government stops.\n  So everyone is aware that there is a lot of pressure toward getting \nthat through. There is a lot of pressure on the President to sign it, \nand that is why it attracts amendments, because people believe if they \ncan just get their pet amendment, whatever it may be, hooked onto this \nthing, it can become law without all the protective mechanisms such as \nhearings, open debate on the floor, perfecting amendments, and \nconsideration of all the long-term impacts and all the other things \nthat we normally have to consider. So people know that when you have a \ndebt limit extension that is must legislation.\n  What happened? We have no better example of the contempt with which \nthe legislative process has been treated in recent days than the way in \nwhich the so-called regulatory reform bill was attached to the debt \nceiling by the House Republicans without any hearings whatsoever, \nwithout any analysis, without adequate notice to the minority. A 112-\npage nongermane amendment was brought to the House floor and attached \nto the debt limit bill--112 pages. It was done with such haste that at \nleast three versions of the amendment were circulating Thursday \nmorning, November 9, the day of the debate and the vote.\n  The day before, on November 8, the chief sponsor of the amendment had \ninserted one version into the Congressional Record. It was that version \nto which my remarks on November 9 were addressed.\n  Revisions to the amendment were being made so close to the time of \nintroduction on the House floor that the chief sponsors themselves \nmisstated an important provision of the amendment. They referred to the \ndefinition of ``major rule'' and said it was defined in the amendment \nas one costing $75 million per year. In the amendment, the cost is $100 \nmillion. This is not a small point.\n  Cost-benefit analysis of major rules is a huge undertaking that can \nresult in documents--we were told in testimony before the Governmental \nAffairs Committee--reaching over 100 feet of shelf space just for one \nrule. So this is not something that is lightly considered.\n  I do not know which number the House sponsors think is the correct \none, since $100 million is in the amendment, but $75 million was \nmentioned by both key sponsors. Are their remarks in error, or is the \nnumber in the amendment a typographical error? We do not know. That \nshould not surprise us.\n  The night before, on November 8, the bill that was given to the House \nRules Committee was 132 pages long and defined a major rule with a \nthreshold of $50 million. The next day at 10 a.m. it was about 20 pages \nshorter, though still hefty, and defined a major rule with a threshold \n$75 million. That was the second version. Then, the third version \nappeared at about 2:30 p.m. after debate on the amendment had begun, \nand defined a major rule with a threshold of $100 million. No wonder \nthe sponsors were confused.\n\n[[Page S17055]]\n\n  But that confusion did not stop the House Republicans from ramming \nthe bill through with minimum debate.\n  Well, since the President was going to veto the debt limit bill \nanyway, we agreed to let it go through the Senate, and I spoke about \none version of this amendment on the Senate floor that night. I can \ntell you that if I thought this regulatory reform bill was going to \nbecome law, I would still be here talking these many days, almost. I \nfeel that strongly about it.\n  Mr. President, I have now examined the version that passed the House, \nand it turns out that my comments of November 9 require no major \nrevision.\n  I claimed that the amendment had a supermandate. They changed the \nlanguage, but the supermandate is still there. How do I know that? \nWell, besides reading the language, I have the word of the chief \nsponsor, Representative Walker. In describing the amendment, he stated \nthat current statutory standards can be ``superseded--the so-called \nsupermandate''.\n  Let us be clear about what that means. It means that 25 years of \nhealth-based environmental standards for clean air and clean water \ncould be overturned if this amendment became law.\n  Representative Walker also describes his amendment as ``not as tough \nas the House bill, nor as loose as the Senate bill''. That is one way \nof putting it. Here is another. The original House bill, H.R. 9, was as \nreactionary an antienvironment, antihealth, and antisafety legislative \ninstrument as I have seen during my entire 20 years in the U.S. Senate. \nThe Senate bill referred to is the Dole-Johnston bill, S. 343, which is \na seriously flawed bill that has failed three cloture motions in the \nSenate this year.\n  So, according to the chief sponsor of the amendment, the amendment is \na cross between the reactionary H.R. 9 and the not-so-moderate version \nof S. 343 that failed on three cloture votes. Is this a moderate \ncompromise?\n  No, it is not. It is an example of what we can expect in a conference \nwith the House on regulatory reform if we go into it with a Senate bill \nlike S. 343.\n  I think the Walker amendment is extreme. It is reckless, extreme in \nthe burden it places on agencies to defend themselves from the \nunlimited litigation that would be unleashed by the judicial review \nprovisions of this amendment. It is reckless in the jeopardy that it \ncauses our laws concerning health, safety, and the environment.\n  We passed it in the U.S. Senate and sent it as part of the debt limit \nbill over to the President. It is a good thing that he vetoed it.\n  Mr. President, I am for regulatory reform, but not at the expense of \nthe health and the safety of the American people. I worked hard all \nyear with both Republican and Democratic colleagues to produce a \nmoderate bill, and we came within two votes of passing it. I am still \ninterested in producing a moderate bill that provides real regulatory \nreform but owes its provenance to no special interest group, and above \nall protects the American people.\n  I am for a balanced budget, too. I am for all the things we are \ntrying to do to get the Federal Government on the right track for the \nAmerican people. But this game playing that is going on, that is \nlargely coming from the House with literally poor and onerous pieces of \nlegislation hooked on as amendments to an essential bill like the debt \nlimit; this is something we cannot tolerate.\n  The President was absolutely right to veto that bill, and I think we \ncan still pass legislation here to benefit all of the American people.\n  We can still do that in this Congress but not if the legislative \nprocess is treated with the literal contempt that has been evinced this \npast week by the way in which reg reform was attached to the debt limit \nbill.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/15/senate-section/article/S17050-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17055-S17056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMERCE FUNDS LOBBYISTS\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' \nattention to a woeful misuse of the taxpayers' money.\n  As we have debated the so-called Istook amendment banning taxpayer \nsubsidies for lobbyists, those opposed to reform have argued that \ncurrent law already prohibits using grant funds for advocacy.\n  But there has come to my attention a blatant example of just this \nphenomenon.\n  The National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a \npart of the Commerce Department, has provided $200,000 to HandsNet, \nInc., a California group which operates an online computer service \nfocused on lobbying and available on the Internet. According to its own \nInternet-based documents, HandsNet links ``5,000 public interest and \nhuman service organizations across the United States.'' Among the \nservices offered: ``the latest Action Alerts,'' a weekly digest \nsummarizing the alerts, and daily updates on key issues.\n  Mr. President, NTIA's own description of the grant award specifically \nmentions that the grant will allow ``National organizations [to] help \nlocal ones keep up to date by publicizing action alerts. . . .''\n  And what are these action alerts? Allow me to offer a few recent \nexamples:\n  ``ISTOOK AMENDMENT--CALL YOUR REPRESENTATIVES''\n  The message? ``Now is the time to turn up the heat. . . . So Call, E-\nMail, or Fax Your Representative Today!''\n  ``GIVE PRESIDENT CLINTON A WAKE-UP CALL.''\n  The message? ``If President Clinton signs immoral welfare and \nMedicaid `reform' bills, the 60-year-old guaranteed safety net for \nchildren will be destroyed.''\n  ``CONGRESS YIELDS TO TRADITIONAL VALUES COALITION''\n  The message? ``The hearing, dubbed `Parental Involvement in Social \nIssues in Education'. . . Is likely to become a tax-funded platform for \ngay bashing.''\n  I could go on, Mr. President, but my point is clear. These action \nalerts are intended to facilitate and increase the effectiveness of \nlobbying on this Congress. ``HandsNet'' has a clear political agenda, \nand it is using Commerce Department funding--the taxpayers' money--to \nfurther that agenda.\n  We cannot afford to fund this kind of political activism. It is a \nwaste of taxpayers' money in times when the Government already taxes \ntoo much and spends even more than it takes in. It is also \ncounterproductive, in times of budgetary downsizing, to fund the \ninterest groups that seek to continue Government's expansion.\n  The sum of $200,000 may not sound like a lot of money Mr. President, \nbut it is the taxpayers' money. What is more, this practice is entirely \ntoo widespread. NTIA also has funded on-line activities for a number of \nother groups engaged in lobbying activities.\n  Mr. President, HandsNet members include several special interest \ngroups lobbying against the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich reform effort. Not \nsurprisingly, these groups are more than happy to use taxpayer funds to \nlobby against having taxpayer funds cut off from their lobbying \nefforts.\n  This brings up the problem of the Commerce Department itself. I say \nthe problem of the Commerce Department because that agency itself is an \ninvitation and a source of funds for lobbying activities and subsidies \nagainst the interests of America's taxpayers.\n  The General Accounting Office has noted that the Commerce Department \nis duplicative and so unnecessary. It shares its missions with over 71 \nFederal departments, agencies and offices. It controls at most 8 \npercent of funding devoted to actual trade issues in our Government and \nhas no unified purpose for its existence.\n  What, then, do we get for our $3.6 billion in funding for the \nCommerce Department? Corporate welfare and subsidies for lobbying \norganizations.\n  The HandsNet example proves how counterproductive Commerce Department \ngrants really are. These grants encourage a growth industry of special-\ninterest lobbying, distort our deliberations here, and push us toward \noverspending and unbalanced budgets. We must stop this blatant self-\ninterested lobbying for the sake of our Nation and for the sake of our \nown independence as a legislative body.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the Heritage \nFoundation's Government Integrity Project Report titled ``Commerce \nDepartment Funds Blatant Lobbying'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S17056]]\n\n\n               Commerce Department Funds Blatant Lobbying\n\n              (By Marshall Wittman and Charles P. Griffin)\n\n       No part of the money appropriated by any enactment of \n     Congress shall, in the absence of express authorization by \n     Congress, be used directly or indirectly to pay for any . . . \n     printed or written matter, or other device, intended or \n     designed to influence in any manner a Member of Congress, to \n     favor or oppose . . . any legislation . . . 18 USC 1913\n       Opponents of the effort to end 40 years of political \n     corruption manifested in a system of taxpayer-subsidized \n     lobbying often state that existing federal law already \n     prohibits using grant funds for advocacy. They cite the above \n     section of the U.S. Code to defend this view.\n       It appears, however, that the law is irrelevant. In recent \n     weeks, the Department of Commerce has provided $200,000 to \n     HandsNet, Inc., a California group which operates an online \n     computer service focused on lobbying and available on the \n     Internet. According to its own Internet-based documents, \n     HandsNet links ``5,000 public interest and human service \n     organizations across the United States.'' Among the services \n     offered: ``the latest Action Alerts.''\n       A description of the grant award prepared by the grant \n     provider, the National Telecommunications and Information \n     Administration (part of the Commerce Department), \n     specifically mentions that the grant will allow ``National \n     organizations [to] help local ones keep up to date by \n     publicizing action alerts. . . .''

In addition, HandsNet will \n     ``conduct a national outreach campaign'' to introduce human \n     services groups to the Internet.\n       The major component of the grant appears to be a new \n     training center in Washington, D.C. The center will be fully \n     functional around January 1, 1996, according to HandsNet \n     documents, but is housed temporarily at the headquarters of \n     Families USA (funder of the 1994 Clinton health care bus \n     caravans). The national center will be operated in \n     conjunction with the Institute for Global Communications, \n     also of California.\n\n\n                             about handsnet\n\n       In reviewing the HandsNet site on the Internet, it appears \n     that its principal purpose is explicit political advocacy. \n     The site has been used in recent months to fight welfare \n     reform and the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich Amendment, among many \n     other issues. The three key information components provided \n     are Action Alerts, a Weekly Digest (a summary of the alerts) \n     and daily updates on key issues. According to its Internet \n     site, HandsNet is affiliated with the Institute for Global \n     Communications, an arm of the Tides Foundation, Members of \n     HandsNet include the major opponents of the Istook-\n     McIntosh-Ehrlich reform effort, including OMB Watch and \n     the Alliance for Justice.\n\n\nabout the telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance \n                             Program TIIAP\n\n       The Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure \n     Assistance Program is operated by NTIA in the Commerce \n     Department. Under the Clinton Administration, this program \n     has mushroomed in cost, from $10 million in FY 1994 to $25 \n     million in FY 1995. In 1994 there were 92 grants; in the most \n     recent round (to be announced in mid-November, has already \n     awarded), there are 120. There also are indications that the \n     TIIAP may subsidize other lobbying activities, in addition to \n     those of HandsNet, Inc.\n       According to NTIA documents, the Planned Parenthood \n     Federation of America received $300,000 in 1994 to set up a \n     ``nationwide on-line information system'' for itself and all \n     164 affiliates. Also in 1994, a California organization \n     called LatinoNet received funding to ``establish a network of \n     regional field representatives'' and ``demonstrate a model \n     for building a national grassroots information system,'' \n     among other things.\n       Organizations that filed proposals and applications for \n     funding in the FY 1995 process include Families USA, ACORN \n     (which led noisy demonstrations in Congress earlier this \n     year), the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, and \n     Citizens Fund (an affiliate of Citizen Action, an active \n     grassroots lobbying organization). It is unclear which, if \n     any, will receive funding.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       The Commerce Department, through NTIA, has awarded a grant \n     to an online lobbying organization for the specific purpose \n     of engaging more groups in its Internet advocacy efforts. The \n     $200,000 gift to HandsNet, Inc., to train people in the \n     publishing of action alerts and other lobbying materials \n     represents a blatant misuse of taxpayer funds.\n       Supporters of taxpayer-funded political patronage argue \n     that the current system is designed to prevent abuses. The \n     case of the Commerce Department and HandsNet, Inc., provides \n     a serious test of this claim. The fact that such a \n     significant grant could be made with no effort to hide the \n     fact that it directly funds lobbying activities clearly \n     demonstrates the need for Congress to reform this costly and \n     irresponsible form of political corruption.\n\n\n                   sample action alert from handsnet\n\n       Help Stop Medicaid and Medicare Cuts!

Mr. President, we should not lose sight of the fact that we \nneed a Continuing Resolution because Congress has not completed its \nwork on the fiscal year 1996 appropriation bills. The fiscal year began \non October 1st and, yet, today, 6 weeks later, Congress has sent only \nthree of the thirteen appropriation bills to the President that he \nsigned. Congress sent a fourth one, the legislative appropriation bill, \nwhich the President, in mid-July, very unwisely vetoed.\n  Be that as it may, in addition, congressional action on the \ntransportation and legislative appropriation bills has been completed \nand they are ready to go to the President. Of the eight remaining \nbills, seven are still in various stages of the legislative process: \nDefense, Interior, Foreign Operations, Treasury-Postal Service, \nCommerce, Justice, VA-HUD, and the District of Columbia appropriation \nbills. The Labor-HHS bill has not even been brought up in this \nChamber--6 weeks after the fiscal year began.\n  One of the major causes of this failure to complete congressional \naction on these eight appropriation bills is the fact that virtually \nall of them contain controversial legislative riders, issues such as \npublic housing reform, EPA regulatory issues, mining law reform, \nCalifornia desert protection, National Endowment for the Arts, prison \nreform, abortion, and rewriting the 1994 crime bill.\n  In other words, instead of completing our necessary appropriations \nwork, Congress has chosen instead to load up our appropriation bills \nwith items from the Republicans' so-called ``Contract With America.''\n  Now, Mr. President, this is my ``Contract With America.'' I keep it \nin my shirt pocket in all of my waking hours, Sundays included. It is \nthe Constitution of the United States. It is pretty \n\n[[Page S17057]]\nwell-worn. It only cost 19 cents when I first gained possession of it--\nthis Contract With America--the Constitution of the United States. That \nis my contract.\n  I have read nowhere in this Constitution of the United States that \nthere is any constitutional requirement that we enact the so-called \n``Contract With America.'' I say it is ``so-called'' because it is not \na legitimate contract. Any lawyer who has studied law, who has taken a \ncourse in contracts, knows that it is not a bona fide contract.\n  There is no constitutional requirement that Congress enact the so-\ncalled ``Contract With America.'' But we are required by the \nConstitution of the United States to enact appropriation bills and only \nthe Congress may enact appropriation bills.\n  The reason for the President's veto of the continuing resolution and \nthe resolution to increase the debt limit was that the Republican \nmajority in Congress insisted on including such controversial \nprovisions in each of those appropriation measures. That is why we are \nat this impasse.\n  It is incumbent upon the Congress to enact a clean continuing \nresolution and a clean debt limit increase without adding controversial \nand unnecessary legislative riders to either. If Congress refuses to do \nso, then the blame properly lies at the doorstep of Congress.\n  It has been obvious for months that part of the grand strategy of the \nRepublican majority in Congress was to threaten to shut down the \nGovernment and to force a default on our debt in order to coerce the \nPresident into accepting their misguided contract items and their \nmisguided budget and Medicare cuts. No question but that we have to cut \nthe budget. We all know that. And we will have to make some reductions \nin Medicare. But the cuts that are being proposed are, in my judgment, \nmisguided.\n\n  A leader of the other body has been extensively and regularly quoted \nin the media on the subject of a Government shutdown, as well as on the \nquestion of increasing the national debt ceiling. In his statements, \nthat leader of the other body has shown a callous disregard for those \nAmericans who are affected adversely by this Government shutdown, as \nwell as for the consequences of the Government's being unable to meet \nits debt obligations.\n  For example, on the question of shutting down the Federal Government, \nhe has had the following things to say. The June 3, 1995, issue of the \nRocky Mountain News quoted Speaker Gingrich as saying: ``We're going to \ngo over the liberal Democratic part of the Government and then say to \nthem: `We could last 60 days, 90 days, 120 days, 5 years, a century.' \nThere's a lot of stuff we don't care if it's ever funded.''\n  The June 5, 1995, issue of Time magazine contained this quote by \nSpeaker Gingrich. I am quoting Time magazine. ``He,'' meaning the \nPresident, ``can run the parts of the Government that are left [after \nthe Republican budget cuts] or he''--the President--``can run no \nGovernment * * *. Which of the two of us do you think worries more \nabout Government not showing up?''\n  The September 22, 1995, issue of the Washington Post attributed this \nquote to Speaker Gingrich, and I am quoting the Washington Post: ``I \ndon't care what the price is. I don't care if we have no executive \noffices and no bonds for 30 days--not this time.''\n  And on the question of increasing the national debt ceiling so that \nthe Federal Government will not default on its financial commitments, \nthe Washington Times reported on April 3 that Speaker Gingrich vowed \n``to create a titanic legislative standoff with President Clinton by \nadding vetoed bills to must-pass legislation, increasing the national \ndebt ceiling.'' That is a quote from the Washington Times of the date \nof April 3, 1995.\n  The same issue, the April 3, 1995 issue of the Washington Times, also \nincluded this quote by Speaker Gingrich: ``The President will veto a \nnumber of things and we'll then put them all''--Senators, you can see \nthis coming; this is what is developing here; the prophecy is being \nfulfilled--``The President will veto a number of things and we'll then \nput them all on the debt ceiling, and then he'll decide how big a \ncrisis he wants.'' So there you have it--the complete blueprint for the \nshutdown.\n  And finally, the November 8, 1995, issue of Investor's Business Daily \ncontained this quote: ``Gingrich has said he would force the Government \nto miss interest and principle payments for the first time ever to \nforce Democrat Clinton's administration to agree to his seven-year \ndeficit reduction.''\n  So there should be no question in the minds of the American people as \nto why the shutdown of the Federal Government occurred at 12:01 a.m. \nyesterday morning. It is because the Republican majority decided months \nago and alerted the American people months ago, called the shots months \nago that there would be a shutdown and that they would create such a \ncrisis--even though there is no reason for a Government shutdown. All \nCongress has to do to alleviate and remove this crisis is to simply \nenact an extension of spending authority for the period of time \nsufficient to enable Congress to complete its work on the remaining \n1996 appropriation bills.\n  Yet, that is not what the Republican majority proposed in the \nContinuing Resolution which the President chose to veto. Instead, that \nresolution included what amounted to a 25 percent increase in Medicare \nPart B premiums and made even further deep cuts in education and other \npublic investments. So, it is clear that the Republican majority \ncreated this crisis which it said would be created to coerce the \nPresident either to accept their wrong-headed proposals or to shut the \nGovernment down.\n  The Republicans demanded higher Medicare premiums as the price of \nkeeping the Government running. Making seniors pay more for health care \nis the one part of the Republican budget agenda they picked to do \nfirst. Higher bills for seniors. The vetoed Continuing Resolution would \nhave increased monthly Medicare premiums on January 1, 1996. \nCongressional Budget Office estimates indicate that the monthly \nincrease would be $11.00 above current law. That would mean an increase \nof $264 a year in Medicare Part B premiums for an elderly couple.\n  Mr. President, I cannot for the life of me understand what the \nRepublican majority thought they gained from forcing a Government \nshutdown at 12:01 a.m. yesterday morning by insisting on including \nthese Medicare premium increases in the Continuing Resolution. The \nAmerican people can see through this deliberately created train wreck. \nThe November 13, 1995, issue of The Wall Street Journal contained an \nNBC News Poll asking the question: ``Who Gets Blamed? If President \nClinton and the Republican Congress don't reach a budget agreement in \ntime to avoid a major shutdown of the federal government, who do you \nthink will be more to blame--President Clinton or the Congress?'' \nForty-three percent of those polled would blame the Republican \nCongress; thirty-two percent would blame President Clinton; eighteen \npercent would blame both equally; and seven percent were not sure as to \nwhom they would blame.\n  And the percentage of Americans who are discontented with Congress \nkeeps growing. Yesterday's Washington Post contained the results from a \nWashington Post-ABC News Poll entitled ``Battle of the Budget.'' The \nquestion was asked: ``There's a possibility the Federal Government \nmight have to shut down in the next few days because the Clinton \nadministration and the Republicans in Congress can't agree on a plan to \nkeep it running while they work on a new budget. Whose fault do you \nthink this mainly is--Clinton's or the Republicans in Congress?'' \nForty-six percent of those polled place the fault of the government \nshutdown on the Republicans in Congress; twenty-seven percent fault \nPresident Clinton; twenty percent fault both; and two percent fault \nneither the Republicans in Congress nor President Clinton.\n  The American people, then, are becoming increasingly disgruntled with \nthis Republican-controlled Congress.\n  Mr. President, how much time is there remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired prior to \nthe vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I may proceed for \nnot to exceed 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  The American people, then, are becoming increasingly disgruntled, as \nI \n\n[[Page S17058]]\nsay, with this Republican-controlled Congress. The American people must \nbe asking themselves what this game of chicken is going to cost and who \nis going to pay for this fiasco. It is not going to be Members of \nCongress--who will continue to be paid in full even if the Government \nshuts down.\n  Furloughed Federal workers by the hundreds of thousands will not be \npaid during this funding hiatus, nor will those who do contract work \nfor the Federal Government. But, the President, and Senators, and \nMembers of the House of Representatives, and Federal judges will still \nreceive their full paychecks, no matter how long the shutdown lasts. Be \nassured, my colleagues, that that situation will not make our \nconstituents love us any more than they do already--which is not very \nmuch.\n  Mr. President, according to the General Accounting Office, there were \nnine occasions over the period from October 1981 through October 1990 \nwhen there were funding gaps of 1 to 3 days. In other words, we had \nnine short periods, usually over weekends, when there were lapses of \nappropriations. Not one of these occasions approached the cost or the \nseverity, not to mention the gross irresponsibility, of our present \nsituation. Furthermore, I am deeply concerned by the strident tones \nsurrounding much of the debate on this budget impasse. In the climate \nof violence and intolerance in American society at large at this time, \nthe extreme rhetoric and incivility emanating from some of our national \nleaders seems to me to be most unhealthy.\n  On the last of these occasions, namely Columbus Day weekend (October \n6-8, 1990), GAO estimated that the shutdown costs of seven affected \nFederal agencies totalled $3.4 million. However, the cost would have \nbeen much higher if a 3-day shutdown had occurred during a normal \nworkweek. GAO states that ``the total cost of such a 3-day workweek \nshutdown would range from about $244.6 million to $607.3 million, \ndepending upon whether revenues estimated to be lost by the IRS could \nbe recovered.'' That is a lot of money that will be wasted--at least \n$250 million for every 3 workdays that the Government is shut down. \nThis is a very expensive way to prove once and for all to the American \npeople that the Government cannot perform even its most basic \nresponsibilities. No wonder one hears so much talk about throwing the \nwhole lot of us out of office. This impasse is like nothing that I have \never seen before.\n  Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. BYRD. This impasse is like nothing I have ever seen before in \nWashington. I was searching for an analogy to describe the current \nimpasse in Washington today and I found it in an unlikely place. Guess \nwhere? The November 14, 1995, issue of the New York Times, in its \nScience section, carries a story about the behavior of the great \nspotted cuckoo. It seems that, in order to advance its territory and \ndeposit its eggs without the bother of doing the work of building a \nnest of its own, the great spotted cuckoo resorts to creative \nextortion.\n  It lays its eggs in magpie nests. If the magpies do not cooperate and \nhatch and raise the cuckoos' eggs, the cuckoos then destroy the whole \nnest, killing all the baby chicks and throwing any unhatched eggs out \nof the nest.\n  The cuckoos run a kind of ``avian mafia,'' making an offer to the \nmagpies that the magpies can ill afford to refuse.\n  It appears to me that some in the Congress may have been carefully \nstudying these strange habits in their spare time. These disciples of \nthe great spotted cuckoo have likewise not done their work and instead \nhave insisted upon planting their very special ``eggs'' in the nests of \nthe Continuing Resolution and the debt limit. If those eggs do not \nhatch or receive proper attention, these Congressional cuckoo birds \nfully intend to exact punishment by damaging or destroying our national \neconomy. This is certainly not very civilized behavior.\n  In the case of the cuckoo, it is described as ``thuggish'' behavior \neven among animals, by the Times. One thing is certain, Mr. President. \nThe American people must certainly view our current situation as more \nthan a little cuckoo. I daresay they are probably watching us with \nutter disgust.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 14, 1995]\n\n        Thuggish Cuckoos Use Muscle To Run Egg Protection Racket\n\n                         (By Carol Kaesuk Yoon)\n\n       Biologists had ranked them among nature's most laughable \n     dupes, inexplicably gullible bird-brains that dutifully \n     tended eggs dumped into their nests by other bird species. \n     For evolutionary biologists, the many species of birds that \n     so devote themselves to a stranger's young have been \n     something of a mystery, for even when the dumped eggs and \n     young look nothing like their own, the birds often favor the \n     parasites' offspring at the expense of their own.\n       Now a study in the journal Evolution offers the first \n     evidence to support what had been considered an unlikely \n     explanation for this behavior. Biologists studying magpies \n     and the great spotted cuckoos that dump eggs into their nests \n     say that the magpie hosts are not dupes at all, but have been \n     forced into cooperation by an avian extortion scheme.\n       The researchers say the cuckoos return periodically to \n     check on the nests in which they have left their eggs. If \n     they find their young safely there, all is well. If their \n     eggs are missing, tossed out by uncooperative magpie hosts, \n     the cuckoos destroy the nest, killing the remaining egg or \n     chick inhabitants wholesale. In other words, the magpies are \n     members of an avian mafia.\n       ``It's an offer that the birds cannot refuse,'' said Dr. \n     Anders Moller, an evolutionary biologist at Copenhagen \n     University in Denmark and an author of the study. ``It's just \n     the same as in the human mafia. If you resist, it turns out \n     very badly.''\n       Dr. Timothy Clutton-Brock, an evolutionary biologist at \n     Cambridge University in England, called the paper ``extremely \n     interesting,'' saying that such punishment behaviors were \n     probably widespread among animals for keeping others in line. \n     He describes this apparently reliable and adaptive strategy \n     for living as: ``You do something nasty to me, I do something \n     even nastier to you.''\n       Raising a nest full of eggs and chicks is difficult, time-\n     consuming work. There is the incubating of eggs, the chasing \n     off of predators, the finding of food for so many peeping, \n     gaping mouths, not to mention feeding oneself to maintain the \n     energy to do all this intensive baby rearing. So cuckoos \n     might well be expected to have evolved all manner of tricks \n     to get other birds to do such work for them.\n       But Dr. Manuel Soler of the University of Granada in Spain \n     said that he and his colleagues  did not believe that birds \n     engaged in such coercive behavior and had set out to \n     disprove the theory known as the mafia hypothesis. Dr. \n     Soler studied the great spotted cuckoos and the magpies \n     they parasitize in high altitude plateaus in southern \n     Spain. He worked with his brother, Dr. Juan Soler, and Dr. \n     Juan Martinez, behavioral ecologists at the university, \n     and Dr. Moller.\n       To test the hypothesis, Dr. Soler and his colleagues \n     removed cuckoo eggs from 29 nests while leaving them in 28 \n     nests. What they found was that in most of the nests that had \n     had their cuckoo eggs removed either the magpie eggs or \n     chicks that remained were later killed. In contrast, nearly \n     all the nests in which scientists allowed the cuckoo eggs to \n     remain were left intact.\n       At the same time, scientists monitored nature. The great \n     majority of nests from which magpies had ejected cuckoo eggs \n     on their own, without the help of scientists, were also \n     attacked and their young inhabitants killed. Very few of \n     those magpie nests that accepted the cuckoo eggs suffered \n     such attacks.\n       Such killings, like most rare and rapid events in nature, \n     are hard to witness. But the biologists say they are \n     confident that the attackers were indeed the cuckoos whose \n     eggs had been ejected. When removing eggs from nests to set \n     up their experiment, the researchers were often scolded by \n     cuckoos, which quickly checked the nests after researchers \n     were done. They also followed one female cuckoo outfitted \n     with a radio transmitter who returned to a nest from which \n     her egg had been removed and destroyed the contents.\n       But most convincing was the evidence in the nests \n     themselves. For what the biologists found were pecked eggs \n     and wounded nestlings, all left behind by their killers. \n     While other birds and animals attack magpie nests, such \n     hungry predators do not leave their victims behind.\n       By the breeding season's end, the magpies that accepted \n     cuckoos in their nests tended to produce more magpie young \n     than those that ejected them, suggesting that the cost of \n     noncompliance is high.\n       ``The experiment they did is very convincing,'' said Dr. \n     Peter Arcese, an ecologist at the University of Wisconsin in \n     Madison. ``People are going to have to take seriously the \n     idea that these nest parasites are more sophisticated than we \n     think.''\n       Researchers say the data are the first to support the so-\n     called mafia hypothesis proposed in 1979 by Dr. Amotz Zahavi, \n     a behavioral ecologist at Tel Aviv University in Israel. Dr. \n     Zahavi proposed that nest parasites, \n\n[[Page S17059]]\n     like the cuckoo, might be bullying their hosts into accepting eggs \n     under threat of violence if they did not. But in the 16 years \n     since Dr. Zahavi's hypothesis was published, no evidence had \n     turned up in support of it.\n       ``He's put out a number of ideas that people have initially \n     pooh-poohed,'' said Dr. Arcese, ``and later people have shown \n     that, in fact, they may operate.''\n       Dr. Zahavi said, ``Obviously it is satisfying that a model \n     you created is found to be true at least for one cuckoo in \n     one place.''\n       But at the same time, researchers note that enforcement may \n     not be the only reason that parasites like the cuckoos are \n     destroying nests.\n       Dr. Arcese said that based on studies of cowbirds that \n     parasitize song sparrows on Mandarte Island near Victoria, \n     British Columbia, he and his colleagues had evidence that \n     cowbirds could also cause their hosts' nests to fail. But Dr. \n     Arcese says their studies indicate that the cowbirds may be \n     destroying nests, not to teach the song sparrows a lesson, \n     but for their own convenience.\n       Cowbirds, like other nest parasites, must find nests into \n     which eggs are being freshly laid. In nests with older eggs \n     or eggs of unknown age, the host's young may hatch first, \n     ending incubation and leading to the death of the parasite's \n     egg.\n       To avoid such problems, Dr. Arcese suggests that parasites, \n     including the cuckoo, may kill young as a way of getting \n     hosts to start another nest, where the parasites can leave \n     their eggs at the perfect time.\n       Dr. Stephen Rothstein, an evolutionary biologist at the \n     University of California at Santa Barbara, while praising the \n     team's work as ``superb,'' suggested a simpler explanation \n     for the fact that many magpies keep the cuckoo eggs.\n       While the eggs and young of many parasites look strikingly \n     different from that of their hosts, those of the great \n     spotted cuckoo are good mimics of the magpie's.\n       ``It could just be evolutionary lag,'' said Dr. Rothstein, \n     describing an idea that has come out of his work with \n     cowbirds. That is, magpies may keep cuckoo eggs simply \n     because they have not yet evolved the ability to make the \n     sometimes difficult distinction between the cuckoo's and \n     their own. It is a lag that leaves the cuckoos winning the \n     evolutionary war, at least for now.\n       Dr. Rothstein added that he also had evidence that parents \n     of nests from which any eggs had been removed, whether the \n     bird's own or a parasite's, would often desert the nest. He \n     said this could explain the greater rate of attacks on nests \n     from which eggs had been experimentally ejected as seen in \n     the new study. With eggs missing, the magpie parents might be \n     considerably less interested in tending and protecting the \n     nests, leaving them open to attack by cuckoos or other birds.\n       To complicate matters even further, Dr. Rothstein said he \n     and his colleagues have studied the same parasite, the great \n     spotted cuckoo, in Israel where it leaves its eggs in crows' \n     nests. Doing similar experiments, they found no evidence of \n     mafia behavior.\n       But Dr. Arcese said that more and more researchers seemed \n     to be finding such geographical differences in the behavior \n     of these birds. One explanation is that since both the \n     parasites and their hosts are long-lived and can learn, these \n     complex behaviors may actually differ from place to place, \n     depending on what they have experienced.\n       At the same time, researchers say that both the great \n     spotted cuckoo and the cowbird are extending their ranges, \n     moving into new territory and encountering new birds. \n     Biologists say that with such changes going on, rather than \n     some studies being wrong, all may be right, with researchers \n     witnessing different stages in the ongoing skirmishes of the \n     evolutionary war between these parasites and their hosts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/15/senate-section/article/S17056-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RETIREMENT OF RICHARD EKSTRUM, SOUTH DAKOTA FARM BUREAU PRESIDENT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this week South Dakota Farm Bureau \npresident Richard Ekstrum will step down after 20 years of dedicated \nservice. During those two decades, his service to South Dakota and \nAmerican agriculture has been immeasurable. I have had the privilege of \nworking with Richard and the Farm Bureau for many years and have \nappreciated his invaluable advice and thoughtful discussions on farm \npolicies and the future of rural America.\n  Throughout his 10 consecutive terms as president of the South Dakota \nFarm Bureau, Richard has been an effective advocate and promoter of \nfree market policies for agriculture. Under his leadership, the South \nDakota Farm Bureau has more than doubled its membership, from 4,700 to \n10,000 members. He has donated over 100 days per year in service to \nFarm Bureau. His commitment to advancing the needs of rural America \ncannot be underestimated.\n  As a hog producer for 30 years Richard knows full well the rewards \nand challenges of American agriculture. During his tenure as president, \nagriculture has undergone tremendous changes. It is the mark of a true \nleader that he has effectively adapted to those changes and moved his \norganization forward. He understands the critical needs facing rural \ncommunities and the necessary steps we must take to ensure farmers and \nranchers remain on the land to produce the food and fiber for our \nNation.\n  Not only has Richard been a successful leader and farmer, but he also \nhas traveled the world as an ambassador for South Dakota and American \nfarmers and ranchers. I am sure the people of the many nations he has \nvisited in his 20 years as Farm Bureau president have been benefited \nfrom his experience and expertise.\n  The South Dakota Farm Bureau will dearly miss the leadership of \nRichard Ekstrum, as will I. There is no doubt in my mind that he will \ncontinue to be an active advocate for South Dakota agriculture. I wish \nhim all the best in his future endeavors and thank him for all his \nassistance over the years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/15/senate-section/article/S17059-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the skyrocketing Federal debt, now slightly \nin excess of $13 billion shy of $5 trillion, has been fueled for a \ngeneration by bureaucratic hot air--sort of like a hot air balloon \nspinning out of control--which everybody has talked about, but almost \nnobody even tried to fix. That attitude began to change however, \nimmediately after the November 1994 elections.\n  The 104th Congress promised to hold true to the Founding Fathers' \ndecree that the executive branch of the U.S. Government should never be \nable to spend a dime unless and until it had been authorized and \nappropriated by the U.S. Congress.\n  So, when the new 104th Congress convened this past January, the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives quickly approved a balanced budget amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution. On the Senate side, all but 1 of the 54 \nRepublican Senators supported the balanced budget amendment.\n  That was the good news. The bad news was that only 13 Democratic \nSenators supported it, and that killed the balanced budget amendment \nfor the time being. Since a two-thirds vote--67 Senators, if all \nSenators are present--is necessary to approve a constitutional \namendment, the proposed Senate amendment failed by one vote. There will \nbe another vote during the 104th Congress.\n  Here is today's bad debt boxscore:\n  As of the close of business Tuesday, November 14, the Federal debt--\ndown to the penny--stood at exactly $4,987,139,764,503.11 or $18,931.27 \non a per capita basis for every man, woman, and child.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/15/senate-section/article/S17059-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17059-S17060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  EPA/OSHA FINDINGS ON PASSIVE SMOKING\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the Congressional Research Service [CRS] \nreleased a long awaited report today that calls into question the \nvalidity of claims that passive smoking presents a risk to nonsmokers. \nIt also highlights questions on the validity of the science behind the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's [EPA] and subsequently the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA] findings on the \neffects of secondhand smoke. In 1993, the EPA released a report \nclassifying passive smoke a ``class A carcinogen.'' This EPA report has \nbeen the basis for numerous actions taken to limit smoking in public \nplaces with the most dramatic example being the OSHA proposed smoking \nban in all workplaces across the United States.\n  However, this CRS report, indicates well placed skepticism on the \nmethods used by OSHA to justify the need for such draconian and \ninvasive policies as the one espoused by this agency. CRS also \nquestions the very harm of second hand smoke. It found fault with the \nEPA's premise that there is no safe level of exposure to passive smoke, \nand the conclusions that OSHA drew from a limited number of studies, a \npractice which clearly undercuts the validity of the OSHA findings.\n  The report released today is but the latest in a series by different \nhigh level specialists at CRS. Every report has led to the same \nconclusion: There is no scientific justification for smoking bans or de \nfacto bans like the one issued by OSHA some months ago. In \n\n[[Page S17060]]\nprevious reports CRS stated unequivocally that, ``the epidemiological \nevidence for passive-smoking-related disease is weak.'' It has followed \nthis statement up with today's report which represents a comprehensive \nlook at this subject as well as an examination of purported risks for \nheart disease.\n  While many agenda driven researchers have picked and chosen from only \nthe studies that support their views, CRS, an agency which is \nunquestioned in its objectivity, has, during a lengthy 20 month review, \nrigorously examined all of the data on this controversial topic. Its \nconclusion is that the OSHA risk assessment as stated in its proposed \nrule is incorrect. While CRS is prohibited under its rules from issuing \nspecific policy recommendations, the evidence of the study is clear and \nbears repeating: There is no scientific justification for the current \nregulatory action being sought by OSHA.\n  The CRS study calls into question the very underpinnings that form \nthe basis of Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] and OSHA claims \nregarding the dangers of second hand smoke. EPA has claimed since the \nrelease of its much criticized report back in January 1993, that there \nis no safe level of exposure to ETS. However, CRS directly refutes this \nassertion. Furthermore, it finds that the only reasonable chance of \nrisk comes in extreme situations and even in those cases the findings \nare uncertain and in need of further research. This, in my view, is the \nscientific equivalent of the townspeople screaming out ``The emperor \nhas no clothes.''\n  In light of the seriousness of the findings of this study and the \nreputation of the organization that is so questioning OSHA actions, I \nam calling on OSHA to reopen its hearings on the proposed rule and to \nre-evaluate the justification for the rule in the first place. I \nrespectfully suggest to my colleagues that this historic study \nundermines the premise for all government coerced smoking bans.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for months, the Clinton administration \nand the Mexican Government have told Congress and the American people \nthat the President's $20 billion bailout of Mexico was a success. But \nthe administration and the Mexican Government have been concealing the \ntrue facts from the Congress and, more importantly, from the American \npeople. It is wrong and it is outrageous. Particularly in this time of \nbudget austerity when we are having such incredible battles over how to \nbalance the budget and deciding what programs will be cut. I think it \nis incredible at this point in our history that we are watching tens of \nbillions of dollars go down a sinkhole and do nothing about it.\n  For almost a year, I have warned that the Clinton bailout of Mexico \nwas doomed to failure. Over the last few weeks, it has become clear \nthat the President's Mexican mirage is evaporating. Truth, \nunfortunately, is not pleasant at times, so there are those who seek to \nlook the other way. But the truth is finally coming into focus.\n  The Clinton administration and the Mexican Government can no longer \nconceal the real facts. We know that record numbers of Mexicans are out \nof work, that Mexican interest rates are soaring and that Mexico is \nreeling under increasing social and political unrest.\n  Before the Mexican peso was devalued last December, it traded at 3.44 \nagainst the dollar. On December 22, after the devaluation, the peso was \ntrading at 4.8. Then it went up to 6, and then 7. Yesterday, the peso \nclosed at 7.81. That is a historic low closing rate. Never before has \nit closed at such a rate--7.81 pesos to the dollar. This morning, it \nopened at 7.9. That is shocking. That is unbelievable. The peso is in \nfree fall without Mexican Government intervention.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, let me suggest that the only people who are \nmaking money are the currency speculators. They know that the Mexican \ncentral bank will intervene, and so as the peso is devalued, as it \nbecomes worth less and approaches the 8 mark and 8.1 and 8.2, the money \nspeculators begin to buy it up because they know at some point the \ncentral bank will move in and they can sell for a handsome profit. They \nare making their profit, while the Mexican Government is chewing up \nbillions of dollars.\n  How much longer will we have to wait before we recognize that this \nprogram has been a failure? If the Mexican bailout was a success, would \ninterest rates have climbed from 20 percent to over 60 percent? That is \nexactly what has taken place during this period of time. No economy can \nsurvive such crushing interest rates--60 percent. Yet when the Mexican \nPresident came to the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury, \nindeed, the President of the United States, said that the proof that \nthe program was working was Mexico's ``pre-payment'' of some of their \ndebt. In reality Mexico flipped the $1.3 billion remainder of their \nloan, rolled it over, and could not pay it in spite of their so-called \nearly payment of $700 million.\n  Since February, the United States and the IMF have poured over $23 \nbillion into Mexico. The Mexican Government has used American taxpayer \ndollars to pay off private investors. The administration should not \ncontinue to throw good money after bad.\n  Last week, I offered a Sense-of-the-Senate resolution calling for the \npublic release of an important document, a document prepared by the \nInternational Monetary Fund. This report is known as the Whittome \nReport. The Whittome Report examined the International Monetary Fund's \nmonitoring and response to the Mexican peso crisis. According to news \naccounts, the IMF's own report concluded that the International \nMonetary Fund had distorted its reporting on Mexico to placate \npolitical pressure from the Mexican Government.\n  I suggest that the American people have a right to see that report. \nWhy is the Treasury Department hiding that report? Secretary Rubin has \nclassified it on ``national security'' grounds.\n  This report talks about the International Monetary Fund's failure. \nWhy should it be classified so that the American people cannot know \nwhat is taking place with money that we have invested with the IMF, \nwith money we have sent down to Mexico. It is American taxpayers' \ndollars. That report should be declassified.\n  The Treasury Department's classification on national security grounds \nis hokum. What nonsense. This report has been made available to 178 \nother countries that are members of the IMF.\n  So here we have a report that has been widely circulated and is being \nheld on the arbitrary, obviously sham, excuse that its release would \njeopardize national security. It is our taxpayers who are providing the \nbulk of the funding for this bailout package, a package which is \nfailing. This package is producing record unemployment in Mexico, \nrecord high interest rates, and has sent the peso to a record low. This \nbailout jeopardizes Americans' financial interests.\n  What do we have? We have secrecy from the Treasury Department \nclaiming that release of this report would jeopardize the security of \nour country, hiding under the pretext of national security grounds.\n  Mr. President, 178 countries, many of which may be allied against the \ninterests of the United States, have copies of this report, but the \nAmerican people do not. And this Senator is not permitted to disclose \nthe contents of that report? That is just simply wrong. It is obvious \nthat this administration is attempting to hide the debacle and the fact \nthat we should never have entered into this absolutely shameful \nrelationship.\n  What we see taking place today is the currency speculators making \nbillions of dollars of profit. Last evening, \n\n[[Page S17061]]\nthe Mexican central bank moved in to support the peso; otherwise, it \nwould have closed over 8. And I have to tell you, as long as they are \ngoing to continue to do this, the money speculators will ride that \nrollercoaster up and down. They will continue to make their fortunes.\n  We are not helping the Mexican people. We are not helping their \neconomy. We are not helping to create job stability. As a matter of \nfact, the programs that we have insisted upon are creating economic \nhardship for Mexico. It is just simply wrong, and it is unconscionable.\n  I do not believe that we should put one more U.S. dollar into this \nsinkhole. Let us use the money, if we have an opportunity to save that \n$7 billion-plus that has not already been wasted, to reduce the budget \ndeficit. Let us use it to fund programs that reasonable people may say, \nyes, we want to fund but we do not have sufficient money. If we are \ntalking about providing students with an opportunity to get a better \neducation, let us use the money for that program. If we are talking in \nterms of reducing the Medicare burden, then let us see to it that we \nmake that money available in that area. If we are talking about not \nhaving sufficient funds to carry out some of the needs because of \nbudget constraints in the Medicaid Program in years to come, let us use \nthat $7 billion-plus instead of putting good money after bad and making \nrich people and speculators richer at the expense of the taxpayers.\n  But let us not hide the truth. Why should the Secretary of the \nTreasury classify this report and keep it from the American people? I \nask the Secretary, ``What do you have to hide, Mr. Secretary?'' One \nhundred and seventy-eight foreign countries have this report. Some of \nthem put little, if any, money into the IMF, a pittance. The United \nStates of America and the taxpayers have poured in billions. And yet \nthis report is classified on so-called national security grounds? Mr. \nSecretary, you are telling the people they do not have a right to see \nwhat has taken place?\n  I have not read the report, and I have not read it for good reason, \nbecause otherwise I would probably want to come down on the floor of \nthe Senate and expose the sham that took place. We all know it is a \nsham that took place. The administration does not want people to see \nthat the IMF has mishandled and bungled what took place down in Mexico. \nIndeed, the program that we have imposed on the Mexican people not only \nrobs the American taxpayers, it will not help the Mexican people.\n  We continue blindly along as if the emperor had no clothes and we are \nafraid to say it. Somehow we are afraid, like the fable about the \nemperor having no clothes. It took some little boy to say what was \nwrong. Here they did not want us to have the facts because they do not \nwant people to begin to say, ``How could you continue this incredible \nfiasco?\"\n  Mr. President, let me end on this--the Congress of the United States \nis reluctant to pull the plug in terms of financing for Mexico because \nthey are justly afraid that President Clinton will turn around and say, \n``Aha, you are responsible for the failure of the Mexican rescue \nbailout package.'' That is exactly what would take place but that is \nwrong. President Clinton knows it and the American people know it too.\n  But there is no reason for this Congress not to insist at least that \nthe truth be made public. My colleagues, Senators and Congressmen \nshould be demanding the release of this Whittome Report. It should not \nbe left to Senator D'Amato. It should not be left to any one person. \nThis should be something that we want, that we demand. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution.\n  So, Mr. President, I am going to continue to call this to the \nattention of my colleagues in the Congress. They have a duty to step \nforward and say, ``Yes, we want this information. The Congress and the \nAmerican people are entitled to it and they should have it.'' For the \nSecretary of the Treasury to say on national security grounds he cannot \nmake this information available, is something that is absolutely, \ntotally unreasonable, and not sustainable.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/15/senate-section/article/S17060-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have spoken several times on this \nfloor, as have others, about disturbing trends in drug use in this \ncountry. Well, the latest bad news is out, having been delayed over 2 \nmonths by the administration. The new Drug Abuse Warning Network [DAWN] \nnumbers on hospital admissions for drug emergencies are in. And the \nstory that they have to tell is disturbing.\n  At least 500,000 Americans ended up in hospital emergency rooms in \n1994 in drug-related episodes. Cocaine-related incidents were up 15 \npercent over 1993, and a stunning 40 percent over 1988. Cocaine-related \nepisodes are the highest since DAWN surveys began. In part, this \nindicates the consequences for an aging addict population beginning to \nshow the signs of prolonged addiction.\n  But, with increases among teenagers in the use of hallucinogens, \nmarijuana, uppers, and downers, we are faced with increasing problems \nin a new generation of users, and storing up problems for the future.\n  Young people are simply not getting the message that drug use is both \nharmful and wrong. Since 1990, marijuana/hashish related episodes \nincreased by 155 percent. They increased 40 percent between 1993 and \n1994 alone.\n  When you combine these numbers with recent PRIDE, household survey, \nand high school survey figures on teenage use, the trend is \nunmistakable. And it is bad news. After years of decline, after years \nof young people foregoing drugs, we are seeing all the successes we had \nwiped out in a few short years as the message about the dangers of \ndrugs has been lost.\n  The mistake made by the present administration was to believe that \nthey could abandon the bully pulpit on this issue, refocus programs to \ntreatment, and not send a signal to the most at-risk population, our \nyoung people, that drug use was not so bad or dangerous. The mistake \nwas in telling people not to inhale instead of saying ``no.''\n  The mistake we seem determined to repeat, after our experiences of \nthe 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's, is that you should only have to do the \ncounter-drug effort once, like a small pox vaccination. Having done \nthis once, we can move on to more pressing issues.\n  Such thinking is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the \nrealities of drug use. The most at-risk population for starting use are \nour teenagers, beginning as early as 12 years old. Unless we declare a \nmoratorium on having children in this country, we will see a new crop \nof teenagers coming into schools and into contact with a drug culture \nevery year. And they are coming of age now in an environment in which \nour cultural elite are once again praising the virtues of drug use, \nfurther obscuring the message.\n  Just as we have to give new immunization shots to a new group of \nteenagers every year. Just as we have to teach a new class geometry, \nand algebra, and civic responsibilities--every year--we have to provide \nthe moral guidance and information to a new crop of kids that will \nprotect them from drug use.\n  We have to have the clear, unambiguous message from all sources that \ncan penetrate that teen sense of immortality that persuades them that \nnothing bad can happen to them simply because they are young. We need \nto sustain that message so that kids can learn that things they do \ntoday can have bad consequences years later. \n\n[[Page S17062]]\n\n  When we fail to get the word out repeatedly and pointedly, we put our \nyoung people at even greater risk. And it encourages those today who \nstill push the 1960's agenda that has destroyed so many promising \nlives. We cannot afford to do this. We have seen the consequences. And \nthe increases in cocaine and heroin hospital emergencies today are a \nlegacy of our foolishness yesterday. We cannot let this happen to our \ntomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in Washington, we are facing a crisis. \nIt is not just a crisis of a Government shutdown, but it is the crisis \nof what direction we shall go as a nation regarding a balanced budget.\n  It is my strongest opinion that the liberals are standing in the way \nof a balanced budget. I always tell high school audiences that they \nshould decide if they are liberal or conservative. If they are more \nliberal, they probably should join the liberal wing of the Democratic \nParty. If they are more conservative, they probably should join the \nRepublican Party.\n  Let us face it, there are two cultures clashing here. One is the \ntraditional liberal culture of big government; the other is the effort \nto have less government, lower taxes, less regulation, and the two \ncultures have clashed here in this balanced budget debate.\n  It has been my opinion that there has been shameless waste in many \nFederal Government spending programs--shameless waste. There has been \nwaste, fraud, and abuse, and the American people want our Federal \nGovernment to become more efficient. They want to take care of the \npoor, they want to take care of the Medicaid and Medicare people and, \nindeed, our budget does take care of them. We are a compassionate \npeople in that we certainly will not abandon the poor and the elderly. \nBut our people want us to be more efficient in the use of Federal \ndollars.\n  Working middle-class families have felt that they are left out of the \nsystem. A lot of families, or a lot of people, are what are called \nworking middle class. They do not get a lot of the tax breaks. They are \nrequired to pull the wagon, so to speak.\n  There is a revolt across the country of these working middle-class \nfamilies and their children, because they feel that if we do not move \ntoward a balanced budget, they will have to pay higher taxes and their \nchildren will have to pay higher taxes.\n  I tell all of the high school graduating classes that I talk to that \nthey will have to pay between 3 and 5 percent additional taxes all \ntheir lives because of the debt that this country has.\n  In my State of South Dakota, we primarily have working middle-class \npeople, and they are the ones who drive us to stick together to get \nthis budget passed that will bring us to a balanced budget in the year \n2002. I feel passionately that we must give the dream of America back \nto our children.\n  I feel that this budget is the most important single piece of \nlegislation, because if we fail, we will be continuing the same habits \nof deficit spending that has gotten us this huge debt. At some point, \nwe have to stop, and we have reached that point.\n  In my State of South Dakota, our field offices have received an \noverwhelming number of calls that indicate that our people want us to \ncontinue; our people do not want us to compromise the balanced-budget \nprinciple; our people want us to take the steps. So we have cast many \nof those difficult votes this year.\n\n  I hope our leadership does not compromise. I know that all parties \nare acting in what they believe to be the national interest. But I \nthink realistically and actually what is happening is that the liberal \ntraditional approach to Government is clashing with what came out of \nthe 1994 elections, and that is a fiscally conservative approach to \nGovernment. Those two forces are now clashing, and the working middle-\nclass families of America are watching to see if we have a resolve to \ncontinue to move toward a balanced budget by 2002. I urge our \nleadership to continue that effort.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski] is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, as you know, I am a Senator from \nMaryland, but I am a Senator not only from Maryland but I am a Senator \nfor Maryland. I represent a State that is the host agency to some of \nthe most important Federal agencies in the United States of America: \nThe National Institutes of Health, Goddard, the Federal Drug \nAdministration, Andrews Air Force Base, the home of the President's \nown; the U.S. Naval Academy.\n  I come to the Senate floor today to tell you I am absolutely opposed \nto the continuation of this Government shutdown. It is terrible for \nFederal employees, it is unfair to the taxpayers of the United States, \nit has a tremendous negative impact on the State of Maryland, and I \nbelieve it compromises America's public health and safety, and I think \nit threatens our American global reputation.\n  Today is the second day of the Federal Government shutdown. No end is \nin sight. We are in gridlock, we are in deadlock, and I think that that \nis a disgrace.\n  Now what is this fight all about? Presidential politics? Yes, but \nthis is a fight also about America's future, about our priorities, \nabout our values, what kind of Nation we are going to be, how do we \npreserve the economic security for senior citizens and provide economic \nopportunity for young people? That is what the national debate should \nbe all about, but we should not have to shut down the Federal \nGovernment to have a conversation about America's future.\n  That is why I absolutely support the effort of Senator Tom Daschle, a \nDemocrat, to call for a continuing resolution for at least 5 days to 5 \nweeks, a cooling-off period where there are no gimmicks, there are no \nriders, no blackmail, where the leadership of this Nation, Republican \nand Democrat, can sit down and negotiate really in not what is in a \npolitical party's interest, but what is in the national interest.\n  We must seek the sensible center. We must find an answer to balancing \nthe budget and balancing our priorities at the same time. That is what \nwe should be doing, but we should not be making pawns of Federal \nemployees.\n  Right now, 800,000 Federal employees were told that they were not \nessential and sent home. How demeaning. How demeaning to those \nscientists at NIH. How disgraceful to say that to the people at FDA who \nare trying to move pharmaceutical products to the marketplace that are \nsafe and effective. How demeaning to the caseworkers who take the calls \nfrom senior citizens applying for Social Security, and how disgraceful \nit is to those who work for the Veterans Administration, who may be \nveterans themselves--when the veterans call to apply for their \ndisability, they are going to get voice mail.\n  I have said to the Federal employees, ``I think you are essential. I \nwant you on the job and I want you working hard for the people of the \nUnited States.'' And to the taxpayers listening, I hope you call this \nan outrage. Get on the phone and tell us to pass a continuing \nresolution to put those Federal employees back to work. Your \nGovernment, American people, should be working as hard for you as you \nwork for your money.\n  I think to close down the Government is an absolute insult to the \ntaxpayers of the United States. We have people on furlough, we have \njobs that need to be done, and we are playing politics, we are playing \nthis kind of Mickey Mouse politics. We have to get out of the Disney \nWorld of Washington and stop acting like the Federal budget is some \naspect that we can play politics with.\n  Mr. President, I hope that this afternoon we give Senator Daschle the \n\n\n[[Page S17063]]\nchance to offer a continuing resolution, where the Federal Government \ncould be in operation for the next 3 days to the next 5 weeks. Let us \nreason together. Let us discuss these issues. Let us talk about the \ntimeframe for balancing the budget. Let us include our national \npriorities--economic security for the old, opportunity for the young--\nand let us reach out and not be on this side of the aisle or that side \nof the aisle. Let us go to that sensible center and put our national \ninterests first, put our Federal employees back to work. Let us give \nthe taxpayers a dollar's worth of Government service for a dollar's \nworth of their taxes. Then we can hold our heads up high and be proud \nthat we are U.S. Senators.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as we begin the second day of the Federal \nGovernment shutdown, I do want to note that like all Senators, I have \nread the polls that say more Americans are blaming the Republican \nCongress for the shutdown than are blaming President Clinton.\n  If you think leadership is all about taking polls--as the White House \ndoes--then I suppose you can take heart in these results.\n  But I happen to believe that leadership is more than just trying to \nmake everybody happy. It is about doing what is right for America and \nwhat is right for our children and grandchildren.\n  From the moment the votes giving Republicans their first \ncongressional majority were tallied last November, we knew we had a \nchoice.\n  We could either look to the next election, basically leave the status \nquo intact, and avoid taking any action that might be controversial or \nunpopular.\n  Or we could roll up our sleeves and do the hard work of giving the \nAmerican people the fundamental changes we have needed for so long.\n  That is the road on which we embarked. We knew the road would be \nbumpy. We knew there would be those who would urge us to detour to the \npath of least resistance.\n  But we also know that if we stay the course, then America will be a \nbetter place to live, work, and raise a family.\n  America will be better because our children and grandchildren will be \nfreed from the crushing burden of our national debt.\n  America will be better because the lower interest rates that will \nresult from a balanced budget will allow more of us to own a home, buy \na car, and take out a college loan.\n  America will be better because we will have saved Medicare from \nbankruptcy.\n  America will be better because we will have returned power to where \nit blongs--to our States, our cities, our neighborhoods, and our \npeople.\n  Madam President, I cannot say it any better than did Mr. Joe Ham of \nLawrenceville, GA, who sent me the following fax yesterday:\n\n       Senator Dole: I know the media and the White House will be \n     pouring on the propaganda, but for our kids' sake and the \n     sake of America, stand your ground.\n       As Mark Twain said, ``In the beginning of a change, the \n     patriot is a scarce man, brave and hated and scorned. When \n     his cause succeeds, however, the timid join him, for then it \n     costs nothing to be a patriot.\n\n  Let me just say to Mr. Ham that when I look at House and Senate \nRepublicans I see patriots, patriots who are willing to pay the price \nfor leadership, and who are willing to pay the price of making the \ntough choices today that will ensure a better tomorrow.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I appreciate very much the statement \njust made by the majority leader. What he has been hearing is the same \nthing that I have been hearing.\n  I think a lot of us, Madam President, have been distressed by reading \nsome of the polls that might imply that there is a deadlock, and \nsomehow the Republicans have something to do with it, when, in fact, we \nhave come up with a solution, the solution that was a part of the \nmandate of the election of 1994.\n  They told us in loud and clear terms as Republicans took control of \nboth the House and the Senate, that we are tired of business as usual, \nthat we do want less Government involved in our lives. We want to \nchange that trend that has existed since the 1960's.\n  I am very proud to announce here today that in our partly closed \noffices around the State of Oklahoma and here in Washington, that we \nhave been watching very closely as the calls come in. The calls have \ncome in, and the very first 6 hours after supposedly the Government \nshut down, 98 people called in and said that they thought the President \nwas right; but 611 people called in--almost an 8-1 ratio--and those 611 \npeople said ``Don't give in.''\n  We made ourselves clear in November of 1994: If the Republicans \ncannot do it, you know the Democrats will not do it. Do not cave in at \nthis time. We want a balanced budget.\n  The Republicans have offered a balanced budget. Every Democrat I know \nof has stood on this floor and said we all want balanced budgets, but \nwhen it gets right down to it, they really do not want balanced \nbudgets. They want business as usual.\n  We have offered a balanced budget. We have sent all this to the \nPresident. It is in the President's court now.\n  It is hard for me to understand what is going to happen. I encourage \nall of my Republican colleagues to listen to the loud and clear message \nthat we are getting from Oklahoma, a very wise State. That is, stay the \ncourse. The same as Mr. Ham said, who wrote to our majority leader, Bob \nDole, that he quoted a few minutes ago.\n  I have no intentions of caving in. This is the last opportunity we \nwill have to actually achieve a balanced budget in America. We are \ngoing to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/15/senate-section/article/S17063-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17063-S17064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRESS DID NOT DO THEIR WORK\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I think there are people watching this \ndebate who should put one thing in perspective: The Government is not \nbeing shut down because there is somehow an inability of the White \nHouse and the congressional leadership to agree on a 7-year budget \nplan. The fact of the matter is, it is being shut down because we have \nnot passed 13 appropriations bills.\n  Now, it is the responsibility--when we talk about whose \nresponsibility is involved, whether the President or the Congress --of \nthe congressional leadership to pass 13 appropriations bills by the end \nof the fiscal year.\n  These begin in the other body. I understand the Speaker of the House \nof Representatives has spoken with a great deal of accuracy of his \ncontrol over the House. The Speaker of the House of Representatives has \nspoken about his ability to move what he wants to move through the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  But the fact of the matter is there are only 3 of the 13 \nappropriations bills that have been signed into law.\n  We are shortly going to vote on a conference report as we already \nhave on one of the remaining 10 appropriations bills.\n  If the congressional leadership had passed and sent the President the \n13 appropriations bills as they are supposed to do, had they done that \nby the end of the fiscal year as they are supposed to do, and had the \nleadership done as they claimed they can with their new majority, to \nmove their agenda through, had they just done the people's business, \nthe business of all Americans--Republicans, Democrats, and \nindependents--had they passed the 13 appropriations bills, we would \nhave \n\n[[Page S17064]]\nno shutdown at all. There would be nothing to shut down. We would have \npassed the legislation.\n  Now, they have a majority of Republicans in the House. They have a \nmajority of Republicans in the Senate. They could very easily have \npassed and sent to the President for signature 13 appropriations bills. \nThirteen appropriations bills could have been signed into law, and \nthere would be no Government shutdown today.\n  Do not talk about this as being some kind of a case where our side \nand their side or the White House and the congressional leadership \ncannot meet agreement. If we, here in the Congress, had done the work \nwe are paid to do, hired to do, elected to do--that is, pass our bills \non time--everybody would be at work today. None of the stoppages would \nbe occurring. There would be none of the inconvenience and the tourists \nhere in the Capitol would be able to see something besides just us.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me bring the Senate up to date on \nthe status of the foreign operations appropriations bill. It has been \nsort of bouncing back and forth between the House and the Senate.\n  The conference report itself on foreign operations was passed by both \nHouses by very wide margins. It passed in the Senate 91 to 7. It passed \nin the House, 331 to 71.\n  This morning the House passed, once again, language offered by \nCongressman Smith, 237 to 183, which remains in disagreement with the \nSenate. So what we have extant is an amendment in disagreement. The \nconference report will not be needed--will not be needed to be voted on \nagain.\n  So what we have before us this afternoon, upon which there will be a \nmotion to table shortly, is the Smith language.\n  The Senate defeated this language 53 to 44 on November 1, and, \ncandidly, I expect the outcome of the vote we are about to have to be \nexactly the same. Let me repeat. The only item in disagreement is \namendment 115. That is the only item upon which we are called to vote \nin a few moments.\n  The underlying conference report, which we have already approved, \nenjoys strong bipartisan support. We fund a number of key national \npriorities including the Camp David accords, aid to the NIS, including \nArmenia and Ukraine. Also in this bill is an extension of the Middle \nEast Peace Facilitation Act.\n  So, again, let me say the conference report itself enjoys very \nstrong, overwhelming bipartisan support. The only item we have before \nus today is what is known as the Chris Smith language, on abortion.\n  My colleague, Senator Leahy may want to make a few comments and then \nI believe the chairman of the Appropriations Committee is going to make \na motion to table.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, very briefly, I am old enough to remember \ngoing to the movies when they would have a cartoon. They would have \nsort of a single line to follow the bouncing ball. Most of the other \nMembers here are not old enough to remember those cartoons. But in \neffect this bill has been like a bouncing ball going back and forth. \nThe distinguished chairman can correct me if I am wrong, but I believe \nwe had 193 items in disagreement in conference that lasted until after \nmidnight. We resolved 192. Both bodies have voted on those. It is time \nnow to realize that the last matter is at an impasse. Let us get the \nbasic bill passed and sent on to the President for his signature and \nallow this part, at least, of our foreign policy to go forward.\n  So I support the distinguished chairman in this. I see the \nsuperchairman, the overall chairman, on the floor. So I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, very shortly I am going to move to \ntable the underlying Senate amendment, amendment No. 115, which will \ntake with it both the original amendment by Senator Kassebaum and the \nHouse amendment by Congressmen Callahan and Smith.\n  Madam President, I need not talk further about the crisis that we all \nface today and of the need to resolve the crisis. I am taking a small \nstep to narrow the area of disagreement between the White House and the \nCongress.\n  But I want to make it very clear that I speak as a deeply committed, \nunadulterated pro-life person, and I have cast my votes on this Senate \nfloor scores of times on that issue. I ran a political campaign in my \nState for reelection when that issue was of paramount importance, and \nOregon is considered the most pro-choice State in the country.\n  So I want it clearly understood that, regardless of my personal \nviewpoint on this question, I have to look at the fact that we are \nlegislating on an appropriations bill, and we do so regularly.\n  We have three appropriations bills struggling with this issue of \nabortion. Not one of these amendments belongs on an appropriations \nbill. It violates the rules of the Senate. It violates the orderly \nlegislative process.\n  At the same time, this very issue and this form of the abortion \nquestion is already on the foreign relations reauthorization bill \nadopted by the House of Representatives, by the same authors, which \nwill be here for consideration by the full Senate. That is where the \nissue should be debated. That is where the issue should be worked out, \nnot on the foreign operations appropriation bill.\n  I realize that when you get into the position of trying to explain \nprocedure to the public, you are lost. But, nevertheless, this is a \nfundamental procedural question that we have to consider seriously. \nBear in mind we could have a vote on this--and I plan to ask for the \nyeas and nays--so that everyone will have an opportunity to express his \nor her viewpoint and to cast a vote. I hope that people vote on the \nprocedural question rather than on the abortion question.\n  That is probably wishing against all odds, but I do feel that even as \na pro-life person I will have to vote to table this amendment that was \nput on this appropriations bill. I have no desire to further encumber \nthe appropriations process and to further exacerbate the contention \nthat now exists between the White House and the Congress. We have to \ntake some small steps to bridge and to resolve that conflict, and I \nthink we ought to be about the business of resolving it rather than \nexacerbating the circumstances of conflict.\n  So we can pass this bill. If we will adopt this tabling motion, we \ncan pass this bill that has been approved by this \n\n[[Page S17065]]\nSenate before with 90-some votes. It has gone through the conference \nwith very little acrimony. So then we can get this bill down to the \nWhite House, and the President, as I understand, has signaled that he \nwill sign this appropriations bill.\n  We are going to get the Transportation bill down to the White House \ntoday. The President has indicated he will sign it. We have cleared up \nthe Treasury-Post Office problem in conference. The House will send \nthat over to us. I hope we can get it down tonight or early tomorrow. \nThe President will probably sign it. And then legislative. We can have \n7 of the 13 appropriations bills completed and signed by the President \nin the next 48 hours.\n  That is going to make the job of reconciling the so-called balanced \nbudget question--or sometimes referred to as the reconciliation, or the \ncontinuing resolution--and the debt ceiling; all these others that we \nmust act upon. I think this will help facilitate those other tasks that \nwe have.\n  So now I move to table the underlying Senate amendment, amendment No. \n115, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, when the Senate first considered the \namendment in disagreement, regarding abortion funding with foreign aid \nmoney, advance notice was given only to those who opposed the House \nposition. Today, no notice was given to anyone. It was I who urged a \nrollcall vote on the issue.\n  I urge Senators to support the House position. I heard it mentioned \nthat the Senate already has defeated this language, but that is just \nnot the case. The Senate has never voted directly on this provision and \nit won't today; previously, it voted on a Kassebaum provision which, in \nessence, gutted the House provision.\n  I have heard assertions that pro-life Members refuse to budge on \nvarious amendments or provisions. But, Senators should understand that \nthe House position has already changed substantially from its original \nposition in order to meet concerns of the Senate.\n  The original ``Mexico City'' language as passed by the House has been \nmodified to cover only foreign private and voluntary organizations. \nThis is an important distinction that Senators on the other side of the \naisle ignore.\n  Furthermore, the provision relating to the U.N. Population Program \n[UNFPA] was modified by the House in several ways. First, more time was \nprovided to UNFPA to terminate its operations in China, thus allowing \nit more flexibility. Second, the term ``motivate'' was redefined so as \nnot to prohibit family planning counseling.\n  The House has tried to accommodate Senate concerns. It is pro-\nabortion Senators who refuse to compromise. And I urge my colleagues to \noppose the tabling motion and thereby support the House position.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the vote begin at 10 \nminutes to 3.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I will not \nobject. So people understand, we are trying to coordinate the schedules \nof people on both sides of the aisle in doing that. I support the \nmotion to table. I support the unanimous consent request of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Reserving the right to object, can one assume that we \nwill have morning business between now and 10 of 3?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Maryland that we will be glad \nto divide the 10 minutes between now and 10 minutes to 3. He takes 5 \nand we take 5. Is that agreeable with the Senator from Maryland?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Who controls the time, Madam President?\n  Mr. LEAHY. If we have 5 minutes on this time and the Senator from \nKentucky has 5 minutes on that time, I yield my 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I am prompted to rise because of the \ncomments made by the chairman of the Appropriations Committee with \nrespect to passing appropriations bills and sending them to the \nPresident.\n  It is very important to understand how we find ourselves in this \noutrageous impasse with the Federal Government closing down and with \nthe ability of the United States to honor its debts cast in jeopardy. \nThe fact of the matter is that, as of this morning, only 3 of the 13 \nappropriations bills have been signed into law. Only four have been \nsent to the President. He vetoed the legislative appropriations bill, \nand that has come back to us, and it will have to be resubmitted.\n  I hear all of these protestations from my colleagues from across the \naisle. But the fact is they have not moved the appropriations process \nforward. Now they want to hold the President hostage and engage in \nlegislative terrorism. That is exactly what is happening here, and \n800,000 Federal employees are furloughed as a consequence of this \nterrorism. How are people who live from paycheck to paycheck going to \nmeet their mortgage payments or tuition payments for their kids who are \nin school?\n  A budget reconciliation package has not even been passed in the \nCongress. It is not even out of the conference committee. So the \nPresident has not had a chance to act on the budget. He has not had a \nchance to act on most of the appropriations bills--10 out of 13 as of \nlast night. A couple will be sent to him shortly--hopefully this one \nthat is now before us and a couple of others that we be considered \nshortly. So the fact is that the Congress has not done its work in \nsending the appropriations bills to the President for him either to \nsign or to return to the Congress with his veto.\n  What is underway is a tremendous coercive tactic to try to force the \nPresident to accede to the priorities that are being set by my \nRepublican colleagues with respect to the budget, and that essential \npriority that is contained therein is deep cuts in Medicare in order to \ngive tax breaks to wealthy people. That is essentially the driving \nforce behind the budget proposal of my Republican colleagues. Of \ncourse, the President has indicated he will not agree to that, and now \nthey are trying to use every tactic in the book in order to compel him \nto do so.\n  It is an outrage that they have closed down the Federal Government. \nClearly, what should have been done is we should have had short-term \nextensions of the appropriations measures and an extension of the debt \nceiling until the remainder of the appropriations bills and the \nreconciliation measure could be sent to the President. That was not \ndone, and the Republicans are now trying to coerce the President into \naccepting a set of priorities with which he does not agree.\n  I oppose that set of priorities and continue to do so. But I must say \nthat my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you are playing with \nfire. Standard & Poor's this week issued a strongly worded warning to \nthe Government saying the faith of investors has to some degree been \ndiminished by the threat of imminent default on its debt. I ask \nunanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am now quoting from the article: ``The unusual \nstatement by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the rating agency, said \nthat it was not reducing the United States' triple A credit rating, the \nhighest grade--and one granted to only about a dozen countries. But it \nclearly left open that possibility.''\n  And they went on later: ``The President of Standard & Poor's * * * \nsaid''--and this is a quote of his--``if this were any other country \nthan the United States that we were talking about, we would have put \nthem on credit watch.''\n  That is the fire that is being played with here.\n  Later, on their own credit line release, Standard & Poor's questioned \nthe Government's willingness to make timely debt service. I ask \nunanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks. \n\n[[Page S17066]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let me just quote:\n\n       Standard & Poor's triple A rating of the U.S. Government is \n     predicated on the dual components of the Government's \n     overwhelming capacity and unquestioned willingness to honor \n     its debt obligations. The U.S. Government's financial \n     capacity to meet its debt obligations remains a worldwide \n     standard based on the size and strength of the U.S. economy. \n     However, the current budget dispute between the President and \n     Congress has raised issues regarding the Government's \n     willingness to make timely debt service.\n\n  This is what is at risk regarding the game that is being played here. \nMost of the appropriations bills have not been sent to the President. \nOf the 13 appropriations bills, as of yesterday, only 4 had been sent \nto the President. He signed three of them. Now we are starting to send \nthe remaining appropriations bills to the President. And I approve of \nthat process. I hope we will get the bills down to the President.\n  Not only have the Republicans failed to pass the appropriations \nbills, but they have also failed to pass the reconciliation bill. The \nreconciliation measure is not even out of conference. The conference \nreport has not yet passed the House and Senate. It is not even out of \nconference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As one of the Federal employees who had been furloughed \nsaid in the morning paper, ``It is stupid.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. He said it is stupid. It is stupid. It is stupid, and \nit ought to stop. Mr. President, he is right.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 11, 1995]\n\n         S. & P. Strongly Warns Government of Threat of Default\n\n                          (By David E. Sanger)\n\n       Washington, November 10.--One of the world's leading \n     credit-rating agencies issued a strongly worded warning today \n     to the United States Government, saying that the faith of \n     investors ``has, to some degree, been diminished'' by the \n     threats of imminent default on its debt.\n       The unusual statement by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, \n     the rating agency, said that it was not reducing the United \n     States' triple-A credit rating, the highest grade--and one \n     granted to only about a dozen countries. But it clearly left \n     open that possibility if the country failed to meet any of \n     its payments on United States Treasury obligations because of \n     the budget impasse.\n       In an interview this evening, the president of Standard & \n     Poor's, Leo C. O'Neill, said that ``if this were any other \n     country than the U.S. that we were talking about, we would \n     have put them on credit watch,'' the formal warning the firm \n     issues when a government or company is at risk of having its \n     credit rating lowered.\n       Mr. O'Neill said that a committee within his firm debated \n     today's statement for nearly two days after it became clear \n     that Congress and the White House were headed toward a \n     showdown. While the warning, which was issued late in the \n     afternoon, itself may rattle the markets early next week, Mr. \n     O'Neill said that he thought it was important that Government \n     officials understand the implications of a default on the \n     country's solid gold credit rating.\n       He said that he fully expected that the United States would \n     make full payment on its debts. But the willingness of \n     American officials to talk about the possibility of default \n     has already done lasting harm to the United States' \n     international image as a country willing to pay back what it \n     borrows, he said.\n       ``Even if the issue is resolved in the 11th hour and 59th \n     minute, in some respects the damage has been done,'' Mr. \n     O'Neill said.\n       The growing uncertainty in Washington over the budget and \n     the prospect of shutting down the Government and defaulting \n     on the national debt is already rippling through Wall Street. \n     Bond prices fell and the broad stock market indexes slumped \n     as the Democratic White House and the Republican Senate \n     headed into the weekend playing an old fashioned game of \n     chicken. And the price of gold, a traditional haven in times \n     of uncertainty, surged $3.10, to $390.50.\n       The price of the 30-year bond fell as the yield, which \n     moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.33 percent. The \n     Dow Jones industrial average managed to inch 6.14 points \n     higher, to a record 4,870.37. But the S. & P. 500-stock index \n     slipped 0.54 point, to 592.72, and the broader Nasdaq index \n     fell almost 2 points.\n       For decades the United States has been the gold standard in \n     the world of investing. Long considered the safest of all \n     investments, Government debt is the yardstick by which the \n     risk of lending funds to other nations or corporations is \n     regularly measured. If Standard & Poor's lowered the \n     nation's rating the result would almost certainly be an \n     increase in interest rates, in order to attract investors \n     to take a marginally higher risk of not being paid back on \n     time. That, in turn, would affect a raft of other rates, \n     including variable-rate mortgages held by millions of \n     American homeowners. Those mortgages are usually based on \n     the interest rate of Treasury obligations.\n       Politically, the rating agency's action today plays into \n     the hands of President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Robert \n     E. Rubin. Both have warned that Congress was threatening \n     America's creditworthiness around the world by linking an \n     increase in the national debt limit to a number of other \n     Republican budget priorities. But many Republicans and some \n     on Wall Street have dismissed that view, contending that \n     investors see the current threats of default as a political \n     sideshow that has little to do with the United States' \n     ability to pay its debts.\n       It is still unlikely that the United States is heading for \n     default and any imminent action is doubtful. Mr. Rubin has \n     been extraordinarily cagey in recent days when asked how long \n     the United States can continue to meet its obligations \n     without increasing the $4.9 trillion ceiling on Federal \n     borrowing.\n       He has authority--which Congress is trying to strip away--\n     to draw on Federal trust funds that keep their money in \n     Treasury securities. That, in turn, would allow the United \n     States to borrow more to meet its operating expenses and to \n     repay investors. The first big hurdle comes on Wednesday, \n     when the Government must pay $25 billion in interest to \n     bondholders; another $44 billion is due the next day.\n       Standard & Poor's argued today that even without a default, \n     America's reputation among investors was hurting. ``Even \n     assuming a debt ceiling agreement is enacted in time to \n     forestall default,'' the firm said in its statement, ``the \n     global capital market's unquestioned faith in the United \n     States Government's willingness to honor its financial \n     obligations has, to some degree, been diminished by the \n     failure of the Government to act in a timely fashion. As a \n     result, the reduced level of market certainty may require \n     some time to overcome, well after the immediate fiscal \n     dispute is resolved.''\n       That wording almost exactly parallels warnings issued \n     recently by Mr. Rubin, who has said the United States will \n     pay for a default ``for years and years to come.''\n       Mr. O'Neill said that he had had no contact with Treasury \n     officials concerning his firm's rating of American debt, or \n     about today's statement. This is the first time Standard & \n     Poor's has issued such a warning. In past debt limit battles, \n     Mr. O'Neill said, ``we didn't really believe there was a real \n     threat of default; now, we are concerned that the debate \n     isn't being resolved.''\n       When Republicans and Democrats can bicker over who is at \n     fault, only Standard & Poor's and its competitor, Moody's \n     Investors Service Inc., have the power to issue ratings that \n     are followed by investors around the world. They are viewed \n     as politically neutral, interested only in the question of \n     risk, not the wisdom of various budget-cutting policies.\n       Moody's issued a less dire warning on Wednesday. It said \n     then that while the odds of a default were low, they were \n     already higher than in 1989, when the United States last \n     faced an impasse over the debt limit.\n       The effects on the United States Government of a lower \n     rating are clear: some institutions in the world will only \n     invest their funds in triple-A securities. But the effects \n     would also be much larger. Many cities and towns issue debt \n     that is linked to United States securities, and others offer \n     those securities as collateral. Standard and Poor's also \n     warned that ``a disruption in U.S. Government debt payments \n     also would have major implications for the liquidity of \n     various financial institutions, money market funds and \n     Government bond funds.''\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n         S Highlights Broad Implic of US Gvt Dbt Limit Debate\n\n       New York.--Standard & Poor's CreditWire 11/10/95--Standard \n     & Poor's, while maintaining its triple--``A'' rating on the \n     United States government, is increasingly concerned about the \n     global financial market ramifications of the current U.S. \n     budget impasse. Even a short-lived default on the U.S. \n     government's direct debt obligations would profoundly impact \n     a broad range of securities and financial market \n     participants.\n       Even assuming a debt ceiling agreement is enacted in time \n     to forestall default, the global capital market's \n     unquestioned faith in the United States government's \n     willingness to honor its financial obligations has, to some \n     degree, been diminished by the failure of the government to \n     act in a timely fashion. As a result, the reduced level of \n     market certainty may require some time to overcome, well \n     after the immediate fiscal dispute is resolved.\n       Standard & Poor's triple--``A'' rating of the U.S. \n     government is predicated on the dual components of the \n     government's overwhelming capacity and unquestioned \n     willingness to honor its debt obligations. The U.S. \n     government's financial capacity to meet its debt obligations \n     remains a worldwide standard based on the size and strength \n     of the U.S. economy. However, the current budget dispute \n     between the President and Congress has raised issues \n     regarding the government's willingness to make timely debt \n     service. Standard & Poor's continues to regard that \n     fundamental willingness as consistent with the highest credit \n     rating category, but in the midst of the current budget \n     struggle, the threat of delayed U.S. debt \n\n[[Page S17067]]\n     service payments has become a highly charged political tactic.\n       While the current debate in Washington has focused \n     substantially on the government's ability to honor its debt \n     obligations in the absence of an agreement to raise the \n     existing ceiling about $4.9 trillion, there are numerous, \n     ancillary debt issues that would also be negatively affected \n     by the failure to reach an agreement. Corollary credit \n     ramifications of a U.S. government default would affect; \n     corporate and municipal agency debt linked to U.S. \n     securities, pre-refunded municipal bonds amounting to $400 \n     billion, collateralized by U.S. obligations. A disruption of \n     U.S. government debt payments also would have major \n     implications for the liquidity of various financial \n     institutions, money-market funds, and government bonds funds.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator that the Senator \nfrom Kentucky controls the time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator from Kentucky yield me 5 minutes?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I have listened in the last several \nminutes to my colleague from Maryland talk about tactics that have \ncaused certain financial interests and indicators in this country to \nreact.\n  There is a clear tactic that has been played out here for the last \nseveral weeks by the Secretary of the Treasury saying that if we did \nnot do certain things, the Government will shut down. All the while he \nwas saying that to the American community of financial interests and to \nthis Congress, he knew and we knew that was nothing but a tactic. And \nyet he went on with the scare game that has been used and is currently \nbeing used.\n  I suggest, if there is a sense of irresponsibility, then the \nSecretary of the Treasury ought to know that suggesting something that \nis not real, and that is financial collapse of this Government if we \ndid not pass x pieces of legislation when he knew he had the capacity \nto keep our Government running and to honor its debt structure for the \nnext several months, is in fact the worst tactic of all.\n  Now the White House is suggesting that they will not deal with us to \nachieve a 7-year balanced budget under CBO figures. ``Nonstart, won't \ngo, can't go,'' says the President and his men, although the President \nhas suggested in a variety of ways that he could accept a balanced \nbudget in 5 years if we gave him a large tax increase. And he got the \ntax increase, and now it is 9 years and maybe 7 years, but he is not \nreally sure because he does not really know.\n  Here is what we know. We know that we are headed down the course of \nproducing a budget for this Government and this country that will \nbalance in 7 years, and that in balancing it in 7 years we will use CBO \nfigures because the President said in the Chamber of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives that they are the ones you can trust, the CBO, so we \nwill use those figures.\n  Beyond the rhetoric of a balanced budget and CBO, and concurrent \nresolutions and debt ceilings, what is the reality of what we are \ntrying to do? What is the impact on America? What will the American \nfamily achieve or receive as a result of our efforts? I suggest to you \nthat a temporary shutdown in the Government, while it may represent \nsome pain, is a short-term problem to a long-term solution. And that \nlong-term solution is achieving a balanced budget.\n  That is what we are after, and that is not what this President is \nafter because he is not really sure about where he can get and how he \ncan get there, but we are. We have worked to produce legislation that \nwill achieve just that.\n  Madam President, a $500 tax cut to 28 million American families \nraising 51 million children in this country and having the ability to \nprovide a better lifestyle to assure a college education, that is what \nour balanced budget is all about. I think it is very clear what we are \ntrying to achieve here--provide a more spendable income to create a \nbetter sense of being in this country.\n\n  Madam President, a 7-year balanced budget with the tax cuts that are \nproposed in this, they yield good things for America. Why not suggest \nthat the gross national product should grow by an additional $10.8 \nbillion by the year 2002? A new study just out by an econometric \nmodeling firm, one of the best in the country, indicates just that, if \nyou have a tax cut along with spending reductions of the kind that we \nput together into the mix--and that is what we are trying to do--you \nhave an additional $32.1 billion in real disposable income.\n  What happens when you put real disposable income out there in the \nhands of the American consumer and the American family? They buy homes, \nthey save for a college education, they buy a new car, they do all of \nthe kinds of things that we ought to be suggesting to the American \nfamily they are entitled to do. This President says, ``No. Let's stay \nwith the past, let's stay with spending, let's stay with the big \ngovernment that has proven itself incapable of dealing with the real \nneeds of America.''\n  That is what we are about here. That is the fundamental argument \nunderway. And I understand what my colleague from Maryland is \nsuggesting. Let me suggest that the long-term benefits of a balanced \nbudget, the kind this President wants to destroy, means real income for \nAmerica, and real opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, may we have order, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me describe where I believe we are \non the foreign operations bill as of this motion to table.\n  According to the Senate Parliamentarian, based on precedence, \nbeginning in 1898 and in subsequent votes as recently as 1984, either \nHouse has the option to recede on its amendment. Based on discussions \nwith the Parliamentarian, it is my understanding that by tabling \namendment No. 115, we have, in effect, receded our position on both the \nKassebaum language and the Chris Smith language leaving no further \namendments in disagreement. \n\n[[Page S17068]]\n This means no further action is required by the House on the foreign \noperations appropriations bill, unless it chooses to, and it can be \nenrolled by the House and sent to the President, again, if the House \nshould choose to take that route.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I hope we have completed our action on \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I concur with the analysis of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky. I point out, as I did earlier, the Senator from Kentucky \nand I went into this conference with 193 items in disagreement; we \nsettled 192, after a great deal of work, a lot of informal conferences, \nand a formal conference that went well after midnight. This was the \nonly item, and this is the only way to take care of it, frankly.\n  The Senate has spoken loudly and clearly on this, and it is a good \ncompromise between both bodies. Let us get off this subject. The issue \ncan come up on authorizations bills, where it belongs, not on \nappropriations bills, and we can go on with the business of the Senate.\n  The only way we are going to get out of the real budget problem we \nhave, when people are out of work and everything else, is to pass the \nappropriations bills. Here is another 1 of the 13 appropriations bills \nthat could go to the President. If he signed it, that would be 3 of the \n13 appropriations bills signed, with only 10 more to go, and we are out \nof this problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me say that, hopefully, within the next \nminute or two, we can call up another conference report--the Treasury, \nPostal Service appropriations bill. As I understand it, the Senate \npapers are on the way up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/15/senate-section/article/S17064-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17068-S17078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TREASURY, POSTAL SERVICE, AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                        1996--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on H.R. 2020 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2020) making appropriations for the Treasury Department, the \n     United States Postal Service, the Executive Office of the \n     President, and certain Independent Agencies, for the fiscal \n     year ending September 30, 1996, and for other purposes, \n     having met, after full and free conference, have agreed to \n     recommend and do recommend to their respective Houses this \n     report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of October 25, 1995.)\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me.\n  Mr. President, in a few moments it is my understanding, according to \nthe majority leader's request, that we are about to begin consideration \nof the conference report on the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. \nThat is my understanding. I think that will be coming to the Senate \nfloor in just a very few moments.\n  Mr. President, I want to remind my colleagues respectfully, \nnotwithstanding the fact that the Senate in a voice vote knocked out a \nprovision which was in the bill that came over from the House of \nRepresentatives, this provision has now been put back in during the \nconference between the House and Senate, and the final conference \nreport including this provision is going to be voted on in a few \nmoments by the Senate.\n  Here is what this provision does: For the first time--for the first \ntime--in the history of this great Republic, we are going to grant the \nauthority for the Internal Revenue Service to privatize tax \ncollections--for the first time.\n  There are no guidelines. There are no ethics rules. There are no laws \nor regulations that pertain to this at this point. But we are going to \nbe saying that we are going to put $13 million in for a pilot project \nto see how much law firms, lawyers, and private bill collectors can go \nout and collect from people who owe the Internal Revenue Service money.\n  This was tried a few years ago, as far back as the ancient Greeks. \nActually, this led, I might say, to this practice being labeled as \n``tax farming.'' These tax farmers, Mr. President, became so very \nunpopular that ultimately they were beheaded. There is a lot written \nabout this. There is a lot stated about this.\n  We are about to commit the act of not recognizing our history nor \nrealizing what this could do in the future of tax collections in this \ncountry.\n  I have been advised, Mr. President, by those with great experience in \nparliamentary procedure--certainly greater than myself--that it will be \nimpossible for this Senator or any other Senator to move that we \nrecommit the conference report with instructions to the conferees. The \nreason is that there is no conference--the conference has disbanded. \nThat is my understanding at this point. I hope I am wrong about that, \nbut I think I am correct.\n  Second, I then thought perhaps I would try something like a sense of \nthe Senate or perhaps some other avenue of approach so that we could \nstrike from this bill that particularly onerous provision that is going \nto send this country stepping toward tax farming and tax collections by \nthe private sector against our own citizens.\n  Mr. President, I have been advised that there is nothing that I can \ndo at this moment to strike that provision, with the exception of just \ntrying to talk about it and wait for another provision in another piece \nof legislation subsequent to this at the appropriate time.\n  In a moment, I will continue this discussion. I will continue talking \nabout why I think this is a very, very bad step, a dangerous step, a \nprecedent-setting step, wading off into an area where we have no \nguidelines, no ethics protection, no protection for confidentiality to \nprotect the taxpayers, something that I hope at the appropriate time we \ncan strike from this particular piece of legislation.\n  I thank the Chair for recognizing me. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President I want to take 1 minute to thank both the \nmanagers of the bill, Senator Shelby and Senator Kerrey.\n  I often am critical of appropriations bills that come to the floor \nbecause of unnecessary and wasteful spending that is associated with \nit. I want to say that I have reviewed this bill, and with a very rare \nexception, this bill is clean of wasteful and unauthorized programs.\n  I think it is probably the best piece of legislation in the \nappropriation cycle that I have seen. I want to express my appreciation \nto both Senator Kerrey and Senator Shelby for resisting what seems to \nbe irresistible on the part of some members of the Appropriations \nCommittee, and that is loading it up with unauthorized projects and \nother special interest programs.\n  I want to again thank him for an outstanding piece of legislation. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I see Senator Shelby is not here, and I \nassumed we were not ready to start in on this bill. I thought I might \nmake a few remarks pending his arrival.\n  Mr. KERREY. I would like to begin. I know Senator Shelby will be down \nhere shortly.\n  How long will the Senator speak?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. You never know when I get wound up.\n  Mr. KERREY. I am aware of that. The Senator from Alabama is coming to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Is there a time agreement on the bill?\n  Mr. KERREY. I believe they are going to try to set the time for the \nvote at 5 o'clock, and I doubt that Senator Shelby and I are going to \ntake a great deal of time in opening statements.\n\n[[Page S17069]]\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Fine. I will wait until then or at some hiatus in the \nbill to speak, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today with my distinguished ranking \nmember, Senator Kerry, I bring to the Senate the conference report for \nH.R. 2020, the fiscal year 1996 appropriations for the Department of \nthe Treasury, the U.S. Postal Service, the Executive Office of the \nPresident, and certain independent agencies.\n  The conference report we are presenting today contains total funding \nof $23,161,490. This bill is $339,457,000 below the appropriations \nprovided in fiscal year 1995. It is $15,797,000 below the House-passed \nbill and $1,735,000,000 below the President's request.\n  Of the totals in this bill the conference is recommending \n$11,263,514,000 for new discretionary spending. The balance, \n$11,889,400,000 is for mandatory programs.\n  The $11,263,514,000 the committee proposes for domestic discretionary \nprograms is almost $1.8 billion below the President's request. Let me \nrepeat that, Mr. President. This bill is nearly $1.8 billion below the \nPresident's fiscal year 1996 request. It is also $340 million below the \namount appropriated for the accounts funded in this bill in fiscal year \n1995.\n  Reaching this level has not been an easy task. We have had to make \nsome very difficult decisions, while trying to ensure that funds are \nmade available to carry out essential Government services.\n  Mr. President, this bill includes $10,303,999,000 for the Department \nof the Treasury.\n  The conference report includes $121,908,000 for payment to the Postal \nService fund for free mail for the blind, overseas voting, and payment \nto the Department of Labor for disability costs incurred by the old \nPost Office Department.\n  The President receives $156,844,000 to exercise the duties and \nresponsibilities of the Executive Office of the President.\n  This conference report contains $7.5 million for the operations of \nthe Office of National Drug Control Policy. The fact that we have \nincluded funding for the drug czar's office does not mean I am \nsatisfied with the current drug policy of this administration. I have \nmade my feelings on the ineffectiveness of this office known before. I \nwill not take the time of my colleagues to restate it again today. I do \nwant to reiterate that the committee will revisit funding for ONDCP in \n1996. I certainly hope we will see some changes.\n  This bill includes $545,002,000 for construction of new courthouses \nand Federal facilities. This funding provides the General Services \nAdministration the ability to let construction contracts for buildings \nwhich construction can begin in fiscal year 1996. There is no funding \nfor projects where no construction awards can be made in fiscal year \n1996.\n  There is $11.8 billion in mandatory payments through the Office of \nPersonnel Management for annuitant and employee health, disability and \nretirement, and life insurance benefits.\n  There is approximately $375 million for other independent agencies.\n  Mr. President, this bill proposes to terminate the Advisory \nCommission on Intergovernmental Relations and the Administrative \nConference of the United States. Funds are provided for ACIR to \ncomplete the unfunded mandates study, and provide for the orderly \nclosedown of the two agencies.\n  Mr. President, this subcommittee continues to be a strong supporter \nof law enforcement. We have done what we can to ensure that the law \nenforcement agencies funded in this bill have the resources to do the \njob we ask them to do.\n  There has been considerable discussion since this bill was reported \nfrom the subcommittee about the level of funding for the Internal \nRevenue Service. The level of discussion continued through the \nconference. The conference report exceeds the bill passed by the Senate \nby $31 million. The Senate conferees worked with the conferees from the \nother body to do what we could to resolve the differences between the \ntwo Houses to balance processing and enforcement, while continuing tax \nsystems modernization efforts.\n  Mr. President, let me be perfectly clear on this. As I said when the \nSenate first deliberated this bill, that the committee's options were \nlimited. Many may disagree with the choices we have made, but we had to \nwork with limited resources. Funding for the IRS makes up 65 percent of \nthe discretionary spending in this bill. There is no other way to reach \nsavings called for in our 602(b) allocation.\n  Mr. President, this bill, as we all know has been held up because of \ndiscussions on the legislative language popularly called the Istook \namendment. The amendment in disagreement is language offered by Senator \nSimpson, which I support. The other body insisted that the Senate \nrecede from its position in amendment No. 132. Senator Simpson, the \nsponsor of this amendment, has indicated that he will support the \nmotion to recede on this amendment so we can send this bill to the \nPresident. I personally want to thank Senators Simpson and Craig for \nall of their hard work on this issue.\n  I yield to Senator Kerrey, the subcommittee's ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. First let me \ncongratulate the Senator from Alabama for doing an exceptional job of \nchairing this subcommittee and working through the various amendments \nand problems that he has faced, along with Chairman Lightfoot on the \nHouse side, in making certain we can deliver a bill to the President.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that John \nLibonati, legislative fellow with the Appropriations Committee, be \ngranted the privilege of the floor throughout the consideration of the \nconference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the subcommittee \nchairman, Senator Shelby, in bringing this conference report to the \nfloor.\n  As the chairman pointed out, this conference report is substantially \nbelow the requested and enacted levels for the many programs and \nactivities under the jurisdiction of the Treasury Department, the \nExecutive Office of the President, and certain independent agencies.\n  Having said that, I want to take this opportunity to compliment the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby, and the House \nsubcommittee chairman, Mr. Lightfoot, for the bipartisan spirit they \nboth displayed during the conference to craft a conference agreement \nwhich, under the most severe budgetary constraints, meets the highest \npriorities of both the executive branch and the Congress.\n  The conference report contains funding for the continuation of the \nCouncil of Economic Advisers, which the House had proposed to \neliminate, and does not include many of the controversial legislative \nriders which would most assuredly open this bill to a Presidential \nveto.\n  This conference report funds Federal programs where a compelling case \nhas been made for their continued existence. And, in the case of two \nagencies, the Administrative Conference of the United States and the \nAdvisory Commission on Intergovernment Relations, it provides only \nlimited funding for the orderly close out of their operations.\n  While most programs have been reduced below enacted levels, the \nconference agreement does contain modest increases for Treasury law \nenforcement agencies to permit them to sustain current levels of \nvigilance in the war on drugs, violent and financial crimes \ninvestigations, counterterrorism, Presidential protection, White House \nsecurity, and law enforcement training.\n  Funding for new Federal building and courthouse construction has been \nfunded at the Senate-passed level of $573 million, or $415 million \nbelow the requested level. In addition, the Senate criteria on Federal \nbuilding construction were adopted by the conferees. These criteria \nprovide full funding for GSA's highest priority projects, which have \nreceived site or design funds in the past; but do not permit the \nfunding of new starts or projects where the construction contract \nawards will not be awarded in fiscal year 1996.\n  I believe this is a sound approach. We are funding buildings at \nlevels that will \n\n[[Page S17070]]\npermit GSA to complete the projects. We did not go along with the House \nproposal to provide 40-percent funding for these projects. That \napproach will only prolong these projects and will not enable GSA to \nlet any contracts in fiscal year 1996.\n\n  Mr. President, having said that, I do not support all of the actions \ntaken by the conference committee. I am particularly concerned that the \nSenate provision fencing IRS tax systems modernization funds until GAO \ncertifies that certain corrections in the management of the program \nhave been made, was dropped.\n  Mr. President, to date, $2.5 billion has been invested in this \nprogram to modernize IRS' outdated computer systems. The conference \nagreement contains an additional $695 million toward this effort. When \nall is said and done, this program could cost the taxpayers upward of \n$8 billion. This is a hefty sum of money, particularly in these \nbudgetary times, for a program which according to GAO is fraught with \nmismanagement and infrastructure problems. There is no doubt that the \nTSM concept should revolutionize the IRS. However, the way the agency \nis progressing on its implementation at this juncture, at some point in \nthe future, we could find us regretting this substantial investment.\n  Mr. President, I am also concerned about the reduced funding level \nfor the IRS returns processing and taxpayer assistance account. The \nconference agreement cuts $81 million from the President's requested \nlevel for IRS' front-line returns processing and taxpayer assistance \nactivities. The IRS estimates that it will process about 211 million \nreturns and supplemental documents and will issue about 83 million tax \nrefunds in fiscal year 1996. This is an increase of about 3 million \nreturns and documents and 2 million refunds above the 1995 level. I \njust hope, Mr. President, that as a result of these reductions, refunds \nare not delayed and taxpayer questions do not go unanswered because we \nhave not provided the agency with the funds it needs to operate at \nincreased service levels.\n  I am pleased that the final agreement includes a provision which I \noffered on the Senate bill to establish a Commission on the \nRestructuring of the Internal Revenue Service. I am hopeful, that \nthrough the work of this Commission, we will come up with some workable \nsolutions to make the IRS a more customer-oriented organization, which \nwill be the Nation's leading revenue producer while operating more \neconomically and efficiently.\n  Mr. President, depending on what happens to the amendment in \ndisagreement, amendment No. 132, I believe this bill will be signed by \nthe President. This bill was passed by the Senate on August 5, the \nconferees met September 12 and was it not for the controversial Istook-\nMcIntosh-Erlich provision, this bill could have been sent to the \nPresident and I believe signed prior to the close of the fiscal year.\n  Unfortunately, we are now past that date, our agencies have been \noperating at reduced funding levels through two continuing resolutions, \nand now most of the agencies funded in this bill are in the shutdown \nphase. I believe we have an opportunity here to get this bill to the \nPresident without further delay. We have an obligation to the American \npublic to get the job done and ensure that important tax, financial \nmanagement, law enforcement, and Federal building programs move \nforward.\n  So, I would urge my colleagues to support this conference report and \nput an end to the gridlock. I urge the adoption of the conference \nreport.\n  Let me comment on a couple of things. I suppose I am not unique. I \nimagine all of us are getting questions from home as to why we were \nunable to pass appropriations bills, why do we have the furloughing of \nFederal employees, and why have we essentially shut down parts of the \nGovernment. There are 200,000 Federal employees who have been \nfurloughed for 2 days as a consequence of this particular \nappropriations bill.\n  The Senator from Alabama referenced it. There were 141 amendments on \nthis legislation that were subject to the conference of this \nsubcommittee--141.\n  The chairman called a conference, he and Chairman Lightfoot. We met \non the 12th and 13th of September, a full 2 weeks before we were \nsupposed to finish our work. According to the Budget Impoundment Act, \nwe had to have that work done by the 30th of September.\n  On the 12th and 13th, the chairman was successful in disposing of 140 \nof 141 amendments. As he indicated, the only one that remained was the \nso-called Istook amendment, which appeared in neither version of the \nbill and which, regardless of your position on the issue, had no \nrelevance to this appropriation bill, and which had a little or no \nsupport in the Senate, and delayed the final House and Senate action on \nthis conference report.\n\n  I mention it because there is a kind of a common perception--I think \nit is common--that there are significant differences between \nRepublicans and Democrats on all these appropriations items, and that \nis why the Government was shut down.\n  I agree with Senator Shelby on this piece of legislation. I am \nprepared to vote for it. Both of us wanted to move this thing out \nbefore the 30th of September, and it could have been not nearly as \ndifficult as it might appear to the average citizen out there that is \nwondering what has gone on in the past couple of days--200,000 Federal \nemployees being furloughed in the last 2 days. Again, not because of \ngreat ideological differences on spending, not because Democrats and \nRepublicans disagreed that we need to get rid of the deficit that has \nbeen, I think, tormenting the Nation for many, many years, but because \nof a single amendment having to do with the regulation of 501(c)(3)'s \nand 501(c)(4)'s.\n  Mr. President, I, too, appreciate the willingness of the Senator from \nWyoming to allow us to recede to the House. I supported the original \nSimpson proposal, and appreciate very much his willingness to recede to \nthe House in this particular case so we can move this to the President \nfor his signature and end the furloughing of 200,000 Federal employees \nwho are covered by this legislation.\n  Let me also comment. The distinguished chairman mentioned his concern \nabout the drug czar. I share that concern. I have a great deal of \nrespect for Dr. Brown. It is not as if I am critical of him as an \nindividual but the number one problem that we face with drugs today is \nthe illegal consumption of drugs by young people 12, 13, and 14 years \nof age. Those who have made it either their living or their avocation \ntrying to help us reduce drug consumption in America will say to us \nthat the most important thing is to reduce the size of the funnel of \npeople that are coming on line using illegal drugs. That means we have \nto get to young people and say to them that you should not use these \nillegal and dangerous drugs.\n  I remember when former First Lady Nancy Reagan started the Just Say \nNo Program. And I thought, well, this is a silly program. It cannot \npossibly work. The fact is it did work. The fact is that young people \nsee the consumption and the use of illegal drugs in black or white \nmaterials. It is either yes or no. If we as adults do not say no to \nthem, they are likely to say, ``Well, maybe it is OK.''\n  Over the past 4 or 5 years, according to those like Jim Burke who \nhave been involved in this effort in the private sector, there has been \nan increase of exposure to the youth of illegal drugs, either on \ntelevision shows or in movies. This has been creeping in again to our \nculture--sort of an acceptance that perhaps marijuana use is OK, or \nthat perhaps cocaine use is OK.\n  So this idea that our leaders say to our youth do not do drugs, say \nno to drugs, this idea that can have a very powerful impact on our \nyouth, to me, has sunken in rather impressively after listening to \npeople out there in the private sector. I have been quite discouraged \nin looking at the drug czar who has legal authority to take action and \nhas failed to either use that legal authority or to make much progress \nin the war on drugs.\n  So I join with the Senator from Alabama. We initially were going to \nzero out the drug czar. We entered into a negotiation here on the \nfloor, and when the bill was first being considered by the Senate and \ntalked to the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, and they convinced us to \naccept some language \n\n[[Page S17071]]\nthat would urge the President to take stronger leadership. I personally \nam pleased to see that the President has announced that in January he \nis going to begin communicating. He is organizing a conference of \nyouth.\n  I think it is terribly important that our political leaders put that \nmessage out there, and that we start doing it repeatedly in order to \nreduce the size of the funnel of the number of people that are coming \nin and beginning to use illegal drugs.\n  To say for emphasis, I am also with the chairman. The verdict is \nstill out as far as I am concerned. I was willing to yield on this \npoint, willing to give him a little bit more rope to try to see if they \ncould be effective. But the bottom line for me is, if it is not \neffective, I will be back here next year suggesting that this Senate \nvote to zero out the drug czar. Get the job done or let us find some \nother organization or somebody else that can do it. Let us not pretend \nthat we are solving the problem if the problem in fact is getting \nworse.\n  Again, I say in closing that I appreciate very much the fine work \nSenator Shelby has done on this bill. I hope that in an expeditious \nfashion we can get this down to the President for his signature.\n\n\n   proposed privatization of investigative services by the office of \n                          personnel management\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a brief \ndiscussion with the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee to \nclarify a matter regarding the proposed privatization of Investigative \nServices by the Office of Personnel Management.\n  It is my understanding that the House and Senate have directed the \nGeneral Accounting Office to perform a detailed, long-term, cost-\nbenefit and feasibility analysis on the OPM submissions for an Employee \nStock Ownership Plan [ESOP] for the Investigative Services under OPM's \njurisdiction.\n  Is it the intent of the conferees that OPM must retain full staffing \nat the Federal Investigative Processing Center [FIPC] in Boyers, PA, \nand that OPM may not proceed with the privatization of Investigative \nServices before receipt of the GAO report and in no event before March \n30, 1996?\n  Mr. SHELBY. The Senator is correct. The committee has received the \nassurance of OPM that full staffing will be retained at the FIPC in \nBoyers with the recognition that many of the employees will be \nconverted from the Federal payroll to the employee stock ownership \nplan.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator for clarifying the intent of the \nconferees. This is an issue of great importance to several hundred \nPennsylvania OPM employees and I appreciate the assistance of the \ndistinguished chairman and his commitment to ensure that their \ninterests and those of every taxpayer are best served. I thank the \nChair and yield the floor.\n\n\n                           fresno courthouse\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nchairman of the subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General \nGovernment Appropriations, Senator Shelby, and the ranking minority \nmember, Senator Kerrey, if they would engage in a brief colloquy with \nmyself and my colleague from California, Senator Boxer.\n  Mr. SHELBY. We would be happy to do so.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. We want to bring to the attention of the managers the \nneed for a new courthouse in Fresno. The current U.S. courthouse in \nFresno is at its full capacity and would require extensive \nmodifications to meet seismic, fire and security standards.\n  The current courthouse, the B.F. Sisk Building, opened in 1968 as an \noffice building with only two courtrooms and a small amount of support \nspace designated for the courts. Now, the court and related support \nagencies occupy 92 percent of the building with additional space being \nleased on the outside. There are currently four district, two \nmagistrate and two bankruptcy courtrooms in the building, which is used \nby two district judges, two senior district judges, one visiting judge \nfrom Sacramento, two bankruptcy judges, two magistrate judges and \nvisiting magistrate judge. Within the next year, there will be an \nadditional senior judge. Five of the current courtrooms have been built \nout in previous office space. There is no room for future expansion.\n  A recent seismic evaluation on the current building found that the \ncost of seismic retrofitting would be more than the cost of the \nbuilding. Also, serious concerns have been raised about the safety and \nsecurity standards in the building relating to its use as a court \nfacility.\n  Given the current situation and projected future growth, the city has \nbeen working with the courts, the General Services Administration [GSA] \nand the subcommittee to obtain funding for a new structure for the past \nfew years. However, I understand that due to budget constraints, there \nis no funding provided for new start courthouse projects, including the \nFresno project, in the conference report for the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1996.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President I share my colleague's concern over the \nsafety and lack of security of this facility. The chief judge for the \nEastern District of California, the Honorable Robert E. Coyle, has \ninformed me that ``the efficient, uninterrupted, safe and secure \noperation of the present courthouse cannot be carried out'' in the \ncurrent building.\n  I also want to make my colleagues aware of actions taken in Fresno \npursuant to direction from this subcommittee last year. Senator \nFeinstein and I commend the city and GSA's work to develop a site for \nthe proposed courthouse in downtown Fresno. As the senator may know, \nthe fiscal year 1995 Treasury-Postal appropriations conference report \nacknowledged the beginning of the site selection process for a Federal \ncourthouse in Fresno and directed GSA to locate a site in downtown \nFresno for the project. To this end, the city has donated a site in \ndowntown Fresno and is presently purchasing parcels to add to the city-\nowned property for that purpose. Also, the city has agreed to complete \nall site and utility preparation work prior to construction will \nfurther, will build parking for the courthouse to accommodate nearly \n400 spaces.\n  This agreement will save $5 million off the estimated Federal cost \nfor site acquisition.\n  It is important to recognize the importance of this project to the \ncity of Fresno. GSA and the courts have worked closely with the city \nfor the purpose of redeveloping a truly troubled downtown area. It \nwould also appear from recent experience that the competitive bidding \nprocess in California is ripe for construction. In both Santa Ana and \nSacramento, the bids came in considerable lower than the anticipated \nbudget. However, one can only assume that delay in this project will \nonly cause the cost to escalate.\n  We would like to urge the chairman and ranking member, in light of \nthe partnership between the city of Fresno and the judicial \nadministration in complying with the committee's directive to reduce \nFederal spending, to make this project a high priority next year. We \nask whether you will give the project your highest consideration.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Yes. The subcommittee will carefully review this project \nin our deliberations next year for court construction for fiscal year \n1997.\n  Mr. KERREY. I appreciate the words from my colleagues from California \nand I also want to express my congratulations for the agreement the \ncourt and GSA was able to work out with the city of Fresno. The Senator \ncan be assured that I will do my part to see that this project receives \nserious consideration in subcommittee deliberations next year.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. We thank the chairman and ranking member for their \nunderstanding and thoughtful responses.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nconference agreement on H.R. 2020, the Treasury, Postal Service, and \ngeneral Government appropriations bill for 1996.\n  This bill provides new budget authority of $23 billion and new \noutlays of $20 billion to finance operations of the Department of the \nTreasury, including the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Customs Service, \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the Financial Management \nService; as well as the Executive Office of the President, the Office \nof Personnel Management, and other agencies that perform central \ngovernment functions. \n\n[[Page S17072]]\n\n  I congratulate the chairman and ranking member for producing a bill \nthat is within the subcommittee's 602(b) allocation. When outlays from \nprior-year budget authority and other adjustments are taken into \naccount, the bill totals $22.8 billion in budget authority and $23.1 \nbillion in outlays. The total bill is at the Senate subcommittee's \n602(b) nondefense allocation for budget authority and under its \nallocation for outlays by $67 million. The subcommittee is also under \nits Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund allocation by $1 million in \nbudget authority and less than $500,000 in outlays.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous to have printed in the Record a table \ndisplaying the Budget Committee scoring of the conference agreement on \nH.R. 2020.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     TREASURY-POSTAL SUBCOMMITTEE SPENDING TOTALS--CONFERENCE REPORT    \n             [For fiscal year 1996, in millions of dollars]             \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       Budget           \n                                                     authority   Outlays\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed.......................................  .........     2,778\n  H.R. 2020, conference report.....................     11,187     8,712\n  Scorekeeping adjustment..........................  .........  ........\n                                                    --------------------\n      Subtotal nondefense discretionary............     11,187    11,490\n                                                    ====================\nViolent crime reduction trust fund:                                     \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed.......................................  .........         8\n  H.R. 2020, conference report.....................         77        62\n  Scorekeeping adjustment..........................  .........  ........\n                                                    --------------------\n      Subtotal violent crime reduction trust fund..         77        70\n                                                    ====================\nMandatory:                                                              \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed.......................................        127       130\n  H.R. 2020, conference report.....................     11,763    11,756\n  Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                         \n   Budget Resolution assumptions...................       -334      -333\n                                                    --------------------\n      Subtotal mandatory...........................     11,555    11,553\n                                                    ====================\n      Adjusted bill total..........................     22,819    23,113\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n  Defense discretionary............................  .........  ........\n  Nondefense discretionary.........................     11,187    11,557\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund...............         78        70\n  Mandatory........................................     11,555    11,553\n      Total allocation.............................     22,820    23,180\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate Subcommittee                     \n 602(b) allocation:                                                     \n  Defense discretionary............................  .........  ........\n  Nondefense discretionary.........................  .........       -67\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund...............         -1        -0\n  Mandatory........................................  .........  ........\n      Total allocation.............................         -1       -67\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I was an early supporter of the taxpayer \nbill of rights which was enacted in 1988. That legislation protected \nthe American taxpayer from overreaching actions by the IRS. This year, \nthe Finance Committee included a number of additional provisions in the \ntax bill to protect the taxpayer.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report for Treasury and Postal \nappropriations upon which we will vote today contains language taking \nus in the opposite direction. The report provides for an appropriation \nof $13 million to the IRS to ``initiate a program to utilized private \ncounsel law firms and debt collection agencies in the collection \nactivities of the IRS.''\n  Mr. President, most bill collectors are paid on a contingency basis. \nWe are in danger of creating a system that will encourage bounty \nhunters to collect taxes from U.S. citizens.\n  Margaret Milner Richardson, the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue \nService, in a letter dated August 4, 1995, expressed ``grave \nreservations'' with respect to privatizing the tax collection services \nof the IRS. To quote Ms. Richardson:\n\n       What impact would private debt collection have on the \n     public's perception of the fairness of tax administration and \n     of the security of the financial information provided to the \n     IRS? A recent study conducted by Anderson Consulting revealed \n     that 59 percent of Americans oppose State tax agencies \n     contracting with private companies to administer and collect \n     taxes.\n\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I believe that the 59 percent number would \nhave increased dramatically had the survey inquired as to whether the \nIRS should contract with debt collection agencies to collect Federal \nincome taxes.\n  We are told by supporters of the proposal that we should not worry \nbecause the debt collectors will be under the direct supervision of IRS \nemployees. I do worry Mr. President, because we have too many instances \nin which IRS employees themselves have abused their powers. This is why \nwe enacted the 1988 taxpayer bill of rights and why this year's \nreconciliation bill contains additional taxpayer rights. I am not \ncomfortable that debt collectors working on a contingency basis will \nrespect taxpayer rights--even if they are under the direct supervision \nof IRS employees.\n  For this reason, Mr. President, I plan to vote against the conference \nreport.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the vote \noccur on adoption of the conference report to accompany H.R. 2020, the \nTreasury-Postal Service appropriations bill, at 4:45 p.m. this evening, \nand that the Senate recede from the Senate amendment in disagreement at \nthat time.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I do not \nwant to object, and I usually am not an obstructionist around this \nChamber. But I want to be guaranteed some time, and enough time to \nexplain a position that I have relative to the farming out of private \ntax collection.\n  Mr. SHELBY. How much time does the Senator want?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Let me say to my friend from Alabama that I do not think \nthat I would use over 30 minutes. If I could have 30 to 35 minutes, I \nthink I could cover the areas that I need to be covering. I would like \nthe opportunity to ask some questions of my friend from Alabama as to \nhow this very onerous provision crept back into this conference report.\n  Mr. SHELBY. The Senator may ask questions of the Senator from \nNebraska, too.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I would be glad to ask either.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Both of us. Sure.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I wonder if I could be allocated a minimum of 35 minutes.\n  Mr. SHELBY. What about 40 minutes? Is that OK?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I will take 40 minutes. I do not think I will use all of \nthat time. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. SHELBY. At 4:45. Would that be OK?\n  Mr. PRYOR. If it is all right with the Senator from Alabama, could we \nsay no later than 5 o'clock?\n  Mr. KERREY. We have to vote at 4:45.\n  Mr. SHELBY. An hour from now is 4:45.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Could not we vote no later than 5 o'clock?\n  Mr. SHELBY. We have a lot of Members. We will give you all the time \nand try to respond to whatever you want.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I guess I will take at least 40 minutes. I hope I do not \nuse it. I know my friend from Iowa wants to speak for 3 minutes on the \nissue. He can speak before I do, if that is all right with the \ndistinguished managers.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the action \nof the conferees decision not to fund President Clinton's initiative \nlast year which spent $405 million to hire over 6,000 more IRS agents. \nThis is an issue that Senator Lott and I have worked on very closely \nfor over a year and I am pleased to see that our efforts have achieved \na success for the taxpayers.\n  In particular, I want to commend Senator Shelby for his work. This \nwould not have happened were it not for Senator Shelby's efforts and \nhis decision to put the interest of the American taxpayer first and not \nlisten to the voices of empire-building bureaucrats at the IRS.\n  I find it particularly galling that when the President is thumping \nhis chest about vetoing bills, he forgets to tell the American people \nthat one of his top priorities is to get $405 million to retain the \n6,000 plus additional IRS agents--that is right 6,000 more IRS agents \nthat he hired last year.\n  And remember, the IRS has already seen a massive increase in staff, \nfrom 82,000 in 1982 to over 110,000 in the early 1990's. Yet, that was \nnot enough for President Clinton.\n  President Clinton wanted to have 6,000 more IRS agents knocking on \ntaxpayers doors. And last year, the big-spending Democrats in Congress \nwere happy to oblige.\n  But last fall, the voters spoke strongly for a smaller Government. \nAnd today we see a significant response to those voters. This bill will \nensure that the IRS will not have 114,000 IRS agents looking through \nyour files but \n\n[[Page S17073]]\ninstead 106,000--a reduction of 8,000 agents.\n  We have asked the American taxpayers to tighten their belts enough \ntimes, now we are finally asking the IRS to do the same. And let me \nsay, you do not hear about it in press releases from the White House, \nbut in closed doors they have been fighting tooth and nail for more \nmoney to keep these additional IRS agents and incredibly, to hire even \nmore.\n  We have heard on this floor the question asked many times, ``Whose \nside are you on?'' It is clear that the White House is on the side of \nbigger bureaucracy and more agents at the IRS, and this Congress is on \nthe side of the taxpayer and small businessmen and women struggling to \npay the bills and who just want big Government off their backs.\n  Once again I want to commend Senator Shelby and Congressman \nLightfoot, chairman in the House and the conferees for their work on \nthis issue. This is clearly a red letter day for taxpayers who have \nfinally won one over the IRS.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. With no one else seeking recognition at this point, if I \nmight, Mr. President, I would like to make a few points relative to \nthis legislation and to one specific provision which bothers me to such \na great extent that I will not only speak against this bill being \npassed, I will vote against this bill being passed, and I may be in a \nminority of one, but if that is the case I will be in that minority and \nbe very proud of it.\n  Historically, the Finance Committee, which is one of the oldest \ncommittees of this great institution, as is the Appropriations \nCommittee, has not only been charged with tax collection but also \ncharged with a very unique function in addition to that, and that \nfunction is the protection of the individual taxpayer. The protection \nof the individual taxpayer's rights has always, historically been a \nfunction not of the Appropriations Committee but of the Finance \nCommittee of the Senate.\n  On page 33 of the conference report that we are considering at this \npoint--and that is the issue before the Senate--we find amendment No. \n22. This is the same language that was stricken by the Senate on August \n4, 1995, when the Senator from Alabama acquiesced in a unanimous-\nconsent request for an amendment by myself, and the Senate knocked out \nthe House language which stated this--I am going to read amendment No. \n22, Mr. President.\n\n       Restores and modifies House language authorizing $13 \n     million for a private debt collection initiative.\n\n  This is truly the tip of the iceberg. When my friend, Senator \nGrassley, of Iowa, a few moments ago was speaking about taxpayers' \nrights and the number of IRS agents that we are not going to employ, \nthus protecting the taxpayer, I went back many years ago remembering \nthe work that Senator Grassley and myself and Senator Shelby, even in \nhis days in the House of Representatives, were involved in by trying to \nget passed in the Congress the first-ever Taxpayer Bill of Rights, the \nfirst time that this country ever stated in statute rights specifically \nto protect the taxpayer.\n  It was 1988 when this legislation was passed. And we are seeing today \nwhat I consider to be a great challenge to and a great erosion of the \nspirit of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. Why is that? First, the Taxpayer \nBill of Rights had a very key provision. I am sure my friend from \nAlabama remembers--I wish my friend from Iowa were here because he \nhelped to draft that particular section--we stated in 1988 that there \ncould be no bounty system, there could be no quota system with regard \nto tax collections from the taxpayers of America. We found egregious \nexample after example throughout the 50 States where tax collectors \nwere abusing the rights of taxpayers, where they were abusing these \nrights to the extent that the tax collectors before 1988 operated under \na bounty system and under a quota system whereby their raises and the \nstructure of their civil service retirement, their opportunity in the \nwork force was based upon, ``How much did you collect?''\n  Here is what we are doing now. For the first time in 200 years we are \nabout to put our stamp of approval officially upon a bounty system. \nThat is what this is. This is a bounty system where we cannot pay those \nlawyers to collect debts, where we cannot pay ABC Collection Service to \ncollect debts of the IRS. There is no way we can put them temporarily \non the Federal payroll. So we are going to pay them the only way there \nis to pay them: We are going to give them a percentage of what they \ncollect.\n  What sort of environment does that bring about? It does not take a \nrocket scientist to figure that one out. They are going to be out there \nusing methods that are unprotected by statute, using a system of bounty \nhunter mentality that was in place before 1988, that is going to become \nthe law of the land with the sanction of the U.S. Government. I think \nit is horrible that we would consider taking this very backward step \nand going back into the dark ages in the collection of our taxes.\n  I received this letter August 4, and usually I am not on the side of \nthe Internal Revenue Service. I chaired the Senate Finance Committee's \nsubcommittee on oversight of the IRS for a good number of years. I \nworked closely with many of my colleagues on that committee and Members \nof this body. But on August 4, I received a letter from Margaret Milner \nRichardson, who is the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service at \nthe Department of the Treasury, and I agree 100 percent.\n  By the way, I ask unanimous consent to place this letter in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Treasury,\n\n\n                                     Internal Revenue Service,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 4, 1995.\n     Hon. David Pryor,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: I am writing to express my concern \n     regarding statutory language in the FY 1996 Appropriations \n     Committee Bill (H.R. 2020) for Treasury, Postal Service and \n     General Government that would mandate the Internal Revenue \n     Service (IRS) spend $13 million ``to initiate a program to \n     utilize private counsel law firms and debt collection \n     activities. . .'' I have grave reservations about starting \n     down the path of using private contractors to contact \n     taxpayers regarding their delinquent tax debts without \n     Congress having a thorough understanding of the costs, \n     benefits and risks of embarking on such a course.\n       There are some administrative and support functions in the \n     collection activity that do lend themselves to performance by \n     private sector enterprises under contract to the IRS. \n     *For example in FY 1994, the IRS spent nearly $5 million \n     for contracts to acquire addresses and telephone numbers for \n     taxpayers with delinquent accounts. In addition, we are \n     taking many steps to emulate the best collection practices of \n     the private sector to the extent they are compatible with \n     safeguarding taxpayer rights. However, to this point, the IRS \n     has not engaged contractors to make direct contact with \n     taxpayers regarding delinquent taxes as is envisioned in H.R. \n     2020. Before taking this step, I strongly recommend that all \n     parties with an interest obtain solid information on the \n     following key issues:\n       (1) What impact would private debt collectors have on the \n     public's perception of the fairness of tax administration and \n     of the security of the financial information provided to the \n     IRS? A recent survey conducted by Anderson Consulting \n     revealed that 59% of Americans oppose state tax agencies \n     contracting with private companies to administer and collect \n     taxes while only 35% favor such a proposal. In all \n     likelihood, the proportion of those opposed would be even \n     higher for Federal taxes. Addressing potential public \n     misgivings should be a priority concern.\n       (2) How would taxpayers rights be protected and privacy be \n     guaranteed once tax information was released to private debt \n     collectors? Would the financial incentives common to private \n     debt collection (keeping a percentage of the amount \n     collected) result in reduced rights for certain taxpayers \n     whose accounts had been privatized? Using private collectors \n     to contact taxpayers on collection matters would pose unique \n     oversight problems for the IRS to assure that Taxpayers Bill \n     of Rights and privacy rights are protected for all taxpayers. \n     Commingling of tax and non-tax data by contractors is a risk \n     as is the use of tax information for purposes other than \n     intended.\n       (3) Is privatizing collection of tax debt a good business \n     decision for the Federal Government? Private contractors have \n     none of the collection powers the Congress has given to the \n     IRS. Therefore, their success in collection may not yield the \n     same return as a similar amount invested in IRS telephone or \n     field collection activities where the capability to contact \n     taxpayers is linked with the ability to institute liens and \n     levy on property if need be. Currently, the IRS telephone \n\n[[Page S17074]]\n     collection efforts yield about $26 collected for every dollar expended. \n     More complex and difficult cases dealt with in the field \n     yield about $10 for every dollar spent.\n       I strongly believe a more extensive dialogue is needed on \n     the matter of contracting out collection activity before the \n     IRS proceeds to implement such a provision. Please let me \n     know if I can provide any additional information that would \n     be of value to you as Congress considers this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Margaret Milner Richardson.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. Richardson wrote me this letter August 4, and I quote:\n\n       I have grave reservations about starting down the path of \n     using private contractors to contact taxpayers regarding \n     their delinquent tax debts without Congress having a thorough \n     understanding of the costs, the benefits and risks of \n     embarking on such a course.\n\n  Another quote from paragraph 2, and she is asking questions at this \ntime.\n\n       How would taxpayers rights be protected and privacy be \n     guaranteed once tax information was released to private debt \n     collectors?\n\n  And that is a good question.\n\n       Would the financial incentives common to private debt \n     collection (keeping a percentage of the amount collected) \n     result in reduced rights for certain taxpayers whose accounts \n     had been privatized? Using private collectors to contact \n     taxpayers on collection matters would cause unique oversight \n     problems for the Internal Revenue Service to assure that \n     Taxpayers Bill of Rights and privacy rights are protected for \n     all taxpayers. Commingling of tax and nontax data by \n     contractors is a risk as is the use of tax information for \n     purposes other than intended.\n\n  This is the end of that quote from the Commissioner of the Internal \nRevenue Service embodied in a letter to me dated August 4.\n  How far will this go? Well, we might say it is only $13 million. They \nare going to go out there and experiment. We are going to hire a few \ncollectors now, and maybe a few lawyers would be interested. They are \ngoing to go out there and try to collect some of the debts that are \nowed to the Internal Revenue Service.\n  How far does it go? No one knows how far it goes because, Mr. \nPresident, there was not one day of hearings. There was not a hearing. \nThere was not a discussion. There was not a debate. There was nothing. \nAll we knew was that the House of Representatives inserted this \nlanguage here. We struck it out in the Senate on August 4. I am hoping \nthat we can defeat this bill so we can send a message back to the House \nthat we are not going to tolerate this potential invasion of privacy, \nthis potential invasion of confidentiality of private taxpayers' \nrecords and give those out to private debt collection companies and \nlawyers throughout the land. It is a terrible situation.\n  The second question is, who are these people going to be? Are they \njust going to be lawyers? We just had the first version where we saw \nthey were debt collection companies. Then it was expanded to lawyers. I \ndo not know what it will be expanded to the next go-round. But now we \nhave already expanded it once from debt collection companies to \nlawyers. I do not know how that happened.\n  Who is going to be hired? Who makes that determination? Do they go up \ninto the IRS office in Washington and say, ``We want to go back in our \nhometowns, and we know that that Ford dealer down there or that old \nfarmer out there on route 4--I have a feeling that he probably owes the \nIRS something. We would like to see his records. And if you would show \nus those records of that Ford dealer or that farmer or that housewife \nor that small businessperson or that individual whom they may not like, \n``for 50 percent we'll go out there and collect that money for you.'' \nThen is the IRS going to say, ``OK. You're hired?'' Someone else may \ncome up and say, ``OK. You are not hired.'' Maybe they want too much \nmoney. Maybe they do not want enough. Who is going to train those \npeople, Mr. President?\n  My friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, was talking about this massive \nbureaucracy of the IRS. I, too, have been critical of that bureaucracy. \nI think for too long it has been too insensitive. But who is going to \ntrain these people to go out and protect taxpayers' rights? That is \nwhat this argument is about. I do not know anything in the legislation \nthat says that those rights are going to be protected.\n  I know nothing in this amendment that says anything about the \nparticular training program that these individuals are going to go \nthrough. All it says is, here is $13 million to go out and hire private \ncollection agencies in the private sector. Who is going to train them? \nWe do not know. Who is going to oversee them, Mr. President? Who is \ngoing to go down to Camden, AR, and oversee the Jones collection agency \nand see if they are properly giving the proper treatment and protection \nto the individual taxpayers that they are collecting money from? Who is \ngoing to oversee them? I do not know. New bureaucracy? Yes. Fewer \ntaxpayers' rights? Yes.\n  And now--this is a key and critical question, Mr. President--which \ntaxpayers' cases are these individuals, once they are hired, once they \nare given their contract, which taxpayers' cases, when you file through \nall the records of the Internal Revenue Service, which ones are they \ngoing to be given to work on? Will it be at random? Will it be rural \nletter carriers as it was a few years ago? Will it be Methodist \nministers? Will it be small businesspeople? Who is it going to be that \nthey are going to zero in on? And this confidential information, \nconfidential tax records, dating perhaps 10 years back, is it going to \nbe given to the local collection agency so they can carry them around \nin the coffee shops, carry them around to the shopping centers and hold \nthem up and say, ``Hey, look at our neighbors' tax collections for the \nlast 10 years.'' Are we going to go out and get that system? As a \nresult, we might collect 50 percent and make a nice profit on it.\n  Mr. President, what type of taxpayer information will be made \navailable? And how will this information be made available? And how \nwill these tax collectors, these bill collectors, I should say, be \npaid? That has never been mentioned in this debate.\n  Once again, Mr. President, this is an appropriations bill. It is not \na bill that came from the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee is \nthat committee historically that has been charged with regulating the \nprotections of the taxpayer. And here we are making a very, very \nbackward step, in fact a step back into the Dark Ages, in my opinion, \nwhen we are creating a new bounty-hunter mentality in the Internal \nRevenue Service. And it is an issue--I should say it is an authority, a \nnew authority, that the Internal Revenue Service does not want. They do \nnot think it will work. They are posing these many questions today as \nwe consider this particular appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I would like at this point to yield the floor. I would \nlike the opportunity to ask some questions of my friend from Alabama. \nPerhaps he would like to respond. He may desire to do so at this time. \nI will yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my good friend \nfrom Arkansas. He is to be commended over the years for being very \ninvolved in pushing legislation for years and years and articulating \nthe position of the taxpayer as far as the IRS is concerned. We all \nknow that that is known as the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights. That was long \nin coming, and the Senator from Arkansas should get most of the credit \nfor it. A lot of us worked with him, but he was the leader in this, and \nI commend him so.\n  On this bill here, let me share some of it. In December 1991, the IRS \ncompleted an internal study that addressed, among other things, legal, \nfinancial, policy, and design considerations involved in contracting \nout collections. The study concluded that the IRS should test the use \nof private collection companies, provided that legal issues regarding \nactivities that the IRS could contract out and funding sources were \nresolved. This proposal before us encourages that. In September 1992, \nthe OMB issued a policy letter indicating that private companies can do \ncollection-related functions such as locating taxpayers, making \ntelephone calls to remind taxpayers of tax delinquencies, mailing tax \nnotices, and providing lockboxes for receipt of payments. This proposal \nencourages that.\n  In December 1992, the IRS chief counsel's office issued guidance for \nIRS' use of contracting with private collection \n\n[[Page S17075]]\ncompanies. It concurs with the OMB letter. In discussing the disclosure \nissue, the guidance said that the IRS has the authority to contract out \ncertain collection-related activities and that the appropriate \nsafeguards would be in place. This proposal would allow the IRS to \nensure the appropriate safeguards are in place.\n  As the Senator from Arkansas brings up--and he is absolutely right--\nthe appropriate safeguards must be in place. The IRS must, Mr. \nPresident, oversee this. The IRS will oversee this. This is a pilot \nprogram. The 1993 GAO report indicated, Mr. President, that the IRS was \nmoving forward with the plans for a pilot test which would start as \nearly as October 1993--we are behind on that--and that the IRS' long-\nrange plans included expansion if the test worked.\n  The Vice President's reinvention proposal indicates that a pilot test \nshould be developed. And considering the fact that taxes remain \nuncollected in the United States and that the number of IRS personnel \ncontinues to grow, and the only apparent way the IRS is able to \nincrease revenues is to spend more money and hire more people, should \nwe not try something new? I say yes.\n  This proposal allows the IRS to create the plan. They can address all \nof the concerns that have been raised, not only by the Senator from \nArkansas, but by others, including this Senator. I firmly believe, Mr. \nPresident, that we should use all of the resources available to ensure \nthat tax scofflaws are tracked down and those of us who pay our taxes \nare given more for our money.\n  Let me continue. The conferees have included, Mr. President, a \nprovision which will create the pilot program allowing private law and \ncollection activities to pursue delinquent tax bills under the \ndirection of the IRS, Mr. President; no one else.\n  This proposal is intended to be innovative. It gives the authority to \nthe IRS to make the decisions. The IRS will be able to use all of the \nsafeguards available to ensure taxpayers and disclosure problems.\n  Many businesses and States already use private collection sources in \nan attempt to manage and to supplement their basic resources.\n  The GAO reported in 1993 that 28 States with individual income tax \nproblems used private collection companies in collecting taxes. Only 6 \nof the 28 States felt they were ineffective.\n  Several questions have been raised by the Senator from Arkansas, and \nthey should be, about the private collection initiative. Some of those \nquestions are basically these:\n  Is privatizing certain collection activities on delinquent tax debt a \ngood idea? The answer, I believe, is yes. Currently, approximately $70 \nbillion, Mr. President--$70 billion--is owed to the IRS in delinquent \ntax debt upon which the IRS has ceased active collection efforts, and \nthis amount is growing by roughly $10 billion a year.\n  This proposal before us would allow private firms to provide limited \ncollection services on that debt at no cost to the taxpayers, unless \nthe debt is collected, because these accounts are currently lying \ndormant at the IRS and will remain so.\n  What prevents private collectors from engaging in abusive collection \npractices or disclosure of confidential information? The Fair Debt \nCollection Practices Act and the Privacy Act of 1974 prohibit \nharassment of debtors and other unfair collection practices, as well as \nthe unauthorized disclosure of debtor information to third parties. \nViolations of these provisions can subject collectors to millions of \ndollars in actual and punitive damages.\n  Let me go into this a minute. What type of taxpayer records will they \nhave access to? This was raised by the Senator from Arkansas. The only \ninformation that contractors would receive would be the debtor's name, \nthe address, the phone number, the Social Security number, employer, \nand amount owed, just as they would with any nontax debt in America.\n  Mr. President, the debtor's tax return would not--and I repeat, would \nnot--be disclosed to the contractor.\n  Who will these contractors be? Private collection companies that \nspecialize in collecting overdue debts. An example of the best pool of \ncandidates from which to choose would be those collectors currently \nworking under the Department of Education's private sector collection \nactivities for student-related debt contracts.\n\n  Who will train them? According to GAO, one of the reasons for using \nprivate collection companies is for the IRS to learn from the \ntechniques that are being used in the private sector to collect overdue \ntaxes. Consequently, the training of employees who will be performing \nthis function should be, I believe, done by private collection \ncompanies that will be contracting with the Internal Revenue Service, \nunder the supervision and guidelines of the Internal Revenue Service.\n  With respect to special expertise that is needed for collecting tax \ndebts, the IRS should and would provide the speciality training. No one \nelse.\n  On which cases will the collector's work? Currently not collectible \naccounts, that is what they are called, Mr. President, as classified by \nthe IRS since these accounts are now lying dormant at the IRS, $70 \nbillion of them.\n  One approach would be to send cases to private contractors that are \notherwise noncollectible, primarily where there is an inability to \nlocate the taxpayer and, in such cases, a contractor should be able to \ninvest more resources to locate them than the IRS can spend.\n  Another approach would be to take cases that are deferred, meaning \nthat there is a small enough balance due that the moneys are left \nuncollected until some other credit shows up in the system, such as a \nrefund, that is then offset against the deferred amount, and replace \nthese with private collectors.\n  What type of collection services will they provide? The contractors \nwill be responsible for generating letters to be mailed in most cases \nby the IRS and making phone calls to debtors. The letters and calls \nwould be designed to remind debtors of their outstanding tax debt and \nto seek assurances from the debtor that the debt will be repaid. The \ncontractors would not, Mr. President, be authorized to receive funds, \ncompromise debts, sue debtors, seize property, or levy against assets.\n  At this time, it would seem to make sense to me to test a program \nwhere private contractors locate and call taxpayers by telephone and \ninform them of how much they owe, how high interest and/or penalties \nare accumulating, their options, and the actions the IRS can take if \nthey do not pay.\n  However, the contractor would not make the final decision and should \nnot make the final decision whether or not to enter into an installment \nagreement or to take any other collection action.\n  The bottom line is that this is a pilot program. IRS has full \ncontrol. They should have full control. The points I have tried to \nrespond to are examples. IRS will be making the decisions. I believe \nthat any ideas should be considered. I believe this is a good proposal \nthat we have come forth with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 25 minutes.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Chair for advising me on the time remaining. I \nam going to speak only a few moments, Mr. President. I want to give \nadequate time for our friend and colleague, the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia, to speak. I would like to hit two or three more \npoints.\n  I listened very intently to my friend from Alabama go down through \nthe concerns as expressed by the Department of the Treasury, more \nspecifically the Commissioner of the IRS, Margaret Milner Richardson, \nwho wrote me on August 4--I placed that letter in the Record--\nexpressing grave concerns about going down this particular trail with \ndebt collection.\n  The Senator from Alabama has just mentioned that the IRS would still \nretain control throughout this whole process. I maintain that the IRS \nhas control now. What we are about to do is to add a new dimension \nwhereby confidential tax information of individual taxpayers, of small \nbusinesses and large, perhaps, are going to be taken from the \nconfidentiality of the Internal Revenue Service and given, basically, \nto debt collection services, to lawyers and to law firms, and they are \ngoing to go out and collect these debts with a bounty hunter's \nmentality.\n  It did not work centuries ago in Greece. It did not work in Rome. \nAnd, Mr. President, it is not going to work now, especially with the \nopposition of the agency, the IRS, that is going to be policing this \nsituation, training these collectors and lawyers and, basically, having \noversight of this whole new venture, in this leap that I think we are \nabout to make into darkness. \n\n[[Page S17076]]\n\n  We are about to privatize the collection of debts by the Internal \nRevenue Service. There is some form of privatizing that may be all \nright. Yesterday, for example, when everything was closed down, I went \ndown to the dining room. I walked down to the dining room, I knocked on \nthe door, and the dining room was closed. So I decided, well, I have to \neat somewhere, I had not had anything to eat. Somebody said, ``You can \ngo over to the House of Representatives and eat; they have a cafeteria \nover there that is open.'' So I walked over, and I had two or three \npeople with me. We walked through the tunnel and walked to the House of \nRepresentatives, and we ate. We ate because it was privatized. It was \nnot run by the Government. Therefore, the Government did not have a lot \nto say about whether or not employees came in.\n  But, Mr. President, privatizing a cafeteria and privatizing the \nconfidential information to be dispensed to the general public and to \nlawyers and debt collectors are two different things. This is one area \nof privatizing that--even though many of our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle might think it is appropriate--I beg them to \nreconsider, to look at the potential for conflict, for harassment, for \nbounty hunters, and for undue influence being used against unsuspecting \nand unprotected taxpayers.\n  In 1988, in the taxpayers' bill of rights, we protected those \ntaxpayers, I say to my friend from Alabama, and now we are about to \nwalk away from them. We are about to say, well, we wanted to give you a \nlittle respite, but now we are ready to go after you again. We are \nready to harness bounty hunters, who are going after you, who are going \nto have knowledge of your confidential tax information, where there are \nno ethics laws applying, and no regulations, where the IRS Commissioner \nsays even the IRS cannot police this program.\n  Mr. President, I ask, what are we doing? I hope we will reconsider \nthis. I, for one, will vote against this conference report, even though \nI will probably be in the minority of one, and I hope that at the \nappropriate time, I am going to give this opportunity of the Senate \nitself to vote up or down on whether or not we should start privatizing \nthe collections of our debts owed to the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I believe some good is going to come out \nof this debate here on the floor of the Senate because I agree with the \nSenator from Arkansas that the IRS should and must protect the privacy \nof all taxpayers not to hand over their tax returns to anyone else, and \nwe are not going to do that in this.\n  Let me go back to something. The IRS, Internal Revenue Service, \nactually requested this proposal 2 years ago. The approved budget for \nthe Internal Revenue Service in fiscal year 1994 included funding, at \nthe request of the IRS, totaling $5.790 million in startup funds and 41 \nfull-time equivalent employees. I will quote the IRS document:\n\n       This will enable the Internal Revenue Service collection to \n     contract for a test to determine the effectiveness and cost-\n     benefit of having private sector collection agencies work a \n     portion of the delinquent taxes inventory not being worked \n     due to resource constraints, and so forth. The funds, \n     unfortunately, were reprogrammed to cover costs of locality \n     pay. Let me repeat, Mr. President, there are $70 billion in \n     America in these closed accounts or dormant accounts, \n     uncollectible, growing at the rate of $10 billion a year. I \n     do not know how much of these dormant accounts--$70 billion \n     now, and next year it will be $80 billion, getting on up \n     toward $100 billion. That is a lot of money in America. If \n     these taxes are owed--and most of them are not even disputed, \n     it is my understanding--we should collect them. These are \n     owed taxes. If we can collect them, it helps us in our \n     expenditures here in the Congress. It means people are not \n     going to be deadbeats in this country, and that we will have \n     to levy fewer taxes elsewhere. I think it is a good start. It \n     is a pilot program, and I think it makes sense.\n\n  I do want to continue to work with my friend from Arkansas to make \nsure that the American taxpayers' privacy is protected. Their returns \nare not put out of the IRS, but as far as what they owe and who they \nare, I do not see any privacy on that. That is everywhere in America \ntoday. You can pick that up on a credit report.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Will my friend from Alabama yield?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Yes.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I want to ask my friend from Alabama, how \nare these new collectors going to be paid?\n  Mr. SHELBY. How will they be paid? We have not received the directive \nfrom the IRS. But I hope they will be paid on what they collect, a \npercentage of what they collect. In other words, I certainly would not \nwant to pay them a salary. I do not believe they would be as diligent \nor that they would work as hard. Billions of dollars in America is \ncollected each day, probably based on incentives. Incentives do matter. \nAs with the Department of Education debt collection contracts, the base \ncompensation, I hope, would be calculated as a percentage of account \ndollars collected, or included in repayment schedules agreed to by the \ndebtors. Also, a competitive environment would be structured so that it \nwould reward productive contractors who comply with the law and who do \nnot generate debtor complaints, do not abuse people and penalize \nunproductive or compliant ones. That is who we look forward to working \nwith.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, in the 1988 taxpayers' bill of rights, on \nwhich the Senator from Alabama was a helpful participant, we abolished \nthe quota system. We said to the regional district offices of the \nInternal Revenue Service, you may not promote or demote your employees \nbased upon what they collected or what they did not collect. We sent a \nmessage throughout the IRS collection system: No quotas, no bounties.\n  The Senator from Alabama has just stated he hopes that they are paid \non a percentage. That is a bounty. That is a quota. That is going \ndirectly contrary to the 1988 taxpayers' bill of rights.\n  Mr. SHELBY. This is a lot different, if I can respond. That is \ndifferent from an IRS auditor coming in and auditing Mr. and Mrs. John \nJones' account, and the more they found, the more they get working as \nan IRS employee. These efforts will be directed at collecting debts \nthat are not in dispute, debts that have been arrived at as owed, debts \nthat have basically been forgotten, as I said, to the tune now of $70 \nbillion. There is a lot of difference between that and protecting \nsomeone who the IRS is auditing or having a tax dispute with. This is \nnot a tax dispute. This is a debt owed. There is a lot of difference.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, to conclude, my friend from Alabama has \nstated that the IRS has requested this. The IRS did not request this \nauthority. This administration did not request this authority. The \npresent IRS Commissioner did not request this new authority. In fact, \nthe present IRS Commissioner has said she does not think it will work. \nShe is raising the questions that, today, are unanswered.\n  I hope that my colleagues from both of the committees and both \nmanagers--each of the managers, I should say, of this conference report \nwill understand my voting ``no'' on this. It is nothing personal \nagainst them. But I am going to continue this fight to try to strike \nthis from the law of the land when we adopt it.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the fiscal \nyear 1994 compliance option request regarding the budget, where the IRS \nrequested this, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Fiscal Year 1994 Compliance Options\n\n     Key Area: Accounts Receivable.\n     Concern: Implementation of Private Collection Agency Program \n         Pilot Objective.\n       We are requesting the direct hire of 41 FTEs and $5.790 \n     million in start up funds. This will enable the IRS \n     Collection to contract for a test to determine the \n     effectiveness/cost benefit of having private sector \n     collection agencies work a portion of delinquent taxes \n     inventory not being worked due to resource constraints.\n\n\n                              program area\n\n       A feasibility study on contracting our collection work was \n     completed by a cross-functional group in December 1991. This \n     group concluded that contracting out could be an effective \n     means to address portions of the Collection inventory that \n     have not been worked, or that have been worked with little or \n     no revenue collected. Benefits of this approach would include \n     a direct reduction in accounts receivable dollar inventory \n     (ARDI), and a reduction of taxpayer burden.\n       A test using commercial vendors to collect delinquent taxes \n     will require the establishment of a national program office \n     to plan and oversee implementation of the pilot test site. \n     Collection agencies would be involved \n\n[[Page S17077]]\n     with the collection of accounts with a balance due of $10,000 or less, \n     or accounts receivable deemed too low for immediate IRS \n     involvement. This project requires a national centralized \n     focal point to oversee the program development and to \n     complete testing before implementation. This proposal has the \n     potential to reduce excessive taxpayer burden while \n     increasing revenue.\n       In addition to personnel this initiative will require start \n     up funds for contractual services. It is not anticipated that \n     the IRS will be able to have a normal business relationship \n     with the collection agencies involved with this program. In \n     the private sector, accounts receivable are collected or sold \n     to a vendor who then retains a portion of the receipts as \n     payment.

Mr. President, the current budget impasse demonstrates \nthe harsh and unacceptable priorities of the Republican majority in \nCongress. As the past 2 days have shown, our Republican friends are \nprepared to hold the entire Federal Government hostage to their extreme \nagenda. Their price for keeping the Government open is to abandon \nsenior citizens on Medicare and families struggling to educate their \nchildren. Their price is too high and their tactics are irresponsible, \nand President Clinton is right to reject them.\n  It is wrong for our Republican friends to sacrifice the rights of \nstudents and senior citizens on the altar of tax breaks for the \nwealthy. The American people did not think they were voting for deep \ncuts in Medicare and education in 1994, and they are not going to vote \nfor anti-Medicare, anti-education candidates in 1996.\n  Make no mistake, balancing the Federal budget is not the issue. We \nall agree that the budget should be balanced and must be balanced, but \nabove all, it must be balanced fairly. The fundamental issue that \ndivides Democrats and Republicans is not whether to balance the budget \nbut how to balance the budget. We can debate these issues responsibly. \nIt is reckless and irresponsible for the Republican majority in \nCongress to shut down the Federal Government because they cannot get \ntheir way. They do not deserve their way, and they will not get their \nway.\n  Democrats categorically reject Republican priorities that would \nbalance the budget on the backs of senior citizens, students, and \nworking families to provide payoffs to the privileged and confer lavish \ntax breaks worth hundreds of billions of dollars on the wealthiest \nindividuals and corporations in our society.\n  In education, the Republican budget bill is a bust for students and a \nbonanza for big banks. It is wrong to dismantle the highly successful \nDirect Student Loan Program. It is wrong to prohibit colleges and \nuniversities from choosing and using a loan program that provides the \nbest service and the lowest cost to students. It is wrong to tilt the \nplaying field and funnel $100 billion in new business over the next 7 \nyears to the banks and guaranty agencies in the student loan industry. \nI say let competition work. Let the best loan program win.\n  Whatever happened to the Republican belief in competition? The \nPresident had signed a law that went into effect in 1993 to provide for \na transition and a real competition between direct loan and the \nguaranteed student loans. Republicans and Democrats alike had worked \ntowards a real compromise.\n  There were many who wanted to go immediately to direct loans. There \nwere others who wanted the guaranteed loan. So we created a compromise \nthat permitted the universities and colleges of this country to move \ngradually towards the Direct Loan Program, and they have been moving \nforward with that Direct Loan Program.\n  There are more than 1,450 colleges that have that. It is interesting \nthat there is not a single college in the United States that has moved \nfrom a Direct Loan Program back to the guaranteed loan. Not one. And \nthere are scores of them that want to move the other way.\n  But under this particular proposal, what we are doing is actually \ncarving out a very narrow sliver of the whole loan program to the \ndirect loan, some 10 percent, and giving the other part to the guaranty \nagencies. Almost $100 billion will flow through them and the profits \nwill be anywhere from $7 billion to $9 billion. Those will be out of \nthe pockets and pocketbooks of the parents primarily and the students \nover the period of these next 7 years, and that is wrong.\n  We say, ``OK, let's leave it up to the universities and colleges.'' \nLet them make the choice whether they want the guaranteed loan program, \non the one, or the direct loan on the other. We have offered that. Let \nthe colleges make the choice. That is competition at the local level. \nBut we were refused and effectively closed out from that option.\n  That is only the beginning of the Republican attack on education. \nOver the next 7 years, their budget would slash Federal aid to \neducation by an incredible one-third--$36 billion. A one-third cut in \neducation is utterly irresponsible. We ought to be investing more in \neducation, not less. That is our priority, that is President Clinton's \npriority, and I am confident the American people share it.\n  The Republicans claim their budget means a brighter future for the \nNation's children. In fact, the Republican budget will turn out the \nclassroom lights for millions of the Nation's schoolchildren and no \nanti-education plan like that deserves to pass. That is included in the \nRepublican program.\n  What they take is the House appropriations figure, which is $4 \nbillion. We had just over $2 billion in the Senate. I am convinced if \nwe had gone to the conference, it would have been closer to the Senate, \ngiven the votes that have taken place here in the Senate on the \neducation issue where we had bipartisan support, 67-32, when we had the \nvote on the Snowe-Simon amendment some time ago and the other actions \nthat were taken on the compromise here.\n  We restored money in education, and what did the continuing \nresolution do? It took the lower figure between the House and the \nSenate, $4 billion cut and said you only have to spend 60 percent of \nwhat was being spent last year. That is effectively undermining in a \ndramatic way major education programs, whether it is the Head Start \nProgram, the math and science programs for elementary schools, the \nwhole school reform program, the drug-free school program, and many \nothers, and that is basically wrong. \n\n[[Page S17079]]\n\n  Excessive cuts like that break faith with families across America \nstruggling to educate their children. Extreme cuts like that walk away \nfrom 30 years of bipartisan cooperation to improve education. Up to \nthis year, we had bipartisan support. If you look over the last \nCongress, in 1992 through 1994, when we reauthorized the Head Start \nProgram, when we reauthorized title I, $6.6 billion to reach out to \nneedy children to help them with math and science, when we passed the \nGoals 2000 program to commit 90 percent of the funding to go to local \nschools and parents in local communities to enhance academic \nachievement, when we passed the School-to-Work Program, when we passed \nthe Direct Loan Program, every one of those had bipartisan \nsupport. Only a handful of Republicans voted against it. Effectively, \nwhat happened in the 1994 legislation that said we have to wipe those \nprograms out--I did not hear that point being made by our Republican \nfriends in the course of the 1994 election, and we should not \neffectively undermine that important commitment to the young people in \nthis country.\n\n  Mr. President, over the next decade, the number of school-aged \nchildren will rise to 50 million. That is almost double the number in \nthe Sputnik era, a generation ago, when nobody questioned that \neducating our children was an urgent national priority. We are \nincreasing the total number of children and effectively seeing the \nsignificant cuts by a third of all of the programs dealing with K \nthrough 12.\n  Now is no time to cut education. Education is the key that unlocks \nthe American dream. Cutting education as we struggle to meet the \nchallenge of the information age is like cutting national defense at \nthe height of the cold war.\n  Senior citizens are targeted by the Republican budget. In the bill \nvetoed by President Clinton, our Republican friends were not insisting \nthat Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals be cut as their price \nfor keeping the Government open. They were not insisting that fraud and \nwaste be squeezed out of Medicare. They were not insisting that senior \ncitizens get the preventive care for outpatient services that they need \nto keep them out of the hospital to reduce Medicare. The right way \ninstead of the right wing way. The only provision our friends insisted \non was a new tax on senior citizens in the form of higher Medicare \npremiums.\n  Speaker Gingrich makes no mistake about it. He says he wants to see \nMedicare wither away. Well, with priorities like that, it is more \nlikely that the Republican Party will wither away.\n  Medicare is part of Social Security. It is a contract between the \nGovernment and the people that says, ``Pay into the trust fund during \nyour working years, and we will guarantee good health care in your \nretirement years.''\n  It is wrong for the Republicans to break that contract. It is wrong \nfor Republicans to propose deep cuts in Medicare--three times as deep \nas anything needed to protect the trust fund. It is doubly wrong for \nRepublicans to propose deep cuts in Medicare in order to pay for tax \nbreaks for the wealthy. It is triply wrong for the Republicans to try \nto force the President into accepting higher Medicare premiums as their \nprice for keeping the Government open.\n  Over the period of the last 2 days, I have seen many of the \nRepublican leaders on television, and not one of them mentions their \ntax cut for the wealthy individuals. I have yet to hear them talk about \nit on the floor of the Senate. Not one of them goes on television and \nsays, ``The reason we need our program, Mr. President, is because we \nhave $245 billion of tax cuts.'' Not one of them say it. They brought \nit in here just a few days before we were going to vote on that. It was \nan add-on, and once they got their commitment in terms of the higher \npremiums on Medicare, then they went ahead and got their tax cut. We \nhave all known that it has been out there for some period of time. Why \ndo we not, on the level, try to present that to the people and let the \nAmerican people vote on that issue? They refuse to do so.\n  So Republican leaders make the preposterous claim that their cuts in \nMedicare will only affect millionaires. Well, I have news for them. \nEighty-three percent of the Medicare spending is for senior citizens \nwith incomes of less than $25,000 a year. Almost two-thirds of Medicare \nspending is for senior citizens with less than $15,000 a year. These \nare the people who you are raising the taxes on with the increased \npremiums on Medicare. On average, because of gaps in Medicare coverage, \nalready high copays, deductibles, and premiums, senior citizens must \nspend 21 percent of their total income to purchase the health care they \nneed. It is unfair to make them bear the brunt of cuts in Medicare.\n\n  The Republican attack on Medicare will make life harder, sicker, and \nshorter for millions of elderly Americans. They deserve better from \nCongress, and I believe they will get it.\n  This cruel and unjust Republican plan to turn the Medicare trust fund \ninto a slush fund for tax breaks for the wealthy deserves to be \ndefeated. Their attempt to force a Medicare premium increase into law \nto keep the Government running deserved the veto it received.\n  We can meet our budget goals without undermining education, without \nundoing Medicare, and without shutting down the Government. I believe \nthat this is a battle that we should fight, rather than cutting the \nMedicare programs and the key education programs, which are so \nimportant for the future.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator makes a lot of good points about the people \nthat are being hurt out there and are being affected by this shutdown \nof the Government. I ask the Senator if he knows something or has heard \nwhat I have found out today and that I was not aware of. Right now, \nbecause of the shutdown in Government, I understand that essential \nworkers go to work. All of our staffs are here at work; committee \nstaffs are here, Senators' staffs, and Representatives' staffs are \nhere. But I just discovered today that when they get their paychecks \nnext week, they are not going to be paid for any days worked after the \n13th of this month. Is that the Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, I had heard that mentioned by some of our \ncolleagues, but the particular details, I am not as familiar with as \nthe Senator from Iowa. I hope that he will explain that to us.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, I just heard that even though they are essential \nworkers and they have to come to work, they do not get paid. I then \nfound out that it does not just apply to staffs. All the air traffic \ncontrollers out there right now working to guide our aircraft--they are \nworking now, and they are essential, but they are not getting paid. So \nwhether it is our staffs, air traffic controllers, or people working at \nthe Pentagon for the Department of Defense, they are working but not \ngetting paid.\n  I thought we did away with slavery in this country. They have to go \nto work, but they do not get paid. Now, again, I guess they will get \npaid later on sometime, but these are people with mortgages, car \npayments, kids in college, kids in school. They have their bills to pay \njust like everybody else. But next Monday, when they get their checks, \nthey are going to come up short. However, I think the Senator--I would \nlike to ask the Senator, we do not fall into that category? Senators \nand Congress are going to get full pay next week when our paychecks \ncome. But staff, air traffic controllers, everybody else, they do not \nget full pay.\n  What an abomination. I ask the Senator, it seems to me, did we not \npass, earlier this year, a law stipulating that all of the laws that we \nhave in this country have to apply to Members of Congress and the \nSenate? Did we not pass that bill? I thought we passed a bill that said \nif we have laws out there, they have to apply to us just like everybody \nelse?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite right, with this one exception: We \nhave provided ourselves with universal comprehensive health insurance. \nWe get the choice of some 200 health programs. The Federal Government \npays three-quarters of it; we only pay a quarter of it. We have not \nprovided that for the American people. We have provided very good \nhealth insurance for every Member here, and it is so interesting that \nso many of those that were \n\n[[Page S17080]]\nagainst any kind of health care coverage were the quickest ones to sign \nup. You can go down in the office of the Secretary of the Senate, and \nthey have a blue sheet down there, and you can go down and check off if \nyou do not want your health care coverage. Every Member in this Senate \nnow has checked that and said that they do want it.\n  So the Senator is right. We have applied laws to ourselves that cover \nothers, with the important exception that we have not given the \nAmerican people what we have given ourselves in terms of health \ninsurance, which is another issue at another time. But I think it is \nalways important to mention that, particularly when the total number of \nuninsured is going up through the roof, particularly children in my \nState and around this country, and where the cost of health care \ncontinues, particularly in prescription drugs, to rise.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is our expert on health care. My question was \ndealing with the staff right now who are not getting paid in the Senate \nand the House, the air traffic controllers, and the people who work for \nthe Department of Defense. But we do. I thought we passed a law that \nsays that Congress has to live by the laws that the rest of the people \ndo. You pointed out one in health care. Is it not true also that \nCongress is not applying to itself the very laws that say that those \nstaff people, air traffic controllers, people working for the \nDepartment of Defense, essential Government workers, they do not get \npaid?\n  But guess what, Senators and Congressmen? We get our pay.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is certainly the way that I understand it, the way \nthat the Senator explained it. I think it is one of the reasons why I \nthink the American people are so frustrated and should be frustrated.\n  This did not have to happen, does the Senator agree with me? This did \nnot have to happen, to work through this whole kind of a situation \nwhere they are halting the Government and effectively blackmailing the \nPresident of the United States for the first time in the history of \nthis country, and also loading up the debt limit with similar kinds of \nactivity to try to halt full faith and credit when we ought to be able \nto, as individuals, be able to work out an accommodation. That is the \nway it is done around here.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  It seems funny, since Congress has not applied this law to itself--\nthat is, Senators and Congressmen continue to get paid but other \nGovernment workers will not get paid.\n  They are the ones who have mortgages to meet, car payments, kids in \nschool. Does it not seem fair to the Senator that perhaps we ought to \ntake up the Boxer bill and pass it here, that would say that Senators \nand Congressmen and the Speaker of the House and everybody else, that \nwe put ourselves in the same boat, that we do not get paid either \nduring this same period of time? Does that not seem reasonable?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It certainly seems reasonable to me. It would make a \ngreat deal of sense.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I hope that the other side, the Republicans, would agree \nto bring this up and put ourselves in the same boat as all the other \nGovernment workers who are not getting paid and see how long this \nfoolishness will go on if Senators and Congressmen are not getting \npaid.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My question is----\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will yield briefly and then I will yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wanted to ask the Senator if he was aware, because the \nSenator from Iowa raised the subject, that in fact the U.S. Senate did \npass the Boxer amendment which said no budget, no pay.\n  It was bipartisan. Senator Daschle and Senator Dole helped me get it \nthrough. It passed twice. But it is, in fact--and I ask the Senator if \nhe is aware of this--Speaker Newt Gingrich who refused to allow it to \nbe voted on on the House side.\n  Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was not aware that very sound and worthwhile, valuable \nsuggestion which I supported was sidetracked--Speaker Gingrich, in \nother words, sidetracked that measure.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I say to my friend, that is true.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And as a result of that, we have the inequity which the \nSenator from Iowa pointed out.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/15/senate-section/article/S17078-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I want to respond to a couple of comments \nmade by my friend and colleague from the State of Massachusetts.\n  I heard two or three statements that Republicans have a budget and \nthey are trying to balance the budget on the backs of senior citizens \nand making unrealistic cuts in Medicare would be the thrust. I \ndisagree.\n  Mr. President, if you look at the Medicare fund, it is going broke. \nThe Medicare system is funded by a payroll tax. All the money goes into \none fund. It is financed by a tax that costs right now 1.45 percent of \npayroll, matched by employer. That is 2.9 percent.\n  Now, next year the fund pays out more than it takes in. You cannot \ncontinue to do that indefinitely. The fund is going broke. The \nPresident's own trustees said it is going broke.\n  Some of us do not want that to happen. Some of us think that would be \nunfair to seniors. Maybe some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle say, ``Well, do not do anything. We will not solve that \nproblem.'' I disagree.\n  Now, there are two ways to solve the problem--either reduce the rate \nof growth of spending in Medicare, which is, frankly, what we are \nproposing, or you increase payroll taxes, which is what Congress has \ndone in the past.\n  Just for my colleagues' information, I looked up years ago what was \nthe history of Medicare taxes. The maximum tax in 1977 was $177. That \nis employee and employer maximum tax. The maximum tax in 1993 was \nalmost $4,000. So it went substantially from $177 to almost $4,000.\n  Guess what? The fund is still going broke. So we have increased the \ntax rates, we have increased the basis. We are spending a lot more \nmoney, and still spending exceeds the revenues. Next year, the spending \nis greater than the revenue in spite of the fact that now there is no \ncap. It is 2.9 percent of payroll. It can be well over $4,000 and the \nfund is still going broke.\n  If it goes broke, it cannot pay the bills. It cannot pay the \nhospital. It cannot pay the doctor. How is it responsible to allow that \nto happen? I do not believe it is responsible. So we need to fix it. \nThat is part of our budget.\n  Somebody says, ``Well, you are cutting Medicare.'' I disagree. This \nyear we are spending $178 billion in Medicare. By the year 2002, we \nwill be spending $286 billion in Medicare. That is an increase. That is \nan increase at twice the rate of inflation. So, Medicare under our \nproposal grows twice the rate of inflation, and it stays solvent. We \nkeep the Medicare trust fund solvent for beyond the year 2010. The \nPresident keeps it solvent for a couple more years. That is not \nsatisfactory. We are trying to be responsible. Some people are playing \npolitics.\n  The President is playing politics. The Republicans wanted a 25-\npercent increase in beneficiaries' payments. That is so demagogic. The \nfacts are, just to be very simple, part B, part B is voluntary. It pays \nfor the doctors. When the system started 30 years ago, it was supposed \nto be 50-50. Now the percentage that beneficiaries pay is 31.5 percent. \nThat means taxpayers pay 68.5 percent. That means my son and daughter, \nwho are not wealthy by any means but they have jobs, they are helping \nto subsidize the wealthiest persons' Medicare--they help pay 68.5 \npercent of the Medicare premium of the wealthiest persons in America.\n  We are trying to make some changes in that. One, we try and keep the \nperk \n\n[[Page S17081]]\nat 31.5 percent under our proposal. Anybody that has looked at the \nproblem of financing Medicare says that the Medicare beneficiary should \nprobably pay at least 31.5 percent. Here you have the President of the \nUnited States saying that is an outlandish increase in Medicare \ncopayments. No, we were trying to keep the percentage at 31.5 percent.\n  People should know the country's law says it will drop to 25 percent. \nShould it drop to 25 percent when it is going broke? We are trying to \nkeep it at that level. Is that an unfair attack on senior citizens to \ngive rich people tax cuts as was alluded to on the floor? Definitely \nnot.\n  As a matter of fact, we passed a provision that says any increase \nbetween the 25 percent and 31.5 percent, 100 percent of that goes into \nthe part A trust fund, which is going broke. Any of the changes that we \nmade in part B, any of the changes we made as increased contributions--\nand we say wealthier people--we will drop off the subsidies. If they \nmake over $150,000 or something, they have to pay 100 percent of their \nMedicare payments. We will eliminate the subsidies for wealthier \npeople. I believe that subsidy phaseout begins at $60,000 for an \nindividual and $90,000 for a couple. We say above those amounts --and \nit takes $50,000, I think, to get to where there is no subsidy--we say \nabove that amount people should pay their own.\n  I think that is a good proposal. Why should our kids be subsidizing \npeople who have incomes of over $150,000? That is a good proposal. Does \nthat wreck the Medicare system? No. It helps save the Medicare system. \nIt reduces the subsidy that a lot of people are paying for people who \ncan well afford to pay for their own.\n  I want to make a couple of comments concerning the stopgap spending \nmeasure that we in Washington, DC, call a continuing resolution. The \nPresident vetoed one that we sent him the other night, on Monday night. \nI wish he had not. He vetoed it because of the part B, and he \ndemagogued it and maybe scored some points. It might have helped \nelectionwise, but it was bad policy for him to do that. I regret that.\n  What else did he veto? I met with the negotiators yesterday. And I \ncompliment Senator Domenici and Congressman Kasich. And we met with Mr. \nPanetta and Secretary Rubin representing the administration, we said we \nwill not mess with Medicare. We say what we really want is a commitment \nto balance the budget in 7 years. So we want to pass a continuing \nresolution, a stopgap spending bill, that will allow Government offices \nacross the country to stay open, but we want a commitment from them to \nbalance the budget in 7 years.\n  Mr. Panetta said that is not acceptable. Why? Because we want to use \nCongressional Budget Office economics because we feel those are more \nrealistic than the Office of Management and Budget, than the \nPresident's economic figures. They said it was not acceptable. I will \njust remind you, Mr. President, that the President of the United States \nin a speech in the House of Representatives, in a State of the Union \nspeech, said that he would use Congressional Budget Office figures. He \ndid not want smoke and mirrors. He did not want to play games. He said, \nlet us use the same numbers. There was a big round of applause.\n\n  Now the President does not want to use the Congressional Budget \nOffice. You say, what difference does that make? I will tell you. Over \na 10-year period of time it makes $475 billion difference, the \ndifference in economic assumptions. So you are talking about a lot of \ndifference. That is twice what we are talking about for changes in \nMedicare and so on. So we are talking about a significant difference.\n  The President says we can balance the budget just by having greater \neconomic expectations and so on. We are saying, no, let us use \nrealistic numbers, let us use the same numbers the President said he \nwould use 2 years ago. So that is what we are saying. Then we said we \nwant to balance the budget in 7 years.\n  President Clinton, as a candidate in June 1992, said we can balance \nthe budget in 5 years. In the last 4 months, he has said we should \nbalance the budget in 10 years, 9 years, 8 years, 7 years, and more \nthan 7 years. He said all the above. We believe it should be done in 7 \nyears.\n  Do we know what is right? Why did we pick 7 years? Because, when we \nhad a balanced budget amendment on the floor of the Senate, we said we \nwould balance the budget by the year 2002, and we said we would try to \ndo it whether we had a balanced budget amendment or not. We happened to \nthink that was the right thing to do. We should balance the budget. \nThat is what this is all about.\n  Do we want to fund Government? Do we want to shut Government down? \nNo. Do we want to pass a responsible short-term spending resolution? \nYes. But we also want the President to start working with us to balance \nthe budget. And, so far, he has been AWOL: absent without leadership. \nHe has not been at the table.\n  His negotiators have said, send us a bill, we will veto it, and then \nwe will negotiate. Why should we not negotiate now? Why should we not \ntry to solve the problems now, not later, but now? We have not been \nable to get anybody's attention in the White House to make it happen. \nWe want it to happen. We want to save Medicare and we want to balance \nthe budget and we want to be able to give American families tax relief.\n  Then I just have to answer the claim that I heard two or three times \nby my colleague from Massachusetts, when he said Republicans want to \nmake all these changes, they are cutting all this spending, and they \nwant to do it so they can give their wealthy friends tax cuts. I \ndisagree.\n  Are we cutting spending? Not really. Today we are spending $1.5 \ntrillion. In 7 years we are going to spend almost $1.9 trillion. \nSpending rises every single year.\n  Do we slow the growth of spending? Yes. Do we curb the growth of \nentitlements? Yes. Have we done that before? For the most part, no. \nCongress has never really had the courage or the leadership to slow the \ngrowth of entitlements, and some entitlement programs have been \nexploding. So now we are saying, let us control their growth. In most \ncases, like Medicare, it is growing at over twice the rate of \ninflation. But we can do that and balance the budget, moderate their \ngrowth and save Medicare.\n  All the savings in Medicare go in to help save the Medicare fund, so \nMedicare reductions in growth have nothing whatsoever to do with tax \ncuts. But we are saying we can make this slope. We can actually make it \nhappen, balance the budget by the year 2002, and allow American \nfamilies to keep more of their hard-earned dollars.\n\n  Over 70-some-odd percent of our budget, 75 or 76 percent, is directed \ntoward American families. The bulk of that is the $500 tax credit per \nchild. Most all that--we passed it in the conference--it comes out to \nindividuals who make less than $70,000 or families who make less than \n$110,000. So we target it toward working families who are paying taxes. \nThen they can use that.\n  If you have two kids, that is $1,000 a year. If you have four kids, \nthat is $2,000 a year. If you have an income of $24,000, you will not \npay any income tax. If you have income of $30,000 with two kids, we \njust cut your tax in half. If you have income of $40,000, we just cut \nyour income tax by a fourth. If you have income of $75,000, we did not \nreduce your tax very much percentagewise, but we still allow that \nperson to have $2,000 more. If they have four kids and they can send \ntheir kids to college, that will help them make that decision. People \nwill be able to make that decision, not Government. To me, that is very \nprofamily.\n  We do some other things. We have some IRA enhancement so people can \nbe encouraged to save. We have some inheritance tax changes so people \ncan be encouraged to build a small business and pass that on to their \nchildren and grandchildren. There are some very positive things in this \nbill that I think would be supported and should be supported by both \nDemocrats and Republicans, and we do it in a responsible fashion.\n  Mr. President, I have been here for 15 years and we have never voted \nfor a balanced budget. We have never voted for the implementing \nlegislation to make it happen. Now we are talking about doing it.\n  Granted, the White House does not want to participate. They do not \nwant it to happen. But we are really serious \n\n[[Page S17082]]\nabout making it happen. We want to balance the budget.\n  To me, this battle is not about who wins, Democrats or Republicans. \nIt is who wins as far as our children are concerned. Are we to continue \npiling up debt after debt after debt?\n  The President's budget, according to CBO, has $200 billion deficits \nas far as the eye can see. For 7 years, 10 years, it is over $200 \nbillion and climbing. That is not acceptable. That is not realistic. It \nneeds to be changed.\n  We are trying to convince the President he is going to have to \nnegotiate with us to get us to a balanced budget. He says he is for a \nbalanced budget; he just does not have one. We are producing one, and \nhopefully in the next couple of days we will vote on one.\n  Mr. President, I am optimistic. I hope the President and his advisers \nwould quit saying ``what makes me look better in the polls'' instead of \nsaying what is right for America. I know some of the President's \nadvisers, and I know they know we can never ever get to a balanced \nbudget unless we start curbing the growth of entitlements, which is \nabout $1 trillion out of a budget today that is $1.5 trillion. They \nknow you cannot say we are going to balance the budget and only work on \na third of the budget. They know you have to work and really look at \nthe entire budget, and that is what we are trying to do.\n  So I urge the President--I hope we send the President a short-term \nspending bill tonight. I believe the House will be taking up one soon. \nThat bill will be a continuation--it will be a short-term spending \nbill, and it will also have language that we should balance the budget \nwith real economics by the year 2002.\n\n  I hope the President receives that bill tonight. I expect he will \nreceive that bill tonight, and I hope he will sign it. Thousands of \npeople can go back to work and we can go back to work and we can finish \nour business, and that business should include balancing the budget. To \nme, that is not a victory for Republicans or Democrats; it is a victory \nfor Americans. That is what we should be doing. That is what this \nCongress has been working on for the most part of this year, and now it \nis coming to a crisis point; it is coming to a head. Now is the time to \ndo it. In my opinion, if we send the President a clean CR with language \nthat we should be balancing the budget in 7 years, he should sign it, \nand I hope he will.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/15/senate-section/article/S17080-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17082-S17083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           A BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Oklahoma has \nhit upon the real issue. I think it is important that we get back to \nthe real issue, focus on the real issue, what all this complex debate \nis about. It simply boils down to whether or not we want a balanced \nbudget--whether or not we want a balanced budget. All the discussion, \nall the debate, all of the figures, all of the back and forth--do we \nwant a balanced budget, and what are we willing to do to achieve it?\n  Everybody says they want a balanced budget. Everybody gives lip \nservice to a balanced budget. We came close to passing a constitutional \namendment, lacking one vote, to balance the budget, and everybody said \nwe do not need a constitutional amendment. All we have to do is balance \nthe budget and do the right thing. The day of reckoning now has come, \nand we are challenged to do the right thing.\n  Why does everybody admit that we have to have a balanced budget? It \nis because of the simple fact we are in the process of bankrupting the \nnext generation. The fact we say it over and over again, like water \nrolling off a duck's back, does not make it any less true.\n  That is what is happening. That is why many of us ran for office. \nThat is why many of us came here--not because we want to say no to \nanybody; not because it will not be more comfortable to have business \nas usual, continue the same programs, the same levels of spending, and \nmaking everybody happy; not because of that but because we realize that \nthere was going to be some heavy lifting to do. That is a challenge for \na serious person.\n  I like to think there are a lot of serious people addressing this. \nNow the very people who are crying the loudest over students--who are \nthe purported defenders of the elderly and all of the other people who \nthese large deficits are hurting and creating a Nation and an economy \nthat will hurt them because of the deficit presided over this last 30 \nyears with the lack of a balanced budget--perhaps can tell those of us \nwho have not been here that long why, if they are concerned about all \nof these little people, they allowed this country to get into the shape \nof a $5 trillion debt. They say, ``Well, the Republicans were in the \nWhite House part of that time.'' That is true. The Democrats controlled \nthe Congress almost all of that time. And that is true.\n  And half the time that I listen to the debate here it is ``who shot \nJohn?'' Who is the bigger person that is the most blameworthy in all of \nthis debate? We have to get past that. We have to get past this idea \nthat one side is for the average person and the other side is not.\n  The real issue here is whether or not we want to balance the budget. \nThe President says now that he wants a balanced budget. But the \nAmerican people are gradually going to focus in on the fact that the \nPresident, and those that are supporting the President in this deadlock \nthat we are in right now, are twisting and squirming and maneuvering \nall the time they say they want a balanced budget to do everything in \nthe world to avoid a balanced budget. Why would they want to do that? \nBecause, if we have a balanced budget, we cannot continue to spend the \nway that we have been spending for the last 30 or 40 years in this \ncountry. And everybody likes to spend.\n  In all of the congressional hearings we have up here nobody comes up \nhere and testifies, ``Please cut out our grant.'' Nobody comes up here \nand testifies that ``we get too much money.'' Everybody loves spending. \nEverybody wants a little more. Everybody wants their nose in the \ntrough, and everybody has been there for the last several decades in \nthis country. Now we have to decide not who is going to give lip \nservice to a balanced budget but who is willing to do what is \nnecessary.\n  The fact of the matter is that the irony is if we act now, if we do a \nresponsible thing now in order to get a balanced budget, a major step \ntoward a balanced budget, we do not have to engage in draconian \nmeasures. We can make some incremental adjustments. We will be spending \nmore money.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma pointed out that over a 7-year period we \nwill be spending more money--$1.9 trillion in this country. We do not \nhave to hurt anybody. But we have to get to our job. We have to start \ndown that road toward what everybody says they want. Everybody wants to \ngo to Heaven. Nobody wants to do what is necessary to get there.\n  The President now has figured out, apparently, how we can balance the \nbudget without really making any incremental adjustments. He decided to \nturn his back on his own figures that he said he wanted--the \nCongressional Budget Office figures over all these years to let his \nstaff come up with new figures, and they produced about a half a \ntrillion dollars out of thin air because they changed the estimates. \nThey changed some estimates, projections, and figures and said, ``Well, \nwe do not really have to do anything.'' Of course, that will get them \npast the next election, will it not? It will get them past the next \nelection before that little house of cards comes tumbling down just \nlike every other projection in this country over the last decade has \ncome tumbling down.\n  We are trying to use real figures over here. The President said \nduring the campaign that he had a plan to balance the budget in 5 \nyears. Then when he is submitting his budget, everybody kind of looked \nat it, and said, ``Well, that is $200 billion a year of deficits as far \nas the eye can see.'' They kind of acknowledge that was the case.\n  Then the President said, ``Well, we need to balance it maybe in 10 \nyears.'' Then, since that time, he has been at 7 years, 8 years, and 9 \nyears, too, I think. I do not think he has gone back to 5 years, or \nanywhere along the line.\n  Then he submitted another document purported, I guess, to be a budget \ndocument that has the new figures in it. Lo and behold, we really do \nnot have to make many adjustments at all because we have this windfall \nover $400 billion \n\n[[Page S17083]]\nbecause he is using the figures now that he derives from his own staff. \nBobbing, weaving, turning, and twisting all the time saying he wants a \nbalanced budget but every few days coming up, ``Well, we can do it in \nthis number of years,'' changing to, ``No. We can do it in that number \nof years.'' One of his advisers, Ms. Tyson, who says somewhere along \nthe line we do not really need to have a balanced budget. It would hurt \nus to have one. The next day, I guess we really do. But we should not \nhave it before 10 years.\n  Are these the comments, are these the actions, of a serious leader \nwho really wants a balanced budget? Are these the actions of someone \ntrying to get past the next election giving lip service to a balanced \nbudget but not willing to do one thing--not willing to say to anybody \nthat we cannot continue your program with a 10 percent increase a year, \nwe can continue it maybe at 6.4 percent? I think the answer to that is \nclear.\n  But the President bobs and weaves, twists and turns, and now his \nlatest impasse when legislation was sent down with the Medicare \nprovision is that he cannot go along with the submission because it is \nraping Medicare, and we are trying to do all of these terrible things. \nA person dealing with the complex issue who is willing to use scare \ntactics--and he has the most bully of all pulpits--is going to win that \nargument in the short run because you can scare people on these \nimportant matters and complex issues. It takes a while for it to set \nin. But the truth does set in, and it will set in just like on his \nhealth care plan.\n\n  The President now says with regard to Medicare part B--and everybody \nacknowledges that Medicare is in terrible shape, and going bankrupt--\nbut he wants a temporary reduction in premiums until the next election, \na temporary reduction in premiums when he and all of his advisors have \nacknowledged in times past that premiums are going to have to be \nincreased. What is the difference between the increase that we are \nsaying is going to be necessary to save it and the increase that the \nPresident says is necessary? Four dollars by the year 2002; a $4 \ndifference. We are $4 higher than he is.\n  If he can convince the senior citizens and get them so excited, and \nappeal to the worst instincts of the American people in terms of greed \nand selfishness, that they are not going to be willing to make any \nincremental adjustment, even to the extent of $4 for the benefit of the \nnext generation, then I guess this is a hopeless cause. But I do not \nthink we have come to that point yet.\n  But this is what he is trying to sell. This is what he is trying to \nsell at a time when it is going bankrupt, at a time when everybody \nknows we have to make some incremental adjustments. Between now and \nnext November he wants actually those premiums to be able to decrease \nat a time when everybody knows they have to go up a little bit, and \neven acknowledges it but he is waiting until after the election to do \nit.\n  Why resist the balanced budget this strongly? Because spending is a \nhard habit to break. I guess there is nothing more attractive \npolitically in this entire world than the proposition and the idea of \nbeing able to have your cake and eat it too. And if the American people \ncan be convinced that the President really wants a balanced budget but \nthat we really do not have to do anything in order to achieve it, and \nthat anybody who suggests we have to make incremental adjustment is \nagainst students, or against his own parents, or against retirees--if a \nperson is willing to play that game, he is going to make some points. \nBut he is not going to win because I think people understand that is a \nshort-term game, and that we have a long-term problem; and that, if we \nwill face up to what we need to do, we will have to make some short-\nterm adjustments but we will have some long-term benefits that will \ninure to the benefit of our children and our grandchildren that we will \nbe extremely proud of.\n  The Heritage Foundation just this month issued a report using a \nwidely regarded model of the U.S. economy and found that balancing the \nFederal budget between 1996 and 2002, and cutting taxes, caused the \neconomy generally to grow more than not balancing the budget and \ncutting taxes. According to this simulation that they used, the \nbalanced budget plan with tax relief would mean that gross domestic \nproduct would grow by $10.8 billion more than under current law by the \nyear 2002. If we balanced the budget, we would get an additional $32 \nbillion in real disposable income over that period of time. If we \nbalanced the budget, we would have an additional $66.2 billion in \nconsumption expenditures over that period of time. If we balanced the \nbudget, we would have an additional $88.2 billion in real \nnonresidential fixed investment over that period of time.\n  If we balanced the budget, we would have a decrease of four-tenths of \n1 percent in the conventional mortgage rate in this country. That means \nthat a balanced budget with tax relief will save a home borrower of \n$100,000 about $10,000 over the life of a 30-year mortgage. If we are \nconcerned about working people and middle-income people in this \ncountry, we need to balance the budget. People out here trying to buy a \nhome, seeing their wages stagnated, young working people's wages \nactually going down, interest rates being what they are, trying to \nborrow, what are they going to be if we do not balance the budget? The \ntax rate, some say, will be 70, 80 percent if we do not balance the \nbudget--astronomical interest rates.\n  Here is the result if we do balance it: additional construction of \nover 104,000 new family homes over the next 7 years; the additional \nsales of 100,000 automobiles over the next 7 years worth $10 billion, \nand a decrease of 7 percent in the growth rate of the Consumer Price \nIndex, a decrease in the Consumer Price Index for things that average \npeople go to K-Mart, Wal-Mart, or whatever, and buy.\n  It is not all gloom and doom. It is not all gloom and doom. We are \ngoing to have to reduce the rate of growth in some of these programs \nwithout question. But after that, we stand to see real long-term \nbenefits in this country.\n  So again, Mr. President, let us get back to the real issue. The real \nissue is whether or not we really want to balance the budget in this \ncountry and whether or not we really want to give any more than lip \nservice to it. We are at a point now where we are either going to put \nup or shut up.\n  The President of the United States needs to know that there are many \nof us here who would like to work with the President. We would like to \ndo this thing together. I think ultimately we are going to have to do a \nlot over the next several years to get this job done. It is not a 1-\nyear deal. Ultimately, it is going to have to be Democrats and \nRepublicans together, it is going to have to be the Congress and the \nWhite House. I would like to get on about that. But if he is going to \ncontinue to stand in the way of what we all know has to be done, he \nought to know there are some people in town who are just as stubborn as \nhe is. And if we were not willing to finish the job we came here to do, \nwe would not have taken the job in the first place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/15/senate-section/article/S17082-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17083-S17084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON.

Mr. President, those who are watching the debate on \ntelevision might wonder why it was that it took us so long to get to \nthis point. Actually, this Senator had sought recognition, the Senator \nfrom Arkansas was about to seek recognition, when we were suddenly cut \noff with the quorum call. I am glad that the Republicans have come back \nand seen the light to allow us at least to discuss a proposition that \nis very vital to America.\n  As I understand it, we are awaiting the offer by Newt Gingrich from \nthe House of Representatives. It would be a continuing resolution to \nsome time in the future, maybe 10 days, maybe 15 days, and stripped of \nall other extraneous matters except--I underline except--the \nproposition that we would have a balanced budget by 7 years using CBO's \nestimates.\n  That is exactly what was proposed to us yesterday during a conference \nthat I was a part of. I will simply say to you, Mr. President, that \nthis Senator is for balancing the budget in 7 years. I voted for a \nconstitutional amendment to do that. The record of this Senator in \nfighting for control of spending in the United States and getting our \nbudget under control is very clear, if not legendary.\n  I would simply say, if we accept the continuing resolution that the \nRepublicans have come up with, I would simply compliment them and \ncompliment them and compliment them for the fact, after we have been \npounding this podium now for almost a month, that they have finally \nconceded that they are not going to insist on making cuts in the \nMedicare proposals. At least that would be a major victory for us. And \nI salute them for finally recognizing the failure of their ways in that \nregard.\n  However, I would say, Mr. President, that if we accept the continuing \nresolution, then that continuing resolution is essentially what the \nRepublicans offered to us yesterday, which was rejected by the \nadministration and, I suspect, will be strenuously objected to by the \nmajority of the Democrats. This is a shell game that is going on \nbecause, if we accept this continuing resolution, had we Democrats and \nthe White House accepted yesterday this same offer that was offered to \nus in the daylong negotiations, we would essentially be locking in the \nRepublican budget that they are trying to force down our throat and \nthat of the American people.\n\n  They would essentially have guaranteed the $245 billion tax break for \nthe wealthy. They would essentially guarantee a dramatic cut in the \nprojected spending of Medicare. They would continue the unfairness that \nis part and parcel of their budget. What this continuing resolution is, \nas I understand it, is another clever means--another clever means--of \ntrying to fool the American people.\n  I emphasize that this Senator is for a balanced budget in 7 years. \nAnd as the Democratic leader on the Budget Committee, I am fashioning \nsuch a program that I will offer at an appropriate time. But I am not \nabout to sign on, and I hope none of the Democrats will, and enough of \nthe Republicans--to stop it. If they do not, the President will veto \nit, in any event.\n  I want to explain what they are doing. They are trying to put into \nlaw in the continuing resolution the basic unfairness of the budget \nthat they are proposing. I would also point out, Mr. President, that \nall during the so-called budget deliberation, the Democrats have not \nbeen involved. I am a member of a conference with the House of \nRepresentatives on four matters: the debt ceiling; debt rescission bill \nthat we hope to receive sometime tonight that they want us to vote on \neven before we see the numbers; the matter of the line-item veto, which \nI joined with the Republicans in getting passed, but after we passed it \nthey wanted to make sure that this President did not have a line-item \nveto until they got their unfair budget bill passed; and I am also a \nconferee on the defense authorization bill, which is a very, very \nimportant matter.\n  I would simply say that in all of these matters, Mr. President, I am \na conferee, but I have not even been conferenced by the Republicans. \nThey have gone behind closed doors, shut out the minority Democrats, \ndone what they want, stamped ``Republican fairness'' on it, and sent it \non its merry way.\n  Mr. President, there is so much wrong with the procedures that are \ngoing on in the U.S. Senate today that I am ashamed, and I would best \ndescribe it as ``a swamp.'' It is not part of the deliberative body \nthat this body has been known for for a long, long time.\n  To sum up as best as I have ever seen it summed up was an editorial \nin U.S. News & World Report, that of November 13, 1995, by David \nGergen. I am going to read that, Mr. President, because I think it puts \nall this in proper perspective. It exposes this once and for all by \nDavid Gergen, who is now an editor at large with the U.S. News & World \nReport, but is better known as a very prominent Republican who served \nwith great distinction in the White House under President Ronald \nReagan.\n  Here is what he has to say in the editorial of the date I mentioned:\n\n                    The GOP's ``Fairness Doctrine''\n\n       Give credit where ample credit is due: True to their \n     campaign promises, Republicans in Congress are forcing the \n     country toward a balanced budget. Only once since the \n     Eisenhower presidency has the nation written its ledgers in \n     black ink. Now, doing what Democrats would not, the new GOP \n     majorities are trying to restore a habit of self-discipline.\n       But in the eagerness to satisfy one principle, fiscal \n     responsibility, the Republicans would ask the country to \n     abandon another, equally vital, principle--fair play. This is \n     a false, cruel choice we should not make.\n       When George Bush and then Bill Clinton achieved large \n     deficit reductions, we pursued the idea of ``shared \n     sacrifice.'' Not this time. Instead, Congress now seems \n     intent on imposing new burdens upon the poor, the elderly and \n     vulnerable children while, incredibly, delivering a windfall \n     for the wealthy.\n       Proposals passed by the House and Senate would rip gaping \n     holes in the nation's social safety net, already low by \n     standards of advanced nations and once considered sacrosanct. \n     Consider how much Congress would extract from projecting \n     spending for key social programs over the next seven years: \n     $169 billion from Medicaid, $102 billion from welfare, $27 \n     billion from food assistance, $133 million from Head Start, \n     at least $23 billion from the earned income tax credit--a \n     program enacted in the 1970s that Ronald Reagan called ``the \n     best antipoverty, the best pro-family, the best job-creation \n     measure to come out of Congress.''\n       This assault doesn't even count the $270 billion reduction \n     in projected spending for Medicare that is frightening senior \n     citizens and could further squeeze public hospitals. Nor does \n     it include the possible elimination of federal standards for \n     nursing homes--standards signed into law by Reagan to stop \n     rip-offs of the elderly.\n       Now consider how our more fortunate citizens make out under \n     these proposals:\n       Left largely unscathed are billions in subsidies, tax \n     loopholes and credits for corporations.\n     \n[[Page S17085]]\n\n       Left largely untouched are many sacred cows--such as the \n     mortgage interest deduction--that benefit middle- and upper-\n     income groups.\n       And for sweeteners, Congress would throw in $245 billion of \n     tax cuts (especially wrongheaded because well-to-do Americans \n     aren't seeking them while hard-pressed Americans won't \n     qualify for them).\n       U.S. News reported last week that internal studies by the \n     executive branch estimate that the lowest 20 percent of the \n     population would lose more income under these spending cuts \n     than the rest of the population combined. At the other end, \n     the highest 20 percent would gain more from the tax cuts than \n     everyone else combined. Republicans are probably right that \n     these estimates, coming from Democrats, are skewed. But no \n     one disputes the basic contention that the burdens and \n     benefits are lopsided. In a nation dividing dangerously into \n     haves and have-nots, this is neither wise nor just.\n       Arguments advanced by proponents simply aren't persuasive. \n     States will take over many of the social programs, it is \n     said, and will make the poor whole. Huh? Who believes that in \n     this climate state legislatures will raise taxes to help poor \n     kids? Many of these social programs are broken, it is said, \n     so they must be overhauled. True, there are many abuses, but \n     we should protect the truly needy while we punish the greedy. \n     Sometime tomorrow, it is said, balancing the budget will help \n     everyone in the younger generation. True, but why shouldn't \n     we all share the same sacrifices today?\n       Ronald Reagan is often invoked as the patron saint of this \n     revolution. How soon we forget that as president, Reagan \n     insisted that seven key programs in the safety net--Head \n     Start, Medicare, Social Security, veterans, Supplemental \n     Security Income, school lunches and summer jobs for youth--\n     would not be touched; now, six of those seven are under the \n     knife. Reagan believed, as he said in his memorable address \n     accepting his party's nomination in 1980, that ``we have to \n     move forward, but we're not going to leave anyone behind.''\n       That sentiment should guide upcoming budget negotiations \n     between Congress and the White House.

Mr. President, I thank the manager for the time, and I \nthank the Chair.\n  I think the people of America must be getting pretty tired of this by \nnow. My hunch is they are. My hunch is, in real-life America, they are \nsaying, ``What are these jerks up to?'' That means the President, that \nmeans the people in Congress, that means all of us. That is what we are \nlooking at.\n  And they must be just numb, as we are sitting here arguing about \nwhether to go 4 or 5 bucks more a month on a program which is called \npart B premiums on Medicare, which is voluntary anyway. You do not have \nto belong. I mean, it boggles the mind.\n  One of the fascinating things about coming to the Senate is the \nexperience of living in two realities. There is one that you actually \nlive, and there is another one that you read about in the papers. That \nis an interesting one, too. Sometimes I wonder if, indeed, there is any \npossible correlation between the two.\n  A case in point is this current standoff, this Government shutdown. \nThe headlines and the television would indicate that it is nearly--\nnearly--the same as Three Mile Island, which was back in 1979. That got \na lot of hysteria. The plume was supposed to be floating towards \nWashington to paralyze us all in our sacks at night. This is the kind \nof stuff that goes with this business. Any time you have 24-hour-a-day \nnews, you have to find the news to stick in it, and, boy, they stick it \nin.\n  This confrontation about the budget has inspired the media to new \nheights of hysteria, about the President bringing the Government to a \nhalt. They say, ``No, no, the President didn't do that; the Congress \ndid that.'' I would like to remind my colleagues about a fact or two, \nbecause one can watch all the television, read the newspapers in utter \nvain until your eyes pop out of their sockets and see the television \nuntil you get a migraine, and you will never hear described what has \nreally happened here.\n\n  What has happened is that the President decided to shut down the \nGovernment. I hope you heard that. We in the Congress sent him \ncontinuing resolutions, called CR's--you have heard that before--to \nkeep it going. And he said, no, that he was going to shut it down.\n  There are people lobbying the Congress now about this matter trying \nto pressure us into ``doing something about it.'' Someone does not \nrealize what has happened. We cannot force the President to sign our \nresolutions to keep the Government operating. I hope you hear that. He \ndoes, indeed, have the power to shut the Government down, and he has. \nIt is not something which can be changed by lobbying the Congress.\n  So that is just one little item that seems to have glanced off the \nsimian skulls of many of the Nation's media for reasons quite unclear \nto me.\n  Here is another one. The President decided to veto our first \ncontinuing resolution, he said, because of a necessary measure to \nmaintain Medicare premiums at a constant fraction of program costs.\n  Just a few raw facts about that particular action. Fact 1: The \nPresident himself, his very self, endorsed increases in Medicare part B \npremiums. Has anybody missed this, that the President of the United \nStates has asked for these? And they are within $5 of where Republican \nbudgets have been headed. I hope that everyone will hear that one.\n  Medicare part B, fact 2, was originally structured so the \nbeneficiaries pay 50 percent of the program costs and the general \ntaxpayers the other 50 percent. We have now let it slip to 31 percent, \nand if we did not take that action to arrest that decline, it would \nhave dipped to 25 percent next year, meaning that we would have raised \nthe effective taxes on the American public up to 75 percent of all of \nthis program cost.\n  That was the action that the President was demanding when he blocked \nthe Medicare provision. He was demanding that we increase the \ntaxpayers' contributions to the program to 75 percent of the overall \nprogram costs. That is called raising people's taxes.\n  Guess who is paying the taxes? Thirty-one percent is paid by the \nbeneficiary, regardless of their net worth or their income in a \nvoluntary program. No one can refute that. I challenge anyone.\n  So 70 percent, 69 percent paid by Joe Six-Pack and now the President \nwants to have Joe Six-Pack paying 75 percent of the premium and doing \nthings for the little guy? The drinks are on me.\n  Fact 3: Taking that action, blocking that measure will vastly worsen \nthe deficit outlook in the years to come, because it would require the \nGovernment, that is, taxpayers, and I hope somebody has that figured \nout, who this Government is, to spend more and more on Medicare part B \nthan it otherwise would. So the President was making a stand here for \nhigher deficits. I guess that is what he wanted to do.\n\n  Fact 4: The President did not do this to protect Medicare \nbeneficiaries from Republicans--evil Republicans--for he had already \nendorsed restraints on the growth of Medicare that are almost exactly \nthe same as Republicans have. This President said he wanted a 7.1 \npercent annual growth limit in his own package, his budget, just \nassumptions--at least he said 7.1. What do Republicans want to do? Let \nit go up only 6.4. So we are seven-tenths of 1 percent apart and \nshutting down the Government.\n  So let us not be bamboozled into thinking that this was some \nprincipled stand, if you will, to hold Medicare harmless.\n  Fact 5: The President got his own way. We offered him a clean \ncontinuing resolution, no Medicare provision. Yet, he has kept the \nGovernment shut down. So what are we and the people to make about all \nof this? I would opine that the President has forgotten one essential \nfactor needed for a man who \n\n[[Page S17086]]\nintends to stand on principle: There has to be a principle there to \nstand on.\n  What does he want now? What will convince him to let the Government \noperate again? We have offered him a clean continuing resolution, if \nonly he will work with us to balance the budget in 7 years. He said he \nwanted to balance it in 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10--pick one, any one. That, my \ncolleagues, is the sticking point. The administration will not agree to \nthat.\n  The President would sooner keep the Government shut down than to work \nwith us--while stockpiling mountains of debt upon our children and \ngrandchildren--at least until after November 1996. Then there will be \nlots of scurried action, you bet, patching together a limping Nation, \nbut not until after November 1996. The President is hung up over a \ncouple of requirements. One is that he does not want to agree in \nadvance to a deadline for a balanced budget. That, very simply, is \nbecause he simply has no plans to balance the budget. Thus, he refuses \nto be held to any standard which would require that this be done.\n  The other serious problem he has is that if he refuses to adopt the \nstandards which he himself previously had endorsed--even demanded and \nrequired--and that is a certification by the Congressional Budget \nOffice. He well knows that if real numbers are used, if the books are \nnot cooked, then none of his own proposals will be judged to balance \nthe budget and will never see the light of day. And he is out, then, on \nthe statement he made at the State of the Union Address a couple of \nyears ago when he said, ``Let us use CBO numbers, ladies and gentlemen, \nno more phony numbers. Let us use Congressional Budget Office.'' And \neverybody cheered. What numbers do we use now? OMB. I know that sounds \nlike inside baseball. I call it deception.\n\n  That is the problem. The President is saying: Let me cook the books, \nlet me avoid any deadline for balancing the budget, and I will set \nGovernment running again. That does not sound like much of a principled \nstand to me.\n  Let us try to look at this from the President's point of view for a \nmoment. Consider what would happen if he did agree to try to balance \nthe budget in 7 years, using real numbers, without gimmicks and \nchicanery in the books, and without assumptions and all the stuff we \nhave seen both administrations use for decades; then he would have to \nagree with the Congress as to making really tough decisions. Then he \nwould have to take a long, hard look at what is really happening in \nMedicare, and that it is going broke. His own trustees are telling him \nthat--people he appointed, people of the stature of Robert Rubin, \nRobert Reich and Donna Shalala. He would have to give up the \npretending.\n  He would have to give up the posturing and the pretending that he is \nthe great defender of unlimited spending on the poor, the elderly, the \nveteran, the downtrodden, everybody. He can choose to pose now as their \ngreatest protector because he is held to no standard at all of \nbudgetary responsibility--none. But if the standard is required of him, \nthen suddenly he cannot continue to say what he has been saying, that \nhe can shield these vulnerable folks from evil depredations and balance \nthe books all at the same time.\n  So that is where we are. This whole Government shut down as a result \nof a gap between the administration's rhetoric. They claimed to want to \nbalance the budget 18 times in one speech yesterday, and they \nsimultaneously claim that no favorite political constituency in this \nland, not a single sacred cow, needs to be touched. On the other hand, \nthe reality is that some severe, very tough choices have to be made in \norder to balance the budget. The American citizens know it, and \neverybody in this Chamber knows it.\n  As soon as the administration is held to an honest standard of \naccountability, this gap will be exposed. And, politically, the \nadministration simply cannot bear to face that. So they are going to \nkeep the Government shut down.\n  This is a curious version and vision of leadership. The \nadministration will not be able to play this game forever. It will be \ngreat for a short period of time. It is going to be a lot of fun. They \nreceived a temporary boost from playing the Medicare political card. \nBut I do not think in any long-term way the public will believe that \nrefusal to commit to balancing the budget is any worthy or worthwhile \nlesson or reason to shut down the Government of the United States for 5 \nbucks a month on a program that is voluntary, which in any other \nsociety would be called an income transfer, because 70 percent of it is \npaid by Joe Six-Pack, and 30 percent of it is paid by the beneficiary, \nregardless of their net worth or income. No wonder the people think we \nare nuts.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes. There is so \nmuch to be said on this subject and not very much time. I want to begin \nby following up on what my good friend from Nebraska, Senator Exon, \nsaid a moment ago. I do hope that we do not have any further abuse of \nthe rules by trying to silence the minority and put in a quorum call \nand object to it being called off, because there are Senators on this \nside who want to speak. That is the kind of things they do in Third \nWorld nations, Mr. President.\n  We are a body of Senators who are supposed to be deliberating. We \ncannot deliberate if we do not get the floor to speak, and we cannot \nspeak when this place is in recess. We all know what is going on here. \nThere is an obvious effort to silence people. I am not going to be \nsilenced. I am like Patrick Henry--I'm willing to sit here all night to \nsay what I am going to say.\n  The other thing the Senator from Nebraska brought up is that no \nDemocrat--not one--has been invited to participate in a conference on \nthe so-called budget reconciliation bill. We are not even permitted in \nthe room. The first time, probably, in history, that the minority has \nbeen completely shut out of conference. I have only been here 21 years, \nbut it is the first time I have ever seen anything like it in my life. \nNormally, when the House and Senate pass different versions of a bill, \nthey select conferees--and there are more Republicans when they are in \ncontrol and more Democrats when we are in control. The conferees \nresolve the differences between the two bills and they send the \nconference report to both Houses.\n  This body is going to be asked to vote on Friday on the budget \nreconciliation bill, on which not one Democrat has even been offered \nthe opportunity to amend, or even offer an amendment. So when the \nPresident says, no, I am not going to accept the Republican so-called \n7-year budget balancing act, it is not because he does not favor a \nbalanced budget.\n  I heard the Senator from Tennessee earlier tonight say that is what \nall of this is about. I say to all Senators, if that is all this were \nabout, we would be recessed and home by now.\n  The President wants a balanced budget. The House and the Senate want \na balanced budget. The American people want a balanced budget. But the \nPresident is not going to sign a bill with garbage on it which has no \nplace on it. And he is not going to sign a bill which commits him to a \nreconciliation bill that is absolutely devastating to the values of \nthis country.\n  What are we doing? Here is that sacred document called the \nConstitution. It is the reason we are still a free nation. What does it \nsay about the Presidency? Just so you will not think I am making this \nup, I will read it.\n\n       Every Bill which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a \n     Law, be presented to the President of the United States; if \n     he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it \n     with his Objections to that House in which it shall have \n     originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their \n     Journal.\n\n  The mother tongue is English. I just read, in English, the \nConstitution which says if the President approves, he will sign it. If \nhe does not approve it, he will send it back.\n  I will not take the time to read the rest of it, but then it says the \nbill shall go back to the House where it originated and that House \nshall vote to override the President's veto by a 67 percent vote. And \nif they do it, it will be sent to the other House.\n  What are we doing here? The President vetoed the continuing \nresolution. There is no effort to override it. They \n\n[[Page S17087]]\nhave an AK-47 to the President's head, saying, ``You will accept a $20 \nbillion cut in school lunches; you will accept a $40 billion cut in \neducation; you will accept a $270 billion cut in Medicare; you will \naccept a $182 billion cut in Medicaid; you will accept a $32 billion \ncut in the earned-income tax credit; you will accept a $245 billion tax \ncut for the wealthy.''\n  People on this floor stand up and solemnly talk about a tax credit \nfor our children. Let me tell you about the tax credit for our \nchildren. The people who work in this country who have children do not \nget it. If that is the House Speaker's idea of a revolution, deliver me \nfrom it. I hope the Speaker keeps using that term revolution. It scares \npeople. It scares me.\n  When I hear people talking about a revolution, I might also say there \nare a lot of people who have never received the full benefits from the \nfirst revolution. And an awful lot of them do not want the benefits of \nhis revolution, including me.\n  This is not about who wants a balanced budget. This is who believes \nin elemental values of fairness. What the reconciliation bill says is: \nEight percent of the people cheat. Let us kill the whole program. Put \nanother 1 million people in poverty by adopting the welfare reform \nbill. Educate 1 million fewer children in college by cutting student \nloans and student grants. So far as that child tax credit is concerned, \nMr. President, listen to this. They act as though the parent of every \nchild in America is going to get a $500 tax credit. Mr. President, \nthere are 5 million households in this country, with 11 million \nchildren, that will receive part or all of the $500 tax credit.\n  Listen to this. There are 8 million households with 15 million \nchildren who will not get one dime, not even a nickel. Who are they? \nWho are these 15 million children? I will tell you precisely who they \nare. They are the people who ought to get a tax cut because they are \nfrom the families who do not make enough money to even pay income tax. \nA husband and wife that make $20,000 a year and pay no tax won't \nbenefit from the so-called family tax credit. If you pay no tax, you \nget no refund. What kind of value is that?\n  I have never seen so much political chicanery in my life. It is \nscary. Some of the things that have gone around here have been \nabsolutely shameless.\n  I know exactly where we are headed. We are headed to the point where \nthe people in this country are beginning to get nervous about the \nSpeaker's revolution. They are uneasy.\n  I tell you, the election a week ago yesterday was not that big a \ndeal. We Democrats got some satisfaction out of it. To me, that \nelection just simply said we are not sure this is what we voted for in \n1994. We want a balanced budget but we did not know you were going to \nassault the elderly and the poor children by cutting school lunches, by \ncutting education funds, by cutting funds for the elderly, by a $182 \nbillion cut in Medicaid which affects the health care of the poorest \nchildren in America. Mr. President, the Republican budget would impose \na $2.6 billion Medicare cut on my little State of Arkansas. I promise \nyou we will be lucky to even have a program worthy of the name \nMedicaid. We cannot do it if you cut $2.6 billion, and for what? For \nthis miserable, for this awful $245 billion tax cut which the wealthy \ndo not want and which the poor will not receive.\n  So I can see it coming now. The polls are going to continue to show \nthe President doing very well and the people getting terribly upset \nabout what we have done here. So what will happen? We will bring up \ndesecration of the flag. That will take their mind off of it. Everybody \nloves the flag. And everybody is for prayer in school, so we will bring \nup prayer in school. That will get their mind off of it.\n  Is it not interesting? I have fought a line-item veto ever since I \nhave been in the Senate, and this year I lost. We passed a line-item \nveto, and what happens? There happens to be a Democrat in the White \nHouse and we cannot get anything done.\n  What about term limits? Everybody was for term limits as long as the \nDemocrats were in charge. Now all of a sudden term limits are not such \na hot idea. I wonder if that has anything to do with the Republicans \ngaining majorities in the House and Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would like to remind the Senator \nfrom Arkansas he has consumed 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself--we have 18 minutes \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have 17 minutes 45 seconds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/15/senate-section/article/S17086-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17087-S17088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE FACTS\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield myself 9 minutes.\n  Mr. President, sitting here I was planning on what I was going to \nsay, and talk about how we were going to balance the budget over the \nnext 7 years. It is very difficult to sit here and listen to some of \nthe inaccuracies that were being put forward on the floor. It is \namazing to me. We should have a debate that talks about what the facts \nreally are.\n  The Senator from Arkansas said 15 million children are not going to \nbenefit as a result of the child tax credit. What he did not tell you \nis those 15 million children have parents who pay no income tax. In \nfact, the majority of those--first, for all of those 15 million \nchildren, their parents receive an earned-income tax credit, most of \nwhich is not to pay them for the income tax they pay. They paid no \nincome taxes. But it is to pay them for their Social Security taxes \nthat they pay. And in the majority of cases it is to give them money \nbeyond even their Social Security taxes. So, to suggest we should then \ngive them an additional $500, it is how much welfare you want to \nprovide?\n  What we have done is, people who earned the earned-income tax credit \nand who pay no taxes, they are going to be at least as well off, if not \nbetter off than what they would be under current law. Those who do pay \ntaxes will get a $500 tax credit, or a portion thereof, depending how \nmuch they pay in taxes. If they only pay $300 in taxes they will get a \n$300 tax credit.\n  Again, I guess it is statistics. There are lies, damned lies, and \nstatistics. There is a statistic that, if you listen, on the face you \nwould say, ``Boy, this is not fair. We are not helping out the poor \nfolks here in this country who need help.''\n  Wrong. We have the earned-income tax credit that does just that. This \nis for families who pay taxes. That is what the tax credit is for, for \nfamilies who pay taxes. I just wanted to set the record straight on \nthat.\n  I would like to step back and take a look at where we are right now. \nWhere are we? The Government is shut down. What does that mean? That \nmeans all nonessential personnel are not showing up for work and have \nnot been showing up for work. I found it somewhat remarkable that 99 \npercent of the Department of Housing and Urban Development are \nnonessential. That makes you think about what they do over at the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, that 99 percent of them \nare not essential. Mr. President, 89 percent of the Department of \nEducation are not essential and 67 percent of the Department of \nCommerce are not essential.\n  One has to stop here and think. If all this is so important, how can \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development, almost everybody \nthere--the only reason it is not 100 percent at HUD is because \npolitical appointments are deemed essential. Other than that, I guess \neverybody at HUD could go home.\n  This is where we are. Government is shut down. Why? I can tell you in \na word why. It is because the President of the United States has \nrefused to come to the table and negotiate on how to balance the \nbudget. That is what this all about, all this clamor, Medicare this and \nthat. The Senator from Wyoming was completely eloquent on the \ndemagoguery that is going on with the Medicare part B premiums. But the \nbottom line is the reason Republicans and Democrats have not sat down \nat a conference to get a balanced budget resolution to the floor is \njust that the President of the United States has simply refused to \nparticipate in those discussions.\n\n  No one on the other side of the aisle has offered any kind of hope \nthat they are willing to participate themselves in \n\n[[Page S17088]]\nthis discussion to get to a balanced budget. Oh, you hear that I am for \na balanced budget. Everybody is for a balanced budget. But wishing does \nnot make it so. You have to make decisions. You have to come to a \nconclusion on how we are going to do it.\n  All we are trying to get from the President right now in a CR, which \nis the spending bill that we are going to be considering probably later \ntonight, is a commitment from the President that he will agree in the \nnext few days to sit down and negotiate a balanced budget over the next \n7 years using real numbers--not phony, rosy scenario numbers, not \ngimmicks, not smoke and mirrors, but the real thing, the thing he said \nhe was going to use. That is what we said we wanted. That is not much.\n  That is exactly what the Senator from Arkansas said he is for. He is \nfor a balanced budget. Let us get a balanced budget. Let us do what we \npromised the American public. Let us do what President--then \ncandidate--Clinton promised the American public, that he had a plan to \nbalance the budget in 5 years. Three years have gone by--no balanced \nbudget. And how about 10 years? That is what it has been since the \nPresident said he could do it in five. That is all we are asking. That \nis where we are. I know there is a lot of confusion out there.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is correct. The people are being scared to \ndeath out there. If I listened to the Senator from Arkansas very long, \nI would be scared too. You would think everything is going to collapse \naround here. Well, the fact of the matter is that most of America has \ngone on pretty well the last couple of days. Life is OK. And we have a \nserious problem. Those of us who are here trying to solve that problem \nbelieve it is important to stand our ground and to do what is right--\nwhich is a balanced budget. That is not to say that we should not \ncompromise. We should. We should sit down and discuss a balanced budget \nover the next 7 years. We will sit down with the President. We will \nassess his priorities. He will assess ours. But we need to do that. We \nneed to sit down and start negotiating on how we are going to get \nthere.\n  My goodness, we owe it. I have three young children, a 4-year-old, a \nlittle boy who is going to turn 3 this weekend, and a 5-month-old \nlittle boy. I cannot go home every night and look at them. I just \ncannot go home and look at them and say, ``Well, we are going to \ncontinue to spend more money. You are going to have to work more hours \nwith probably less take-home pay than people are making today and have \nless opportunity, less chance for advancement, because I just could not \nmake tough decisions because I was afraid that someone was going to \nvote against me or the polls said, you know, people do not like what we \nare doing. I am sorry. If anybody in this country who has listened to \nthis can look at their children or grandchildren and say that extra $5 \na month means your future, that is just that important to me, I do not \nthink anyone can do it.\n\n  This is a historic time in our country. I had a gentleman who saw me \noutside on the way in. He has been sitting up in the galleries biting \nhis tongue for the last 3 days listening to all of this. He suggested \nin a letter that he gave me that we should do what the Founding Fathers \ndid in Philadelphia when they were working on the U.S. Constitution, \nthat we should take a day off, sit and ask God to help us and \nintervene, and we should pray about it, and we should have a \nreconciliation. Maybe that is a good idea. Maybe we should get rid of \nall this rhetoric around here--all of these charges and \ncountercharges--and think about what this country was founded upon. \nThink about how important this great experiment is to the world, and \nhow all of this politics--that is what it is, folks; this is just all \npolitics being played--how all this just is not necessary.\n  We are not that far apart. I mean, we really are not. It is amazing, \nif anybody--I do not know if any of the news publications have done \nthis--would take a look at where the President wants to go, at least \nhis public statement, and where we want to go. The Senator from Wyoming \nsaid we are seven-tenths of 1 percent away on Medicare spending. I \nmean, that is a few billion dollars a year out of a program that is a \n$250 billion program. You do not think we can come together on \nsomething? Of course we can.\n  Welfare reform--I have been working on welfare reform for 3 years on \nthis bill. We have a bill in conference that is very similar to the \nSenate bill, one that the Senate passed 87 to 12, and one that the \nPresident said he would sign. That is going to be in the reconciliation \nbill. It is something he should sign. We are not far apart. There may \nbe a few minor differences in welfare, but not substantial. It has \neverything the President campaigned on. It is in that bill. Tax cuts--\n--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair reminds the Senator from \nPennsylvania----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will take 45 additional seconds.\n  We are close together on tax cuts. He says he wants a tax cut for \nmiddle-income families. I talked before. We say EITC increases for next \nyear and the year after. That is included in our budget, with the \nexception of families that do not have children. But if you have a \nchild, you are going to get those increases.\n  We have a middle-income tax. Ninety percent of our tax cut goes to \npeople under $100,000.\n  I think my friend from Wyoming may have a good idea. We ought to \nstart thinking about what our calling is here and the great experiment \nthat we have in this country, and can the politics. Let us get down to \nthe substance, because on the substance we agree. We are not far apart, \nand we hope we agree that balancing the budget is the best thing for \nthis country.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I understand that I have 7 minutes. I ask \nunanimous-consent that I be granted 3 additional minutes and 3 \nadditional minutes on that side as well.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. That just shows you \nthe kind of cooperative spirit we have when the Senator from California \nasks for 3 additional minutes and that the unanimous-consent request \nasks for an additional 3 minutes for the other side. That that would be \nobjected to is extraordinary.\n  Mr. COATS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. On your time. I only have 7 minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. We were informed that an agreement was made with the \nleaders, the majority and minority leaders, that an hour of time would \nbe allocated, 30 minutes to each side, and that Senator Dole would then \nrecess.\n  May I suggest that the Senator from California take her 7 minutes. We \nwill check to see if that can be extended, and perhaps additional time \ncan be added on, an equal amount on each side, while she is speaking.\n  (Mr. SANTORUM assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend very much because I do not think 6 \nminutes in a day like today is going to make or break the U.S. Senate. \nThat is why I asked equally for each side.\n  Mr. COATS. It may not. But since there was an agreement between the \nleaders, we have to check with them.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I absolutely have no problem with that at all. I thank \nthe Senator very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/15/senate-section/article/S17087-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17088-S17089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECONCILIATION AND THE BUDGET\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, when you took to the floor, you talked \nabout your obligation to your children. I relate to that very much \nbecause I raised two of them, and now I am a grandmother. That is what \nthis debate is all about. You are exactly right. It is about our \nchildren, and it is about what life in America is going to be like for \nthem.\n  I grew up in the years when I was able to get the American dream. I \ncame from a very middle-class family. Actually, my mother never \ngraduated from high school, and I am in the Senate because I got a free \neducation, because I played by the rules of the game, because I had a \ncommunity that was safe to grow up in and a caring community it was. I \ngrew up in an inner city. \n\n[[Page S17089]]\n\n  So that is what this debate is all about. It is about the Presiding \nOfficer's children and my grandchild and generations to come.\n  I find it very interesting; on the one hand we hear a new cry: All we \nwant is a little bit different than the President. All we are talking \nabout is incremental change. That is what the Senator from Tennessee \nsaid.\n  Well, gee, I have listened to the Republicans. They are talking about \na revolution--a revolution--not incremental change. And it is a \nrevolution to allow Medicare to ``wither on the vine,'' to quote Newt \nGingrich. He says he was talking about HCFA. He was talking about \nMedicare. Even all the analysts agree--wither on the vine. The majority \nleader bragging to a group that he led the charge against Medicare.\n  So let us not take to the floor and say one thing one day: It is a \nrevolution, and another thing another day: No, no, it is just that we \nwant to balance the budget.\n  Today the majority leader made a very eloquent speech in which he \npraised Republicans for their courage. He said the polls are not going \nour way, but we are courageous. And I think that the majority leader \nclearly sees it that way. But I have to ask a question: What is \ncourageous about shutting down the Government? What is courageous about \ncutting Medicare by $270 billion and giving the money to the wealthiest \namong us? What is courageous about gutting education and environmental \nfunds and, frankly, repealing nursing home standards? What is \ncourageous about loading down the temporary debt extension and the \ncontinuing appropriations bills with extraneous matters such as \nregulatory reform, habeas corpus reform, and my all-time favorite, a \ndebt limit extension for a few weeks that says to the President, ``Your \nhands are tied on the debt crisis. You cannot do anything but \ndefault.''\n  That is really swell. When I was a stockbroker on Wall Street, I \nwatched the market shift, and so far they do not believe anything is \ngoing to happen, but I can tell you we are playing with fire here. For \nthe greatest nation in the world, the dollar is under stress right now. \nThe markets are wondering. S is looking at us for bond ratings. The \ninternational bond raters are saying we are on the watch list.\n  Swell. Real courageous. I say it is outrageous, and it is a \ndereliction of our duty. What is courageous about not doing our job? \nWhat is courageous about thousands and thousands of American workers \nbeing sent home, workers who have to care for their families. They, \ntoo, I say to the Presiding Officer, have beautiful little children \njust like you, and you do, and you adore them, and these workers adore \ntheir families. They do not know if they are going to get paid. As a \nmatter of fact, they will not get paid until this mess is over, even if \nthey are essential. And if they are nonessential, who knows.\n\n  That is a dereliction of duty that is not courageous. So I hope we \nget off of the self-congratulatory binge around here, whether \nRepublicans or Democrats, because a pox on everyone for this mess we \nare in. There is nothing courageous about this continuing shutdown, \nabout Congress not passing its appropriations bills. Let us not try to \nblackmail the President with a budget that destroys Medicare and \nrewards the wealthy. The fight should take place over the budget bill, \nnot over these short-term extensions and trying to force the President \ninto signing something that makes it impossible for him to negotiate. I \ndo not know how else to say it except, ladies and gentlemen, we do have \na Democrat in the White House, the Republicans control the Congress, \nand we better work together and not tie each other's hands. Come to the \ntable clean.\n  I ask a question: Why should we get our pay when thousands of other \nFederal employees are not getting theirs? Why should we get our pay? It \nis not fair. We passed here in this Senate the Boxer-Durbin bill that \nessentially says if there is a shutdown, Members of Congress and the \nPresident will not get our pay and we will not get it back \nretroactively. And some of us have begun doing something about it. But \nthis is about institutional failure.\n  I was here when we all voted for congressional accountability, and we \nsaid we are not above the law; we are going to be treated like \neverybody else. And yet we are the only Federal employees who are \nguaranteed their pay even though there is no appropriations bills \nsigned into law for this function.\n  I do praise the leadership of the Senate; in a bipartisan way, \nSenators Daschle and Dole, they came together. They supported this. But \nover there on the House side Speaker Gingrich is blocking a vote as we \nspeak. I hope people will call Speaker Gingrich.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I hope they will tell him to support the Boxer-Durbin no \nbudget-no pay bill. It is not courageous for us to take our pay and cut \noff everybody else's.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/15/senate-section/article/S17088-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17089-S17090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CALLING THE PRESIDENT'S BLUFF\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, what we are faced with here very shortly is \nessentially calling the President's bluff. We sent him a continuing \nresolution that would keep Government open, keep those workers working, \nkeep the functions of Government going forward, and the President \nvetoed it, he said, because it was loaded with extraneous material. \nThere were items on there that promoted the Republican budget, promoted \nthe Republican plan to redefine some of the functions of Government, \nand therefore he could not accept it. But give him a clean CR, so-\ncalled clean continuing resolution, that is what he needed. That is \nwhat he wanted. We had all kinds of injunctions from 1600 Pennsylvania \nAvenue about giving the President just a clean bill.\n  Now, the President campaigned in 1992 vigorously on the proposal of a \nbalanced budget in 4 years, some say 5. It might have been 5. The \nPresident has kind of been all over the lot on this. But 4 or 5 years \nis almost irrelevant here. The President said this country needs a \nbalanced budget, and if I am elected, I will deliver a balanced budget.\n  He also campaigned vigorously on tax relief for middle-income \nfamilies with children, saying it is a disgrace that they are so \nshortchanged in our Tax Code; the costs of raising children are \nincreasing dramatically; we need tax relief for middle America.\n  That was 1992, and that was the campaign. Subsequently, we have not \nseen delivered from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue a balanced budget that is \nscored as a real balanced budget. It was the President himself in his \nfirst address to a Joint Session of Congress after he was elected who \nlooked at the Republican side with a big smile on his face and said we \nare going to use the numbers certified by the Congressional Budget \nOffice because they are nonpartisan and they are not politically \nmotivated as are the numbers from the Office of Management and Budget, \nwhich is the President's own budgeting people.\n  Now, all that the Republicans are asking for, and I assume will come \nover from the House of Representatives, we hope this evening, is what \nthe President has said he wants: a continuing resolution which will \nbring back Federal workers to work tomorrow morning, which will \ncontinue the functions of Government. There is only one condition \nattached to it, and that is the condition that the President campaigned \nfor and the President now has asked for, and that is a balanced budget.\n  We are saying, Mr. President, we will allow Government to go forward \nfor a period of time while we resolve the details of a balanced budget. \nAnd unlike the 4 years or 5 years that you campaigned for, we will \nallow 7 years in order to accomplish this fact. That is all we are \nasking. And we are attaching it to this continuing resolution as a \ncondition because, frankly, that is the only way we can bring the \nPresident to the bargaining table.\n  We have heard nothing but excuse and obfuscation from the White House \nand from the President, from Democrats, our friends across the aisle. \n``Oh, yes, we're for a balanced budget, but not this one.'' Well, I \nhave been here 15 years, and that is all I have heard from the party \nacross the aisle. ``We're for a balanced budget, but not this one. We \n\n[[Page S17090]]\nneed to talk some more. We need to negotiate some more.'' That is all \nwe have been doing this year in this body.\n  Democrats say they have not been invited to the party. They have been \nat the party now for 10 months. We have debated every item that we are \ntalking about in reconciliation. We talked about the tax cut, we talked \nabout the changes to Medicare, to Medicaid, to welfare, to every aspect \nof the budget. Everybody knows what the details are. The fact of the \nmatter is, there are people who want to maintain the status quo. They \nare the party of government, big government, ever-growing government. \nIt is their ticket to political success, they think. And there are many \nof us who feel that our debt is of such a staggering proportion, and \ngrowing at such an extraordinary rate, that this is the moment and this \nis the time where, if we do not grab a hold of it now, it may be too \nlate.\n  So we have put a plan together to balance that budget. What we hear \nfrom the other side of the aisle is nit-picking about portions of this \nplan. And so we have said, ``All right, Mr. President. We will set that \naside and we will simply, in return for continuing the functioning of \ngovernment, we will simply ask you to agree to sit down with us and \nnegotiate a plan to balance the budget in a 7-year period of time, \ncertified by the very accounting agency, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, that you asked us to use.''\n  So I do not know how much more we can give the President. We have \nessentially given him everything he has asked for. And so we are going \nto find out whether or not the President is really interested in \nbalancing the budget, is really interested in keeping the promise he \nmade to the American people in his campaign for the Presidency. We are \ngoing to put this on his desk and say, ``Mr. President, we have now \ngiven you what you asked for. If you really believe this, sign the \nbill, and we're in business. If you veto it, we'll all know where you \nstand.''\n  The bluff is going to be called. It will be called very quickly. And \nthe American people will fully understand just who is willing to put it \non the line for a balanced budget and who is not willing to put it on \nthe line for a balanced budget. So we will know now in about the next \n24 hours or so just who is upfront and who is straight out with the \nAmerican people about the agenda that is best and good for this \ncountry.\n  I think everyone instinctively knows we cannot continue on the path \nthat we are on. To continue on that path is bankruptcy for this Nation. \nRepublicans are saying, ``It's time to draw the line to make the tough \nchoices, to balance the budget. Mr. President, why don't you join us?\"\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to designate a portion of the Red River in Louisiana \nas the ``J. Bennett Johnston Waterway,'' and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n        the j. bennett johnston waterway designation act of 1995\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today, with respect and admiration \nfor my colleague from Louisiana, the Honorable J. Bennett Johnston, in \norder to introduce legislation which will designate part of the Red \nRiver the ``J. Bennett Johnston Waterway.''\n  Senator Johnston's diligence in serving the people of Louisiana for \nclose to 30 years more than justifies this legislation and should be a \nreminder to those of us who have had the honor to serve in the Senate \nwith him and to all who will serve here in the future what the word \n``service'' truly means.\n  The work that Senator Johnston has done to rebuild and rejuvenate the \nRed River and the communities that depend on it exemplifies the \nstrength of his leadership and his commitment to the economic \ndevelopment of Louisiana.\n  For years, the many bends and excessive sedimentation in the Red \nRiver made it unnavigable to the barges and ships necessary for \ntransporting local goods. The economy of the region that depended on \nthe Red River became depressed.\n  Senator Johnston has worked successfully for the last 22 years \nhelping local communities and organizations obtain the funding \nnecessary to create a modern waterway. As a result of this success, old \nand new businesses are moving back into the area, job opportunities are \nsprouting up again, and the hope that accompanied a new economic \ndirection is taking root in the region.\n  In fact, the Army Corps of Engineers estimates that $107 million in \nbenefits will be generated annually and approximately 56,000 new jobs \nwill be created in 40 years. Other benefits include cleaner water, \nimproved and increased recreational use, the possibility of \nhydroelectric power in the future, and potential for greater \nagricultural utilization of the river.\n  Local organizations and residents recognize the positive growth \nresulting from this project as well as the substantial role Senator \nJohnston played in making this growth a reality. In fact, it was local \ncitizens who requested this naming legislation.\n  The many people who have worked with Senator Johnston over the years \nknow he was the key to this project's success and want to honor him for \nall that he has done to make the waterway a reality.\n  Each time we navigate the river, each time we use it to recreate and \neach time we realize economic benefits from the river, we will forever \nbe mindful of the man whose unyielding leadership and dedication made \nit all possible, my colleague, my friend, and my senior Senator, the \nHonorable J. Bennett Johnston.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HELMS (for himself and Mr. Faircloth):\n  S. 1413. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nrequire that an application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nfor a license, license amendment, or permit for an activity that will \nresult in a withdrawal by a State or political subdivision of a State \nof water from a lake that is situated in two States shall not be \ngranted unless the Governor of the State in which more than 50 percent \nof the lake, reservoir, or other body of water is situated certifies \nthat the withdrawal will not have an adverse effect on the environment \nin or economy of that State, and for other purposes; and the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                 THE LAKE GASTON PROTECTION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, today Senator Faircloth and I are \nintroducing the Lake Gaston Protection Act of 1995. The States of North \nCarolina and Virginia have been locked in a dispute for a decade as to \nwhether the city of Virginia Beach should be able to withdraw water \nfrom Lake Gaston, which straddles both States.\n\n  Our bill stops the withdrawal of water from the lake until Federal \nofficials listen to the concerns of countless thousands of citizens of \nboth North Carolina and Virginia.\n  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [FERC] approved a permit \nallowing the daily withdrawal of 60 million gallons from Lake Gaston--\nbut the FERC officials did not look closely enough at the potential \nnegative environmental effects of withdrawing 60 million gallons a day \nfrom the lake. In short, they failed to consider either the \nenvironmental problems or the adverse impact on striped bass and other \nfish species. A sharply reduced quantity of water flowing through the \nlower Roanoke River basin may very well be harmful to the estuaries of \nthe Albemarle Sound in the spawning of many fish species.\n  And, Mr. President besides the environmental impact, the withdrawal \ncould very well pose dire consequences to the commercial and \nrecreational fishing industry that depends so heavily on an adequate \nexchange of fresh water and salt water in the estuary.\n  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should have obtained \ncertification from the State of North Carolina that there would be no \ndegradation of water quality or the environment. Instead, FERC ran \nroughshod over the concerns of North Carolina.\n  Mr. President, Senator Faircloth's and my bill would require FERC to \nobtain certification from North Carolina that this project will have \nno, and I emphasize, no adverse impact on the environment or the local \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, for the record, I believe a brief history of this \ndispute may be helpful.\n  Virginia Electric Power Co., on behalf of Virginia Beach, applied to \nthe FERC for permission to construct a water intake on Pea Hill Cove of \nLake Gaston and a 76-mile pipeline to withdraw up to 60 million gallons \nper day.\n  Both the City of Virginia Beach and the State of North Carolina have \nmarched back and forth in the Federal courts over this issue. North \nCarolina raised many concerns of water quality and the adverse effects \non the downstream ecosystems. North Carolina officials assert that FERC \ndid a far too hasty job on its environmental analysis. FERC allowed \nonly 2 months for the review of the reams of environmental data.\n  Furthermore North Carolina asserts that FERC staff failed to conduct \nstudies requested by several Federal agencies, including the EPA, U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service, National Marine Fisheries, and independent \nbiologists.\n  After much litigation, a Federal mediator was appointed by the \nFederal courts within the past 18 months, to look into the possibility \nof bringing the State of North Carolina and the city of Virginia Beach \nto an agreement on the issue.\n  A final settlement agreement was reached on June 26, and was \nsupported by both Virginia Senators. I have a copy of a letter signed \nby both Senators to the Governors of North Carolina and Virginia in \nsupport of the agreement. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nletter be placed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the settlement was subject to ratification \nof an Interstate compact by both State legislatures and approval by the \nCongress. According to the officials in North Carolina, this agreement \nprotects the interests of the three North Carolina counties that \nsurround the lake. As of now, neither State has ratified the compact.\n  The communities that surround the lake in Northampton, Warren, and \nHalifax Counties in North Carolina are greatly dependent on it to \nsupport their economies. According to a November 2, 1993, article in \nthe Lake Gaston Gazette, property owners around the lake paid over $253 \nmillion in 1993 real estate and personal property \n\n[[Page S17092]]\ntaxes. Also it is estimated that there has been $125 million in new \nhome construction each year.\n  Mr. President, North Carolina and Virginia have a history of \ncooperation on matters affecting both States. For example the joint \nNorth Carolina and Virginia efforts to stem Lake Gaston's having been \ninfested by hydrilla, an aquatic weed similar to kudzu. These five \ncounties and both State governments have worked together to bring this \nnuisance weed under control.\n  If Virginia and the city of Virginia Beach object to this \nlegislation, there is a way out; this proposed law will not apply if \nand when the June 26 settlement is resurrected and there is an \ninterstate compact. So each State can urge its Governor and legislature \nto ratify the agreement and the compact. This will give everyone a \nchance to take a second look at North Carolina's environmental \nconcerns.\n  This legislation is narrowly drawn to apply only to this particular \nsituation and would not adversely affect our western friends.\n  We realize how sensitive our western friends are on the issue of \nwater rights. Senator Faircloth's and my staffs have consulted with \nnumerous experts in western U.S. water rights and have been assured \nthat this legislation exempts western water projects.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1413\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

We also pledge our support to \n     the proposed Interstate Compact should it be passed by the \n     General Assemblies of Virginia and North Carolina and if the \n     settlement becomes effective and is not terminated by the \n     parties after action by the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission (FERC) on VEPCO's application.\n       Following enactment by both state legislatures, it is our \n     intention to promptly introduce the Compact in the United \n     States Senate and take every appropriate action to obtain the \n     expeditious consent of the Congress to the Compact.\n       With kind regards,\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles Robb.\n     John Warner.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Helms \ntoday in introducing a bill to help resolve a long-standing dispute \nbetween Virginia and North Carolina over Lake Gaston, a lake spanning \nthe border between our two States. The dispute concerns Virginia's \nplans to construct a water pipeline from Lake Gaston to Virginia Beach \nfor that city's municipal use--60 million gallons a day.\n  I am disappointed that this disagreement has come to the point where \nwe must introduce legislation. Last spring the two States came very \nclose to resolving the issue and actually had a settlement ready, \nsigned, and waiting for ratification by the States and the Congress. \nUnfortunately, logistical problems prevented the settlement from being \nclosed by the Virginia State legislature before their adjournment. Soon \nafter they adjourned, however, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \napproved a permit allowing for the project to proceed. Of course, with \napproval in hand, Virginia was refused to return to the negotiating \ntable. They simply have a permit. As it now stands, the citizens of \nNorth Carolina and the residents of Lake Gaston have lost the water \nwithout any agreement whatsoever between the States on how much water \ncan be withdrawn from the lake, and other critical factors.\n  Mr. President, it is wrong for the Federal Government to allow this \npipeline to take millions of gallons of water from Lake Gaston and \nNorth Carolina without North Carolina's approval and agreement. It is \nonly fair that a project with this kind of impact should proceed only \nafter an agreement has been reached between the two States--especially \nwhen an agreement is very nearly at hand--until the Federal Government \nwent ahead and issued the permit.\n  Reasonable restrictions should be in place and agreed to by both \nStates, such as the amount of water that can be withdrawn each day. The \nimpact of withdrawing millions of gallons of water from the Roanoke \nRiver Basin is, frankly, unknown and in dispute.\n  I am particularly concerned about the impact the new pipeline will \nhave on the economy of North Carolina. Many industries and towns depend \non water from the Roanoke River. The property owners around the lake \npaid nearly $250 million in property taxes this year alone. What \nhappens, Mr. President, when all this water is diverted to Virginia \nBeach? Even if the effect right now may not be severe, it could hamper \ngrowth in the future. You simply will lower the lake level to a degree \nwhere it will be unattractive. No one can tell with any certainty what \nthe effect will be on the local economy, but predictions from \nhomeowners and others are that they will be severe.\n  The environmental effects are equally unknown. Every day people are \nturned down for wetland permits by the Federal Government because of \nrelatively minor environmental impacts. But here, with lake Gaston, \nwhere we are talking about an enormous and unprecedented impact on \nwater flow and quality--and the agencies let the permit sail on \nthrough. The environmental impact study--which sometimes drag on for \nyears--took only 3 months to sail it through.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is there are simply too many questions \nto allow this project to proceed over the objections of North Carolina. \nToo much is on the line here. An agreement is just around the corner if \nwe give it a chance and give it time.\n  Senator Helms and I are representing North Carolina as a whole, the \nState legislature, the State house, the State Senate, and the Governor. \nIn North Carolina we are totally unified as to what should be done--and \nthat is not build a pipeline until an agreement is reached. An \nagreement is at hand, and around the corner. With some help here today \nit can be reached.\n  We look forward to working with the Senators from Virginia to \nconclude it, and to bring it to a proper conclusion.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Helms, Mr. \n        McConnell, and Mr. Gramm):\n        \n[[Page S17093]]\n\n  S. 1414. A bill to ensure that payments during fiscal year 1996 of \ncompensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities, of \ndependency, and indemnity compensation for survivors of such veterans, \nand of other veterans benefits are made regardless of Government \nfinancial shortfalls: to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                         VETERANS' LEGISLATION\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, Senator Simpson and I are \nintroducing legislation today to make sure the veterans of this country \ndo not worry about their pension payments being made, in case the \nGovernment continues to be shut down, by November 21 or November 22. \nMadam President, of course we hope this will not happen. We hope the \nPresident will agree to a balanced budget, and that we can do our \nresponsibility to the people of this country and pass the first year of \nthe 7-year march to a balanced budget.\n\n  But the administration has chosen to tell veterans that they will not \nbe paid; that they are not a priority payment. We are introducing this \nlegislation to force the administration to pay veterans benefits, just \nas the administration would pay any other mandatory benefits that \npeople have earned. Our veterans have earned their benefits. It is a \nmandatory payment. This legislation should not be necessary but for the \nposition the administration has taken.\n  I am pleased to introduce this bill with Senator Simpson and I yield \nthe time I have left to Senator Simpson to talk about the importance of \nmaking sure that veterans are not going to have to worry, that their \npension checks will be in the mail December 1.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \nmeasure. I think Senator Hutchison has well described what we are \ntrying to do. It seems extraordinary to me we would even be in this \nposition. The President could have had every opportunity to extricate \nhimself from the position. I think the reason it has come to pass is a \nvery simple one, and that is the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, a \nCabinet post, Secretary Jesse Brown, is acting and continues to act in \nan exceedingly and purely partisan mode.\n   On November 3, I rose in this Chamber to speak to an issue of \nparticular concern to me. At that time I spoke of what I feel to be the \nwholly inappropriate use by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs of \nGovernment computers and the VA employee pay stubs to convey a \nblatantly partisan political message to his 240,000 employees.\n  The consistent message Secretary Brown has been conveying has been \none of doom and destruction. Were one to listen to the Secretary, one \nwould believe that the whole system of veterans' benefits was in grave \njeopardy--a system put in place by a grateful Nation for those who \nfought and sacrificed that she may remain free. Indeed, in his morning \nmessage to employees that greeted them when they booted up their \ncomputers on the morning of November 9, he said no less.\n  That is just plain wrong. For it is simply not true. The budget \nproposed by this Congress--these evil Republicans--provides for a \ngrowth, that is, increase, of nearly $4 billion over the 7-year time \nperiod during which we seek a budget balance. That hardly smacks of the \nelimination of veterans' benefits as we know them. And during this time \nin which the budget for veterans will rise more than 10 percent, the \nnumber of veterans will be steadily falling from the 26.1 million \ncurrently living to approximately 23 million. Resources continue to \nincrease. The number of beneficiaries continues to decline. How anyone \ncan refer to that as the same draconian cut Secretary Brown keeps \nmentioning truly amazes and eludes me.\n  I want to say I have served as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee and have been a member of it for some 17 years, since 1979. \nSince that time I have seen many good, able men at the helm of the \nVeterans Administration, now the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  When I arrived, Max Cleland, that very spirited, brave young man, who \nhad lost three of his limbs in combat in Vietnam, was the Administrator \nunder a Democrat President. Following him, under the Reagan \nadministration, Bob Nimmo, a committed decorated bomber pilot of World \nWar II, served in that position. Then West Pointer and ``Lonesome \nEnd,'' Harry Walters was in that position. Then steady and reliable \nGen. Tom Turnage. With the elevation of the VA to Cabinet status my old \nfriend the affable and effective Ed Derwinski took the helm, and \nfollowing Ed, the exceedingly bright and conscientious former staff \ndirector, Tony Principi.\n  Never, during all of those years, and they include both Democratic \nand Republican Administrators, have I ever seen the role of \nAdministrator of Veterans Affairs or Secretary be used--and being used \nis the word I want to use here--for such blatant partisan political \npurposes, and being used in a way I would consider to be wholly \nembarrassing and demeaning.\n  In my remarks on November 3, I stated that the budget approved by the \nCongress was substantially more advantageous to veterans than the \nPresident's own. In an interview with Ruth Larson of the Washington \nTimes published on November 8, Secretary Brown himself acknowledged as \nmuch saying: ``He's (meaning me) absolutely right.'' Then he goes on, \nwith an apparently straight face: ``No problem. The President said I \ncan come back and ask for more next year.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of that article printed in the \nRecord, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, that is the way the budget process \nworks. Each year, every single agency head submits his or her own \nbudget request for that particular year.\n  The budget process starts in the fall of the year. The agencies \nsubmit their budget requests to the Office of Management and Budget. \nAfter some considerable back and forth, the budget of the \nadministration comes to us. When the Secretary says that he'll have a \nchance to ask for more next year--or that the President promises to \ntreat this veteran constituency fairly in the future, I am tempted to \nsay: ``So what. No big deal.'' Those are the very same rules by which \nevery agency operates. And indeed, I would imagine that the President \nhas committed to each of his Cabinet officers the very same thing \nsaying: ``Present your best budget to me, and I'll package that for \npresentation to the Hill.'' One notes in this form of articulation that \nthere are no promises made.\n  And really there can't be. The budget environment in which we are \noperating, to balance the budget as I personally would hope we do by \nthe year 2002, or the budget proposed by the administration which \nwould, under assumptions that are at the very best questionable, \nbalance the budget over a 10-year period. Either way, there are limits \non spending programs, and those limits will, of necessity, affect every \nsingle agency of this Government.\n  Indeed, Secretary Brown's criticism of the Congress assumes a \nstraight line freeze of the VA medical care budget. While, in fact, \nboth the Senate and House have approved significant increases.\n  Secretary Brown tells us the President will think about an increase \nnext year. Well, I remind him again. The Congress has delivered one \nthis year.\n  The true fact is, no country on this earth has been more generous \nwith its veterans than has ours. The very fact that the budget of the \nVA goes up some $4 billion over the next 7 years, while the population \nof veterans will decline by 3 million, seems to be a pretty powerful \nindication of our continuing commitment to veterans. In this climate, \nother agencies are suffering actual cuts. Many of those agencies have \nworthy constituencies as well. But the budget of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs is not being cut. It continues to grow, and indeed \ngrow at a generous rate as it has each and every year since my arrival \nhere in the Senate in l979. It was $20 billion then. It is almost $40 \nbillion now. Not a cut in a carload.\n  Madam President, would that the Secretary could simply acknowledge \nthat basic fact and then work with us to assure that the funds \nappropriated for the worthy purposes pursued by his Department were \nbest utilized. Unfortunately, he has taken the President's tack on \nthis. He is churning out the political message of the day as it is set \nforth by the White House in anticipation of the tough 1996 election \nyear. And he is doing it in various ways that I consider to be wholly \ninappropriate. \n\n[[Page S17094]]\n\n  It has recently come to my attention that part of this political \ncaper is done through the use of dedicated career civil service \nemployees of the Department who are directed by the Secretary's \npolitical underlings and henchmen to craft his message. Does one really \nbelieve that those messages flickering on the VA computer screen every \nmorning are the work of the Secretary himself? I do not think so. They \nare cranked in his Office of Public Affairs, as are the drafts of the \nmyriad political stump speeches he and his underlings deliver around \nthe country. I'm learning fast on that too--by having my fellow veteran \nfriends out there listening to those speeches. Those are often \noutrageous.\n  One VA employee has raised a concern with me regarding the fact that \nhe has been asked to further the White House political message line--\nalthough it has nothing whatsoever to do with veterans. Instructions to \njust send the political appointees out in the land--at Government \nexpense--with a canned speech in tow that could have been written by \nthe White House itself. And do always attack the Republican Congress \nand any budget it proposes. Do whatever you will--as long as it is \nconsistent with the White House media message of the week.\n  I too am a taxpayer, and I am offended. Indeed, this Nation's \nveterans are taxpayers as well, and they should be similarly offended \nthat their tax dollars are being used in this way.\n  I have nothing whatsoever against a Secretary extolling the splendid \nvirtues of America's veterans, exhorting his fine professional staff to \never higher levels of service to those who fought for this country, or \ngenerally informing both segments of society of information they need \nto effectively participate in this political process. What grievously \nappalls me is the blatant partisanship here exhibited. Doesn't seem to \nbother Jesse though.\n  Mr. President, Secretary Brown has referred to my criticism of him \nand of his message as outrageous.\n  Jim Holley, his media spin-master spokesman, has called it ironic as \nit would appear to be a criticism of the Secretary based on his \nadvocacy for veterans. Mr. Holley, surely misses the entire point. \nThere is a difference between advocating for our veterans, and pouring \nout rank political partisanship. What we see here is the latter.\n  Mr. President, I have no intention of holding back in my criticism of \nthe Secretary on this matter. As I have said before, I believe what he \nis doing is plain wrong. I do not condone that, nor should veterans.\n  It is unacceptable for political agencies to lobby. We have statutes \nthat prohibit that. It is equally inappropriate for an agency such as \nthis to encourage its employees and its constituency, albeit by \nimplication, to do that which they cannot legally do directly. And I \nshall keep expressing that message loud and clear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, I will continue to observe this process \nvery clearly and express my objections at every possible occasion.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Nov. 8, 1995]\n\n      VA Chief Terms ``Outrageous'' GOP ``Cheap Politics'' Charge\n\n                            (By Ruth Larson)\n\n       Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown said he will \n     continue telling his employees about the effect of \n     congressional budget proposals, despite congressional \n     Republicans' objections that he was engaging in ``cheap \n     politics.''\n       ``It's outrageous to suggest that the VA shouldn't tell its \n     240,000 employees that as many as 61,000 jobs are at risk, or \n     that 41 veterans hospitals may close,'' Mr. Brown said in a \n     telephone interview yesterday.\n       Sen. Alan K. Simpson, Wyoming Republican and chairman of \n     the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, on Friday blasted Mr. \n     Brown's use of VA computers and employee pay stubs to \n     criticize congressional budget proposals and warn of massive \n     layoffs at the department. He accused Mr. Brown of using \n     government resources to send out partisan misinformation.\n       Mr. Brown countered: ``I hope someone tells me that it's \n     not going to happen--that they're not going to lock in our \n     funding at 1995 levels for the next seven years. If somebody \n     would tell me that, I'd apologize--sure, I would,'' Mr. Brown \n     said.\n       Asked about Mr. Simpson's assertions that veterans would \n     suffer more under the Clinton administration's proposed \n     budget than under congressional plans, Mr. Brown said, ``He's \n     absolutely right.''\n       But he was quick to explain that statement. He said that \n     during the budget process, he'd gone to Mr. Clinton three \n     times to tell him that the administration's government-wide \n     cutbacks ``would have the same effect as what the Republicans \n     are proposing.''\n       Mr. Clinton assured him that he would be able to negotiate \n     the budget every year. ``I'll be sure the veterans are \n     treated fairly,'' he quoted Mr. Clinton as saying.\n       ``We aren't getting the same commitment from Congress. \n     There is no flexibility,'' Mr. Brown said.\n       Rep. Bob Stump, Arizona Republican and chairman of the \n     House Veterans' Affairs Committee, criticized Mr. Brown for \n     ``intentionally misrepresenting and needlessly scaring \n     vulnerable veterans'' about Republican budget proposals.\n       He said in a statement: ``The real hypocrisy lies with the \n     Clinton 10-year budget plan which takes nearly three times as \n     much from veterans' programs without balancing the budget.''\n       The Washington Times reported yesterday that some VA field \n     employees had complained that Mr. Brown's messages \n     represented ``political propaganda.''\n       Mr. Brown said he had sent out hundreds of daily messages \n     on a variety of subjects to his 240,000 employees. ``Out of \n     those hundreds of messages, [Mr. Simpson] chose three.''\n       Mr. Brown said he routinely runs the messages by his \n     general counsel ``to make sure they don't violate any laws or \n     ethics requirements, and they've all passed,'' he said. ``We \n     wouldn't do it if it weren't legal.''\n       Administration officials often defend the legality of their \n     actions by saying they stop short of urging employees to \n     contact members of Congress. For example, in one of his \n     messages, Mr. Brown cautioned, ``I am not calling on you to \n     act.''\n       ``No, not much,'' Mr. Simpson chided him on Friday. ``It \n     does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that many \n     employees might take that as a pretty good hint to take some \n     action.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill entitled ``Thrift Charter Conversion Act of 1995''; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                   the thrift charter conversion act\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am introducing today the Thrift \nCharter Conversion Act. I am introducing the bill exactly as it was \nreported out by the Subcommittee on Financial Services and Consumer \nCredit of the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services. I am \ndoing this in the spirit of cooperation exhibited during the House and \nSenate collaboration during the reconciliation process, particularly in \nrecapitalizing the Savings Association Insurance Fund--an action which \nwill increase public confidence in our Federal deposit insurance system \nand avoid any further costs to the taxpayers.\n  This bill would eliminate the specialized Federal thrift charter, \nmerge the Federal thrift industry into the banking industry, and \nconsolidate the federal thrift and bank regulatory agencies. It would \ncreate a safer and sounder and more rational framework for depository \ninstitutions. While I do not endorse all of the provisions of the House \nbill, I am committed to its basic goal of merging the thrift and bank \ncharters. The Senate Banking Committee will commence its consideration \nof this bill immediately, and I am committed to completing this \nlegislative task as quickly as possible consistent with the other \nobligations of the Banking Committee.\n  Mr. President, I am committed to the goal of minimizing--and \neliminating to the extent possible--the risks to the taxpayer that will \ninevitably result from the continued existence of the thrift industry. \nEarlier this year, I took the first step toward this goal by \nintroducing legislation to merge the separate federal deposit insurance \nfunds for banks and thrifts. The introduction of the Thrift Charter \nConversion Act is an important final step toward that goal.\n  I want to commend my colleagues in the House for their leadership on \nthis essential next step of merging the thrift and bank charters. The \nHouse \n\n[[Page S17095]]\nand Senate Banking Committees considered including charter merger \nprovisions in the budget reconciliation legislation, but Senate \nprocedural rules prohibited us from including such provisions. The \nHouse reconciliation bill contained the text of the measure that I am \nintroducing today. I want to commend Representative Marge Roukema, \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer \nCredit, and full committee Chairman Leach for their work on this bill.\n  Mr. President, our Nation's thrift industry has helped Americans \nfinance their homes for over 160 years--with remarkable success. As we \nhave witnessed during the past two decades, however, it has also \nexperienced serious financial difficulties. These difficulties \neventually led to the industry's collapse during the 1980's--a collapse \nthat has cost the American taxpayers more than $150 billion.\n  Despite the massive bailout and the numerous laws enacted to \nstabilize the thrift industry, serious problems continue to plague our \nNation's thrift industry. Congress cannot ignore these problems. \nCongress must act now before our Nation's taxpayers are asked to pay \nfor another bailout of the thrift industry.\n  I am pleased that under the leadership of the House and Senate \nBanking Committees, Congress is already taking action to protect the \nAmerican taxpayer and to avoid another thrift industry crisis. Last \nweek, the House and Senate Banking Committees agreed to a proposal to \nrecapitalize the ailing Federal deposit insurance fund for thrifts--\ncalled the Savings Association Insurance Fund [SAIF]. The SAIF is now \nso undercapitalized that the failure of one large thrift could bankrupt \nit. The proposal agreed to last week will recapitalize the fund-using \nindustry--not taxpayer--money. Because the proposal saves the American \ntaxpayers some $900 million, it has been included in Congress' budget \nreconciliation package--a package designed to eliminate the budget \ndeficit in 7 years.\n  Mr. President, despite the recapitalization of SAIF, the thrift \nindustry continues to pose serious and chronic safety and soundness \nrisks to our Nation's Federal deposit insurance system. In an October \n31, 1995 letter to me, Ricki Helfer, Chairman of the FDIC, explained \nwhy thrifts pose a greater safety and soundness risk of the Federal \ndeposit insurance system than do banks, even with a recapitalized \ninsurance fund:\n\n       Relative to the Bank Insurance Fund [BIF], the SAIF faces \n     risks related to the size of its membership, geographic and \n     product concentrations, and inherent structural problems in \n     the industry. The SAIF has fewer members than the BIF and \n     faces greater risks with the failure of any one member. The \n     SAIF also has a geographic concentration on the West coast. \n     The eight largest SAIF-insured thrifts operate predominantly \n     in California, and they hold 18.5 percent of SAIF-insured \n     deposits. By contrast, the eight largest holders of BIF-\n     insured deposits are located in five different states and \n     hold 10 percent of BIF-insured deposits. SAIF members' \n     assets are concentrated in residential real estate . . . \n     to realize certain tax benefits. While traditional \n     residential real estate lending can be managed in such a \n     way as to present relatively little credit risk, \n     substantial concentrations in the area make SAIF members \n     susceptible to interest-rate fluctuations.\n\n  In an August 29, 1995, report, entitled ``The Thrift Charter: Should \nIt Be Eliminated?'' the Congressional Research Service also noted that \ntheir specialization in housing finance makes thrifts more vulnerable \nthan banks to an economic downturn:\n\n       Support for a more flexible [thrift] charter stems from \n     interest in protecting the Federal deposit insurance system. \n     . . . Lending and deposit options for thrifts have been \n     broadened over the past several years, nonetheless, thrifts' \n     deposit and lending base is still less diversified than banks \n     because of their specialization in housing finance. There is \n     concern that this lack of diversification could cause \n     institutional weaknesses in an unfavorable economic climate.\n\n  Thus, an important goal of charter merger legislation is to decrease \nthe significant safety and soundness risks posed by thrifts to the \nFederal deposit insurance system.\n  In addition, fundamental changes in the marketplace have called into \nquestion the need for a specialized thrift industry. The role played by \nthrifts in the housing finance market has declined significantly. \nTestifying before the House Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and \nConsumer Credit on August 2, 1995, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board, summarized this development as follows:\n\n       So far this decade, savings and loans and savings banks \n     have originated 25 percent of residential mortgages--as \n     compared to 50 percent over the previous 20 years--and hold, \n     on average, only 28 percent of outstanding residential \n     mortgage debt, compared to two-thirds during the earlier \n     period. Currently only 2 thrifts are among the top 15 \n     mortgage services and none are among the top 10 originators. \n     Over the last decade, when thrifts' participation in the \n     residential mortgage market receded, the aggregate supply of \n     housing finance was unimpaired and mortgage rates apparently \n     unaffected.\n\n  The decreased dependence on a specialized thrift industry to \noriginate and fund mortgages is primarily due to the development of \nmortgage-backed securities and a secondary mortgage market.\n  Mr. President, while the role of thrifts in housing finance is \nreceding, thrifts do continue to provide niche financing that is \nimportant to the housing market, including adjustable rate mortgages \nand mortgages that do not conform to secondary market underwriting \ncriteria. Thrifts could still specialize in this type of financing \nunder current charter merger proposals, however. In this regard, I \nbelieve that, as a business matter, many institutions will want to \nfocus on housing finance, despite any charter changes mandated by \nCongress.\n  To summarize, the continued safety and soundness risks posed by the \nthrift industry and the receding role of the thrift industry have \nresulted in proposals to eliminate the thrift charter. Federal banking \nand thrift regulators have expressed support for these proposals. At a \nSeptember 21, 1995, hearing held by the House Subcommittee on Financial \nInstitutions and Consumer Credit, Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan \nnoted:\n\n       Two conclusions are clear. First, the nexus between thrifts \n     and housing largely has been broken without any evident \n     detriment to housing finance availability. Second, a public \n     policy that induces--let alone requires--thirfts to \n     specialize in mortgage finance threatens the continued \n     viability of many of these entities--particularly those \n     without wide and deep deposit franchises, tight cost \n     controls, and the ability, when necessary, effectively to \n     originate and sell standard mortgages that cannot profitably \n     be held long-term. A broader charter for thrifts--such as a \n     commercial bank charter that lets them hold a wider range of \n     assets--thus would seem to be good public policy. . . .\n\n  At that same hearing, FDIC Chairman Helfer also expressed support for \nthe elimination of the current thrift charter:\n\n       The FDIC is not opposed to eliminating the distinctions \n     between bank and thrift charters--far from it. The FDIC \n     believes that the current charter distinctions no longer \n     match economic reality. Moreover, forcibly concentrating a \n     class of institutions--thrifts in this instance--into a \n     limited range of activities with low profit margins is a \n     prescription for trouble, as the savings and loan crisis of \n     the 1980's and early 1990's amply demonstrated.\n\n  These statements from our Nation's top bank and thrift regulators \ncannot be ignored by Congress.\n  Mr. President, industry representatives have also recognized the \ninherent problems of the thrift charter and expressed support for \neliminating or reforming their current charter. In a September 12, \n1995, Wall Street Journal article, entitled ``Time to Kill the Thrifts \nfor Good,'' a leading thrift industry executive stated:\n\n       The thrift industry charter is inherently flawed, and the \n     resulting vulnerability of the industry has been demonstrated \n     repeatedly over the past 25 years. . . . These numbers are \n     trying to tell us something--namely the thrift charter is \n     obsolete. Today, a separate thrift industry cannot be \n     justified either by standards of the market or public policy. \n     . . . In formulating public policy, we should not seek to \n     maintain an industry charter that impairs the viability of \n     its institutions, strains the banking system and threatens \n     the American taxpayer. We need to integrate thrifts into the \n     banking industry.\n\n  It is difficult to imagine a stronger statement in favor of \neliminating the thrift charter, and the statement is even more forceful \ncoming from a thrift industry executive. In a September 20, 1995, \nletter to me, America's Community Bankers, the national trade \nassociation for thrifts, also noted that it ``is fully prepared to work \n. . . toward--thrift--charter reform and modernization.''\n\n       Finally, one of the strongest statements in support of \n     eliminating the thrift charter has \n\n[[Page S17096]]\n     come from the editorial board of a leading national newspaper. In a \n     September 20, 1995 editorial, the Washington Post stated that \n     ``S have lost their special purpose--all kinds of \n     institutions now make mortgage loans--and in some respects \n     have become a danger.'' The editorial concluded: ``S were \n     work horses in their day. The day is gone, and so--as a \n     separate kind of entity--should they be.''\n\n  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today would eliminate the \nspecialized Federal thrift charter, and would force all federally \nchartered thrifts to convert to banks. It also would require that all \nState-chartered thrifts be regulated like State-chartered banks. It \nwould also allow some converted institutions and qualified thrift \nholding companies to engage in certain activities not permitted for \nbanks. These grandfathered activities would be permitted only under \nstrict constraints. Finally, it would create a new Federal charter, \ncalled a national mutual bank.\n  This bill also would rationalize the Federal regulation of banks and \nthrifts. It would merge the Federal banking and thrift regulators, \nsaving taxpayer money, and reducing bureaucratic redtape. There is a \nbroad consensus in favor of this initiative. As Under Secretary of the \nTreasury for Domestic Finance John Hawke stated, in an October 27, \n1995, letter to House Banking Chairman Leach, there is ``broad \nagreement on the logic of merging the Federal regulation of banks and \nthrifts.''\n  Mr. President, resolving the thrift industry's remaining problems \nwill not be an easy task. This is not a project that can be completed \novernight. There are numerous, complex legal and public policy issues \nthat must be addressed in a careful, thoughtful way. Congress will need \nto collaborate with industry representatives, Federal thrift and bank \nregulators, and the administration. Decisions made today on these \nissues will have lasting consequences on the shape of our Nation's \nfinancial services industry well into the next millennium.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a brief description of the complex legal \nand public policy issues that must be addressed as we move forward with \nconsideration of this bill be printed in the Record. Some of these \nissues are addressed by the House bill. Others are not.\n  Mr. President, every process needs a beginning. I believe this bill \nis an appropriate place for the Senate to start its consideration. I \nlook forward to working with my Senate and House colleagues to address \nthe very important issues raised by this bill. Working together, I \nbelieve we can create a safer and sounder and more rational framework \nfor depository institutions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Issues Raised by the Thrift Charter Conversion Act\n\n       Transition Period: The House bill may not provide an \n     adequate transition period. The bill requires federal savings \n     associations to convert to banks or liquidate in two years. \n     In other cases where entire classes of financial institutions \n     have been subject to major statutory change, a longer \n     transition period was provided. For example, when one-bank \n     holding companies became subject to Federal Reserve \n     Regulation by the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of \n     1970, a transition period of 10 years accompanied such change \n     to allow for proper corporate planning.\n       Continued Existence of State Thrifts: The House bill \n     eliminates federal thrifts, but not state thrifts. If the \n     reasoning of the House bill is that the thrift charter is \n     inherently risky, it is unclear why federal deposit insurance \n     should continue to be made available to state thrifts. Many, \n     perhaps even most, federal thrifts may elect to become state \n     thrifts under the House legislation, thereby frustrating \n     whatever purpose underlies the House bill.\n       Grandfather Period for Savings Institutions Powers: Under \n     the House bill, thrifts that become banks would have two \n     years in which to terminate any activities or investments not \n     permissible for banks. Regulators could grant two one-year \n     extensions of that deadline, on a case-by-case basis. This \n     two-year period may be too short and may create needless \n     uncertainty for institutions. The case-by-case extension \n     procedure could create needless administrative costs for \n     institutions and their regulators.\n       Branching: All thrift branches established after September \n     13, 1995, would be subject to federal and state laws \n     applicable to banks under the House bill. Tying \n     grandfathering to this date could unnecessarily disrupt the \n     operations of thrifts pending enactment of legislation. \n     Moreover, the public policy rationale underlying the House \n     provision prohibiting former thrifts from branching within a \n     state in which the thrift had already established a branch \n     should be carefully reviewed. Limiting branching by an \n     institution in a state where it already has a presence could \n     harm institutions heavily invested in existing branch \n     networks.\n       New Rules for Thrift Holding Companies: The House bill \n     completely changes the rules that apply to companies that own \n     savings institutions. But there has been no evidence that the \n     current thrift holding company framework has been a source of \n     strength to their thrift subsidiaries. Obviously, the public \n     policy rationale and consequences of these changes must be \n     carefully reviewed.\n       Grandfather for Thrift Holding Companies: the House bill's \n     requirements for maintaining grandfathered holding company \n     status may be too rigid and need adjustment. Even a minor \n     infraction of an investment limitation could trigger \n     forfeiture of grandfather rights. These provisions must be \n     carefully reviewed.\n       Regulation by Federal Reserve: The financial impact and \n     uncertainty of regulation of grandfathered thrift holding \n     companies by the Federal Reserve has not been thoroughly \n     analyzed and considered.\n       Elimination of Commonly Used Indices: Certain indices \n     commonly used for adjustable rate mortgages (e.g., cost of \n     funds indices (COFI) likely will be lost under the House \n     bill. While the bill recognizes the need to address this \n     loss, the uncertainty surrounding their replacement could \n     have a significant impact on the mortgage market and COFI-\n     based mortgage related securities.\n       Federal Home Loan Bank Membership: The House bill would \n     permanently prohibit federal savings associations from \n     withdrawing voluntarily from the Federal Home Loan Bank \n     System. It is unclear why national banks that once were \n     thrifts should be singled out for mandatory membership.\n       Prohibition on New Federal Savings Association Charters: \n     The House bill would prohibit the OTS from issuing any new \n     federal thrift charters. A prohibition against issuing new \n     thrift charters between the date of enactment and the date on \n     which the federal thrift charter expires may not allow for \n     exceptions needed to facilitate conversions and mergers \n     (including resolution of troubled thrifts) that will not \n     result in the creation of a new federal thrift.\n       Loans-to-One Borrower (``LTOB'') Rules: The House bill \n     would grandfather for 3 years after the date of enactment any \n     loans or legally binding commitments made by a thrift that \n     converts to a national bank on or before January 1, 1998. \n     Thus, thrifts with significant investments in housing loans \n     authorized pursuant to the special real estate exception \n     available to thrifts under the LTOB rule would be forced to \n     liquidate existing loans made under this exception. It is \n     unclear what purpose is served by requiring liquidation of \n     loans that were lawful when made. It is also unclear what \n     impact revocation of the exemption would have on a going \n     forward basis on funding for housing.\n       Elimination of the OTS: The House bill provides for a \n     complicated three-way merger of the Office of Thrift \n     Supervision (OTS) into the other federal banking agencies. \n     The bill omits the ``standard'' FIRREA employee protections. \n     Treasury, OTS, and the Office of the Comptroller of the \n     Currency have discussed agency merger transition provisions, \n     but have yet to produce a comprehensive proposal for \n     disposition of OTS. Adequate transfer rules for OTS employees \n     are essential to ensure the retention of skilled and \n     experienced personnel to supervise institutions during a \n     period of significant economic strain on the thrift industry. \n     They are also necessary for the smooth transition of \n     oversight functions, and the fair treatment of existing OTS \n     personnel.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATFIELD (for himself and Mr. Mack):\n  S. 1416. A bill to establish limitation with respect to the \ndisclosure and use of genetic information, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                    the genetic privacy act of 1995\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, recent breakthroughs in science \nhave brought great hopes in the area of genetics. The human genome \nproject is proceeding with the goal of mapping and sequencing every \ngene in the human body. The potential of identifying disease \ncharacteristics through their genetic makeup brings great hope to those \nsuffering from an array of diseases such as Huntington disease, \nAlzheimer's disease, cystic fibrosis, and breast cancer. Unfortunately, \nthese advances also raise profound ethical, legal, and social questions \nrelating to access to genetic testing, insurability, employability, and \nconfidentiality.\n  While many doctors are offering genetic testing to patients with a \nhistory of a genetic-related disease to identify their own risk, many \npatients and physicians are not capable of dealing with the \nconsequences of this information. For example, is the patient required \nto share this information with the health insurance company? How about \ntheir employer? Does the physician have an obligation to share this \ninformation? \n\n[[Page S17097]]\nThere have already been cases of discrimination as a result of an \nemployer learning of an employee's genetic risk. In addition, cases \nhave arisen where health insurance access was denied as a result of a \ngenetic predisposition.\n  This is problematic because we are only in the first stages of \nunderstanding the human genome. Genetic testing has proven effective in \nsome cases but it can be argued that the presence of a gene or certain \ngenetic characteristics will not always result in the onset of the \nparticular illness. The potential for discrimination is great. Although \nseveral States, including my own State of Oregon, have begun to address \nthe issue of genetic information and health insurance, there are \ncurrently no Federal laws governing the use of genetic information.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today with my colleague, \nSenator Mack, is modeled on the Genetic Privacy Act recently passed by \nthe Oregon Legislature. It also draws on recommendations made by the \nNIH-sponsored ELSI Working Group and the National Action Plan on Breast \nCancer.\n  The purpose of the Genetic Privacy Act of 1995 is to establish some \ninitial limitations with respect to the disclosure and use of genetic \ninformation with the goal of balancing the need to protect the rights \nof the individual against society's interests. The bill is intended as \na first step--to ensure that there are some Federal standards in place \nin the most critical areas of concern. I see it as a working draft to \nbe refined as the science progresses. The bill would define the rights \nof individuals whose genetic information is disclosed. In addition, it \nwould protect against discrimination by an insurer or employer based \nupon an individual's genetic characteristics.\n  First, the bill prohibits the disclosure of genetic information by \nanyone without the specific written authorization of the individual. \nThis disclosure provision could apply to health care professionals, \nhealth care institutions, laboratories, researchers, employers \ninsurance companies, and law enforcement officials. The written \nauthorization must include a description of the information being \ndisclosed, the name of the individual or entity to whom the disclosure \nis being made, and the purpose of the disclosure. This provision \npreserves the individual's ability to control the disclosure of his or \nher genetic information. There are several exceptions for the purposes \nof criminal or death investigations, specific orders of Federal or \nState courts for civil actions, paternity establishment, specific \nauthorization by the individual, genetic information relating to a \ndecedent for the medical diagnosis of blood relatives of the decedent, \nor identifying bodies.\n  Second, the legislation prohibits employers from seeking to obtain or \nuse genetic information of an employee or prospective employee in order \nto discriminate against that person. In March 1995, the U.S. Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission [EEOC] released official guidance on \nthe definition of the term ``disability''. The EEOC's guidance \nclarifies that protection under the Americans With Disabilities Act \nextends to individuals who are discriminated against in employment \ndecisions based solely on genetic information. Issuance of the EEOC's \nguidance is precedent setting--it is the first Federal protection \nagainst the unfair use of genetic information. The provision included \nin the bill is intended to reiterate the ruling of the EEOC and make it \nclear that this practice would be prohibited under Federal law.\n\n  Third, the legislation prohibits health insurers from using genetic \ninformation to reject, deny, limit, cancel, refuse to renew, increase \nrates, or otherwise affect health insurance. This is in line with \nchanges that are currently under consideration with regard to health \ninsurance and preexisting condition exclusions.\n  A study of genetic discrimination prepared by Paul R. Billings, M.D. \nand cited by the NIH-DOE ELSI Working Group in their report entitled \n``Genetic Information and Health Insurance,'' indicates that there have \nbeen a number of cases of discrimination already as the result of an \ninsurer learning of an individual's genetic predisposition. One woman \nwho was found to carry the gene that causes cystic fibrosis was told \nshe and her children were not insurable unless her husband was \ndetermined not to carry the cystic fibrosis gene. She went without \nhealth insurance for several months while this was determined. In \nanother case, a man diagnosed with Huntington disease was denied health \ninsurance on the basis that it was a preexisting condition, even though \nno previous diagnosis of Huntington had been made.\n  As the prevalence of genetic testing spreads, so does the risks of \ndiscrimination. Women found to carry the gene that indicates breast \ncancer susceptibility, BRCA1, fear they will lose health coverage if \ntheir insurer finds out. However, having this information may provide \nearly treatment and prevention options for the woman. The provision \nrelating to health insurance in the bill will provide much needed \nassurance to individuals with genetic predispositions. This will ensure \nthat they will not risk losing their health coverage when they need it \nthe most.\n  Finally, the bill requires the recently established National \nBioethics Advisory Commission to submit to Congress their \nrecommendations on further protections for the collection, storage, and \nuse of DNA samples and genetic information obtained from those samples, \nand appropriate standards for the acquisition and retention of genetic \ninformation in all settings. This provision is intended to ensure that \nthe social consequences of genome research are considered as the \ntechnology develops and not after the fact.\n  Madam President, as I said previously, this is a first step. This \nbill addresses the most pressing concerns surrounding genetic testing \nand the disclosure of genetic information as they relate to health \ninsurer and employer discrimination.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the \nlikelihood of a GATT challenge to an embargo on Iran.\n  On December 13, 1994, the Congressional Research Service did a \nMemorandum for Representative Peter DeFazio entitled ``The Likelihood \nof a \n\n[[Page S17098]]\nGATT challenge to the Cuban embargo under the GATT 1994 and the WTO.'' \nThis document further backs up my assertion that the United States, \nunder Article 21 of the GATT, the United States has the broad authority \nto impose sanctions against another country for reasons of national \nsecurity, and by connection we have that right to do so in the case of \nIran. Mr. President, so that my colleagues can read this interesting \nmemorandum, I ask that this memo be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  I would also like to comment on section 8(a) of the Export \nAdministration Act of 1979, as it relates to S. 1228, the Iran Foreign \nOil Sanctions Act of 1995. For purposes of demonstration, I would like \nto comment on paragraph (1) of this section which reads as follows:\n\n       (1) For the purpose of implementing the policies set forth \n     in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (5) of section 3 of \n     this Act, the President shall issue regulations prohibiting \n     any United States person, with respect to his activities in \n     the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States, from \n     taking or knowingly agreeing to take any of the following \n     actions with intent to comply with, further, or support any \n     boycott fostered or imposed by a foreign country against a \n     country which is friendly to the United States and which is \n     not itself the object of any form of boycott pursuant to \n     United States law or regulation. . ..''\n\n  This paragraph is very instructive because it prohibits U.S. \ncompanies from dealing with a country that abides by an \n``unsanctioned'' third-party boycott against another country. However, \nthe stipulations of this paragraph are vital to the argument supporting \na ``sanctioned'' third-party embargo against Iran. The intent here is \nto prevent support for ``* * * any boycott fostered or imposed by a \nforeign country against a country which is friendly to the United \nStates and which is not itself the object of any form of boycott \npursuant to United States law or regulation * * *.'' The phrases \n``against a country which is friendly to the United States,'' and \n``which is not itself the object of any form of boycott pursuant to \nUnited States law or regulation'' are key to the argument. In the case \nof Iran, I think everyone would agree that Iran is not friendly to the \nUnited States and equally so, it is certainly a matter of fact that \nIran is subject to sanctions by the United States.\n  Therefore, the opponents of this legislation cannot argue against the \nIran sanctions legislation because there are provisions in the bill \nthat would require United States companies to avoid doing business with \ncompanies that sell oil and gas equipment to Iran. The ``anti-boycott \nprovisions in the EAA clearly permit the imposition of ``sanctioned \nboycotts'' against countries which are unfriendly to the United States.\n  The material follows:\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                      The Library of Congress,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 13, 1994.\n     To: Hon. Peter A. DeFazio.\n      (Attention: Peter Tyler).\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: Likelihood of a GATT challenge to the Cuban embargo \n         under the GATT 1994 and the WTO.\n       This memorandum is in response to your inquiry concerning \n     the possibility of Cuba's bringing a challenge to the U.S. \n     embargo against it before the World Trade Organization (WTO) \n     under the terms of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \n     of 1994, the General Agreement as it emerged from the Uruguay \n     Round.\\1\\ Unless otherwise exempted by other provisions under \n     the GATT 1994, the Cuban embargo is arguably inconsistent \n     with the obligations to extend most-favored-nation (MFN) \n     treatment under Article I: 1, of the GATT 1994,\\2\\ to extend \n     national treatment under Article II: 4, of the GATT 1994, and \n     to eliminate quantitative restrictions generally under \n     Article XI: 1, of the GATT 1994. The U.S. embargo against \n     Cuba appears to be justifiable under the international law \n     concept of fundamental change in circumstances, i.e., Cuba's \n     change to a communist regime and a non-market economy. The \n     national security exception under Article XXI of GATT 1994 \n     may also exempt the embargo as a national security measure. \n     Also, the United States could request a waiver to permit the \n     embargo, but this may be difficult to obtain. Apparently, \n     there is some concern that the strengthened dispute \n     settlement and enforcement mechanisms under the GATT 1994 may \n     motivate Cuba to bring a challenge to the embargo. You also \n     indicated concern about possible limitations on unilateral \n     quantitative restrictions under the GATT 1994, but it seems \n     these limitations generally involve limitations on \n     quantitative restrictions that have been permissible in the \n     past as a routine matter under textile arrangements, for \n     balance-of-payments reasons, and the like, and not \n     limitations on embargoes that are justifiable under other \n     provisions of the GATT. This memorandum will briefly discuss \n     the history of the embargo and the possible justifications \n     for the embargo under the GATT.\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Cuba is an original contracting party to the GATT,\\3\\ yet \n     the United States has had an embargo on Cuba since 1962.\\4\\ \n     Cuba has from time to time protested or commented negatively \n     on the U.S. embargo as GATT illegal,\\5\\ indicating that the \n     United States has never formally justified its actions in the \n     GATT context. These comments or protests either concern the \n     Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 or the support of other countries \n     subjected to sanctions by the United States. It is unclear \n     whether Cuba made a formal complaint about the original \n     embargo in the GATT forum.\\6\\ The United States was \n     apparently motivated by the communist coup and unresolved \n     U.S. compensation claims arising from the expropriation and \n     nationalization of U.S. property holdings in Cuba and also by \n     concerns about human rights abuses and the lack of democracy \n     in Cuba.\\7\\\n\n\n           the concept of fundamental change in circumstances\n\n       It appears that justification of the embargo was possible \n     under the international law concept of fundamental change in \n     circumstance. However, this requires notification to the \n     other parties of action taken pursuant to the doctrine. Under \n     the international law concept of fundamental change in \n     circumstances, the United States and other GATT parties could \n     have considered Cuba to no longer be a member of GATT when \n     Castro deposed the Cuban government that had been in power \n     when the GATT 1947 was concluded. This concept, codified in \n     the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,\\8\\ states that \n     where there has been a fundamental change from the \n     circumstances existing at the time of the conclusion of an \n     international agreement, which was not foreseen by the \n     parties, this change may not be a ground for terminating or \n     withdrawing from the agreement unless the circumstances were \n     essential to the consent of the parties to be bound by the \n     agreement and the change radically transforms the extent of \n     obligations still to be performed under the agreement. A \n     party may not invoke this doctrine if the fundamental change \n     of circumstances was the result of the invoking party's \n     breach of an obligation under the agreement or of any \n     international obligation owed by that party to any other \n     party to the agreement. If a party may invoke the doctrine \n     for termination of or withdrawal from an agreement, it may \n     also invoke it for suspension of the operation of the \n     agreement. A party invoking this doctrine must notify other \n     parties to the agreement.\\9\\\n       The original circumstances, that Cuba was controlled by a \n     non-communist regime and was a market economy, were arguably \n     essential to the Agreement. Although non-market economies \n     have acceded to the GATT, they have done so under protocols \n     specifying goals and measures to be met to ensure fair trade. \n     Also, given the international political situation at the \n     time, the cuban change to a communist-style government and \n     the resulting political and military tensions between the two \n     countries could be considered by the United States to \n     constitute a fundamental change of circumstances sufficient \n     to terminate or suspend the operation of an agreement.\\10\\\n       The United States and other GATT parties could have \n     notified, and may still be able to notify, the GATT that, \n     under the doctrine, they consider the GATT terminated (or \n     suspended) with respect to Cuba.\\11\\ There apparently was \n     never any formal declaration by either the United States or \n     Cuba to the GATT Contracting Parties of any inability to \n     continue the application of the General Agreement to each \n     other. Although the United States has not declared a formal \n     suspension regarding agreements with Cuba generally, \n     apparently many agreements are not being applied.\\12\\\n\n\n                       Application of Article XXI\n\n       The United States could justify its embargo for national \n     security reasons under GATT Article XXI(b)(iii), because of \n     the acts of hostility between the two at the time the embargo \n     was imposed. The national security reasons need not be \n     formally stated to the GATT Contracting Parties.\\13\\ However, \n     the presidential proclamation declaring the embargo against \n     Cuba gave self-defense and national security as the reasons \n     for it.\\14\\\n       Historically, the United States has suspended most-favored-\n     nation treatment for various countries and justified its \n     actions under GATT exceptions, particularly GATT Article XXI \n     concerning security exceptions. Article XXI, provides that \n     nothing in the Agreement shall be construed (1) to require a \n     contracting party to reveal information the disclosure of \n     which is contrary to its security interests; (2) to prevent \n     measures, which a party considers necessary to the protection \n     of its security interests and which are related to nuclear \n     material, related to trade in arms, or taken in time of war \n     or other international emergency; (3) or to prevent a party \n     from taking action pursuant to its obligations under the \n     United Nations Charter for the maintenance of international \n     peace and security. The security exceptions have been \n\n[[Page S17099]]\n     applicable in several cases where the United States has suspended MFN \n     treatment, although some parties have felt that the United \n     States has relied excessively on Article XXI in justifying \n     its actions. However, a GATT panel has decided that the \n     underlying justification for a claim of the national security \n     exception will not be questioned. This decision resulted from \n     Nicaragua's GATT challenge to the embargo that the U.S. \n     imposed on it.\n       Nicaragua became a GATT contracting party on May 28, 1950, \n     under the terms of the 1949 Annecy Protocol of Terms of \n     Accession.\\15\\ In the late 1970s and early 1980s, relations \n     between the United States and the Nicaraguan Sandinista-\n     controlled government deteriorated as the United States cut \n     off aid to the Nicaraguan government and supported Contra \n     rebel efforts to bring about a free and independent \n     government by deposing the Sandinista government.\\16\\ On \n     September 23, 1983, President Reagan reduced the import quota \n     for Nicaraguan sugar.\\17\\ Nicaragua brought a complaint \n     before the GATT. A dispute settlement panel found that the \n     quota reduction was in violation of GATT Article XIII, which \n     provides that quantitative restrictions of a product are only \n     permissible where similar measures are applied to all imports \n     and exports of that product and where the import quota shares \n     are distributed among the parties concerned in a way that \n     approximates as nearly as possible the share each party would \n     have had in the absence of restrictions.\\18\\ The United \n     States did not invoke any exception and seems to have \n     effectively refused to defend itself on GATT grounds, stating \n     merely that any actions taken were not matters of trade \n     policy and could not be properly evaluated in the trade \n     context, and that the United States had not benefitted in any \n     economic manner from the reduction in Nicaragua's quota.\\19\\ \n     The panel report was adopted on March 13, 1984, but in \n     November 1984, Nicaragua was complaining that the United \n     States still had not restored its sugar quota.\\20\\ The United \n     States agreed that Nicaragua had rights, but maintained its \n     position that the situation had to be viewed in a political \n     context.\\21\\\n       President Reagan imposed an embargo on Nicaragua by \n     executive order on May 1, 1985, pursuant to his authority \n     under the International Economic Emergency Act and the \n     National Emergency Act, among others.\\22\\ He found that the \n     ``policies and actions of the Government of Nicaragua \n     constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the \n     national security and foreign policy of the United States and \n     hereby declare a national emergency to deal with the \n     threat.'' The embargo prohibited all imports of goods and \n     services of Nicaraguan origin and all exports of goods and \n     services destined for Nicaragua except for those destined for \n     the democratic resistance organization. Additionally, \n     Nicaraguan aircraft were forbidden from landing in or taking \n     off from the United States and Nicaraguan vessels were \n     prohibited from entering U.S.ports.\n       The embargo against Nicaragua is notable particularly \n     because Nicaragua brought a formal complaint before the GATT \n     and got the reluctant United States to agree to the formation \n     of a dispute settlement panel.\\23\\ Although discrete \n     discriminatory measures had been challenged, a virtually \n     total embargo apparently had never before been brought before \n     a dispute settlement panel. Nicaragua also had previously \n     sued the United States before the International Court of \n     Justice (ICJ) and gotten a determination that the military \n     and paramilitary actions taken against Nicaragua, including \n     the embargo, were violations of international law.\\24\\\n       The United States claimed an exception under the national \n     security clause of GATT Article XXI.\\25\\ Nicaragua challenged \n     the validity of the motives of the United States, complaining \n     that it was improperly using a trade forum and trade measures \n     to achieve political ends.\\26\\ It wanted a panel to examine \n     the validity of the United States' claim to the national \n     security exemption by determining whether the Nicaraguan \n     situation posed a valid national security concern for the \n     United States.\\27\\ But although the United States consented \n     to the formation of a panel, it insisted that the GATT could \n     not question the validity of a party's national security \n     concerns.\\28\\ It was a party's prerogative to decide what it \n     considered a threat to national security. The GATT members \n     agreed and did not authorize the panel to examine the \n     justification for the invocation of GATT Article XXI. The \n     panel could only decide whether the measures taken by the \n     United States were consistent or inconsistent with the \n     General Agreement. Therefore, the panel concluded that it \n     could not determine whether the actions of the United States \n     were inconsistent with or in compliance with its obligations \n     under the General Agreement.\\29\\\n       Thus, the United States successfully invoked the national \n     security exception under GATT Article XXI and used trade \n     sanctions for political purposes, which it maintained was \n     permissible. However, although many other GATT parties agreed \n     that GATT Article XXI properly left to each party the \n     judgment of what constituted its essential security \n     interests, the parties also regretted the expansive \n     interpretation of the exception by the United States and were \n     concerned that frequent resort to it as an all-purposes \n     defense would erode the GATT rules.\\30\\ They also noted the \n     1982 decision regarding GATT Article XXI, indicating that \n     actions under Article XXI, should not be overly broad in \n     scope.\\31\\ Free elections were held in Nicaragua in February \n     1990.\\32\\ President Bush restored the sugar quota in April \n     1990\\33\\ and Nicaragua, stating that it had reached an \n     agreement with the United States on economic relations, \n     requested the discontinuation of proceedings to determine \n     reparations in the ICJ case in 1991.\\34\\\n\n\n   the possibility of a waiver under gatt article xxv: 5 and the wto \n                               agreement\n\n       Article IX:3 of the WTO Agreement\\35\\ specifies a three-\n     fourths majority vote for a waiver of a multilateral trade \n     agreement obligation ``in exceptional circumstances.'' \n     Article XVI:3 of the WTO Agreement provides that in case of a \n     conflict between a WTO Agreement provision and that of a \n     multilateral trade agreement, the WTO Agreement prevails. \n     GATT Article XXV:5 provides that the Contracting Parties may \n     waive an obligation for a particular party ``in exceptional \n     circumstances not elsewhere provided for in this agreement'' \n     by a two-thirds majority vote of approval where such majority \n     comprises more than half of the parties.\\36\\ So under the \n     terms of the WTO Agreement, a three-fourths vote is now \n     required. Under GATT Article XXV:V, the GATT parties may also \n     by such a vote define certain categories of exceptional \n     circumstances to which other voting requirements shall apply \n     for a waiver and may prescribe such criteria as may be \n     necessary for the application of Article XXV:5. Article IX:4 \n     of the WTO Agreement provides that a waiver granted for more \n     than one year shall be reviewed annually by the Ministerial \n     Conference which shall examine whether the exceptional \n     circumstances justifying the waiver still exist and whether \n     all terms and conditions for the waiver have been met. \n     Possibly the United States could ask for a waiver of the MFN \n     for Cuba, but the three-fourths majority required for the \n     grant of the waiver would be difficult to meet; the \n     Contracting Parties are unlikely to relax the requirements \n     for such a serious matter. Furthermore, the annual review of \n     the waiver would make it necessary to satisfy the Ministerial \n     Conference that the exceptional circumstances still existed \n     in order to maintain an embargo pursuant to a waiver, thereby \n     making it less likely that such an embargo could be \n     maintained indefinitely. In the 1950s, the United States and \n     Czechoslovakia were granted waivers to suspend application of \n     the GATT to each other.\n       In 1951, the United States suspended application of the \n     GATT to Czechoslovakia, although it was an original signatory \n     to the GATT and accepted the Protocol of Provisional \n     Application\\37\\ and the United States had not invoked GATT \n     Article XXXV, providing for non-application between parties \n     upon accession, with respect to Czechoslovakia upon the \n     accession of the two to the GATT. Czechoslovakia did not have \n     a non-market economy at the time of its accession to the GATT \n     on April 20, 1948.\\38\\ But subsequent changes in the \n     government of Czechoslovakia and friction with the United \n     States over U.S. claims to compensation for postwar \n     nationalizations led to a breach in trade relations.\\39\\ The \n     United States and Czechoslovakia each made declarations, \n     using language found in GATT Article XXIII:1, that the other, \n     through its actions, had nullified benefits which should have \n     accrued to the declaring party.\\40\\\n       Although the GATT parties apparently considered the issue \n     to have been resolved through dispute settlement under GATT \n     Article XXIII:2,\\41\\ it also appears that the Contracting \n     Parties took joint action pursuant to GATT Article XXV:5.\\42\\ \n     This provides that ``under exceptional circumstances not \n     elsewhere provided for in this Agreement, the Contracting \n     Parties may waive an obligation imposed upon a contracting \n     party by this Agreement; Provided that any such decision \n     shall be approved by a two-thirds majority of the votes cast \n     and that such majority shall comprise more than half of the \n     contracting parties [emphasis added].'' The Contracting \n     Parties declared that, considering ``that a contracting party \n     may not be held subject to the provisions of the General \n     Agreement when the fulfillment [sic] of its obligations is \n     rendered impossible by exceptional circumstances of a kind \n     different from those contemplated under the General Agreement \n     . . . the Governments of the United States and Czechoslovakia \n     shall be free to suspend, each with respect to the other, the \n     obligations of the [GATT] [emphasis added].''\\13\\\n       However, more recently where the waiver has been requested \n     by a party for discriminatory treatment of a certain other \n     party, the discriminatory treatment was to the benefit of the \n     other party. For example, the original GATT authority for \n     voluntary tariff preference programs for developing \n     countries, e.g., Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), was \n     done by waiver.\\44\\ Also, Italy requested permission to give \n     more favorable treatment to certain products from Libya and \n     from Somalia; Australia asked permission to treat certain \n     products of Papua-New Gunea more favorably.\\45\\ The more \n     developed country was trying to assist the economic \n     development of the lesser developed country or to continue a \n     traditional special relationship. So a waiver to deny MFN \n     treatment to Cuba may be difficult to obtain, particularly \n     since Cuba now, unlike Czechoslovakia in the 1950s, \n     apparently has no interest in a mutual suspension of GATT \n     application, as evidenced by its protests that the embargo is \n     illegal.\\46\\\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       The U.S. suspension of application of the General Agreement \n     to Cuba, embodied by the \n\n[[Page S17100]]\n     embargo, is probably justifiable under international law on the grounds \n     of Cuba's change to a communist regime and a non-market \n     economy. The United States may also invoke GATT Article XXI, \n     the national security exception, on the basis of a concern \n     for national security, with our without a mutual declaration \n     of suspension authorized by the Contracting Parties.

SANCHEZ\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, it is with pleasure that I ask \nthe Senate to recognize Manuel T. Sanchez for his service to my home \nState of New Mexico. Manuel has distinguished himself as a successful \nfamily man, businessperson, and community leader.\n  He was born on November 15, 1901 in Las Vegas, NM, 11 years before \nNew Mexico was admitted into the Union. Needless to say, Manuel has \nwitnessed New Mexico flourish and change during his lifetime.\n  In the early 1920's, Manuel and his family moved to a section of \nAlbuquerque known as Martineztown. There they started a grocery store \nto serve the community. This store is still in operation today and it \nstill serves as an unofficial meeting place for social and political \ngatherings.\n  In 1933, Manuel was elected Democratic ward chairman of Ward 11 B. \nDuring those early years he worked closely with my uncle John Bingaman \nin helping Governor Tingley succeed in his campaigns. For over 60 \nyears, he has continued to serve in this capacity as ward chair. His \nsuccess is a result of his dedication to the work ethic and in the \nbelief that a person's word is as good as a written contract. It would \n\n[[Page S17101]]\nhave been impossible for Manuel to represent his community as \nDemocratic ward chairman for such an extended period of time if people \ndid not put trust in his word.\n  Although much about New Mexico has changed since Manuel's childhood \nyears, one characteristic that has not changed is a strong sense of \ncommunity. He is very central to that feeling in Martineztown. Whether \nin the grocery store or at the Barelas Cafe eating some combination of \ngreen chile, I believe he deserves recognition and our thanks for his \nservice to the community over the years. It is with this thought that I \nwish Manuel many more years of health and happiness on this his 94th \nbirthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/15/senate-section/article/S17100-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, although the period of official \nmourning in Israel for slain Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has ended, \nthe time for reflection on his legacy has not. Supporters of Israel in \nAmerica and around the world continue to ponder the incredible \nsacrifices made by Yitzhak Rabin during his relentless pursuit of peace \nin the Middle East. Many people continue to draw great personal \nstrength and inspiration from the way Rabin conducted his heroic life \nuntil his tragic and untimely death.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following statements \non Yitzhak Rabin by leaders of the Jewish community in my home State of \nMinnesota be included in the Record.\n  Mr. Frank R. Berman: ``It is with much grief that we mourn the tragic \nassassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. I had the honor of \nknowing the Prime Minister and came to hold him in the highest regard. \nHe was a great leader and visionary for Israel as well as for peace-\nloving people everywhere. I know that the Jewish community and all \ncitizens of Minnesota join me in expressing our deeply felt condolences \nto the government and people of Israel and to his family. We pray that \nhis noble goal of peace in the Middle East will be fulfilled.''\n  Margo and Fred Berdass: ``We offer our heartfelt condolences to Mrs. \nRabin and her family and to the people of Israel. We pray God give them \nthe strength and wisdom to unite as a people and to overcome their \ngreat loss. May we all hope Israel may forge a policy all can support \nand that will lead to peace.''\n  Mr. Mike Fiterman: ``Prime Minister Rabin was more than a leader \nwithin his country--he was more of a visionary on how to make the world \na better place. Although he was viewed as a brilliant military \nstrategist, his role in the military only befits him as really a \nchampion of peace and not war. His desire was never one of victory over \nopponent, but rather a desire to bring peace and security to his \nbeloved country and the Israeli people. I had the great privilege of \nattending the historic peace signing on the White House lawn between \nthe people of Israel and the Palestinian people. No one watching that \nday could help but be moved by the significance of that event whether \nyou were personally present or watching from places around the world. \nIt was one of the most emotional events I have ever been privileged to \nwitness. With all of the various speeches, I think it was Prime \nMinister Rabin's words of `enough killing, enough war' that were the \nmost moving. It was not the words he spoke, but the emotion in his \nvoice that spoke volumes. He spoke not only of his desire for peace, \nbut also of the enormous sacrifice he personally knew was needed to \nearn a lasting peace. None of us knew that day the ultimate sacrifice \nYitzhak Rabin would make in the name of peace for his country, his \npeople and the world. The sacrifice that Yitzhak Rabin made that day on \nthe White House lawn was a true exhibit for all people around the world \nthat nothing could ever be more important than people living in harmony \nwith one another throughout the world. He showed us if two peoples \nwarring over the centuries could put down their weapons and pick up a \npen to sign a peace agreement, it was possible for all people around \nthe world to achieve peace with their neighbors. Prime Minister Rabin's \ngranddaughter during the memorial service, however, remembered him for \nall of us as not a statesman or a general, but as a warm person who \nloved his family and who tried to make the world a little better for \nall of us. Yitzhak Rabin will be missed by all peace loving people and \nwill be a lasting reminder to all of us that we can never stop working \ntoward a goal to do whatever we can to make the world a little better \neveryday and to continue to strive to bring peace to all the people of \nthe world.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/15/senate-section/article/S17101-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17101-S17102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  GLOBAL CASINOS POSE VIRTUAL MESS; LAWMAKERS SAY ELECTRONIC GAMBLING \n                         DIFFICULT TO REGULATE\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask that the following article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Tampa Tribune, Aug. 27, 1995]\n\n  Global Casinos Pose Virtual Mess; Lawmakers Say Electronic Gambling \n                         Difficult To Regulate\n\n                           (By Ron Bartlett)\n\n       So you're sitting at home, somewhere in Florida, and you've \n     got the itch to go casino gambling?\n       No problem. Chances are by early next year, no matter where \n     you live in the state, such an opportunity will be at your \n     fingertips.\n       Through a personal computer, you'll be able to glide down \n     the hallways of a glittering casino, passing rooms filled \n     with roulette wheels and slot machines. Once you pick a game, \n     you'll be able to plunk down a bet and take on other gamblers \n     from across the globe.\n       But this won't be for play. This will be for real, cold, \n     hard cash.\n       Didn't state voters resoundingly reject casinos in 1994 for \n     the third time?\n       Sure they did. But savvy entrepreneurs are using \n     electronics to introduce new forms of gambling that are \n     likely to be widely available in Florida and throughout the \n     United States in the coming months.\n       In a rapidly developing market, offshore companies based \n     mostly in the Caribbean are beginning to offer ``virtual \n     reality'' casinos and sports book operations on the Internet, \n     the worldwide network of computers.\n       From your easy chair in Tampa, it soon will be possible to \n     place real bets through your personal computer at virtual \n     casinos in places such as Antigua and St. Martin. Some of \n     these games will come with sophisticated graphics and video \n     that will give players at home the feeling that they are \n     inside a major casino.\n       While the first such virtual casino isn't yet operating, \n     predictions are that hundreds could be up and running within \n     the next year.\n       Meanwhile, the Coeur d'Alene Indian tribe in Idaho plans to \n     offer a national lottery by year's end that some experts say \n     ultimately could offer weekly jackpots up to $200 million.\n       The tribe wants to set up toll-free 1-800 lines that \n     players would use to dial in numbers and give their credit \n     card information.\n       And Floridians who want to bet on sporting events already \n     can call Connecticut or New York, which offer national \n     telephone wagering.\n       The expansion of electronic gambling is not only creating \n     new outlets for players but also bringing wagering directly \n     into the home, which gaming entrepreneurs view as the new \n     frontier. In Florida and other states, the trend is worrying \n     law enforcement officials, regulators and lawmakers.\n       On one level, there are concerns that electronic gambling \n     will hurt business at existing state lotteries, pari-mutuel \n     facilities, bingo halls and Indian gaming facilities.\n       On another, there are fears it will be difficult, if not \n     impossible, to regulate offshore casinos operating on the \n     Internet, that consumers won't be adequately protected, \n     and that the new opportunities could increase gambling \n     addiction and all its dangers.\n       Earlier this month, the chairman of the Florida House \n     Regulated Industries Committee asked state Attorney General \n     Bob Butterworth to investigate what, if anything, the state \n     can do to stop Floridians from betting on the emerging \n     virtual casinos or from calling other states to wager on \n     sports events.\n       State Rep. Steven Geller, a Hallandale Democrat, said his \n     request wasn't a moral stance against gambling, rather, he \n     wants to protect the state's struggling horse and dog tracks \n     and jai alai frontons, which generate jobs and taxes.\n       ``If you have access to a virtual casino and play \n     blackjack, how do you know that the casino in Antigua is run \n     honestly?'' Geller asked. ``How do you know that the roulette \n     wheel isn't rigged?''\n       Butterworth hasn't responded to Geller's inquiry. But with \n     the Internet gambling in particular, he says, any regulatory \n     answers rest in Washington, not Tallahassee.\n       ``How do you stop it from coming into states that don't \n     want it?'' Butterworth said. ``How do you tax it in states \n     that do want it? I don't know how you do that without the \n     federal government taking the lead.''\n       Some members of Congress are grumbling about online \n     gambling. The Justice Department has declared it illegal in \n     the United States, saying it will act on violators. But to \n     date, the full extent and scope of the federal response--if \n     any--remains to be seen.\n       Under federal law, it's a crime for anyone in the gambling \n     business to use an interstate \n\n[[Page S17102]]\n     or international telephone line to transmit information assisting in \n     the placing of bets. But it's not illegal to make a bet, as \n     long as you're not in the gambling business. The Coeur \n     d'Alene tribe would have callers place bets to its operations \n     in Idaho.\n       I. Nelson Rose, a Whittier College law professor and \n     gambling expert, believes Americans running offshore virtual \n     casinos could face seizure of their assets under federal \n     racketeering statutes. But foreign nationals operating the \n     facilities are likely beyond Uncle Sam's reach, and players \n     are usually hard to trace and aren't prosecuted.\n       ``Because it's so new, people don't really know how to \n     respond to it,'' said Jeff Frentzen, who follows developments \n     on the Internet for the magazine PC Week. ``In some corners, \n     it's viewed as a threat.\n       ``It reminds me of what was going on earlier this year with \n     the Internet pornography issue. It's a global system, and \n     it's really hard to control.''\n       One company on the Internet is Sports International Ltd., \n     which says it has 25 to 30 people working at its computer \n     operation on St. John's, Antigua. It does marketing and \n     software development at an office outside Philadelphia.\n       The publicly held company, which says it handled $48 \n     million in its first year, has been taking bets on sports \n     events on the Internet since February. During the first \n     quarter of 1996, it expects to offer ``Global Casino,'' in \n     which players at home will be given software that will \n     make it seem as though they're really inside a gambling \n     hall.\n       The way the online operations are typically set up is this: \n     Players either send money or use a credit card to establish a \n     prepaid account on the island where the game is administered. \n     They use that money to gamble. Their winnings are either \n     rolled back into their account, or wired to them. That way, \n     all the gambling takes place outside the U.S.\n       Jeffrey Erb, a Sports International official, said players \n     are responsible for paying taxes on their earnings. He said \n     the company has a simple incentive for maintaining integrity: \n     Any customer who felt cheated could instantly put the word \n     out to millions of Internet users.\n       At this stage, the phenomenon of Internet gambling is so \n     new and so rapidly evolving that no one really knows what its \n     ultimate impact on the gaming industry will be.\n       Roger Gros, the Atlantic City-based editor of two industry \n     publications, Casino Journal and Casino Player, said that in \n     recent months, he has heard about a half-dozen announcements \n     for virtual casinos. But more are coming; within a year, he \n     expects hundreds.\n       Still, he doesn't think they'll fundamentally alter the \n     casino landscape. At least not now.\n       ``It's just going to be a little sidelight for people who \n     want to gamble and know how to use the Internet,'' he said. \n     ``But I don't think it's going to be a major factor in the \n     gambling industry.''\n       While Butterworth is still trying to determine whether he \n     can do anything to halt electronic gambling on the Internet, \n     he and other attorneys general from around the country \n     already have taken a strong stand to stop the Coeur d`Alene \n     tribe's proposed national lottery.\n       In March, Butterworth sent a letter to all telephone \n     companies in Florida, warning that use of their phone lines \n     for carrying gambling information across state lines would \n     violate both state and federal laws.\n       Meanwhile, the National Association of Attorneys General \n     passed a resolution urging the National Indian Gaming \n     Commission and U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to take \n     action to prevent the ``illegal'' lottery. A bill introduced \n     in Congress would effectively kill the planned lottery by \n     amending current law to require that all players be \n     physically present at the game.\n       The tribe wants to run its weekly game where state \n     lotteries already exist--that's 36 states and the District of \n     Columbia, a huge potential market that far exceeds any other \n     lottery. The tribe contends it has received all the \n     government approvals it needs and says its detractors are \n     just afraid of competition.\n       Indeed, that fear is high in Florida. Officials say the \n     Indian lottery could severely hurt ticket sales for the \n     Florida Lottery, and cut into the more than $800 million it \n     raises for public schools each year.\n       Butterworth vows to go to court the moment the tribe's \n     lottery is up and running.\n       Yet another form of electronic gambling that is now being \n     offered by lotteries in five states, including California and \n     New York, is keno. But it's doubtful it will appear in \n     Florida, at least in the near future.\n       Under keno, players select up to 20 of 80 numbers, and then \n     watch randomly selected numbers flash on a screen. How much \n     they win depends on how many of their numbers appear. The \n     games are run every five minutes, and terminals are being \n     installed in restaurants, bars, bowling alleys and \n     convenience stores.\n       Florida Lottery Secretary Marcia Mann said her staff hasn't \n     studied keno for possible introduction and doesn't intent to.\n       ``Knowing our governor like I do, I think he would see that \n     as too much of a proliferation of gambling and too much like \n     casinos,'' she said. Gov. Lawton Chiles has generally been a \n     staunch opponent of gambling.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/15/senate-section/article/S17101-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            MEASURES PLACED ON CALENDAR--S. 1410 AND S. 1411\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until the \nhour of 9 a.m. on Thursday, November 16; that following the prayer, the \nJournal of proceedings be deemed approved to date, no resolutions come \nover under the rule, the call of the calendar be dispensed with, the \nmorning hour be deemed to have expired, and the time for the two \nleaders be reserved for their use later in the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I think Senators should, therefore, be on notice that we \ncan expect votes probably tomorrow morning. We hope to complete action \non this by early afternoon, I hope. As I understand, there may be no \nmore than two amendments, so we will just take it up at 9 o'clock. \nSenator Hatfield, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, has been \nnotified. And, hopefully, we can turn to any other available conference \nreports tomorrow.\n  I will just say I do not think it would be helpful to stay here until \nthe House completes action. It would be after 11 o'clock, and by the \ntime we completed action it would be 2 or 3 in the morning. So even if \nit were passed, it would not get to the White House until morning and \nthat would not be in time to alert anybody, assuming he signed it, to \ncome back to work. So I think we are not losing any time nor \nprejudicing anybody's rights by taking this up tomorrow morning at 9 \no'clock.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I share the view expressed by the \nmajority leader and can assure him that we are prepared to go to the \nresolution. We will be offering amendments. It is certainly not our \nintention to delay the consideration and final passage of the \nresolution, hopefully, sometime early afternoon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/15/senate-section/article/S17102-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CHANGE OF VOTE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.
