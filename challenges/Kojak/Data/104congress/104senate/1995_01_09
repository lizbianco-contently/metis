Replace our greed with Your giving. Replace our \nignorance with Your truth, we pray.\n  In this place where so many would seek to bind wills and votes in \ntheir knowledge of a part of the truth, we pray that You would, in Your \nmercy, supply those gathered for business here today with all the truth \nthey need to do the work You have committed into their hands. Teach \nthem how, we pray, in the frustrations of committees and compromises, \nin the honest uncertainties of ever-changing challenges, teach them how \nto secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and to our posterity, \nand to help to extend those freedoms around Your world.\n  Give us, as a nation, we pray, the freedom that comes through Your \ntruth, and use even our actions here this day to that end for Jesus' \nsake.

Mr. President, this past Saturday I read in the New York \nTimes an interesting editorial dealing with the challenge of attracting \ngood teachers into the Nation's classrooms, and the importance of \nhaving well-qualified, well-trained, and excellent teachers. \n[[Page S610]] \n  There can be no greater challenge to us today than improving our \neducation system throughout the country. It struck me as I read the \neditorial that this calls the attention of all of us to the fact that \nno matter what kind of programs we have, how much money we spend, what \nkind of national goals we adopt and try to implement, if we do not have \ngood, qualified, conscientious, and committed teachers in the \nclassrooms of the schools of America, we are not going to have a good \neducation system. They are the cornerstone of our education system in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the New York \nTimes editorial of Saturday to which I refer be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 7, 1995]\n\n                  A National Reward for Good Teachers\n\n       Ever since the mid-1980's, when a series of landmark \n     studies called for drastic changes in the nation's schools, \n     American educators have been seeking ways to raise teaching \n     standards. That effort bore its first fruit this week when 81 \n     gifted teachers were awarded national teaching certification \n     at a ceremony in Washington.\n       The ceremony may turn out to be a pivotal moment in the \n     history of American education. Many educators hope that the \n     81 recipients will be the first small vanguard of a new \n     generation of highly qualified teachers who, in turn, will \n     nourish better schools and better students.\n       Until Thursday, no teacher possessed a national \n     certificate. Public school teachers are certified by states \n     and localities. One hope is that recipients will be able to \n     move from state to state without facing recertification. \n     Another is that states and localities will reward \n     certificate-holders with higher pay, thus offering an \n     incentive to other teachers.\n       But the real value of the certificate may have been \n     identified by Arthur Levine, the president of Teachers \n     College at Columbia University. These first awards, he said, \n     ``provide some sense that around the country there is some \n     agreement on what makes for a good teacher.''\n       The certificates grew out of a report called ``A Nation \n     Prepared: Teachers for the 21st Century,'' which led to the \n     creation of a National Board for Professional Teaching \n     Standards in 1987. The idea was to raise standards for \n     teachers and elevate their status, treating them more like \n     doctors and other professionals.\n       The board then set about creating a licensing system. The \n     heart of the system is an exhaustive series of tests aimed at \n     finding out how teachers teach and evaluating their \n     effectiveness.\n       A group of 539 volunteers has now completed tests for \n     English-language specialists and generalists who teach early \n     adolescents. The 81 winners came from the generally/early \n     adolescent category, and more are scheduled to follow among \n     the English teachers.\n       The volunteers submitted portfolios of their work--\n     videotapes of classroom techniques, examples of their \n     students' work, references from colleagues and written self-\n     assessments. They were also tested on subject matter and \n     teaching techniques. Participants found that the rigorous \n     assessment process was itself an exercise in professional \n     growth.\n       Preparing for the test costs money. At least eight states \n     have already taken action to support or reward teachers who \n     seek national board certification. Others should follow suit. \n     If stronger teaching is the most important element in \n     improving schools--and most educators believe it is--then the \n     certification process is certain to give a huge boost to the \n     effort to give American schoolchildren a better deal than \n     they now receive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/09/senate-section/article/S609-7", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is with a great deal of pride and \nhumility that I rise today as Wyoming's newest Senator. It is a great \nhonor, of course, to be here. I take the floor to speak about a matter \nwhich is of great concern to me and all of us, and that is the future \nof this country. We have a historic opportunity to make real changes in \nthe way the Federal Government operates and in how the American people \nperceive their Government. It seems to me that we either move boldly \nforward with the changes demanded by the electorate last November 8, or \nwe squander the only real, true chance of restoring the American \npeople's confidence in their Government.\n  The true test of government, it seems to me, is how responsive it is \nto the will of the voters. Mr. President, as I traveled Wyoming these \nlast few months and talked to the folks from Cheyenne to Cody, I heard \na recurring theme from my constituents. Over and over, they told me to \nget Government out of their lives, to restore fiscal responsibility to \nWashington, and above all else, to put an end to business as usual.\n  Judging by the results of the last election, it was a common message \nthroughout the country. There should be no doubt about the message sent \nto Washington last November, and that was we need less government, less \nexpensive government. People are tired of the status quo, and they want \nchanges in how Government operates.\n    \n    \n  Unfortunately, as we all know, government in modern times has become \nincreasingly resistant to change. As I read history, it is not unusual \nfor voters to call for change. They did so about every generation in \nthe 1800's up into the 1900's, until about 1930 when the Federal \nGovernment began to get much larger. As it has become a more and more \npervasive part of our lives, to where it is now, with the size of the \nFederal Government plus the outside bureaucracies that have been built \nup through the decades, it becomes more and more difficult to change.\n  These constituencies and the Government stubbornly fight to protect \ntheir piece of the Federal funding pie. Federal programs do not die; \nthey do not even fade away. They grow and grow.\n  As the Federal Government has grown, the American people have grown \nincreasingly disenfranchised. Not only do Americans distrust their \nGovernment, but many do not even bother to vote because they do not \nbelieve their vote can help effect change. I suppose that is because in \npast elections, change has not come about and the direction the country \nhas remained much the same. We cannot repeat that mistake.\n  The first lesson we must learn is that we cannot continue to do the \nsame things, to follow the same procedures, and expect different \nresults. If we want to change the direction this country is moving, \nthen we have to make procedural changes in the Government.\n  Many argue that we do not need a balanced budget amendment, that we \nsimply ought to balance the budget. Let me suggest to you that for 40 \nyears that has not worked. Indeed, in my opinion, there does need to be \na change in procedure and there does need to be some discipline that \ncauses us to have a balanced budget.\n  We have made a good start. We will pass a measure that causes \nCongress to live under the same laws that it mandated for others. Next \nweek, we will move to eliminate unfunded Federal mandates. We need to \npass a balanced budget amendment and give the President line-item-veto \nauthority. As we demand a smaller Federal Government, we need to lead \nby example and reduce the congressional bureaucracy.\n  The American people support these changes. They will go a long way \ntoward building the base from which to bring fundamental change to \nevery sector of the Government.\n  Mr. President, there will be many important issues debated on the \nfloor of the Senate over the next 2 years. Some of my priorities \ninclude health care reform, tax reduction, welfare reform, and reducing \nthe growth of Federal ownership of public lands, to name just a few. \nBut no issue is as important as the structural changes I mentioned \nearlier.\n  Without significant change in the way the Congress and the Federal \nGovernment operates, other important changes in policy will be \ndifficult. The American people will be watching closely to see if we \nrespond to their cry for change. I certainly heard that message in \nWyoming loud and clear. I hope that this time, Washington is listening, \nas well.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. \n[[Page S611]] \n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/09/senate-section/article/S610-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LIFETIME DREAM REALIZED\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, 40 years ago, when my wife, Mary, and I \nwere students at LSU, we discussed my dream of some day serving in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  I am one of those few fortunate human beings who have seen his dreams \nfulfilled in the fullest and most satisfying sense. This year, 1995, \nmarks my 31st consecutive year in elective office. Over 22 of those \nyears have been in this most noble and hallowed institution.\n  James MacGregor Burns says that the measure of a man is not the \nhonors he has received, but the difference he has made by his service.\n  Mr. President, I believe that, working with my colleagues and a \nwonderful staff, we have made a difference for Louisiana. When I first \nstarted working on the North-South Highway for Louisiana, the trip was \nbumpy, dangerous, and slow. Today, Interstate 49 competes for motor \nfreight shipments with a brand new Red River navigation system. We have \nimproved our ports, dredged our rivers and harbors and built levees to \ncontrol our flooding. By Federal statute, we have set aside over $600 \nmillion in a so-called 8(g) fund for education, and we have built \nresearch facilities and secured research funds for all our institutions \nof higher learning in Louisiana. By Federal law, we have created nine \nwildlife refuges, with more than 100,000 acres of protected land, and \nthree national parks that now receive over 1 million visitors a year.\n  I am proud of these accomplishments, but I am most proud of what they \nwill mean for the young people of our State.\n  Mr. President, it has been my privilege to serve on the Energy \nCommittee for 22 years, 8 of those as chairman, and to have a hand in \nevery major piece of legislation which has been passed from that \ncommittee during those years, from deregulation of natural gas to the \nNational Energy Policy Act. We have pushed free markets, free trade and \nfree enterprise. We have fought for the poor, for the disadvantaged, \nand for our senior citizens.\n  These 22 years have been successful and satisfying. I have simply \nloved it. But now, Mr. President, I must decide whether to continue \nSenate service or to depart in 2 years at the end of this term. Much \nargues for continued service. I love the Senate and I love to \nlegislate. I am in superb health and have abundant energy, and \nreelection, though never assured, seems highly likely.\n  Nevertheless, Mr. President, I am today announcing that I will \nterminate my Senate service at the end of this term. I will not seek \nreelection in 1996.\n  There are rhythms and tides and seasons in life. I have been \nfortunate in my life to sense the rhythm and sail it full tide, and now \nI believe that the season for a new beginning approaches. As my \ncolleague Russell Long used to say, ``It is important to retire as a \nchamp and to leave the stage when the crowd still likes your singing.''\n  I make this announcement now for two reasons. First, to allow me to \ndevote my full time and attention to what will be a very active and, I \nhope, productive 2 years, and, second, to allow time for my would-be \nsuccessors to make their plans and to conduct their campaigns.\n  Who will succeed me? I do not now have a candidate, but I want my \nsuccessor to share some deeply held views of mine: that politics and \npublic service are synonymous; that the pursuit of public office is a \nhigh calling--in our society, it is the best opportunity for helping \nyour State, your country, and your fellow man; that the Senate, with \nits faults and criticisms, remains a bulwark of our democracy and a \nhallowed institution. I will stand up for it, will not bash it and will \ndefend it against those who do. Years 1995 and 1996 will be an exciting \n2 years, and after that I look forward to a new life and new \nchallenges, doing what I do not know except that it will not be \nretirement.\n  Mr. President, I love the State of Louisiana. Its people have \nbestowed upon me honor and power and a rare privilege. For that, I, my \nwife, and my family are profoundly grateful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n       senator bennett johnston's Exemplary Service To The Senate\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, we have just heard a very profound and a \nvery significant statement by the senior Senator from my State of \nLouisiana, very significant in what it means to my State of Louisiana, \nsignificant in what it means to this Senate by his announcement--very \nprofound, indeed, because of what it says about an individual and what \nhis priorities are and what he thinks public service is all about.\n  When our State looks back over the long history of service by my \ncolleague, people will remember a number of tremendous contributions \nand contributions yet to be made in the last 2 years of his term in the \nSenate. I look back and remember the David Duke campaign and a Bennett \nJohnston who stopped him in his tracks. I look at projects throughout \nour State of Louisiana: The Red River project, which would clearly not \nbe there except for his strong commitment and never-ending \ndetermination to see it started and completed, and it will be because \nof his effort. I look back and see ideas like risk assessment, which is \na very popular idea in 1995, that my colleague championed even before \nit was an idea in most of our minds. It is now on its way to being the \nlaw of the land.\n  I look back and see a number of universities that today, tomorrow, \nand in the future will be doing research in science projects which will \nbenefit not only this generation but generations to come because of the \nwisdom of my senior Senator in seeing that Federal dollars were wisely \nspent in those areas.\n  I look back and see the very essence of our State of Louisiana \nthrough his efforts in wetlands restoration and wetlands protection \nthat literally future generations will have a State to live in and to \nenjoy because of his great efforts today and yesterday in devising \nFederal programs to help those wetlands remain a part of our great \nState.\n  Indeed, his services will stand as a monument to all those young men \nand women who today perhaps are a little turned off by the concept of \npublic service, who think that somehow if you are there, you are not \ndoing the work of the average citizen. Bennett Johnston's effort has \nalways been to help people in our State to live a better life and to \nhave a better future. So I think that his service will stand as a \nmonument and an incentive to encourage other young people, men and \nwomen, to become involved in public service because public service is \nepitomized by his career, and he still has 2 very important years \nremaining.\n  Public service is more than just being a critic. It is more than just \nbeing someone who complains about the status quo. Public service, as \nBennett Johnston has carried it out, is public service that means \nhelping to solve problems and helping to construct things that help \npeople and to do things in a very positive sense. In his service in the \nSenate--and it has been my privilege to be his junior colleague for so \nlong--he will always be remembered as a doer and a person who believed \nin this institution and who believed in making things happen for the \ngood of all of us. His service will be a shining monument of that type \nof attitude, of what public service is all about.\n  I congratulate him and his family for what I know must have been a \ndifficult decision, but I applaud him for having the courage to make it \nand to serve with all of us over these years in such an exemplary \nfashion. It gives us a lot after which to pattern our lives and \ncareers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/09/senate-section/article/S611-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S611-S616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n             announcement of retirement of bennett johnston\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, on occasions of this kind, we are prone \nto look back and think historically as well as to absorb the magnitude \nof the statement of the moment given by my good friend, Senator Bennett \nJohnston, from Louisiana. [[Page S612]] \n  When I came to the Senate, I had the privilege of serving with Allen \nEllender and Senator Russell Long, who represented the State of \nLouisiana at that particular time in 1967.\n  Mr. President, I must say that the strength of those two leaders at \nthat time certainly has been carried on in the tradition of Louisiana \nvoters and the subsequent Senators, including Senator Bennett Johnston \nand his colleague today who serves with him from Louisiana, John \nBreaux.\n  Mr. President, I have had the privilege of serving with Senator \nJohnston on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee now for all the \nyears that he has been in the Senate. It was then called the Interior \nCommittee of the Senate and Insular Affairs, and then its name was \nchanged and, of course, all that time he has been chairman of that \ncommittee.\n  In addition to that, both Senator Johnston and I serve on the \nAppropriations Committee, and we begin this year the 18th year we have \nserved in partnership either as chairman or the ranking member, as \nSenator Johnston has occupied that seat, or as I now occupy that seat \nas chairman of that subcommittee and he the ranking member, as I say, \nfor 18 years.\n  I think on both the authorizing committee and the appropriating \ncommittee, we get a very, very intimate relationship of the total \nlegislative process. I want to say it has not only been an honor and a \npersonal pleasure, but I have marveled at the way Senator Johnston has \ncarried his duties and responsibilities in both of those committees, \ndemonstrating competence, demonstrating brilliance of understanding of \nthe issues. He gets up and starts talking about the nuclear power \nfacilities, and so forth and so on, and I am always happy to defer to \nhim, whether I am chairman or ranking member, any time that subject \ncomes up because there is no one on this floor that has greater \nintimate knowledge of that complexity of nuclear energy than Senator \nJohnston.\n  I also want to say that Senator Johnston's Christmas cards, when he \nfirst came here, showed this beautiful family--beautiful Mary, his \nwife, and his children. I watched that Christmas card expand over the \nyears. I think it is very significant that sitting next to him on the \nfloor of the Senate today is a very distinguished congressman from the \nState of Indiana, who happens to be his son-in-law, Tim Roemer. I am \nvery, very pleased to know that he is leaving more than just a legacy \nof record. He is leaving in the Congress of the United States a legacy \nof leadership that will continue.\n  Mr. President, there are so many things that come to my mind. I am \nflooded with memories of the thousands of miles that he and I have \ntraveled with our spouses and other members of the committee from \nChina, Thailand, Indonesia, throughout the whole Pacific region.\n  I want to say even though he is noted as perhaps the expert here of \nenergy, among his other expertise, whenever he has chaired a Codel and \nis called upon to respond to the head of state, to the prime minister \nor the president or the foreign minister--whoever might be hosting us \nat the moment--on any foreign policy, he can respond with grace and \nwith, again, a manner in which we all take pride of being Americans and \nbeing his associate and colleague on these Codels.\n  So he is a Renaissance man with great capacity for many, many \nsubjects. He does everything with fairness and with objectivity. I \noften say some of his problems on the committees have been that he has \nsupported Republican causes that have not always been supported by the \nmajority of his own Democratic Party on that committee. He has been \nthat kind of broad-based, Renaissance person.\n  This is a decision he has to make. I have regrets in hearing this \ndecision. They are selfish and personal because I have 2 years yet as \nwell and it also causes me to have to reflect on what my future is. But \nif I should run for reelection and get reelected, I would be very, very \nmuch lesser a person because I would miss the expertise and counsel of \nBennett Johnston.\n  But, Bennett, being very informal at this moment on the floor, I want \nto say, as a long-time fan and supporter of yours and personal friend, \nI greet this news with great mixed emotions. I am happy for you and \nyour family in many ways, yet I am regretful for what you are going to \ndeny the Senate as far as the future.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                        A Lot of Miles Yet to Go\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am sorry to say to the Senator from \nGeorgia, I left a meeting and I will take about 30 seconds here with my \nfriend.\n  This is not the time to say goodbye to Senator Johnston. We are \nsaddened to hear the statement of the senior Senator from Louisiana. I \nthink that Senator Johnston spent enough time in my State to be \nqualified to vote, and I spent almost the same amount of time in his \nState for other reasons, I might add.\n  But I am saddened to hear the announcement of my good friend. I \nunderstand his reasons, and I really seriously marvel at his capacity \nto make such a judgment, but I do think that we have a lot of things \nleft undone. We have a lot of miles to go yet, and I will say my \nfarewells when the time comes. Meanwhile, I say to my good friend, we \nhave one big battle, and that is the battle of wetlands. I hope he will \nbe there with us until the end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                  Tribute to Senator Bennett Johnston\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I, too, want to say a few words about this \nman we all think so much of, the Senator from Louisiana, Senator \nJohnston.\n  Until a time I can reflect on it at length and really go over some of \nthe historical accomplishments he has been so involved in, I remember \nvery well when he got elected to the U.S. Senate because I got elected \nthe same time.\n  With one exception, we have seen eye to eye on virtually everything \nsince we have been here, and that one exception was the first day he \narrived, he had a news conference saying he was the senior Member of \nthe class of 1972. That was not only erroneous but it was to the \ndetriment of the Senator from Georgia. The next day we had a chance to \nmeet personally. The first thing I informed him was he had to retract \nthat statement because it was not correct. He did that graciously when \nhe found out the accuracy of my remark. Ever since then, he has been on \ntarget.\n  I must say, my colleagues have already enumerated some of his \naccomplishments. He has been an expert in his own field of energy. He \nhas been an expert in the field of environment. He has also been an \nexpert in the field of foreign policy and national security. He has \ntraveled all over the globe. He knows people all over the globe. He is \nrespected all over the globe. He has a following all over, not only in \nthis country but throughout the world.\n  On the Appropriations Committee, he has been a stalwart in that area. \nHe has been one of few people, few of us who have been willing to take \non the tough subject of entitlements over the years, and if some of \nthose votes he and I and some others made together back in the eighties \nand even before had passed at that time, we would not have some of the \nentitlement problems we have today.\n  So he has had an outstanding legislative record. I will enumerate \nthat at a later date. But the most important thing he has done is what \nso many people have difficulty doing here in Washington, and that is, \nwhile he has done all of this for his State and for his constituents \nand for the people of this Nation, he has held his family together. \nThat is the toughy. Anyone who works 60, 70 hours a week, travels on \nweekends, and makes speeches all over is always under pressure, that \ncan maintain the love and relationship with his wonderful wife, Mary, \nthe children, Sally, Mary, Bennett, Hunter, and all of his family, that \nis truly the exception rather than the rule in this very busy, \nstressful place.\n  So he has a family that loves him. He has a wonderful set of children \nthat are doing their own things in their own professions, and he has a \nson-in-law, as we have already heard, from Indiana who is here on the \nfloor with him as a Member of Congress.\n  So I list, Bennett, your accomplishments as keeping your family \ntogether and raising a wonderful group of children with, of course, the \ntremendous help of Mary who is as outstanding as [[Page S613]] any \nindividual I know, and also maintaining a wonderful relationship with \nyour staff. You can tell a lot about a Senator by his staff. Bennett \nJohnston has an outstanding staff. Some of them are here today. I \nworked with many of them over a period of time, and I know others of \nthem on the floor have worked with them. You can tell an awful lot.\n  So I say to my friend, for his own future, I am sure he has reflected \nlong and hard on this decision and, from that point of view, I \ncongratulate him. From the point of view of the Senate, I am \nremorseful. I think we are going to be a lesser body when he leaves \nhere in 2 years, although for the next 2 years, he will be, I am sure, \nas energetic, productive, and effective as he has ever been.\n  But I do understand the decision. I understand it. All of us have to \ngo through this kind of thought process. He made the decision quicker \nthan I thought he would. If I had predicted 2 weeks ago, I would have \npredicted the other way around. But I know he made it after a great \ndeal of thought, a great deal of prayerful consideration with his \nfamily and his staff.\n  So it is not an announcement that I take lightly, or with any kind of \nfeeling of celebration, because I understand the deficit that is going \nto be left when this outstanding U.S. Senator does retire in 2 years. \nSo I congratulate him on his service. I do not congratulate him, \nnecessarily, on the decision because I do want to talk to him a little \nbit about it. But I do commend him on his splendid record of service \nfor the State of Louisiana and the Nation.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n               Bennett Johnston, The Master Of The Close\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I heard about 2:15 this afternoon that \nSenator Johnston was going to take the floor, so I picked up the phone \nand tried to reach him and missed him. I wanted to just say a few \nwords.\n  I listened, back in my office, to what he had to say. I was thinking, \nback when this mayor from San Francisco in the mid-1980's came back to \nsee the head of the Energy Committee. I had an opportunity and I walked \ninto his office. I saw the pelicans. I did not even know if he would \nreally listen to me. I found a human being who was open, who was \ngentle, who was kind, who was listening, and who was interested. Then, \nof course, in 1992 I came to this Senate and I found a man who was a \nleader of the U.S. Senate--certainly a leader on the Democratic side \nand I believe a leader in the Senate--who had worked for 22 years, who \nhad established a reputation in this body.\n  I might say, many of the Members on our side, when we were discussing \nthe California Desert Protection Act, said toward the close of the \nsession, ``Don't worry. Watch Bennett. He is a master of the close.''\n  And as the months went on, the debate and the discussion on this \nbill, I saw indeed that Bennett Johnston was not only a master of the \nclose, but was a master of strategy. I saw he is a man who is bright. \nHe is a man who is articulate. But he is also somebody who is always a \ngentleman, always receptive, always able to say what he thinks in a way \nthat brings the best from everyone around him.\n  So, Bennett Johnston, I want to say to you: In the few days we have \nbeen back, this is the worst news I have heard. Even worse than the \nContract With America, in many respects. I am just so sorry that this \nis going to happen. But there is one thing I do know: Even if you have \nmade up your mind there are still 2 years, so we will be hearing much \nmore from Bennett Johnston, the master of the close.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                  Senator Bennett Johnston, Statesman\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, it is a sad day for the Senate, a sad day \nfor the Nation, when we find out we will be losing a Member of the U.S. \nSenate who has contributed so much to this body as an institution and \nto this Nation as a whole.\n  We do not use the word ``statesman'' very often. I grew up hearing it \nmuch more frequently than I hear it today. I think we look at certain \nareas of expertise and accomplishment and we realize that there are \nstatesmen in those fields, as well as from a generalist viewpoint. I \nlook back over the career of Bennett Johnston and I remember when I \ncame to the Senate, this Nation was in an energy crisis. We were \ntalking about shortages and what had to be done. I remember President \nCarter's speech with his sweater.\n  But Bennett Johnston stood out in those days as a voice of reason, \ncalling for an energy policy that was really very detailed, but was \naccompanied by great reasoning. His energy policy prevailed over the \nyears, and we weathered that crisis. As we have gone through the \nchanges relative to energy policy and the relationship of nuclear \nenergy, Bennett Johnston has always come forward with expertise, with \nreason, and with a view toward the future and has accomplished \ntremendous feats in regard to the energy field. He had the unique \nposition of serving as chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources and the subcommittee dealing with energy and water \ndevelopment of the Appropriations Committee. It is very unusual for a \nperson to occupy those two positions simultaneously, but because of his \nexpertise and seniority and his choice, he selected those. And I think \nthe Nation has been the beneficiary as a result of it.\n  His State of Louisiana has greatly benefited from his service. I \nconsider Bennett a conservative, a progressive conservative. He is a \nsoutherner. We have pretty well agreed on most issues, as Sam Nunn \nmentioned a while ago. And he has really taken on a great deal in his \npolitical life, in taking on certain tasks that other people would \nattempt to evade and to avoid.\n  He has had to fight bigots. He has had to fight those who were \nintolerant. He has moved forward in the South toward having improved \nrace relations and has been a great voice of reason in pursuing that \nparticular task. And the South today has many benefits that really \nresulted from his leadership.\n  He has been a wonderful family man. I think Sam spoke about that, the \nfact that he has a delightful, wonderful, charming wife, Mary, and four \nchildren: Bennett, Hunter, Sally and Mary. They are great examples of a \nfamily and to the fact that there are such close ties among them. He \nhas been one of those who have advocated, as we all agree that we \nshould, an improved quality of life in the Senate in order that we \nspend more time with our families. He and David Pryor have been voices \nthat have sounded forth many times on the improvement of the quality of \nlife in the Senate. Hopefully, our new minority leader will agree and \nhopefully he can influence our majority leader a little bit toward \nfollowing the advice that Bennett Johnston has given in the past \nrelative to this.\n  He loves this institution and he has really done a great deal. I stop \nand think of all he has done. Sometimes you do not belong to the \nrespective committees, but he has been a tremendous spokesman for \nsouthern agriculture. I look back upon many of the battles we have had \nrelative to agriculture and know that his voice has been the voice of a \nchampion, pertaining to those issues. Then, in foreign affairs, he \nwould come back from his trips--I can remember him many times talking \nabout the Pacific rim and its great future and the fact that we needed \nto develop better relationships with the Pacific rim nations because \nmuch of the future would lie there, and the progress that has taken \nplace in recent years pertaining to this.\n  (Mr. SANTORUM assumed the chair.)\n  So we with great sadness see the announcement of the departure some 2 \nyears from now of a statesman in the field of energy, a statesman in \nthe field of race relations, a statesman who has done much for this \nNation. We will have lost a great Senator. We are now losing a great \nchairman, but nevertheless he will continue as a spokesman in his \nparticular fields. But he has also served in so many other different \nways on the budget, in the field of aging, and in the field of \nintelligence, having served in committees in that capacity.\n  We salute Bennett. I think maybe the real reason behind this is that \nhe is feeling that he is getting a little older, that he is not as \naccomplished a tennis player as he used to be, and that his colleague, \nJohn Breaux, is now beating him more often than he used to. Perhaps \nthat might have affected his decision relative to this matter. \n[[Page S614]] \n  But we look forward to his, as he leaves and when he leaves the \nSenate, continuing to give us advice, counsel, and we know he will \ncontinue to be a friend.\n  I say to him, my friend, that this is a sad day for America and for \nthe Senate. But we respect his decision.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I inquire of my colleague, Senator Pryor. \nHe was waiting to speak before I came in and he requested time to do \nso.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I respond to my friend from Wyoming by \nsaying that I have been here for some time and I am enjoying all these \nspeeches so much. I have no preference as to when I speak.\n  So I would love to listen to the Senator from Wyoming, to hear him \ntalk about our friend, Bennett Johnston.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, if I said that my remarks would not \nexceed 5 minutes, there would be an audible gasp. However, I want you \nto observe the clock and you will find that they shall not exceed the \nperiod of 5 minutes. I, too, will say a lot more later.\n  I thank my friend from Arkansas, who came here when I did, Senator \nPryor, and Senator Heflin, also. We have a special bond in our class \nwhich is very strong that crosses party lines. In fact, the other \nevening we met, the survivors of the class of 1978, and talked about \nhow we might try to make this place work better with bipartisanship. \nThat is an effort that we will pursue with people of the caliber of \nSenator Pryor and Senator Heflin.\n  But let me just say a word about my friend. Bennett Johnston is a \nspecial man, a man of remarkable brightness, energy, and a wonderful \nsense of humor, and a person who could come to this floor in the midst \nof a debate on nuclear fission and without a note suddenly be totally \nin the fray or who could come here on issues of energy, Btu's or public \nlands and without a note debate for an hour or two taking questions, \nfielding questions thoroughly engaged.\n  So what I learned from him is a remarkable intellect blended with a \nwonderful mind and an ability to deal with complex issues, and when \neveryone else, like in the words of Rudyard Kipling, was ``losing their \nheads,'' blaming it on you, Bennett would be right there with that \nwonderful whimsical smile which is difficult to identify sometimes. You \nnever know quite what is being concocted there with that smile. But I \nhave seen it many times, and it is always with a gentleness.\n  So I thank him for what he taught me on nuclear issues as I chaired \nthe nuclear regulations subcommittee as a freshman, and how he helped \nme on all energy issues when I was again chairing that committee. On \npublic lands issues, I watched my colleague from Wyoming, Malcolm \nWallop, work with him and watched Bennett and Malcolm, even though they \ndisagreed strongly, work so well together. They gave us finally an \nenergy bill that was unattainable for decades. I thank him for that.\n  He is dogged, determined, with a persistence and steadiness which is \nenviable.\n  So I thank him. I have been privileged to travel with him. Whatever \nthey have said about Mary is not enough. That is a special woman, and \nit has been a great honor and privilege to travel with him. Whether it \nwas in Vietnam or China or around the world, dealing with nuclear \nissues, any time Bennett rose to give the greetings or receive the \nacknowledgment from another head of state, we just all sat back and \nknew it would be done with wonderful compassion, skill, and a \ncompletely tactful presentation. He was our spokesman, and whatever \nside of the aisle you were on, you never even questioned that.\n  So a gentle, congenial man of very steady demeanor will be greatly \nmissed. It is not easy to find people who will do this kind of work and \ntake what goes with it. We are thin-skinned sometimes. I know I am. But \nhe just smiles and takes it, and can dish it right back in beautiful \nfashion and always with a gentler, much gentler, recipe than it has \nbeen dished out to him.\n  So to Bennett and to Mary, and their dear family, and to the son-in-\nlaw who will serve us in Congress on the other side of the aisle, I \nwish them all well.\n  It has been a rich personal privilege for Ann and for me to come to \nknow Bennett and Mary Johnston, and we love them. We wish them well in \nwhatever they may wish to do in the future.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, this is indeed a sad day. It is a sad day \nfor the U.S. Senate. It is indeed a sad day for the State of Arkansas \nto be losing one of our colleagues from this Senate, but of equal \nimportance to be losing, Mr. President, one of our neighbors, the \nHonorable Bennett Johnston as our colleague and friend from our \nneighboring State of Louisiana.\n  We have often said, Dale Bumpers and I--and I am sure he will \neloquently address this momentarily--Senator Bumpers and I have often \nsaid in our State that we have three Senators, that we are very \nfortunate, and that the third Senator is the Senator from Louisiana, \nwho on every project, Mr. President, on every issue has stood shoulder \nto shoulder not only with Senator Bumpers and myself and our \npredecessors in this body but also with our State and its people in the \nprojects that we pursued on many occasions.\n  Senator Johnston in his eloquent, and I must say brief, remarks, \ntalked about two principles, one of honor, that the people had honored \nhim. And all of us know Senator Johnston well. I know that honor was \nbestowed upon Senator Johnston and that he treated that honor basically \nas holding that honor in trust for the people of his State and the \npeople of this country. The other characteristic that he addressed was \npower, that the people of Louisiana had bestowed upon him as a U.S. \nSenator a great power.\n  Mr. President, I can say without reservation that of the some 20 \nyears that I have known this fine gentleman, I have never seen nor have \nI ever heard of this fine man ever once abusing that power or of taking \nthat power for granted.\n  Mr. President, Bennett Johnston will go down in the annals of this \ngreat U.S. Senate as one of the great doers and one of the great \nbuilders that this body has ever produced. The Senate has been a better \nplace because of him. His life and his example and his family all mean \nso much to all of us.\n\n  Mr. President, I notice that the distinguished Presiding Officer, the \nnew Senator from Pennsylvania, is seated today presiding over the U.S. \nSenate. I know that he faces a middle aisle that some say divides the \nRepublicans from the Democrats. I have a feeling, Mr. President, that \nSenator Bennett Johnston, our friend and neighbor from Louisiana, has \nnever seen that middle aisle as a line of demarcation, nor as a line of \ndivision, but merely as a line of invitation to join hands and join \nparties, whether Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative, on \nthose issues that face this country and those issues that must make us \na better people.\n  Bennett Johnston, in my opinion, has been able to bridge that gap and \nto cross that aisle in friendship, in principle, in camaraderie and \ncomity, as well as any Member that I have ever seen in the U.S. Senate. \nHe is a wise and a good man. It has been my extreme pleasure and honor \nto serve in this body with Bennett Johnston, my friend and colleague \nfrom the great State of Louisiana.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                  Tribute To Senator Bennett Johnston\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to associate myself with the \nremarks made by so many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in \ntribute to our friend and colleague, Bennett Johnston.\n  A couple of days ago, I read some words written by George Bernard \nShaw that I think probably as closely epitomized how I view Bennett \nJohnston as any I have read in my time in the Senate. I would like to \nbegin what I hope to be very brief remarks, keeping to the approach \nused by our distinguished colleague from Wyoming in being brief this \nafternoon.\n  George Bernard Shaw wrote:\n\n       This is the true joy in life: Being used for a purpose \n     recognized by yourself as a mighty one, being a force of \n     nature instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments \n     and grievances, complaining that the world will \n     [[Page S615]] not devote itself to making you happy. I am of \n     the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community, and \n     as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. I \n     want to be thoroughly used up when I finish, for the harder I \n     work, the more I love. I rejoice in life for its own sake. \n     Life is no brief candle for me. It is a sort of splendid \n     torch which I have got ahold of for the moment. I want to \n     make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to \n     future generations.\n\n  Mr. President, that describes our friend, Bennett Johnston. For 22 \nyears, the people of Louisiana and the people of the United States have \nbeen blessed with the leadership of this outstanding U.S. Senator. \nBennett Johnston epitomizes the best in public service through his \nthoughtfulness, his fairness, his determination, his sense of humor, \nand his belief in love for his family. In this period of cynicism and \nugliness in politics, Bennett Johnston has stood as a pillar of \nintegrity, of hard work, of dedication, of devotion to public service.\n  I have had the good fortune to know him now for over 8 years. I am \nproud to call him my friend. I am proud that I will have the ability to \nwork closely with him for at least 2 more years. I respect his decision \nand know how deeply he feels about his family and his time spent on \nthose occasions walking with his wife, Mary. There will be other days, \nas others have said, to talk about the many accomplishments of Senator \nBennett Johnston, but today let me join with others in wishing him a \nfuture of good health and much happiness, recognizing that we do enjoy \nhis company, his work, his partnership, and the future that we hold \nwith him together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                  Tribute to Senator Bennett Johnston\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, a few moments ago, my staff came into the \noffice and said, ``Quick, turn on the television. Senator Bennett \nJohnston is announcing that he will retire after this term.'' I did, \nand I caught the remaining words that the Senator spoke.\n  I came immediately to the floor to express, on the part of the Idaho \nSenators who are serving and who have previously served in this body, \nthe respect we have for Senator Bennett Johnston of Louisiana. Other \nthan you, Mr. President, I am, at this moment in time, as I scan the \nfloor, one of the more junior Senators serving, although I am \nprivileged to be the senior Senator from Idaho. I say that in context \nto having arrived here 4 years ago, and to have asked the advice of the \nthen retiring senior Senator from Idaho, Jim McClure, ``From whom might \nI seek counsel as it relates to certain issues that are near and dear \nto our State of Idaho and to the Nation?'' --I served on the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee that Bennett Johnston was chairing at that \ntime and continued to chair through the 103d session of Congress--and \nwithout ever thinking of anything else, Jim McClure said, ``Chairman \nBennett Johnston.''\n  I had just served 10 years in the House, and I was used to the \ndynamics of the House. I thought to myself immediately: But he is a \nDemocrat; therefore, he is partisan. That was quite typical of the \nstyle of the House. There was not the comity nor the bipartisan nature \nof the Senate existing at that time in the House. I remember at that \ntime Senator McClure said, ``On the issues that you will be dealing \nwith, Larry, Bennett Johnston should always be your counsel. And when \nhe cannot be bipartisan--and there were times when he could not be--he \nwill be very straightforward because you will always know where he \nis.'' For those 4 years, following that advice, Bennett Johnston was \ntrue to the description of Jim McClure.\n  Let me also speak briefly for Steve Symms, recently retired from the \nU.S. Senate who, again, spoke similar words. My exposure in working \nwith Chairman Johnston over the last 4 years has certainly paid honor \nto both of those gentlemen and their respect for Bennett Johnston of \nLouisiana.\n  Bennett, personally, I will miss you. I will miss you because of your \ntalent and your energy and your willingness to be bipartisan and \ncooperative in the name of good public policy. And I oftentimes, Mr. \nPresident, marveled at the sharpness of mind and the detail with which \nBennett Johnston engaged the issues of energy. Whether it was \nelectrical energy generated by nuclear or hydro or coal power, he knew \nthe details. He knew the phenomenal maze of law that is bound around \nall of that, whether it was with the utility companies, or whether it \nwas with the Federal regulatory agencies. I was always amazed because I \nsuggest that never in my service in the U.S. Senate would I expect to \ncommand that kind of knowledge or understanding as does Chairman \nJohnston.\n  I will miss you, Bennett Johnston, because of these things and \nbecause you have become a friend, and I appreciate that. At the same \ntime, let me say how much I respect your willingness to recognize that \nthere was a time to say, ``I will do something different.'' I think \nthat is important for all of us, because I have the privilege of \nserving in the U.S. Senate because a senior Senator, at the peak of his \nsenatorial ability, announced his retirement, choosing to do something \nin the private sector of our country.\n  So I do respect those kinds of decisions, recognizing that there is \nlife after the Senate, and that expertise and talent and service can go \non to serve in other ways and in other capacities.\n  But for the coming 2 years, Bennett, you will remain a valuable and \ncontributive member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and \nthe Appropriation Committees on which you serve. While you now serve in \nthe minority, that will never stop me from seeking your counsel and \nyour advice because, while the title has changed, the respect has not. \nIn 2 years time, I will miss you, as will in body.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I defer to the Senator from Arkansas, \nwho I overlooked, who has been waiting for some time. I would like to \nbe recognized following his remarks in tribute to Bennett Johnston.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator from Alaska very much.\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BENNETT JOHNSTON\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is indeed a sad day for me \npersonally and, though Americans may not realize it, it is a sad day \nfor them, too.\n  The other morning, I read where former Secretary Cheney said he was \nnot going to run for President and, in a spate of candor customary to \nDick Cheney, said the price was ``too high.'' I toyed with a \nPresidential race one time and came to the same conclusion. I never did \nsay it, though.\n  But the truth of the matter is, public service, which I was taught by \nmy father was the noblest of all callings, has come to demand an almost \nimpossible price.\n  I have no idea what went into Senator Johnston's thinking in arriving \nat the decision not to seek reelection. I know he is a family man. He \nis one of the few people I would defer to, maybe slightly, in his \ndevotion to his family over me. So maybe that was it. But I am not here \nto wonder aloud what all went into his decision.\n  The first time I heard of Bennett Johnston was when he ran for \nGovernor of Louisiana and he was using the same media consultant I had \nused a year earlier in running for Governor of Arkansas, Deloss Walker. \nAnd while Bennett barely lost that election, he was elected handily for \nthe U.S. Senate 2 years later.\n  I might say to the Senator that that was probably the most fortuitous \nthing that ever happened to him. As a former Governor and Senator, I \ncan tell you it was the most fortuitous thing that ever happened.\n  But Deloss Walker had told me what a good candidate Senator Johnston \nwas. And so he came to the Senate 2 years before I did. I was put on \nthe Energy Committee, which was a widely sought committee assignment at \nthat time because the Arab oil embargo of 1973 had everybody frightened \nto death. We were going to become energy independent. We were going to \ndevelop alternative fuels, and you name it.\n  Senator Johnston had the seat just in front of me, and later of \ncourse became chairman of the committee. I forget the year. But I \nbecame ranking Democrat on that committee. [[Page S616]] \n  There are perhaps people in the Senate who have been closer to \nSenator Johnston than I have been, though I do not see how. I have \ntraveled with him abroad. I have sat at his right hand in that \ncommittee, all these years. I have found him to be an ardent opponent \non occasion. It took me forever to kill the super collider because he \nwas on the other side. And I did not really kill it. The House of \nRepresentatives deserve the credit for killing the super collider. But \nI can tell you, as long as Senator Johnston was in the Senate, it was \nnot going to happen over here.\n  But in good times and bad, in battles together and battles against \neach other, I found him always to be brilliant and tenacious, but \neminently fair. Last year, he took on another battle on the side of the \nangels that I had been fighting sort of a lonely battle for about 5 \nyears, and that was reform of the mining laws of this country. Senator \nJohnston got involved in that debate last year. He was tenacious. But I \npromise you some of his most ardent opponents, including the Senator \nfrom Alaska and the Senator from Idaho, will tell you they always found \nhim to be eminently fair. He held hearing after hearing, private \nhearings with them to see if there was any accommodation that could be \nmade that would satisfy them.\n  And on the California desert bill, another battle that I had been \ninvolved in for 6 years here, he took that battle on last year and won \nit and we passed the California desert bill. Some day the people of \nAmerica will look back and say we owe Bennett Johnston a big one for \nthat.\n  His announcement today follows the same announcement by two other \nfine men in this body, Hank Brown and Paul Simon. And my guess is there \nare going to be others.\n  We could sit here and I guess make partisan speeches or philosophical \nspeeches about whether or not the price of public service has become \ntoo high, and that would serve absolutely no useful purpose at this \npoint.\n  Bennett will have another career and he will have more time in that \ncareer. I do not know what it will be, but I promise you whatever he \ntakes up, whether he decides to become a professor in some law school \nor maybe teach political science or some contemporary course on \npolitics at LSU or someplace else, I do not care what it is, he will \nhave more time for his family than he has had in the past 22 years.\n  So, Mr. President, today is a sad time for me. It is going to be a \npersonal loss to me for Bennett to leave the Senate, but more \nimportantly it is a loss for America.\n  I have never favored term limits. It is not easy to go before an \naudience when you know 70 to 75 percent of that audience favors term \nlimits, and say you do not favor it, but I do not; never have. One \nreason is because it would arbitrarily cause us to lose good men and \nwomen with good minds, but, above all, a wealth of experience which we \ncherish in every single profession in America except here in politics.\n  Well, Mr. President, I will probably be here to say this a few more \ntimes over the next 2 years for good friends of mine who decide not to \nrun, but I can tell you I will not say with any more fervor or \nconviction at any point in the next 2 years, no matter who leaves here, \nthat this is truly a great loss to this Nation and especially to the \nState of Louisiana.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/09/senate-section/article/S611-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S616-S617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BENNETT JOHNSTON\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues acknowledging \nthe remarks of the senior Senator from Louisiana earlier on the floor \ntoday.\n  You know, it has been said you really never know a person until you \nhave walked in his footsteps. As the incoming chairman of the Energy \nCommittee, I take my first steps, Bennett Johnston, with great \nhumility.\n  I have observed, as a member of the minority, the manner in which you \nhave conducted the affairs of the Energy Committee. You have always \nbeen an extraordinary legislator. You have been a consensus builder. \nYou have had the capability to tackle the tough jobs and get the job \ndone. You have always had the energy and the commitment to move ahead, \nyet somehow you genuinely accorded each member an opportunity to be \nheard and most of us an opportunity to exhaust our thoughts on the \nsubject, and then you moved ahead with an agenda as you saw it. I know \nevery Member who has worked with the Senator from Louisiana respects \nhim. The Senator from Louisiana has tackled the national issues. As the \nSenator from Arkansas indicated, occasionally the Senator has been \npartisan, but the Senator has been partisan in a way that I think \nrepresented the reality that the Senator's party was in the majority. \nYet the Senator from Louisiana was always willing to listen to the \ninput from the minority.\n\n  The Senator was a fighter for the State of Louisiana. I do not think \nthat anyone can observe the career of the Senator in the last 22 years \nand suggest that the Senator has not served the State of Louisiana \nwell. The Senator has left an example for other Members to follow.\n  I came into the Senate 14 years ago. At that time, Senator ``Scoop'' \nJackson of Washington was chairman of the committee. Jack McClure \nfollowed that tenure. I think one of the extraordinary things that we \nall wonder about during our careers in the Senate is knowing when it is \ntime to go, when to have the wisdom and the honesty, because as we all \nknow, in this business an awful lot of our everyday activities are \nassociated with our own individual egos.\n  The Senator from Louisiana has chosen to go out at the very top of \nhis career. The Senator has ahead of him, obviously, some unknowns but \nsome very exciting unknowns as the Senator looks to his future and the \ncontribution that he will make to his State and America as a whole.\n  The Senator has given me the honor and the pleasure of working with \nhim, but he has also given me the wisdom and an insight that I will \nrespect and learn from. The Senator has always been very fair in \naccommodating the interest of the junior Senator from Alaska.\n  The Senator has gone up to Alaska on numerous occasions. The Senator \nhas visited the North Slope, the Senator has visited ANWR, the Senator \nhas listened to Alaskans, and the Senator has listened with a genuine \ninterest to our problems and with a commitment to try to assist as we \nattempt to develop in our State what was done throughout the United \nStates, perhaps 100 years ago. And that is a sound resource policy \nusing science and technology available today that was not available, \nperhaps, 50 or 75 years ago.\n  We will miss you, Bennett. I am looking forward to having the \npleasure of working together these next 2 years. I look forward to \nassisting in completing the agenda of the Senator, as well as exploring \nnew agendas. I look to the Senator for advice, consent, and counsel.\n  Finally, in conclusion, let me just comment on a reflection I had \nwhen the Senator and his wife, Mary, were kind enough to include us in \nthe Christmas card list. I saw, this time, grandchildren. Not just one, \nbut several. Somebody mentioned to me some years ago when we had our \nfirst grandchild that, truly, that was the ticket to eternity.\n  I do not know whether there is any reflection on this decision in the \ngrandchildren, but I, personally, would not be surprised if the Senator \nhas decided to try to spend a little more time with the grandchildren. \nObviously, when you are around your grandchildren, you generate a \nreflection on perhaps some of the qualities of life rather than the \nquantity.\n  So let me commend the Senator for the service that the Senator has \ngiven to this body, the State of Louisiana, and my State of Alaska, and \nthe friendship which I have enjoyed and that I am looking forward, as \nwe spend the next 2 years together, to working on behalf of the many \ninterests that are before our committee.\n  Again, my sincere best wishes on the Senator's new future. We look \nforward again, those Senators who are at least going to be around here \nfor the balance of our term, to observing the patterns and the \nfootsteps as the Senator from Louisiana moves out and pursues some \n[[Page S617]] of the exciting opportunities and challenges outside the \nU.S. Senate. It has been a pleasure, my friend. I wish you well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/09/senate-section/article/S616-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was sitting in my office catching up on \npaperwork when I was literally caught by the announcement that the \ndistinguished former chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee would not seek reelection.\n  I had to come over and add my voice to those that have already been \nraised in tribute to this fine man, this outstanding Senator and, for \nme, close friend.\n  As I came to the Chamber, I was reminded of his words to the former \nranking member on that committee, Malcolm Wallop, who made a similar \nannouncement. As Senator Wallop came into the committee, Senator \nJohnston looked at him and said, ``You did not ask my permission.'' I \nhad the same feeling here. He did not ask my permission. Not that he \nwould have or should have.\n  This is, obviously, a personal decision. I am sure from seeing how \nwell he makes decisions, that it is the right decision. I wanted him to \nknow, and the country to know, that I will feel a sense of personal \nloss. I am not saying goodbye as some have said, because I am looking \nforward to the next 2 years.\n  I was sorry that, in the reorganization of the committees, I missed \ngoing back on that committee by exactly one slot. If there had been one \nmore slot, I would have been there as I have been there the last 2 \nyears. And I look forward to going back there when the next 2 years are \ngone.\n  It will not be the same without Bennett Johnston. A year ago, just \nabout this time, we were in China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand \ntogether. I said to him, after one of the meetings we had had with the \nhead of state on that trip, ``Mr. Chairman, if you want to run for \nSecretary of State, I will be happy to handle your campaign.'' He is an \noutstanding diplomat, an outstanding servant of the citizens of the \nUnited States. He has 2 years left to go. We will not turn this into \nhis funeral eulogy because I know he will spend the next 2 years in the \nsame kind of service that he has rendered in the past 22.\n  I am one who believes in term limits. I think we need to open up the \nprocess to get new blood in. When people say to me ``Yes, but won't you \nlose some people that are precious to the United States?'' I always \nsay, ``Yes, we will. That is the down side of term limits.'' Then I go \non to list, privately, of course, some people that I think term limits \nwould be good for. Bennett Johnston is in the first group. That is, \nthose who would be precious to the United States who would be lost, and \nfor whom, if I could, I would waive the term-limit requirement.\n  He is a fine gentleman, a fine friend, a fine Senator. I look forward \nto 2 more years at his side and, indeed, at his feet, for he has taught \nthis junior Senator a very great deal. I look forward to learning a \nvery great deal more. Mr. President, this is a time of pride for the \nUnited States that we can look back on the career of one of our finest. \nI did not want to let the occasion pass without adding my voice to \nthose that have been raised in tribute to this fine public servant. I \nyield the floor.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Senator Johnston\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to our distinguished \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Louisiana [Bennett Johnston], on his \nannounced intention to retire from the Senate at the end of his current \nterm. His departure will be a loss to this body.\n  Senator Johnston has served here ably and well for over 20 years, \nmost notably as chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources and of the Appropriations subcommittee having jurisdiction in \nthe same area. He has mastered the intricacies of much difficult \nlegislation in this capacity, and the Nation has benefited from the \nperspective and wisdom which he brought to the task.\n  I am privileged to have had a long friendship with Bennett Johnston \nand I admire him for the manner in which he conducts himself as a \nSenator and as a person. And, particularly, as a tennis player. In the \nbest sense of the word, he can be called a straight shooter.\n  I regret, honor, and sympathize with his decision to end his \ndistinguished political career and I wish him and his lovely wife Mary \nall the best for the future after he leaves the Senate in 1997. In the \nmeantime, we are fortunate to have the benefit of his talents for at \nleast 2 more years.\n\n\n                      tribute to bennett johnston\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my good friend, \nBennett Johnston, who announced his decision yesterday to retire from \nthe Senate.\n  Senator Johnston has been a terrific friend and ally for me on a \nmyriad of issues during his service in the Senate. I have always found \nhim fair in all his dealings as chairman and ranking member on the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, where a public lands State like \nUtah is always tremendously affected by the committee's activities.\n  For example, last year, Senator Johnston's help was essential in \ngetting a bill through the Senate that will allow Utah's public school \nsystem to receive from revenues generated from Federal lands and \nroyalties. He recognized the importance of this piece of legislation to \neducation in my State and did everything he could to help it through \nthe committee. I am convinced the bill would not have been signed into \nlaw by President Clinton last year without his support, and Utah's \nschool children will be indebted to him for many years.\n  He has a keen sense on issues related to the energy security of this \nNation. It was his leadership that led to the development and passage \nof the Energy Security Act of 1992, which should allow us to meet the \nenergy demands of our growing population for many years to come. His \nexpertise in this area will be sorely missed by the Senate.\n  He also recognizes that many States are financially dependent on the \nappropriate development of their natural resources, especially when \nthese resources are located on Federal lands. Of course, Louisiana is \nas rich in these resources as my own State of Utah. And, by recognizing \nthis dependence, Senator Johnston has been willing to work with \nSenators on resource issues that are unique to that particular State, \nwhether the subject matter was precious metals, coal, petroleum, \nnatural gas, or, in the case of Utah, tar sands and oil shale. He has \nprovided tremendous leadership in showcasing and supporting our \nnational parks, forests, and recreation areas. While we have not always \nagreed on every single issue, I will miss his manner of doing business.\n  In addition, he has been successful in focusing this body on the \nimportant issue of risk assessment related to environmental \nregulations. With the total cost for all 54 Federal environmental \nregulatory agencies totaling $14.3 billion last year, it is critical \nthat Congress determine the benefit associated with the cost of each \nand every environmental regulation we pass. Senator Johnston has \nprovided leadership on this matter, and I hope that this body will \nagain pass his amendment during this session to require a risk \nassessment on new regulations.\n  Obviously, the Senator from Louisiana has been a leader in many areas \nduring his tenure in the Senate. For this, I thank and applaud him. We \nare losing a true expert on these issues, and I am losing a true friend \nin every sense of the word. I understand why he has made this decision \nto leave the Senate; and, while 2 years remain for us to collaborate on \nimportant issues, I want to express my thanks to him and wish him well \nin all his future plans. He has been a great asset to his State and to \nthe Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/09/senate-section/article/S617-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S618]]\n\n                        AMENDMENT TO BE OFFERED\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, according to the Associated Press, the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has decided to issue a license \nfor the manufacture of Rhino Ammo by the Signature Products Corp. of \nHuntsville, AL. Rhino Ammo, according to its manufacturer, is designed \nto fragment upon impact with human tissue in order to inflict maximum \ninjury, Mr. David Keen, the chief executive of Signature Corp., has \nsaid of this ammunition:\n\n       The beauty behind it is that it makes an incredible wound. \n     * * * That's not by accident. It's engineered by design. The \n     round disintegrates as it hits. There's no way to stop the \n     bleeding. * * * I don't care where it hits. They're going \n     down for good.\n\n  The application for this license should be denied. There is something \nsick about a chief executive officer of an American corporation making \nsuch a statement to sell ammunition specifically designed to cause, in \nMr. Keen's own words, ``horrific'' wounds.\n  There is a history here. The St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868 was \nthe first effort to ban certain types of ammunition which caused \nunnecessary suffering. The United States was not a party to the \ndeclaration, but we did ratify the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, \nboth of which banned the use of dum-dum bullets.\n  Dum-dum bullets were invented in the late 19th century at the British \narsenal in the town of Dum Dum, which was located 6 miles northeast of \nthe Calcutta city center at the time. The rounds expand upon impact, \nthereby causing much larger wounds than ordinary bullets.\n  The Hague Conference of 1899 met in May 1899. It was attended by 26 \nnations and produced three conventions, the second of which was the \n``Convention with respect to the Laws and Customs of War on Land.'' The \nConference also produced three declarations. Here is the text of the \nthird declaration:\n\n       III. On Expanding Bullets--The Contracting Parties agree to \n     abstain from the use of bullets which expand or flatten \n     easily in the human body, such as bullets with a hard \n     envelope which does not entirely cover the core, or is \n     pierced with incisions.\n\n  It was ``especially prohibited'' by article 23(e) of the Hague \nConvention of 1899,\n\n     To employ arms, projectiles, or material of a nature to cause \n     superfluous injury.\n\nAnd it was ``especially forbidden'' article 23(e) of the Hague \nConvention of 1907,\n\n     To employ arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause \n     unnecessary suffering.\n\n  The Treasury Department has apparently decided that Americans may arm \nthemselves and use rounds of ammunition which would be forbidden by \ntreaty--the supreme law of the land--to the U.S. Armed Forces. This \nborders on contempt of the law.\n  It borders further on contempt of Congress. On Thursday, January 5, \nin the Washington Post I reported on efforts in the statutes and other \nmeans that Congress has adopted in recent years banning rounds of \nammunition of particular threat to police officers. Any number of \npolice officials have stated that once this round is manufactured and \nsold, it will end up being used against policemen. Evidently, this does \nnot in any way trouble the Treasury Department.\n  Clearly, there has to be a complete review in the executive branch of \nthis issue. Just as clearly no license should be issued until that \nreview has been made and submitted to Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/09/senate-section/article/S618-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO BEN RICH\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, it is my sad duty to inform the Senate \nthat one of the giants of American aviation history, Mr. Ben Rich, the \nlong-time director and spirit of the famed Lockheed Skunk Works, passed \naway on January 5, 1995, in Ventura, CA. Ben Rich was the driving \ncreative force behind the most potent and successful aircraft created \nby man, including the U-2 and the SR-71 reconnaissance aircraft, the \nworkhorses of the cold war, and the F-117, or Stealth fighter, the \nbackbone of our air campaign in the Desert Storm operation.\n  Ben Rich's life was synonymous with the great achievements of post-\nWorld War II advanced military American aviation. He joined Lockheed in \n1950, and participated in the aerodynamic, propulsion, and design \naspects of the F-104, U-2, A-12, SR-71 Blackbird and numerous other \nprograms that have earned the Lockheed Skunk Works unparalleled \ninternational recognition. In 1975, he was named Lockheed vice \npresident in charge of this talented advanced development projects \norganization, and from 1975 until his retirement in 1991, he led the \nSkunk Works through an intense period, including the U-2 production \nrestart, the Stealth fighter development and production and the F-22 \nadvanced tactical fighter prototype development, among other programs. \nFollowing his retirement, he continued in aviation as a consultant for \nthe Rand Corp., Lockheed, and other defense contractors and \norganizations.\n  Anyone who was privileged even to briefly meet with Ben Rich \npersonally could not help but be affected by his infectious enthusiasm, \nboundless energy, and persistent can do attitude. It was an attitude \nwhich carried the greatest aircraft developments in the world through \ndaunting engineering challenges at the very edge of the envelope of \nengineering design and system development.\n  Unquestionably, his most notable recent achievement during his years \nas the Chief Skunk was the creation of the Stealth F-117 fighter \nprogram. He organized a research and development program to respond to \nthe Nation's need for new fighter aircraft featuring low observable \ntechnologies. These included a revolutionary faceted external design, \nnew inlet and exhaust nozzle concepts, advanced radar absorbing \nmaterials and structures, and unique antennas and apertures. Even with \nthis range of new technologies, they were all put together in a winning \nsystem to achieve initial operational capability in just 5 years.\n\n  Furthermore, his team was able to keep the existence of the aircraft \ntotally secret, in the black, until its existence was formally \nacknowledged by the Air Force, from 1970 until 1988.\n  The great value of the Stealth fighter was amply demonstrated during \nDesert Storm when a small force of some 42 aircraft had a major impact \non the war. The F-117, according to unofficial sources, destroyed 40 \npercent of all strategic targets with only 2 percent of the total of \nall Allied Forces tactical aircraft. It was the only aircraft to attack \nheavily defended Baghdad, unescorted, delivering laser-guided weapons \nwith unprecedented accuracy, with minimum collateral damage and \ncivilian casualties.\n  Ben Rich's many achievements have been recognized repeatedly in the \naerospace industry. In May 1994, Secretary of Defense William J. Perry \npresented him with the Distinguished Public Service Award. Among his \nother awards, he and his team were awarded the 1989 Collier Trophy by \nthe National Aeronautic Association for the Stealth fighter. This award \nis given annually for the most outstanding achievement in aeronautics \nand or astronautics.\n  With Ben's passing, we as a nation are poorer for out loss, but I am \ncertain his spirit and achievements will continue to inspire a new \ngeneration of aerospace designers and engineers to new heights in one \nof America's premier industries.\n  On behalf of myself and, I know, all my colleagues, I wish to convey \nour sincere condolences to his wife, Hilda, his son, Michael, and \ndaughter, Karen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/09/senate-section/article/S618-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S618-S619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

The \nAmerican people took note of that on November 8.\n  As of Friday, January 8, at the close of business, the Federal debt \nstood--down to the penny--at exactly $4,802,133,808,513.71. This debt, \nremember, was run up by the Congress of the United States.\n  The Founding Fathers decreed that the big-spending bureaucrats in the \nexecutive branch of the U.S. Government should never be able to spend \neven a dime unless and until the spending had been authorized and \nappropriated by the U.S. Congress.\n  The U.S. Constitution is quite specific about that, as every school \nboy is supposed to know.\n  And do not be misled by declarations by politicians that the Federal \ndebt was run up by some previous President or another, depending on \nparty affiliation. Sometimes you hear false claims that Ronald Reagan \nran it up; sometimes they play hit-and-run with George Bush.\n  These buck-passing declarations are false, as I said earlier, because \nthe Congress of the United States is the culprit. The Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives are the big spenders.\n  Mr. President, most citizens cannot conceive of a billion of \nanything, let alone a trillion. It may provide a bit of perspective to \nbear in mind that a billion seconds ago, Mr. President, the Cuban \nmissile crisis was in progress. A billion minutes ago, the crucifixion \nof Jesus Christ had occurred not long before.\n  Which sort of puts it in perspective, does it not, that Congress has \nrun up this incredible Federal debt totaling 4,802 of those billions--\nof dollars. In other words, the Federal debt, as I said earlier, stood \nthis morning at four trillion, 802 billion, 133 million, 808 thousand, \n513 dollars, and 71 cents. It'll be even greater at closing time today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/09/senate-section/article/S618-4", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S619-S621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ANNUAL MEETING OF THE AMERICAN FARM BUREAU FEDERATION\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, this morning I had the privilege of \nattending the 76th annual meeting of the American Farm Bureau \nFederation in St. Louis, MO.\n  As my colleagues know, the American Farm Bureau is the largest farm \norganization in America, with over 4.4 million members nationwide. \nWhile in St. Louis, I met with both Kansas and American Farm Bureau \nmembers as they discussed issues of importance to agriculture and to \nall Americans.\n  The theme of this year's meeting is ``The Spirit Grows.'' I believe \nthat their theme reflects the spirit we have seen in American during \nthe last few months. A growing spirit to change America and to bring \ncommon sense back to Government. Like most Americans, members of the \nAmerican Farm Bureau want change.\n  In his opening remarks, Farm Bureau President Dean Kleckner listed \nseven Farm Bureau goals--goals which many of us here in the Senate \nshare. These include adopting a balanced budget amendment, passing a \nline-item veto, reducing the capital gains tax, increasing the estate \ntax exemption, implementing legislation requiring risk assessment and \ncost-benefit analysis, limiting unfunded mandates, and strengthening \nprivate property rights.\n  Mr. President, I would encourage my colleagues to read the full text \nof Mr. Kleckner's speech and to take to heart some of the points he \nmakes. I ask unanimous consent that the text of Mr. Kleckner's speech \nbe included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n              Annual Address, AFBF President Dean Kleckner\n\n       Good morning fellow Farm Bureau members. Welcome to this \n     76th gathering of the world's largest, greatest, most \n     powerful, most influential farm organization.\n       Your American Farm Bureau Federation. Once again, your \n     actions, your deeds, your policies benefitted agriculture, \n     America's most important industry.\n       Through Farm Bureau, 4.4 million families speak with a \n     unified voice. United in Farm Bureau, we implement the \n     policies and get the results that we could not accomplish \n     individually.\n       As a direct result of your work--our work--U.S. agriculture \n     today is more oriented toward the marketplace. World trade is \n     less subsidized. The sanctity of property rights is more \n     recognized and appreciated. And there is a growing belief \n     that government must lessen its impact on people and their \n     livelihoods.\n       We are completing a philosophical cycle.\n       Our nation was founded on a belief in the integrity and \n     common sense of the individual. Yet, over the years, this \n     rock-solid philosophy eroded, evolving to the thought of: \n     ``Let government do it.'' Then to: ``Government, do it.'' The \n     cycle moved a few years ago to: ``Should government do it?''\n       Now, people of all walks of life, all segments of society \n     are answering: ``Government should not do it. It is my \n     responsibility.''\n       President Andrew Jackson once said, ``When a democracy is \n     in trouble, the remedy is more democracy.''\n       Our democracy may not have been in trouble, but the way \n     voters voiced their demand for positive change by reducing \n     government's presence was encouraging.\n       Farm Bureau has long championed the worth of the \n     individual. We've stood firm on our philosophies, our \n     policies. We've altered our policies when we recognize that \n     change is needed, * * * But our philosophies? Never.\n       The basics, the fundamentals, the traditional values that \n     are still rock-solid across the country, Farm Bureau has not \n     wavered. I know sometimes it felt like we were talking to \n     ourselves. The lack of external response sometimes led us to \n     question ourselves, but we never questioned our values. Now \n     it can be seen that others were listening.\n       Others harbored the same quiet, solid beliefs--beliefs that \n     never left rural America.\n       For decades, Farm Bureau was one of a very few \n     organizations that stood up and spoke out for the ideals we \n     believe in, no matter where our position rated in the latest \n     public opinion poll.\n       Great political change occurred last November. But we saw \n     the bell cow in 1992 when the public clamored for change. At \n     this point, it looks like no more country-club or good-old-\n     boy politics as usual. Public dissatisfaction--really \n     disgust--with the political system and the politicians won't \n     allow it.\n       People want a return to basic American principles--\n     individual responsibility, common sense, fairness, faith, \n     firmness not forms, a hand up * * * Not a hand out.\n       Where's the sense in spending billions of Superfund dollars \n     to pay lawyers to talk about cleaning up dirt at a \n     contaminated site? Why spend billions on a welfare system \n     that does not foster an incentive to get off the public dole?\n       People have told government that a reordering of priorities \n     and spending habits is definitely in order. And that is an \n     order--an order that will be enforced, come next election, if \n     changes--acceptable changes--don't come quickly.\n       More regulations, more taxation, more restrictions aren't \n     the answer. We don't need consensus, we need conquerors. When \n     will the deep thinkers, but shallow doers, learn? Free \n     enterprise, coupled with religious compassion, works. \n     Government making rules doesn't make change.\n       Princeton University economists did a study that showed \n     environmental quality quickly starts to improve when \n     individuals' income and investment returns top $10,000 a \n     year.\n       That's the exact opposite conclusion of some think-tank \n     talkers who believe economic growth does unavoidable harm to \n     the environment.\n       In reality, Mexico, Chile, Venezuela and many Pacific Rim \n     countries have surpassed that threshold number and are moving \n     to improve their environments. To see environmental \n     degradation, look to those that were centrally planned--\n     Russia, Poland, the Balkan states. Yet, some scholars still \n     think that progress is a dirty word. Progress is good if we \n     make it good.\n       Farm Bureau policies depend on the collective wisdom, \n     experience and values of working people throughout this land.\n       1994 was quite a year for Farm Bureau. It was a year of \n     accomplishments and yet-to-be-finished accomplishments. I \n     want to tell you of a few, to illustrate the great breadth of \n     your farm organization's interests and activities.\n       All of the efforts, all of the work, all of the strategies \n     are aimed at our two over-riding goals. They are the same two \n     that Farm Bureau has aimed for since we started over 75 years \n     ago. We're working to improve net farm income. And we strive \n     to improve the quality of rural living.\n       1994 saw the successful completion to two important trade \n     negotiations. Farm Bureau was intensely involved with both. \n     Our Congress passage of the General Agreement on Tariffs and \n     Trade is a major relief for U.S. agriculture. I was never \n     more proud, more aware of Farm Bureau's influence, than I was \n     last month as I was led down to sit in the front of that big \n     room in Washington, D.C., to watch President Clinton sign the \n     GATT legislation into law.\n       By signing on to GATT, other countries will have to follow \n     the same trade rules we [[Page S620]] do, opening their \n     markets to our commodities. They must begin to reduce tariffs \n     and subsidies. And they must have a sound, scientific reason \n     to restrict imports for health or sanitation reasons.\n       Ever since the talks began in Uruguay in 1986, Farm Bureau \n     monitored the negotiations, often speaking directly to \n     foreign negotiators, political leaders and farmers.\n       Farm Bureau has long recognized that one way to improve our \n     income was to increase the markets for our products. \n     America's farmers and ranchers are just too good at what we \n     do. There aren't enough people here in the U.S. to buy all \n     that we can produce. 95 percent of the world's stomachs are \n     outside our borders. New technologies and new products come \n     on stream daily. Clearly, we have to have access to world \n     markets.\n       Now, with GATT, that access has improved. Not as much as we \n     would have liked, but enough to offer promise of future \n     improvement. The new international trade regulations are \n     clearly a vote of confidence for the American farmer.\n       1994 saw the signing of the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement which provides freer trade faster than GATT. \n     Initial trade reports bear out the estimates made by \n     supporters that sales would increase and that export-related \n     employment would increase. There is a great sound in the \n     land, but it's not the predicted great sucking sound of lost \n     jobs. It's more of a chomping sound as fanatics are forced to \n     eat their words.\n       Now, there is talk of expanding NAFTA to include more South \n     American countries, with some people envisioning a Western \n     Hemisphere trade bloc eventually * * * From the Arctic to the \n     Antarctic. Farm Bureau supports continued elimination of \n     trade barriers. We will observe future negotiations as \n     closely as we did the previous ones. They will certainly \n     offer new and different challenges.\n    \n    \n       We will also continue to promote international \n     understanding and goodwill among farmers the world over. \n     Thirteen state Farm Bureau presidents and I visited China in \n     1994. What a market * * * One-and-a-quarter billion people, \n     not all as poor as church mice.\n       They have a middle class of 100 million consumers with \n     money to spend. China is already a major customer of ours, \n     purchasing an average 500 million dollars a year of wheat and \n     200 million dollars a year of cotton.\n       The U.S. Ambassador to China stressed to us that China's \n     economic progress must be encouraged. They are the only \n     country that has successfully managed a substantial \n     transformation of its economy from centrally planned to one \n     largely responsive to market forces. And they're doing it \n     under conditions of growing prosperity and rapid economic \n     growth. I believe that these economic changes will hasten \n     political and civic changes, as well. It is an exciting era \n     for trade expansion and Farm Bureau is well situated to \n     continue to work for your interests.\n       Another major area demanding our time and talents in 1994 \n     was the defense of property rights. Significant gains were \n     made. Much more needs to be done. Throughout our years of \n     struggle, we have pointed out that farmers and ranchers are \n     environmentalists. We have continued to advance our \n     conservation and stewardship practices.\n       Last year, more than 100 million acres--over one-third of \n     all U.S. cropland, was farmed using residue management or \n     conservation tillage practices. Why? It's environmentally \n     sound. It's economically sensible. Residue decreases soil \n     erosion and water runoff.\n       Despite the profusion of unplowed lands, we are using less \n     herbicides. We practice integrated pest management, using \n     natural methods to supplement chemical pesticides. We plant \n     winter crops to replenish the soil naturally and we leave \n     legume or grass strips in the fields and along fence lines to \n     shelter wildlife. We do this even though we end up providing \n     room and board for the animals we attract as they eat our \n     crops. We do this voluntarily, without government threats or \n     public thanks.\n       Our conservation compliance plans are complete. It is \n     evident, very evident, that the environment has nothing to \n     fear from farmers. We do care for the land because it cares \n     for us. We don't care for environmental elitists--their \n     rhetoric aimed at fund-raising and membership growth more \n     than reason and rational progress. Let them rant, we'll \n     plant. Let them accuse, we'll conserve and use--responsibly \n     use--our God-given resources to benefit people. We'll \n     continue to stand for conservation and challenge \n     preservation.\n       And it appears the weather vane of public opinion is \n     changing. Elitists fear that public support for three issues \n     will gut their movement. One is the weighing of costs of risk \n     prevention against the benefits, in any federal regulations. \n     Another is a severe restriction on unfunded mandates imposed \n     at the federal level on state and country governments, with \n     these costs being passed on to us. And the third fear is \n     compensation to landowners when their property values are \n     lessened.\n       Elitists call these three issues the ``Unholy Trinity.'' I \n     call the three common sense for the common good. These issues \n     go to the heart of many of the specific actions we took last \n     year in the environmental area.\n       We worked for a law that strengthens trespass restraints \n     against government agents involved with biological surveys. \n     We also supported President Clinton's creation of an office \n     of risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis and an \n     independent national appeals division.\n       Farm Bureau and its leaders were instrumental in defeating \n     attempts to hike grazing fees to unrealistic, unprofitable \n     levels. We stalled consideration of a global biodiversity \n     treaty until our specific concerns and complaints were \n     addressed. We defeated an energy tax last year that would \n     have cost farmers an average of 2,500 dollars each. We didn't \n     want to be BTU'd.\n       We worked for sensible clean water rules, a common-sense \n     wetlands definition. We sued to keep ethanol an important \n     component of the EPA's clean air pollution reduction program. \n     Despite significant progress in Congress and in public \n     opinion, it was still necessary to go to court to protect \n     farmers' and ranchers' interests.\n       One of our most recent and on-going lawsuits involves the \n     federal government's scheme to put wolves into the \n     Yellowstone Park area. The surrounding area is immense--half \n     the state of Montana, 95 percent of Idaho and all of Wyoming \n     would be considered wolf range. Federal efforts to protect \n     the wolf under the Endangered Species Act would amount to a \n     giant federal land-use plan for most of the residents of the \n     three states.\n       First off, the wolf the government wants to put in the area \n     isn't even endangered. There are thousands in Alaska and \n     Minnesota and 70,000 of them in Canada. Second, the wolf they \n     want to introduce is the Canadian gray wolf, not the Northern \n     Rocky Mountain wolf that once roamed the area. Third, we \n     object to the plan because the government didn't follow its \n     own rules.\n       Fish and Wildlife ignored them. While they were supposed to \n     be talking with area residents about the general idea, \n     federal agents were instead building holding pens in the park \n     to house the wolves.\n       Throughout the sham, government workers used questionable \n     biological science to implement their own political \n     decisions.\n       There are provisions allowing ranchers to protect \n     livestock. As a New York Times article concluded a few days \n     ago, ``Ranchers will still be able to kill or harass wolves \n     if they threaten livestock.'' That makes everybody feel \n     really good, doesn't it?\n       But the official rules are composed in typical \n     governmentese--Beltway babble--by people who don't have the \n     slightest idea of real-world living. You could kill a wolf, \n     but you've got to do it by the book.\n       First, you must catch the wolf in the act of killing, \n     wounding or biting livestock. Killing one that you see \n     working over a carcass isn't good enough because you couldn't \n     prove that that wolf killed your animal. So you've got to see \n     the wolf in action, killing.\n       There's a second restriction. If you kill a wolf, a fresh \n     domesticated animal carcass must be on hand for the \n     government to inspect. If it takes more than a day for you to \n     ride in, report the taking, get the agent to your place and \n     ride out to the attack site, forget it, you're in trouble.\n       Now those rules apply only if you kill a wolf on your own \n     land. For those grazing federal land, it's even more \n     contrived, more ridiculous.\n       Just like so many of our wetlands examples, so many of our \n     endangered species examples, the stories are absurd. They're \n     funny--until they happen to you or your neighbors or your \n     fellow Farm Bureau members. Farm Bureau is working for you, \n     right now, to put an end to such tales.\n       We've been involved in many more issues and activities. We \n     developed a book to review farm program legislation options. \n     We worked to strengthen the crop insurance program.\n       Whether it was in Congress or the courts, Farm Bureau was \n     there representing agriculture's interests. But that is all \n     old news.\n       What is Farm Bureau going to do next? What are you doing \n     now? Ladies and gentlemen, Farm Bureau is poised for our \n     greatest accomplishments ever. Farmers and ranchers have \n     never had the opportunities we have now.\n       With the convening of the 104th Congress, Farm Bureau is \n     ready to push for the acceptance of many of our most basic, \n     our most fundamental principles. The first 100 days of this \n     new Congress are extremely crucial. We must be prepared to \n     act. We must work to create acceptance of our efforts by the \n     politicians and opinion-makers. Farm Bureau members must push \n     for the legislative implementation of our policies.\n       One item we've sought for a long time is a balanced budget \n     amendment. We've had some successes. Many now in Congress \n     said they would push for it. Let's push them.\n       Another crucial goal is granting the president a line-item \n     veto. The Republicans supported it when they were in the \n     minority and there were Republican presidents. Now that \n     they're in control of Congress, Farm Bureau must work to make \n     sure they are still so eager for it.\n       A third major goal would be a reduced capital gains tax, \n     better yet a total elimination, the same as citizens of many \n     developed countries enjoy. Do you know what Germans are taxed \n     on capital gains? Zero. What about people in Hong Kong? Zero. \n     Italians? Zero. South Koreans? Zero. Taiwanese? Zero.\n       Some countries do have a capital gains tax. Japan? Five \n     percent. France? 16 percent. Even our social service-happy \n     neighbors to the north only pay a maximum 17-and-a-half \n     percent capital gains tax. [[Page S621]] \n       We'll work with Congress to cut the tax, cut it big-time. \n     I'm convinced a significant cut will result in more tax \n     revenues to the government through the increased sales of \n     appreciated assets. 10 or 15 percent of something is a lot \n     more than 28 percent of nothing.\n       Another of our opportunities is an increased estate tax \n     exemption. The 600,000 dollar exemption currently in the law \n     hasn't been changed for a decade. We must work to obtain an \n     exemption that will allow farm operations to pass from \n     generation to generation with minimal disruption and \n     dislocation.\n       A fifth area of opportunity would be obtaining legislation \n     requiring risk assessment and cost/benefit analysis. A sixth \n     is legislation limiting the creation of unfunded mandates.\n       And a seventh is granting compensation for victims of \n     takings. That's the key in our private property battle. Make \n     government pay for what they take and they'll take less or, \n     better yet, they'll stop taking. Or, if they take, we get \n     fair market value.\n       That's seven goals for us to shoot for, by Easter. And \n     we'll work to get a 100 percent income tax deduction for \n     health insurance premiums paid by the self-employed and \n     adequate funding for new farm programs.\n       That will be enough on our plate for now, for these 100 \n     days. Challenge and change. Opportunity and good fortune. The \n     future is exciting. We are creating our own breaks. Better \n     prosperity beckons. But there's more, much more.\n       Innovations overtake us with dizzying speed. And we accept \n     and adapt them to our advantage. About the only thing old-\n     fashioned about farmers today is our adherence to our \n     traditional values.\n       I recently came across a paragraph from the Durants' 11-\n     volume ``Story of Civilization.'' I'll quote the paragraph, \n     not the 11 volumes. ``Civilization is a stream with banks. \n     The stream is sometimes filled with blood from people \n     killing, stealing, shouting and doing things historians \n     usually record * * * While on the banks, unnoticed, people \n     build homes, make love, raise children, sing songs, write \n     poetry and even whittle statues. The story of civilization is \n     the story of what happened on the banks. Historians are \n     pessimists because they ignore the banks for the river.''\n       Sometimes, we get awfully close to being like those \n     historians. Still, even though agriculture is so enmeshed in \n     executive orders, legislation, regulations and court rulings, \n     we know there's a lot more to life than making a living.\n       It's seeing seedlings push through the crust * * * to \n     unfold in a burst * * * Green rows stretching to the horizon. \n     It's seeing a cow nuzzle and nudge her calf, to stand on its \n     own. It's going to Saturday night church service so on Sunday \n     morning we can see dawn break and contemplate God from our \n     deer stand. It's hurrying to finish chores so we can go to \n     another Farm Bureau meeting. It's seeing the kids beam with \n     pride as they see their hog take a fourth-place ribbon, even \n     if there was only a class of four.\n       There's more to life than making a living.\n       Winston Churchill said we make a living by what we get, but \n     we make a life by what we give. We know life and we call it \n     farming. And it's what Farm Bureau is all about. We work to \n     preserve the ideals we cherish, the life that others only \n     dream about.\n       You and I, working together, can keep this nation the \n     country we want, the country we fought for, the country we \n     will always fight for. Our future is bright because of our \n     faith, our families and Farm Bureau.\n       As the country prepares for the 21st century, let us keep \n     our principles in place for the 22nd. We face a different \n     world, and you, working through Farm Bureau, can make a \n     difference.\n       Thank you for the wonderful opportunity, the gift, of \n     serving you. God bless you. God bless America.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 2, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2) to make certain laws applicable to the \n     legislative branch of the Federal Government.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Ford/Feingold amendment No. 4, to prohibit the personal use \n     of accrued frequent flyer miles by Members and employees of \n     the Congress.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Now pending before the Senate is amendment No. \n4.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, we had this legislation on the floor last \nweek, of course, and continue it today. We will continue it tomorrow. \nThe time is limited on this.\n  I wanted to rise and let all the people watching in the offices, all \nthe different staffs, as well as the individual Senators, know that it \nis my understanding--and I ask my distinguished colleague from Iowa to \ncomment on this, too--it is my understanding that the majority leader \nhas indicated that he wished to end this bill, if at all possible, by 7 \no'clock tomorrow evening, Tuesday evening.\n  Now, I presume that is correct. I know we will try to end by a \ncertain time. I was just told a few moments ago that the time expressed \nis 7 tomorrow evening.\n  That being the case, there are no amendments on the Republican side. \nThey are all on the Democratic. If we are to meet that deadline, it \nmeans that people had better get their amendments together and get them \nover here. We have no time agreements at this point, so anyone can take \nup as much time as they want on the floor.\n  But we do have a number of amendments still pending, and if people \nexpect to make certain of not getting frozen out with their proposals, \nthen they better get over here this afternoon. We will have some \ntomorrow morning. But people should be cognizant of the fact that \ntomorrow is conference day also where we will be out of session \ntemporarily, or in recess, from about 12:30 to 2:15, so we lose a block \nof time in the middle of the day.\n  As I see it right now, with the number of amendments still left, \nthere is not going to be time for getting them all in right now even if \npeople started coming to the floor now. I hope people are not going to \nwait until late tomorrow afternoon and then bump up against the 7 \no'clock deadline and then want the floor managers, Senator Grassley and \nmyself, to try to make some special arrangement for them, because that \nis not likely to be possible. I encourage people who have amendments to \nget them together, get them over here and consider them this afternoon \nwhile we have time. We have quite a bit of time. It is 20 minutes to 4. \nWe can consider several amendments. We have nothing pending at the \nmoment. I urge my Democratic colleagues to get them together and get \nover here. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, let us take a look at the amendments \nthat might be brought up. I hope they will not all be brought up:\n  One by Senator Bryan dealing with pensions. One by Senator Byrd that \nis described as a relevant amendment. We have four by Senator Feinstein \ndealing with campaign finance reform. We have one by Senator Ford that \nis an amendment pending dealing with frequent flier miles. Also, \nanother one described as a relevant amendment. We have a manager's \namendment by our friend Senator Glenn. Senator Graham, of Florida, has \nan amendment that is in the process of being drafted of which we have \nno description. Senator Kerry has an amendment dealing with leadership \nPAC's and campaign fund conversion for personal use. Senator Lautenberg \nhas an amendment that is described as a relevant amendment. Senator \nLeahy dealing with employment rights. Senator Levin, another one \ndescribed as relevant. Senator Reid, described as relevant. And Senator \nWellstone has several, two that deal with gift ban, three that deal \nwith campaign finance reform, one with health care, and two described \nas relevant.\n  I think that anybody in this body or anybody listening throughout the \ncountry would probably realize that each of these amendments, at least \nthose that we have a description of, are legitimate subjects for \ndiscussion within this body. Most of them--not all of them--but most of \nthem have already been alluded to by the Senate majority leader by his \nsaying that before just a few short months are up, all of these issues \nwill be discussed. The issue of gifts and the issue of lobbying reform \nhave all been described by Senator Dole, the majority leader, as issues \nthat he intends to give any Member of this body an opportunity to go as \nindepth as they want to on any of these issues.\n  So there is not any issue on this set of pending amendments that will \nnot have an opportunity to be discussed; in [[Page S622]] other words, \nit will have an opportunity to be discussed the first half of this \nyear, for sure.\n  So I urge my colleagues who are very sincere about what they are \ntrying to accomplish through these amendments to maybe not offer these \namendments on the bill that is before us.\n  Then that brings me to further discussion of the bill that is before \nus, because this is a bill that the people of this country have been \ndemanding that we pass for quite a few years now, to correct a \nsituation where in this country there are two sets of laws: One for \nCapitol Hill and one for the rest of the country; one for Pennsylvania \nAvenue, DC, and the other for Main Street, USA; where there is one set \nof laws for the Congress as an employer, or we individual Senators and \nCongressmen and women as employers because we hire staff, and another \nset of laws for every other employer in America. There is one set of \nprotections for people in the private sector whose employees are \nprotected by the employment, safety and civil rights laws, but no \nprotection, or very little protection, for employees on Capitol Hill.\n  We have a situation of one set of laws applying to one part of the \ncountry and those laws not applying to Capitol Hill. Under the laws \nthat apply outside Capitol Hill, employers of America can be \nintimidated and harassed and fined and maybe even put out of business \nby regulators and inspectors and various employees of Federal \nenforcement agencies coming around to their place of business to \nenforce those laws; whereas we, as an institution of Congress and an \nemployer and we as individual Senators--and we happen to be employers \nof staff--we do not have to worry about that sort of intimidation and \nharassment and fined by regulators coming around and inspecting our \noffices and looking into our employment practices because we are not \ncovered by those laws.\n  We have a situation where the private-sector employers understand \nthat intimidation and they understand the egregiousness and the cost of \nlegislation on their operation. We on Capitol Hill, because we have \nexempted ourselves from this series of legislation since the 1930's, do \nnot know about that cost, do not know about the paying a fine, do not \nknow about the intimidation that the private sector feels.\n  So for a long period of time--and I have been involved in sponsoring \nthis legislation for 7 or 8 years--but for a long period of time, \npeople in the private sector, understanding the unfairness of the \nsituation, the American people have asked Congress to end that \nsituation of dual statutes. They have asked Congress to end the unfair \nsituation where we have exempted ourselves from this legislation.\n  The legislation that passed the House of Representatives did that. It \npassed unanimously in the other body. Senator Dole made a commitment a \nlong time ago, after the Republicans had become the majority again as a \nresult of the last election, that this bill would be No. 1 up on the \nfloor of this body.\n  So we have the Congressional Accountability Act, a bipartisan bill \nsponsored by myself and by Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, to carry \non from where the House left off, to end this situation. We discussed \nthis bill all day Thursday, all day Friday and today is the third day. \nWe are going to be on it, as Senator Dole said, until about 7 o'clock \ntomorrow night when we hope to pass it. Four days to pass legislation \nthat unanimously has passed the House of Representatives and which \neveryone agrees is a situation that should be rectified.\n\n  But we have not spent much time in debate on the floor of this body \ndiscussing the merits of the legislation. We have had speeches by the \nDemocratic manager, Senator Glenn, myself, Senator Lieberman, the main \ncosponsor, Members on both sides of the aisle gave some opening \nstatements about why they support the legislation but no amendments to \nchange the basic legislation.\n  We had 6 or 7 amendments last week, all of them tabled, unrelated \namendments to the Congressional Accountability Act that we had to deal \nwith because under the rules of the Senate those amendments can be \noffered even if they do not concern the subject matter of the basic \nunderlying legislation.\n  Again, I would say, as I said about the amendments that are pending, \nthat might be offered yet today and tomorrow, there was not a single \nissue that has been offered by my colleagues that is not a legitimate \nsubject for discussion on the floor of this body. But again, whether \nthose amendments were Thursday or Friday or today and tomorrow, they \nall fit into the category of issues that Senator Dole is going to give \neverybody an opportunity to participate in the debate and bills where \nthose amendments are more germane to the subject.\n  So I think, since there is not opposition to the underlying \nlegislation, we ought to be able to just get this behind us and move on \nand respond to what the people said in the election on November 8; that \nthey no longer wanted business as usual in Washington, DC. And there is \nno better example of business as usual than for Congress to continue \nits exemption from employment and safety and civil rights laws that \napply to the rest of the Nation but have not applied to us.\n  The House has demonstrated, for sure, it is not business as usual \nbecause they passed the bill with just a few minutes of discussion and \nunanimously. I wish we could do as well in the Senate. It looks as if \nthe legislation will pass and we will end this dual system of \nlawmaking, and end our exemptions, but it is just taking a little bit \nlonger than it should.\n  It is also important that we move on to other important pieces of \nlegislation that are in the contract that we have with America: \nUnfunded mandates, the next bill that will be coming up on the floor of \nthis body, so that we do not make policy here in Washington and then \nmake Governors and legislators and mayors and councils raise their \nlocal taxes to pay for a policy we will not pay for here in Washington. \nThen we move on to a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced \nbudget, and then move on to a line-item veto, welfare reform, then \nmoving term limits for Members of Congress, tort reform, and two or \nthree other things such as tax relief and crime that we have a contract \nwith America to pass within the first few months.\n  Then we have still the part of the year, the spring, the summer and \nthe fall, when most of the work around here gets done in the late night \nhours. Maybe we will not have to work so late at night so long as we \nare working early in the year.\n  So I appreciate that scheduling and that better management of the \ncalendar. But there will be plenty of opportunities to deal with all \nthese very important amendments that my colleagues want to offer to \nthis bill even though they are not relevant to the bill. I hope we will \nsee some of these amendments not actually offered, and I hope that we \ncan get agreement to time limits on these amendments when they will be \noffered.\n  I wish, as my good friend, Senator Glenn, has already stated, \nSenators would come over here and offer these amendments.\n  I am going to yield the floor, but before I do, Mr. President, I \nwould like to have a section-by-section analysis of the legislation \nthat Senator Lieberman and I have introduced submitted and printed in \nthe Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n                         Section 1--Short Title\n\n       This act may be cited as the ``Congressional Accountability \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n                            Title I--General\n\n                        Section 101--Definitions\n\n       This section defines terms used throughout this act, as \n     follows:\n       (1) The term ``Board'' means the Board of Directors of the \n     Office of Compliance, which has authority under this act to \n     promulgate regulations for the implementation of the laws \n     made applicable by this act and to review decisions of \n     hearing officers in cases brought under the dispute \n     resolution process created by this act.\n       (2) The term ``Chair'' means the Chair of the Board of \n     Directors of the Office of Compliance.\n       (3) The term ``covered employee'' means any employee of the \n     House of Representatives, the Senate, the Office of the \n     Architect of the Capitol, the Congressional Budget Office, \n     the Office of Technology Assessment, the Office of \n     Compliance, the Capitol Police, the Capitol Guide Service, or \n     the Office of the Attending Physician. It does not include \n     employees of the General Accounting Office, Library of \n     Congress, or Government Printing Office. [[Page S623]] \n       (4) The term ``employee'' includes an applicant for \n     employment and a former employee.\n       (5) The term ``employee of the Office of the Architect of \n     the Capitol'' means employees of the Office of the Architect, \n     the Botanic Garden, or the Senate restaurants.\n       (6) The term ``employee of the Capitol Police'' includes \n     any member or officer of the Capitol Police.\n       (7) The term ``employee of the House of Representatives'' \n     means an individual occupying a position the pay for which is \n     disbursed by the Clerk of the House of Representatives, or \n     other official designated by the House of Representatives, or \n     any employment position in an entity that is paid through \n     funds derived from the Clerk-hire allowance of the House of \n     Representatives, but not any such individual employed by the \n     Capitol Police Board, the Capitol Guide Board, the Office of \n     the Attending Physician, the Congressional Budget Office, \n     Office of Technology Assessment, or the Office of the \n     Architect of the Capitol.\n       (8) The term ``employee of the Senate'' means, any \n     individual whose pay is disbursed by the Secretary of the \n     Senate, excluding such individuals employed by the Capitol \n     Police Board, the Capitol Guide Board, the Office of the \n     Attending Physician, Office of Technology Assessment, Office \n     of Compliance, or the Office is of the Architect of the \n     Capitol.\n       (9) The term ``employing office'' means a personal office \n     of the Member of the House of Representatives or the Senate, \n     or joint office, or any office under the authority of an \n     individual who has final authority to appoint, hire, \n     discharge, or set the terms of employment of an employee, as \n     well as contractors and consultants. The office of compliance \n     created by this act will issue rules concerning the \n     ``employing office'' of minority staff of committees.\n       (10) The term ``Executive Director'' means the Executive \n     Director of the Office of Compliance.\n       (11) The term ``general counsel'' means the general counsel \n     of the Office of Congressional Fair Employment Practices.\n       (12) The term ``Office'' means the office of compliance.\n\n                    Section 102--Application of Laws\n\n       Section 102(a) enumerates the statutes, as prescribed by \n     this act, that are made applicable to the legislative branch. \n     These are (1) the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938; (2) Title \n     VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; (3) the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act of 1990; (4) Age Discrimination in \n     Employment Act of 1967; (5) Family and Medical Leave Act of \n     1993; (6) Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970; (7) \n     Federal Service Labor Management Relations Act; (8) Employee \n     Polygraph Protection Act of 1988; (9) Worker Adjustment and \n     Retraining Notification Act; (10) Rehabilitation Act of 1973; \n     (11) Veterans Reemployment Act.\n       Section 102(b) requires the Board of review statutes and \n     regulations relating to the terms and conditions of \n     employment and access to public services and accommodations. \n     Beginning on December 31, 1996, and every 2 years thereafter, \n     the Board is to report on whether these provisions apply to \n     the legislative branch, and to what degree, and whether \n     provisions inapplicable or less than fully applicable should \n     be changed to govern Congress. Thus, the Board will review \n     laws already in existence at the time of enactment that are \n     not addressed or fully addressed by this act, and will, in \n     the future consider as well legislation enacted after the \n     enactment of this act. Each report will be printed in the \n     Congressional Record and referred to the House of \n     Representatives and Senate committees of appropriate \n     jurisdiction.\n       Section 102(b) requires each committee report accompanying \n     a bill or joint resolution relating to terms and conditions \n     of employment or access to public services or accommodations \n     to describe the manner in which the bill applies to Congress. \n     In the event the provision is not applicable to Congress, the \n     report will contain a statement of reasons for its \n     inapplicability. If such requirement is not followed, it \n     shall not be in order for either House to consider the bill. \n     On a majority vote of that House, this point of order can be \n     waived.\n\n             Title II--Extension of Rights and Protections\n\n   Section 201--Rights and Protections Under Laws Against Employment \n                               Procedures\n\n       Civil Rights. Section 201(a) sets forth the basic rights to \n     freedom from employment discrimination on the basis of race, \n     color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicap, or \n     disability, that are extended to all employees covered under \n     this act. By defining the rights guaranteed under this act by \n     reference to existing statutes, the Act incorporates the \n     interpretations of those rights as developed in case law.\n       Applicable remedies. In addition to setting forth the \n     rights to freedom from employment discrimination, this \n     section (in subsection (b)) sets forth the remedies available \n     to employees who prove a violation of those rights in \n     proceedings before hearing officer, or in Federal district \n     court. With respect to claims of discrimination on the basis \n     of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, the \n     remedies are those that would be available to private \n     employees under sections 706(g) and 706(k) of title VII (42 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-5(G), 2000e-5(k)), including reinstatement, \n     back pay, and attorney's fees. For these claims, the Act \n     incorporates the waiver of sovereign immunity from interest \n     for delay in payment that applies to the executive branch \n     under section 717(d) of title VII (42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000E-\n     16(d)), as provided in section 225(b). Employees are also \n     entitled to compensatory damages available under section 1977 \n     and sections 1977(A)(a) and (b)(2) of the revised statutes \n     (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981, 1981A(a), (b)(2)). Damages under title \n     VII may not exceed, for each employee, and without regard to \n     the size of the employing office, $300,000, the same maximum \n     figure that applies to large private employers.\n       With respect to age discrimination claims, employees are \n     entitled to the same remedies as are available under section \n     15(c) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 633a(C)) available to Federal employees who prove age \n     discrimination. The waiver provisions of section 7(f) of that \n     Act also apply to covered employees. 29 U.S.C. 626(f). In \n     regard to claims of discrimination on the basis of handicap \n     within the meaning of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act \n     of 1973 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 791), employees are entitled to the \n     same remedies as are available to Federal employees under \n     section 505(a)(1) of that act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 794a(a)(1)), as \n     well as the compensatory damages provisions described above \n     under Title VII. For claims of discrimination on the basis of \n     disability within the meaning of sections 102-104 of the \n     Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, employees are \n     entitled to the remedies as are available under section 107 \n     of that Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12117(a)), as well as the title \n     VII compensatory damages.\n       As under current law with respect to Federal employees, \n     punitive damages are not available for any claims under this \n     section.\n       Section 201 is also made applicable to instrumentalities of \n     Congress.\n       Effective date. This section is effective one year after \n     enactment.\n\nSection 202--Rights and Protections Under the Family and Medical Leave \n                                  Act\n\n       Family and medical leave. This section provides employees \n     with the rights to family and medical leave provided to \n     private employees under sections 101 through 105 of the \n     Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. For purposes of \n     applying those sections, the term ``eligible employee'' as \n     used in the Family and Medical Leave Act is defined so that a \n     covered employee within the Senate, the House of \n     Representatives, or of the Congressional instrumentalities \n     covered by this act, earns his or her entitlement to family \n     and medical leave without respect to transfers between \n     employing offices. For example, once an employee has been a \n     covered employee for at least twelve months, and works for at \n     least 1250 hours during the previous twelve months, he or she \n     is an eligible employee for purposes of family and medical \n     leave, irrespective of whether he or she changes employing \n     offices.\n       This section makes title I of the Family and Medical Leave \n     Act, rather than title II, applicable to the General \n     Accounting Office and the Library of Congress, beginning one \n     year after the date of completion of the study referred to in \n     section 230.\n       Applicable remedies. The remedies for a violation of the \n     rights conferred by this section are the same remedies that \n     would be available to a private employee under section \n     107(a)(1) of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2617(a)(1), which includes damages, liquidated \n     damages and interest, attorney's fees, and costs. The \n     remedies and protections under this act provide rights over a \n     one year period. Accordingly, the Board is to ensure that the \n     six month statute of limitations that applies under this act \n     is applied in such a way as to ensure the possibility that \n     employees will have six months to seek to redress violations \n     of any rights conferred by the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n       Under this section, and various other sections of the bill, \n     the Board is given authority to issue regulations to enforce \n     the Family and Medical Leave Act. Such regulations shall be \n     the same as the substantive regulations issued by the \n     Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provisions \n     referred to in subsection (a), except insofar as the Board \n     may determine, for good cause shown and stated together with \n     the regulation, that a modification of such regulations would \n     be more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.\n       ``Good cause'' is a term of art in the Administrative \n     Procedures Act. This is a narrow phrase. It does not provide \n     an escape hatch for the Board to deviate from executive \n     branch regulations except for substantial justification. I \n     expect courts to interpret the term ``good cause'' narrowly \n     here, just as they have done with respect to the equivalent \n     term in the Administrative Procedures Act.\n       Effective date. This section is effective one year after \n     the enactment of this act.\n\n Section 203--Rights and Protections Under the Fair Labor Standards Act\n\n       Minimum wage, maximum hours, and equal pay. This section \n     provides employees with rights to minimum wage, equal pay, \n     maximum hours, afforded private and other public employees \n     under sections 6(a)(1), 6(d), 7 and 12(c) of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act (29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 206(a)(1), 206(d), 207, \n     212(c). As in the private sector, employees may not be \n     provided compensatory leave in lieu of overtime compensation. \n     For the purposes of this section, the term ``covered \n     employee'' does not include an intern as defined by \n     regulation. [[Page S624]] \n       The exemptions for certain employees, set forth in section \n     13(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 213(a)(1)), also apply under this act. Employees who are \n     employed in a ``bona fide executive, administrative, or \n     professional capacity'' are not covered by the minimum wage \n     and maximum hours provisions. Volunteers are also excluded \n     from coverage if they receive no compensation or are paid \n     expenses, reasonable benefits, or a nominal fee for their \n     services, and such services are not the same type of services \n     for which the individual is employed.\n       Applicable remedies. The remedies for a violation of the \n     rights conferred by this section shall be the remedies that \n     would be available to other employees under section 16(b) of \n     the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 216(b)), \n     which includes unpaid minimum or overtime wages, liquidated \n     damages, attorney's fees, and costs.\n       Regulations issued by the Board. This section also directs \n     the Board to promulgate rules, pursuant to section 304 of \n     this act, that are necessary to implement the rights and \n     protections under this section. This would include rules on \n     what employees are exempt from the minimum wage and maximum \n     hours requirements, the definition of an intern, and which \n     employees' work depends directly on the schedule of the House \n     of Representatives and Senate. ``Directly'' is to be strictly \n     limited to those employees who are essentially floor staff. \n     Regulations issued by the Board are to be the same as \n     substantive regulations issued under the Fair labor Standards \n     Act by the Secretary of Labor, unless the Board determines \n     that a different rule would be more effective for \n     implementation of the rights and protections of this act.\n  Effective date. Subsections (a) and (b) of this section are effective \none year after enactment of this act.\n\n   Section 204--Rights and Protections Under the Employee Polygraph \n                         Protection Act of 1988\n\n       Under this section, no employing Office, irrespective of \n     whether a covered employee works in that Office may require a \n     covered employee to take a lie detector test where such a \n     test would be prohibited if required under paragraphs (1), \n     (2), or (3) of section 3 of the Employee Protection Act of \n     1988 (29 U.S.C. 2002 (1), (2), (3). For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``covered employee'' includes the employees \n     of the General Accounting Office and Library of Congress. The \n     term ``employing Office'' includes the General Accounting \n     Office and Library of Congress. However, nothing in this \n     section precludes the Capitol Police from using lie detectors \n     in accordance with regulations issued under subsection (c).\n       The remedies available for a violation of this section are \n     the appropriate remedies under section 6(c)(1) of the \n     Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 (29 U.S.C. \n     20005(c)(1). In addition, the waiver provisions of section \n     6(d) of the act (29 U.S.C. 2005(d)) shall apply.\n       The Board is empowered to issue regulations to implement \n     this section under section 304 of this act. These regulations \n     shall be the same as substantive regulations issued by the \n     Secretary of Labor to implement the underlying statute, \n     except insofar as the Board may determine, for good cause, \n     that a modification of such regulations would be more \n     effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.\n       The effective date for this section is one year after the \n     date of enactment of this act, except with respect to the \n     General Accounting Office and Library of Congress, for which \n     the effective date shall be one year after the transmission \n     to Congress of the study authorized in section 230.\n\n  Section 205--Rights and Protections Under the Worker Adjustment and \n                      Retraining Notification Act\n\n       This section provides that no employing office shall be \n     closed or a mass layoff ordered within the meaning of section \n     3 of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act \n     (29 U.S.C. 1202) until the end of a 60-day period after the \n     employing office serves written notice of such prospective \n     closing or layoff to representatives of covered employees or, \n     if there are no representatives, to covered employees. For \n     purposes of this section, the term ``covered employee'' \n     includes employees of the General Accounting Office and \n     Library of Congress and the term ``employing office'' \n     includes the General Accounting Office and Library of \n     Congress.\n       The remedies available for a violation of the rights \n     conferred by this section shall be such remedy as would be \n     appropriate under paragraphs (1), (2), and (4) of section 5 \n     of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (29 \n     U.S.C. 2104(a) (1), (2), (4)). Under this statute, a specific \n     rule affecting coverage is contained in section 225(f)(2).\n       The Board shall issue regulations pursuant to section 304 \n     to issue regulations to implement this section. These \n     regulations shall be the same as substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) except \n     insofar as the Board may determine, for good cause shown, \n     that a modification of such regulations would be more \n     effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.\n       This section is effective one year after the date of \n     enactment of this act, except in the case of the General \n     Accounting Office and Library of Congress, where the \n     effective date will be one year after transmission to the \n     Congress of the study provided for in section 230.\n\n Section 206--Rights and Protections Relating to Veterans' Employment \n                            and Reemployment\n\n       This section prohibits an employing office from (1) \n     discriminating, within the meaning of subsections (a) and (b) \n     of section 4311 of title 38, United States Code, against an \n     eligible employee; (2) denying an eligible employee \n     reemployment rights within the meaning of sections 4312 and \n     4313 of title 38, United States Code; or (3) denying an \n     eligible employee benefits within the meaning of sections \n     4316, 4317, and 4318 of title 38, United States Code. For \n     purposes of this section, the term ``eligible employee'' \n     means a covered employee performing service in the uniformed \n     services, within the meaning of section 4303(13) of title 38, \n     United States Code, whose service has not been terminated \n     upon occurrence of any of the events enumerated in section \n     4304 of title 38, United States Code. For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``covered employee'' includes employees of \n     the General Accounting Office and Library of Congress, and \n     the term ``employing office'' includes the General Accounting \n     Office and the Library of Congress.\n       The remedy available for violation of this section shall be \n     the remedies available under paragraphs (1), (2)(A), and (3) \n     of section 4323(c) of chapter 43 of title 38, United States \n     Code. These remedies shall be in addition to, and not \n     substitutes for, any existing remedies available to covered \n     employees under chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code.\n       The Board, pursuant to section 304, shall issue regulations \n     to implement this section. These regulations shall be the \n     same as substantive regulations issued by the Secretary of \n     Labor to implement the underlying statutory provisions except \n     to the extent that the Board may determine, for good cause \n     shown, that a modification of such regulations would be more \n     effective for the implementation of the rights and provisions \n     under this section.\n       The effective date of this section is one year after \n     enactment of this act, except as to the General Accounting \n     Office and Library of Congress, where the effective date \n     shall be one year after transmittal to Congress of the study \n     authorized under section 230.\n\n          Section 207--Prohibition of Intimidation of Reprisal\n\n       This section provides one uniform remedy for intimidation \n     or reprisal taken against covered employees for exercising \n     rights and pursuing remedies of violations for the violation \n     of rights conferred by this act. Under this section, it is \n     unlawful for an employing office to take reprisal against, or \n     otherwise discriminate against, any covered employee because \n     the covered employee has opposed any practice made unlawful \n     by this act, or because the covered employee has initiated \n     proceedings, made a charge, or testified, assisted, or \n     participated in any manner in a hearing or other proceeding \n     under this act. The remedy available for a violation of this \n     subsection shall be such legal or equitable remedy as would \n     be appropriate.\n\n     Section 210--Rights and Protections Under the Americans With \n                            Disabilities Act\n\n       This section applies the protections of title II and III of \n     the Americans With Disabilities Act, which concern rights \n     other than employment discrimination, to each office of the \n     Senate, each office of the House of Representatives, each \n     Joint Committee, the Office of the Architect, the Capitol \n     Guide Board, Capitol Police Board, Congressional Budget \n     Office, Office of Technology Assessment, Office of \n     Compliance, and Office of the Attending Physician. It \n     prohibits discrimination in the provision of public services \n     on the basis of disability, within the meaning of sections \n     201 through 230, 302, 303, and 309 of the Americans With \n     Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182-\n     83 and 12189). For purposes of the application of the \n     Americans With Disabilities Act under this section, the \n     covered congressional entities are deemed to be public \n     entities.\n       The protection afforded by this section applies to any \n     individual with a disability as defined in section 201(s) of \n     the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 12131(2)). However, with respect to any claim of \n     employment discrimination on the basis of disability made by \n     any employee covered under this act, the exclusive remedy \n     shall be under section 201 of this act.\n       Applicable remedies. The remedies for discrimination in \n     public services prohibited by this section shall be the \n     remedies that would be available under section 203 or 308(a) \n     of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 12133, 12188(a)). Section 203 and 308(a) of the ADA \n     incorporates the remedies under section 505 of the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794A). This includes \n     equitable relief, attorneys fees, and costs. It does not \n     include the remedial procedures described in section 717 that \n     involves the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which \n     is not provided any enforcement authority under this act. Nor \n     does it include the provisions in title III of the Americans \n     With Disabilities Act that enable the Attorney General to \n     seek monetary damages in particular cases.\n       Procedures for enforcement. Under this section, a qualified \n     individual with a disability who alleges a violation under \n     this section may file a charge with the general counsel of \n     the office of compliance. The general counsel shall \n     investigate any such charge and, if the general counsel \n     believes that a violation [[Page S625]] may have occurred and \n     that mediation may aid in resolving the dispute, the general \n     counsel may request mediation with the Office under section \n     403 of this act between the complaining individual and the \n     entity alleged to have committed the violation. The general \n     counsel does not participate in the mediation.\n       If the dispute is not resolved through mediation, and the \n     general counsel believes that a violation has occurred, the \n     general counsel may, in his or her discretion, file a \n     complaint against the entity with the Office. Ordinarily, \n     once the general counsel concludes that a violation has \n     occurred, a complaint should be filed; however, in a \n     particular case, circumstances, such as the de minimis nature \n     of the violation, may warrant a decision not to file a \n     complaint.\n       The Office shall submit the complaint to a hearing officer \n     for decision under section 405. Any person who has filed a \n     charge under this section may intervene as of right, with the \n     full rights of a party. This procedure is established so that \n     this individual may participate in developing the record for \n     appeal in the event that the general counsel does not \n     participate in the judicial appeal.\n       Any party (including the complaining party who has \n     intervened) aggrieved by a final decision of a hearing \n     officer under this section may seek review of the decision by \n     the Board. Any party aggrieved by a final decision of the \n     Board may file a petition for review with the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, pursuant \n     to section 407 of this act. This section authorizes \n     judicial review only of a final decision of the Board. \n     Decisions of the general counsel not to file a request for \n     mediation or a complaint, or not to appeal a hearing \n     officer's decision to the Board, are not subject to \n     judicial review under this section or under any other \n     provision of this Act.\n       Regulations to be issued by the Board. This section directs \n     the Board to issue rules pursuant to Section 304 of this Act, \n     to implement the rights and protections under this section. \n     Any such rules are to be consistent with the regulations \n     issued by the Attorney General and the Secretary of \n     Transportation to implement the provisions of the Americans \n     with Disabilities Act of 1990 referenced in section 210(b) of \n     this Act. The Board may promulgate rules that differ from \n     those of the Attorney General and the Secretary of \n     Transportation only if the Board determines for good cause \n     shown that a modification would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.\n       Inspections, reporting, and detailees. This section also \n     provides for regular inspections by the General Counsel of \n     the covered entities to ensure that they are in compliance \n     with the requirements of this section. The general counsel is \n     directed to report at least once each Congress to the Speaker \n     of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore \n     of the Senate on the results of the inspections and to \n     describe any steps necessary to ensure full compliance with \n     this section.\n       Under this section, the Attorney General, the Secretary of \n     Transportation, and the Architectural and Transportation \n     Barriers Compliance Board may, upon the request of the \n     general counsel, detail such personnel as may be necessary to \n     advise and assist the Office in carrying out its duties under \n     this Section.\n       A private right of action is provided to any qualified \n     person under the Americans with Disabilities Act against the \n     General Accounting Office, the Government Printing Office, \n     and Library of Congress. However, the enforcement authority \n     of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall be \n     exercised by the Chief Official of the Instrumentality.\n       Effective date. This section is effective on January 1, \n     1997, except as to the private right of action against the \n     instrumentalities, which is effective one year after \n     transmittal to Congress of the study provided for in section \n     230.\n\n Section 215--Rights and Protections Under the Occupational Safety and \n            Health Act; Procedures for Remedy of Violations\n\n       Protections from workplace hazards. This section \n     requires employees and employing offices to comply with \n     the provisions of section 5 of the Occupational Safety and \n     Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 654). Section 5 \n     requires each employer to furnish employees a workplace \n     free from recognized hazards that are causing or likely to \n     cause death or serious physical harm and requires both \n     employers and employees to comply with the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Standards promulgated by the Secretary \n     of Labor under section 6 of that act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 655). \n     The requirement that employers and employees comply with \n     the Secretary of Labor's standards is subject to variance \n     granted under subsections (c)(4) and any regulations \n     promulgated by the Board under subsection (d).\n       For purposes of this section, the term ``employer'' as used \n     in the Occupational Safety and Health Act means an employing \n     office and the term ``employee'' means a covered employee. \n     For purposes of this section, the term ``employing office'' \n     includes the General Accounting Office and Library of \n     Congress, and the term ``employee'' includes employees of the \n     General Accounting Office and Library of Congress.\n       Applicable remedies. The remedy available for violations \n     under this section are an order to correct the violation, \n     including such an order as would be appropriate under section \n     11 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 662), which include citations issued by the \n     general counsel.\n       Procedures for enforcement. The responsibilities for \n     enforcement of this section are vested in the general counsel \n     rather than the Secretary of Labor. The Board is given the \n     responsibility to conduct hearings and review orders that is \n     vested in the Occupational Safety and Health Review \n     Commission under section 10(c) of OSHA (29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 659(c)) and to the Secretary of Labor with respect to \n     affirming or modifying abatement requirements, to hear \n     objections and requests with respect to citations and \n     notifications. The remedy available under this act for a \n     violation of OSHA is an order to correct the violation, \n     including such order as would be appropriate if ordered under \n     section 13(2) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n     1970.\n       Inspections. With respect to inspections, the authorities \n     granted to the Secretary of Labor in sections 8(a) and 8(f) \n     of OSHA (29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 657(a), (f)) to inspect and \n     investigate places of employment are to be exercised by the \n     general counsel. Under this section, there are two possible \n     scenarios under which inspections will occur: through \n     employee-initiated requests that the general counsel inspect \n     particular offices and periodic inspections of all \n     congressional facilities. The general counsel exercises OSHA \n     authority with respect to both employee requested and \n     periodic inspections. Periodic inspections are random. Each \n     facility is to be inspected each Congress. However, the act \n     does not provide that employing offices are to receive notice \n     of the inspections.\n       Citations. With respect to citations, the authorities \n     granted to the Secretary of Labor in sections 9 and 10 of \n     OSHA (29 U.S.C. Sec. 658, 659) to issue citations for \n     violations or notices of failure to correct violations for \n     which citations have been issued are vested in the general \n     counsel. The citation would normally state a date by which \n     corrective action is to be completed. The citation is to be \n     issued only against the employing office that is responsible \n     for the particular violation as determined by regulations \n     issued by the Board. The general counsel may also issue a \n     notification to any employing office that the general counsel \n     believes has failed to correct a violation for which a \n     citation has been issued within the period permitted for its \n     correction.\n       If after issuing a citation or notification, the general \n     counsel determines that a violation has not been corrected, \n     the general counsel may file with the Office of Compliance a \n     complaint against the employing office named in the citation \n     or notification. Under OSHA, the general counsel can issue a \n     citation and proceed to file a complaint if the violation \n     remains unabated. Or the general counsel may file a \n     notification after the citation is not complied with, and \n     then file a complaint. The general counsel may not file a \n     notification without having first filed a citation that has \n     not been honored. The choice whether to follow a citation \n     with a complaint once it is evident that there has not been \n     compliance, or to file a notification before the filing of \n     the complaint, will normally turn on whether the general \n     counsel believes that good faith efforts are being undertaken \n     to comply with the citation, but the time period for complete \n     remediation of the citation period has expired. The Office \n     shall submit the complaint to a hearing officer subject to \n     Board review under the general provisions of the Act \n     outlining those procedures.\n       Variances. The Board shall exercise the authorities granted \n     the Secretary of Labor in sections 6(b)(6) and 6(d) of OSHA \n     (29 U.S.C. Sec. 655(b)(6) and (d)) to act on any request by \n     an employer for a temporary order granting a variance from a \n     standard made applicable by subsection (a). The Board may \n     refer such a request to a hearing officer for a hearing \n     conducted in accordance with section 405 of this act and \n     subject to review under section 406 of this act. The general \n     counsel or employing office aggrieved by a final decision of \n     the Board regarding a citation, notification, or variance, \n     may file a petition for review with the United States Court \n     of Appeals for the Federal Circuit pursuant to section 407.\n       Compliance date. If a citation of a violation under OSHA is \n     received, and appropriated funds are necessary to abate the \n     violation, abatement shall take place as soon as possible, \n     but no later than the fiscal year following the fiscal year \n     in which the citations are issued. This permits the Congress \n     to appropriate funds to remedy OSHA violations during the \n     standard appropriations timetable where the abatement amount \n     is large, and avoids disruptions to other functions of the \n     employing office caused by the unanticipated need for \n     additional expenditures.\n       Regulations issued by the Board. The Board shall promulgate \n     regulations to implement this section. Such regulations shall \n     be the same as the standards and regulations promulgated by \n     the Secretary of Labor to implement OSHA with the same \n     standard for deviation contained elsewhere in the act.\n       Periodic inspections. At least once each Congress, the \n     general counsel shall conduct periodic inspections of all \n     facilities of the Congress for compliance with the \n     Occupational Safety and Health Act. Based on the result of \n     each periodic inspection, the general counsel will prepare \n     and submit a report to the House Speaker, Senate President \n     pro tempore, and the employing office responsible for \n     correcting the violation. The report will also contain the \n     results of the periodic [[Page S626]] inspection, identify \n     the responsible employing office, describe the actions \n     necessary to correct any violation, and assess the risks to \n     employee health and safety associated with any violation. If \n     a report identifies any violation, the general counsel shall \n     issue a citation or notice. The general counsel may be \n     assisted by personnel detailed from the Secretary of Labor, \n     upon request of the executive director for such assistance.\n       The bill uses the terms ``employing office'' as a \n     designative term referring to an office. There is no \n     requirement that the employing office responsible for the \n     violation actually be the employing office of the employee \n     that makes the complaint, for instance.\n       Effective date. The period from the date of enactment until \n     December 31, 1996 shall be available to the Office of the \n     Architect of the Capitol to identify any OSHA violations, \n     determine costs of compliance, and to take any necessary \n     abatement actions. The general counsel shall conduct a \n     thorough inspection prior to July 1, 1996, and report the \n     results to the Congress. Except as to GAO and Library of \n     Congress, this section will become effective on January 1, \n     1997. As to these instrumentalities, this section will take \n     effect 1 year after transmission to Congress of the study \n     provided for in section 230.\n\nSection 220--Application of Federal Service Labor-Management Relations \n         Statute; Procedures for Implementation and Enforcement\n\n       Labor-management relations. This section applies to \n     employees and employing offices the rights, protections, and \n     responsibilities relating to collective bargaining \n     established for other Federal employees and employers under 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 7102, 7106, 7111 through 7117, 7119 through \n     7122, and 7131. For purposes of applying those provisions \n     under this section, the term ``agency'' shall be deemed to \n     mean an employing office.\n       The remedy for a violation of subsection (a) shall be a \n     remedy under section 7118(a)(7) of title 5 of the United \n     States Code as would be appropriate if awarded by the Federal \n     Labor Relations Authority to remedy a violation of any \n     provision made applicable by subsection (a).\n       In applying the Federal service labor-management relations \n     provisions to employees and employing offices, the Board \n     shall exercise the authorities of the Federal Labor Relations \n     Authority under 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 7105, 7111 to 7113, 7115, \n     7117, 7118, and 7122 and of the President under 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 7103(b). Any petition or other submission that would be \n     submitted to the Federal Labor Relations Authority shall, \n     under this section be submitted to the Board.\n       The Board may refer any matter submitted to it under \n     subparagraph (c)(1) of this section to a hearing officer for \n     decision pursuant to section 405 of this act. The Board may \n     direct that the general counsel carry out the Board's \n     investigative authorities.\n       Procedures. Under this section, the general counsel shall \n     exercise the authorities of the general counsel of the \n     Federal Labor Relations Authority under 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 7104 and 7118. Any charge or other submission that, \n     if submitted under chapter 71 of title 5 would be submitted \n     to the general counsel of the Federal Labor Relations \n     Authority shall, if brought under this section, be submitted \n     to the general counsel. If any person charges an employing \n     office or a labor organization representing employees with \n     having engaged in an unfair labor practice in violation of \n     this section within 180 days of the occurrence of the alleged \n     unfair labor practice, the general counsel shall investigate \n     the charge, and may issue a complaint. A complaint issued by \n     the general counsel under this section shall be submitted to \n     a hearing officer for decision under section 405 of this act.\n       For purposes of applying the Federal service labor-\n     management relations provisions under this section, the Board \n     shall exercise the authority of the Federal service impasses \n     panel under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7119. Any request that under those \n     provisions would be presented to the Federal service impasses \n     panel shall, if made under this section, be presented to the \n     Board. At the request of the Board, the director shall \n     appoint a mediator or mediators to perform the functions of \n     the Federal service impasses panel under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7119. \n     Ordinarily, the Board should request the appointment of a \n     mediator and should avoid participating in the mediation of \n     disputes for which it may have adjudicatory responsibilities.\n       Regulations to be issued by the Board. The Board shall \n     promulgate regulations to implement this section. The rules \n     promulgated under this section shall be the same as the \n     rules promulgated by the Federal labor relations authority \n     to implement 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 7102, 7106, 7111 through \n     7117, 7119 through 7122, and 7131. The Board may \n     promulgate rules that are not the same as the rules of the \n     Federal labor relations authority only under the standard \n     provided as elsewhere in the act, except as provided in \n     subsection (e).\n       The Board shall issue rules pursuant to the rulemaking \n     provisions of section 304 of this act on the manner and \n     extent to which the rights conferred by this section should \n     apply to employees who are employed in positions in offices \n     with a direct connection to the legislative process, \n     including the personal office of any Member of the House or \n     the Senate, a standing, select, special, permanent, \n     temporary, or other committee of the Senate or the House, a \n     joint committee of Congress, and the offices of various party \n     officers, including the Office of the Majority and Minority \n     Leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives. These \n     rules should be the same as the regulations of the Federal \n     labor relations authority except to the extent that the Board \n     may determine, for good cause shown and stated together with \n     the regulation, that a modification of such regulations would \n     be more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section; and that the Board shall \n     exclude from coverage any covered employees who are employed \n     in the offices listed in paragraph 2 of subsection (e) if the \n     Board determines that such exclusion is required because of a \n     conflict or appearance of a conflict of interest, or \n     Congress' constitutional responsibilities. Paragraph (h) of \n     subsection (e) should be construed narrowly. However, one \n     portion of one office that might fall within this paragraph \n     would be the employees of the Office of the Sergeant at Arms \n     who engage in doorkeeping and maintaining order in the \n     legislative Chamber and who compel the presence of absent \n     Senators.\n       A conflict of interest would include, for example, whether \n     certain classes of employees should be precluded from being \n     represented by unions affiliated with noncongressional or \n     non-Federal unions. This separate standard from deviation \n     from regulations is not a standardless license to roam far \n     afield from such executive branch regulations. The Board \n     cannot determine unilaterally that an insupportably broad \n     view of Congress' constitutional responsibilities means that \n     no unions of any kind can work in Congress. Without \n     abdicating its review responsibilities, however, courts \n     should give more deference to congressional determinations \n     under this particular regulatory area than to all other \n     deviations from executive branch regulations made by the \n     Board.\n       Effective date. Subsections (a) and (b) of this section \n     shall be effective on October 1, 1996, except with respect to \n     the offices listed in subsection (e)(2), to the covered \n     employees of such offices, and to representatives of such \n     employees, for which subsections (a) and (b) shall be \n     effective on the effective date of regulations issued under \n     subsection (e).\n\n\n                            part e--general\n\n       Section 225--Generally Applicable Remedies and Limitations\n\n       Under subsection 225(a), if a complainant is a prevailing \n     party under section 405, 406, 407, or 408, the hearing \n     officer, Board, or court, as the case may be, may award \n     attorney's fees, expert witness fees, and other costs as \n     would be appropriate if awarded under section 706(k) of the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964. Although the Board has no authority \n     to issue regulations under section 201, it does have the \n     ability under section 303 to issue procedural rules. Such \n     rules could govern the availability of fees and costs under \n     section 706(k), so long as the rules were consistent with \n     court cases interpreting the Civil Rights Act. For example, \n     some courts have held that the amount of compensatory damages \n     a prevailing party recovers is relevant to determine a \n     reasonable fee award, and that recovery of only a portion of \n     the compensatory damages request can form the basis for \n     reducing the fee award. Other courts have held that \n     proportionality cannot be considered in awarding attorney's \n     fees. Given the conflict among the cases, the Board could \n     decide which set of cases to follow when it issues its \n     regulations.\n       Subsection (b) provides that in any proceeding under \n     section 405, 406, 407, or 408, the same interest to \n     compensate for delay in payment shall be made available as \n     would be appropriate in actions involving the executive \n     branch under section 717(d) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \n     This is an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity as to these \n     interest payments. Subsection (c) provides, in keeping with \n     longstanding rules applicable to the Federal Government, that \n     no civil penalty or punitive damages may be awarded with \n     respect to any claim under this act.\n       Subsection (d) provides that except in cases under the \n     Veterans Reemployment Act, no person may commence an \n     administrative or judicial proceeding to seek a remedy for \n     the rights and protections afforded by this act except as \n     provided in this act.\n       Subsection (e) provides that only a covered employee who \n     has undergone and completed the procedures described in \n     section 402 and 403 may pursue a civil action in court. \n     Counseling and mediation with the office are preconditions to \n     bringing any civil action under this act.\n       Subsection (f) states that except where contrary exemptions \n     and exemptions appear in this act, the definitions and \n     exemptions in the laws made applicable by this act shall \n     apply under this act. This means that although the various 11 \n     laws are made applicable to Congress, the exemptions and \n     definitions that limit its application in the private sector \n     limit its applicability to Congress as well and that \n     regulations of the executive branch interpreting those \n     definitions and exemptions should ordinarily apply.\n       Subsection (g) states that the act shall not be construed \n     to authorize enforcement by the executive branch of this act, \n     but this does not override the provision that executive \n     branch employees may be detailed to the Office of Compliance \n     at the request of the executive director.\n\n  Section 230--Study and Recommendations Regarding General Accounting \n    Office, Government Printing Office, and the Library of Congress\n\n       This section directs the Administrative Conference of the \n     United States to study the [[Page S627]] extent to which the \n     legislative branch employees not covered under this act are \n     or are not covered by the employment laws made applicable by \n     this act. This primarily includes employees in the General \n     Accounting Office, the Government Printing Office, and the \n     Library of Congress The Administrative Conference should \n     study the manner and extent to which these employees are \n     covered under existing laws, and should also study the \n     regulations and procedures implemented by these congressional \n     instrumentalities to provide for the enforcement of these \n     rights and protections.\n       This study should evaluate not only the extent to which \n     employees are provided the rights and protections of the laws \n     made applicable to Congress in this act. But also whether \n     they are as comprehensive and effective as those provided \n     under this act. The study should include recommendations for \n     legislation to extend or improve coverage as well as \n     recommended improvements in regulations or procedures. \n     Recommendations for legislation may include recommendations \n     on clarifying existing legislation where coverage of \n     legislative branch employees is ambiguous, or can be \n     determined only by unduly complex parsing of a number of \n     laws.\n       The Administrative Office shall submit the study and \n     recommendations required under this section to the Board \n     within 2 years after enactment of this act. The Board shall \n     transmit the study and recommendations head of each \n     instrumentality or other entity considered in this study and \n     to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and President \n     pro tempore for referral to the appropriate committees of the \n     House of Representatives and of the Senate.\n\n                    Title III--Office of Compliance\n\n           Section 301--Establishment of Office of Compliance\n\n       This section creates the Office of Congressional Fair \n     Employment Practices as an independent office in the \n     legislative branch of the Government to administer the \n     dispute resolution process created by this act.\n       The Office shall be overseen by a board of directors, \n     which shall be composed of 5 members. A five member board \n     is the best size to discourage deadlock and to facilitate \n     effective decisionmaking.\\1\\\n     \\1\\Some management researchers have concluded that \n     policymaking bodies of five members are preferable to both \n     larger and small groups. See, U.S. Senate Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs, Study on Federal Regulation, Vol. IV, \n     Doc. No. 95-72, July 1977, p. 115.\n\n       It is extremely important that the Board function in a \n     nonpartisan manner. For this reason, the act requires that \n     all members of the Board be appointed without regard to \n     political affiliation and solely on the basis of fitness to \n     perform the duties of office. Board members shall be \n     appointed solely on the basis of fitness to perform their \n     duties under the act, and shall have background and \n     experience in application of the rights, protections, and \n     remedies under the laws made applicable to section 102. There \n     is no assumption that any particular kind of training or \n     experience is necessary, but a variety of experiences would \n     qualify an individual for a position on the Board. The act \n     does not require that any individual member have training or \n     experience under all of the statutes made applicable by this \n     act, but members should be selected with a view to providing \n     the Board as a whole with some expertise in each field of law \n     within the Board's jurisdiction.\n       On the other hand, the committee also recognizes that, in \n     order for the Board to function in Congress's political \n     environment, and to insulate the Board against claims of \n     partisanship that will inevitably be raised by persons \n     dissatisfied with a particular decision, the process for the \n     selection of the Board members must be fully bipartisan. To \n     accomplish this, the appointment of members is jointly made \n     between the Houses and between the parties. Accordingly, the \n     members shall be appointed jointly by the Speaker of the \n     House, majority leader of the Senate, and the minority leader \n     of both Houses. The chair of the Board shall also be \n     appointed jointly. Appointment of the first 5 members of the \n     Board shall be completed not later than 90 days after the \n     date of enactment.\n       There are certain disqualifications from service as a Board \n     member. No lobbyist may serve. No Board member may be a \n     Member of Congress or a former Member. Nor may a Board member \n     be an officer or employee of the House, Senate, an \n     instrumentality of Congress, except an officer or employee of \n     the GAO Personnel Appeals Board, House Office of Fair \n     Employment Practices, or the Senate Office of Fair Employment \n     Practices, or a former holder of one of these positions \n     within 4 years of the date of appointment. These requirements \n     are critical because the office must, in both appearance and \n     reality, be independent in order to gain and keep the \n     confidence of the employees and employers who will utilize \n     the dispute resolution process created by this act.\n       Vacancies on the Board are to be filed in the same manner \n     as the original appointment for the vacant position. Because \n     the Board is small in number, it will be important to fill \n     vacancies as quickly as possible, consistent with selecting \n     the best qualified individuals for these positions.\n       Terms. The terms of office of the members are staggered so \n     that, after the first appointments, there will not be \n     complete turnover of the Board. The appointment is for 5 \n     years and cannot be renewed, except for someone who serves \n     three years or less. Of the first five members, one shall \n     serve three years, two for four years, and two for five \n     years, one of whom shall be chair.\n       Removal. Members may be removed from office by a majority \n     vote of the appointing authority. To further ensure the \n     independence of the Board, members may only be removed for \n     specific causes including a disability that substantially \n     prevents the member from carrying out the member's duties, \n     incompetence, neglect of duty, malfeasance in office, a \n     felony or conduct involving moral turpitude, or holding an \n     office or employment or engaging in an activity that \n     disqualifies the individual from service as a member of the \n     Board. The reason for removal of any member must be stated, \n     in writing, to the member being removed by the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the \n     Senate.\n       Compensation and travel expenses. Members may be \n     compensated at a rate equal to the daily equivalent of the \n     annual rate of basic pay prescribed for level V of the \n     Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. sec. 5316 for each day \n     during which the member is engaged in the performance of \n     board duties. Travel time should be included in the \n     computation of the time a member has spent engaged in the \n     performance of board duties.\n       Members of the Board are entitled to reimbursement for \n     travel expenses for each day that the member is engaged in \n     the performance of Board duties away from home or the regular \n     place of business of the member. The rates for travel \n     expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, shall be \n     at rates authorized for employees of agencies under 5 U.S.C. \n     sec. 5751.\n       Subsection (h) describes the duties of the office, which \n     include educating members and other employing authorities of \n     their duties and employees of their rights under this act. It \n     is also to provide educational materials on the statutes made \n     applicable to Congress by this act to employing offices for \n     new employees. The office shall also compile and publish \n     statistics on the use of the office by covered employees, \n     including the number and types of contacts made with the \n     office, on the number of covered employees who initiated \n     proceedings under the act, as well as the number of employees \n     who filed a complaint, the basis for the complaint, and its \n     disposition. In light of the confidentiality of the \n     proceedings in the administrative process, this information \n     should be compiled in a manner that does not reveal the \n     identity of particular employees or employing offices.\n       The Board and office shall be subject to oversight by the \n     Committee of rules and Administration and the Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on House \n     Oversight of the House of Representatives. Oversight \n     authority of these committees does not extend to the \n     processing, consideration, or disposition of individual cases \n     or the unwillingness of the general counsel to file a \n     complaint regarding particular charges within his or her \n     responsibility.\n       The office is to open within 1 year after enactment of this \n     act. This will provide sufficient time for the Board members \n     to be selected, the regulations to be issued, and the office \n     to be staffed.\n       Financial disclosure reports. Members of the Board will be \n     required to file financial disclosure reports under the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-521, title I \n     (5 U.S.C. appendix sections 103(H)(A)(II)II)).\n\n           Section 302--Officers, Staff, and Other Personnel\n\n       This section provides for the appointment of staff of the \n     new office.\n       Executive director. The position of executive director is \n     modeled after the Director of the Office of Senate Fair \n     Employment Practices (OSFEP), who administers the Senate's \n     internal resolution process. Like the Senate's Director of \n     OSFEP, the Director of the Congressional Office will have the \n     responsibility of the daily administration of the disputes \n     resolution system created by this act. This includes \n     assisting in the development and implementation of rules of \n     procedures for the dispute resolution process, selecting \n     hearing officers, counselors, and mediators, and maintaining \n     the dockets of cases filed with the office.\n       The Chair, subject to the approval of the Board, shall \n     appoint, and has the power to remove, the director. As is the \n     case of members of the Board, selection of a director should \n     be made solely on the basis of ability to perform the \n     functions of the job and without regard to political \n     affiliation. To ensure the appearance of independence and \n     impartiality of the Director, certain individuals are \n     precluded from service as Director. These are the same \n     persons who are ineligible to serve as Directors.\n       The Chair may set the compensation of the Executive \n     Director, but the rate of pay may not exceed the annual rate \n     of basic pay prescribed for level V of the executive schedule \n     under 5 U.S.C. sec 5316. The Executive Director will serve \n     a nonrenewable 5-year term, except that the first \n     Executive Director may serve a nonrenewable 7-year term.\n       Additionally the office will have two Deputy Directors, one \n     for each House of Congress. The Deputy Executive Directors \n     are appointed and removed by the Chair, subject to the \n     approval of the Board. The appointment shall be made without \n     regard to political affiliation and with the same \n     disqualifications that apply to service as Executive \n     Director. The Deputy Executive Director [[Page S628]] shall \n     serve a 5-year term, except that the first Deputy Executive \n     Director shall serve for 6 years. This will mean that the \n     Deputy Executive Director will serve terms that do not expire \n     concurrently with the Executive Director.\n       The Deputy Executive Director shall recommend the \n     regulations to the Board under section 304(a)(2)(B)(i), \n     maintain the regulations and all records pertaining to the \n     regulations, and shall assume such other responsibilities as \n     may be delegated to the Executive Director.\n       The Executive Director may appoint, terminate, and fix the \n     compensation of such staff, including hearing officers, \n     necessary to enable the office to carry out its functions. \n     The Executive Director does not have authority to appoint \n     attorneys to assist the general counsel, which authority is \n     provided directly to the general counsel. The Executive \n     Director may request other Government departments or agencies \n     to detail on a reimbursable or nonreimbursable basis the \n     services of the personnel of the department or agency. In \n     addition, the Executive Director is authorized to procure the \n     temporary or intermittent services of consultants.\n       General Counsel. The Chair, subject to the approval of the \n     board, may appoint and remove a general counsel. This \n     position does not have an analogy in the Senate fair \n     employment process. This position and its duties, however, \n     are modeled on the role of the general counsel in bodies such \n     as the General Accounting Office Personnel Appeals Board or \n     the Federal Labor Relations Authority. Under this act, the \n     general counsel may receive complaints of violations of the \n     provisions of titles II and III of the Americans With \n     Disabilities Act made applicable by this act and file and \n     prosecute complaints in the name of parties making charges of \n     violations. The general counsel will also conduct workplace \n     inspections and issue citations of violations of the \n     requirements of OSHA made applicable by this act. The general \n     counsel exercises authority comparable to that of the Federal \n     Labor Relations Authority's General Counsel. The general \n     counsel also provides representation to the office when it is \n     named as a respondent in proceedings brought in the Federal \n     Circuit under this act.\n       To ensure that the general counsel is, and appears to be, \n     independent and impartial, certain individuals are precluded \n     from service as general counsel. These are the same as apply \n     to the Board of Directors.\n       The Chair may fix the compensation of the general counsel, \n     which shall not exceed the annual rate of basic pay \n     prescribed for level V of the executive schedule under 5 \n     U.S.C. sec. 5316. The general counsel may appoint, terminate, \n     and fix the compensation of such additional counsel as may be \n     necessary to carry out the duties of the general counsel. The \n     term of office of the general counsel is for a single term of \n     5 years. The general counsel may only be removed for cause. \n     The act carefully prescribes which officials may be removed \n     only for cause and which may not.\n\n                     Section 303--procedural rules\n\n       This section sets forth the procedure for the adoption and \n     amendment of rules governing the procedures of the Office of \n     Compliance, including rules concerning hearing officers. The \n     rules and amendments thereto shall be submitted for \n     publication in the Congressional Record.\n       Under subsection (b), the Executive Director shall adopt \n     the rules referred to in subsection (a) in accordance with \n     the principles and procedures of the Administrative \n     Procedures Act. The Executive Director shall publish a notice \n     of proposed rulemaking in accordance with the APA, but with \n     publication occurring in the Congressional Record rather than \n     the Federal Register. Before issuing rules, the Executive \n     Director shall provide a comment period of at least 30 days \n     after publication of the notice of rulemaking. Upon adopting \n     rules, the Executive Director shall transmit notice of such \n     action along with the rules to the Speaker of the House and \n     the President pro tempore of the Senate for publication in \n     the Congressional Record. Rules are considered to be issued \n     on the date on which they are so published.\n\n                  Section 304--substantive regulations\n\n       This section sets forth the procedures of issuing \n     regulations to implement this Act, including regulations the \n     board is required to issue under title II, including \n     appropriate application of exemptions under the laws made \n     applicable in title II. There shall be three sets of \n     substantive rules, one for each House, and one for other \n     employing offices.\n       The authority conferred by this section is authority only \n     to issue rules that will aid in understanding how the laws \n     apply to the Congress and does not include the authority to \n     limit the substantive rights conferred under this act. Thus, \n     for example, such rules might set forth guidance to Senate \n     offices as to how the board would interpret the family and \n     medical leave act's entitlement to unpaid family or medical \n     leave, in light of the fact that the Senate payroll system \n     does not have a leave without pay status.\n       Under subsection (b), the Board shall adopt the regulations \n     in accordance with the principles and procedures of the \n     Administrative Procedures Act. Instead of publishing a \n     general notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal \n     Register, the Board shall transmit such notice to the Speaker \n     of the House and President pro tempore of the Senate for \n     publication in the Congressional Record. Such notice shall \n     set forth the recommendations of the Deputy Director in \n     regard to regulations of the House and Senate and of the \n     executive director for the other employing offices. In this \n     way, the members of the approving body will know how the \n     board's proposed regulations differ from the recommendations \n     of the Deputy Director for their respective house.\n       Before adopting regulations, the Board shall provide a \n     comment period of at least 30 days after publication of a \n     general notice of proposed rulemaking. After considering \n     comments, the Board shall adopt regulations and transmit \n     notice of such action together with the regulations to the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro \n     tempore of the Senate for publication in the Congressional \n     Record. The Board shall include a recommendation in the \n     general notice of proposed rulemaking as to whether the \n     regulations should be approved by resolution of the Senate, \n     by resolution of the House of Representatives, by concurrent \n     resolution, or by joint resolution.\n       Regulations referred to in paragraph (2)(B)(i) of \n     subsection (a) may be approved by the Senate by resolution or \n     by the Congress by joint or concurrent resolution. \n     Regulations referred to in paragraph (2)(B)(ii) of subsection \n     (a) may be approved by the House of Representatives by \n     resolution or by the Congress by concurrent or joint \n     resolution. Regulations referred to in paragraph (2)(B)(iii) \n     may be approved by Congress by concurrent resolution or by \n     joint resolution. Upon receipt of a notice of adoption of \n     regulations, the presiding officers shall refer such notice \n     and the proposed regulation to the committee or committees of \n     jurisdiction in that House. The referral is designed to let \n     the committee determine whether the regulations should be \n     approved and by which method.\n       Following approval of regulations by the Congress or one of \n     its Houses, the Board shall submit the regulations for \n     publication in the Congressional Record. The date of issuance \n     of the regulations is the date on which they were published \n     in the Congressional Record as a result of this procedure. \n     Regulations shall become effective not less than 60 days \n     after the regulations are issued, except that an earlier \n     effective date may be specified for good cause found within \n     the meaning of section 553(d) of title 5 of the United States \n     Code.\n       Amendment to the rules. The Board's rules may be amended in \n     the same manner as they are initially adopted under this \n     section. The Board may, in its discretion, dispense with the \n     publication of a general notice of proposed rulemaking of \n     minor, technical, or urgent amendments when the Board finds \n     that notices are ``impractical, unnecessary, or contrary to \n     the public interest'' within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. sec. \n     553(B).\n       Right to petition for rulemaking.--Any person may petition \n     the Board for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule. \n     However, nothing in this section confers upon any individual \n     a right to seek judicial review of any action or inaction of \n     the Board under this section.\n       In formulating regulations, the Executive Director, Deputy \n     Directors, and Board shall consult with the chair of the \n     administrative conference, the Secretary of Labor, the \n     Federal Labor Relations Authority, and may consult with any \n     other persons of their choosing.\n\n                         Section 305--Expenses\n\n       Authorization of Appropriations. In fiscal year 1995, and \n     each fiscal year thereafter, the Congress authorizes to be \n     appropriated necessary funds for the expenses of the office \n     in carrying out its duties. Until money is first appropriated \n     under this section, but not for a period exceeding 12 months \n     after the date of enactment of this act, the expenses of the \n     office shall be paid one-half from the contingent fund of the \n     Senate and one-half from the contingent fund of the House, \n     upon vouchers approved by the director.\n       Witness fees and allowances. Except for employees, \n     witnesses before a hearing officer or the Board in any \n     proceeding other than rulemaking are entitled to be paid the \n     same fee and mileage allowances as are paid to subpoenaed \n     witnesses in the courts of the United States. It is intended \n     that, as in the courts, these costs will be borne by the \n     parties. Employees who are summoned, or assigned by the \n     employers to testify in their official capacity or to produce \n     official records before a mediator, hearing officer, or the \n     Board, shall be entitled to travel expenses under 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 5751. The committee intends for the office to bear these \n     costs.\n\n  Title IV--Administrative and Judicial Dispute--Resolution Procedures\n\n       Much of title IV builds on the dispute resolution process \n     created for the Senate in title III of the Civil Rights Act \n     of 1991. The most significant changes in this title from the \n     existing Senate procedures are the addition of the option of \n     initiating an action in Federal district court following the \n     initial two stages of dispute resolution and the deletion of \n     review of each decision by the Senate Ethics Committee. An \n     opportunity to appeal to the Board is available in the place \n     of Ethics Committee review.\n\n     Section 401--Procedure for consideration of alleged violations\n\n       Section 401 lists the procedure for consideration of \n     alleged violations of the statutes made applicable to \n     congressional employing offices under part A of title II. \n     They are [[Page S629]] counseling as provided in section 402, \n     mediation as provided in section 403, and an election as \n     provided in section 404 of either (1) a formal complaint and \n     hearing as provided in section 405, subject to board review \n     in section 406, and judicial review in the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit as provided in \n     section 407, or (2) a civil action in a district court of the \n     United States as provided in section 408. However, in the \n     case of an employee of the Architect of the Capitol or of the \n     Capitol Police, the Executive Director, after receiving a \n     request for counseling under section 402, may recommend that \n     an employee use the grievance procedures of the Architect of \n     the Capitol or the Capitol Police. The decision to make the \n     recommendation to the employee is entirely discretionary on \n     the part of the Executive Director. The decision to follow \n     the recommendation is entirely discretionary on the employee. \n     The purpose is to permit employees to use another \n     administrative remedy that may function well in the eyes of \n     the employee, without prejudice for further opportunity to \n     utilize the procedures available through the Office of \n     Compliance, as the time limitations available for counseling \n     or mediation shall not apply when during the specific period \n     that the Executive Director recommends that the employee use \n     for using the grievance procedures.\n\n                        Section 402--Counseling\n\n       Initiation. A covered employee shall request counseling \n     with the Office as a condition for commencing a proceeding \n     alleging a violation of a law made applicable under part A of \n     title II of this act. For claims under any of these statutes, \n     the request for counseling must be made within 180 days after \n     the date of the alleged violation. A failure to request \n     counseling within the time required bars an employee from \n     proceeding under this act to redress violations under these \n     sections.\n       Purpose. The purpose of counseling is to provide an \n     employee with the opportunity to discuss and evaluate the \n     employee's claims. Under the current Senate system, employees \n     meet with a counselor who assists them in preparing a \n     statement of their claims, reviews what other information \n     might aid in making a determination about whether to proceed \n     with a claim, and may assist the employee in contacting the \n     employing office to determine if a dispute can be resolved. \n     The type of counseling may vary, depending upon the nature of \n     the problem, the sophistication of the employee, and the \n     willingness of parties to resolve issues. The purpose of \n     counseling is neither to discourage nor to encourage further \n     adversarial proceedings, but rather to assist in identifying \n     issues at an early stage, so that they can be addressed \n     appropriately.\n       Period for counseling. Counseling commences on the date the \n     request for counseling is received in the Office and \n     continues for 30 days, unless the employee and the Office \n     agree to reduce the period. The 30 days begins on the date \n     the request for counseling is received.\n       Notification of the end of the counseling period. The \n     Office is required to notify the employee in writing of the \n     end of the counseling period.\n\n                         Section 403--Mediation\n\n       Initiation. A covered employee must request mediation with \n     the Office no later than 15 days after the date on which the \n     employee receives notification of the end of the counseling \n     period. Mediation under section 403 is a precondition for \n     making the election of procedures provided in section 404.\n       Mediation process. The Director shall specify one or more \n     individuals to mediate a dispute, depending upon the \n     Director's view of what would be most beneficial in a \n     particular case. In selecting mediators, the Director is \n     required to consider individuals recommended by organizations \n     with expertise in mediating or arbitrating personnel matters. \n     The Director may also consider other individuals with \n     expertise in this field.\n       The purpose of the mediation is to resolve disputes at an \n     early stage in a manner that serves the interests of all \n     parties. To this end, it is important that both sides \n     participate in the process. Although parties cannot be forced \n     to mediate, it is expected that employees and employing \n     offices will take seriously this opportunity by carefully \n     assessing the claims of the other party and responding to \n     reasonable requests for information. The parties to mediation \n     under section 403(b) may include the Office, the covered \n     employee, and the employing office. Mediation may occur \n     through meetings with the parties separately or jointly for \n     the purpose of resolving the dispute.\n       Mediation period. Mediation shall occur for 30 days \n     beginning on the date the request for mediation is received. \n     The 30-day period may be extended at the joint request of the \n     covered employee and the employing office. The Office shall \n     in writing notify the parties to the mediation of the end of \n     the mediation period.\n       Independence of the mediation process. In order to protect \n     the integrity of the mediation process and ensure that \n     parties have confidence in it, no individual who conducts \n     mediation may conduct or aid in the hearing conducted under \n     section 405 with respect to the same matter. In addition, no \n     individual who participates as a mediator may testify about, \n     or produce records relating to, that mediation, either \n     voluntarily or by compulsion, in any proceeding under this \n     act or before any other investigative or adjudicative entity.\n\n                  Section 404--Election of Proceeding\n\n       Not later than 90 days after a covered employee receives \n     notice of the end of the period of mediation, but no sooner \n     than 30 days after receipt of such notification, such covered \n     employee may either (1) file a complaint with the Office in \n     accordance with section 405, or (2) file a civil action in \n     accordance with section 408 in the United States District \n     Court for the district in which the employee is employed or \n     for the District of Columbia.\n\n                   Section 405--Complaint and hearing\n\n       Complaint. An individual who has made a timely request for \n     counseling and mediation, has completed those processes, and \n     has not elected to file a complaint in Federal District Court \n     under section 408, may file a complaint with the Office. The \n     complaint must be filed no later than 90 days after receiving \n     the notice of the end of mediation, but no sooner than 30 \n     days after receiving such notice. The respondent to the \n     complaint shall be the employing office involved in the \n     violation or in which the violation is alleged to have \n     occurred, and about which mediation was conducted.\n       Appointment of a hearing officer. Upon the filing of a \n     complaint, the Director shall appoint a hearing officer to \n     the case. The hearing officer may dismiss any claim that the \n     hearing officer finds to be frivolous or that fails to state \n     a claim upon which relief can be granted. When the Executive \n     Director issues rules under section 303, he or she may \n     consider whether the procedures of title VII can be applied \n     to these proceedings. For instance, whether employing offices \n     can be awarded fees when the hearing officer determines that \n     the complaint is frivolous, groundless, and brought in bad \n     faith.\n       No member of the House of Representatives, Senator, officer \n     of either House, head of an employing office, member of the \n     board, or covered employee, may be appointed to be a hearing \n     officer.\n       The Executive Director is required to develop lists of \n     individuals experienced in arbitrating or adjudicating the \n     kinds of personnel and other matters for which hearings may \n     be conducted under this act. The lists can be composed of \n     categories of individuals with expertise in particular \n     fields, or possessing particular skills. In developing the \n     lists, the Executive Director shall consider candidates \n     recommended to the Director of the Federal Mediation and \n     Conciliation Service, the Administrative Conference of the \n     United States, or other organizations composed of individuals \n     with expertise in adjudicating or arbitrating the kinds of \n     matters for which hearings may be conducted under this act, \n     such as technical matters relating to occupational safety and \n     health.\n       In requiring the Executive Director to select individuals \n     randomly or by rotation from these lists, the act does \n     not prevent the Executive Director from hiring hearing \n     officers as full-time employees of the Office or from \n     selecting hearing officers on the basis of specialized \n     expertise required for a particular case.\n       Hearing. Unless a hearing officer dismisses a complaint on \n     a threshold legal issue, the hearing officer shall conduct a \n     hearing on the record. The hearing should be conducted as \n     expeditiously as practical, but in any event must be \n     commenced no later than 60 days after the filing of the \n     complaint. The hearing officer should, to the greatest extent \n     practical, conduct the hearing in accordance with the \n     principles of 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 554-57.\n       Discovery. The hearing officer may, in his or her \n     discretion, permit reasonable prehearing discovery. In \n     exercising this discretion, hearing officers should be \n     mindful of the requirement that the hearing is to be \n     conducted expeditiously and should seek to prevent \n     repetitious, overly burdensome, and unnecessary discovery.\n       Subpoenas. In general. At the request of a party, a hearing \n     officer may issue a subpoena for the attendance of witnesses \n     and the production of records. Hearing officers should not \n     issue subpoenas in blank, but rather only issue subpoenas for \n     specific witnesses or document requests. Ordinarily, \n     subpoenas should not be required for the production of \n     testimony or records in this process. Employees and employing \n     offices have a responsibility to respond to reasonable \n     discovery requests, without the requirement of compulsory \n     process.\n       Where appropriate, the attendance of witnesses and the \n     production or records may be required from any place within \n     the United States. Subpoenas shall be served in the manner \n     provided under rule 45(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil \n     Procedure.\n       Objections. If a person refuses, on the basis of relevance, \n     privilege, or other objection, to testify or produce records \n     in response to a question or to produce records in connection \n     with a proceeding before a hearing officer, the hearing \n     officer shall rule on the objection and, if the objection is \n     overruled, order compliance. The hearing officer shall, at \n     the request of the witness or any party, and may on the \n     hearing officer's own initiative, refer the ruling to the \n     board for review.\n       Enforcement. If a person fails to comply with a subpoena, \n     the Board may authorize the General Counsel to apply to an \n     appropriate United States District Court for an order \n     requiring that the person appear before the hearing officer \n     to testify and-or to produce records. The application shall \n     be made in the judicial district where the hearing is \n     conducted or where the person refusing to comply is found, \n     resides, or transacts business. Any failure to obey a lawful \n     order [[Page S630]] of the district court issued pursuant to \n     this section may be held by such court to be a civil \n     contempt thereof.\n       Service of process. In an action brought in district court \n     to enforce a subpoena under this section, or in a civil \n     contempt action under this section, process may be served in \n     any judicial district in which the individual or entity \n     refusing or failing to comply resides, transacts business, or \n     may be found, and subpoenas for witnesses who are required to \n     attend such proceedings may run into any other district.\n       Decision. Following any hearing under this section, the \n     hearing officer shall issue a written decision as \n     expeditiously as possible, but in no event more than 90 days \n     after the conclusion of the hearing. Each decision shall \n     state the issues raised in the complaint, describe the \n     evidence in the record, contain findings of fact and \n     conclusions of law, and contain a determination of whether a \n     violation has occurred, and, where appropriate, order \n     remedies authorized under title II of this act. The decision \n     shall be entered in the records of the Office as the final \n     decision of the hearing officer, and of the Office if such \n     decision is not appealed under section 406 to the Board. The \n     Office shall transmit a copy of the decision to each of the \n     parties.\n       Precedents. In conducting hearings and deciding cases, \n     hearing officers are to be guided by judicial decisions under \n     the statutes made applicable by section 102 and by Board \n     decisions under this act.\n\n                    Section 406--Appeal to the Board\n\n       In general. Any party aggrieved by the decision of a \n     hearing officer under section 405(g) may seek review by \n     filing a petition for review in the Office not later than 30 \n     days after notice by the Office of the entry in the Office \n     records of the final decision of the hearing officer.\n       Opportunity for argument. The Board shall provide the \n     parties with a reasonable opportunity to be heard on their \n     appeal through written submissions. In the discretion of the \n     Board, the parties may be heard through oral argument.\n       Standard of review. The standard of review to be applied by \n     the Board is the same standard that will be applied by the \n     Federal Circuit sitting in review of the Board's decisions. \n     The Board shall set aside a decision of a hearing officer \n     only if the Board determines that the decision is arbitrary, \n     capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not \n     consistent with the law, not made consistent with required \n     procedures, or unsupported by substantial evidence.\n       Record. In making determinations under this section, the \n     Board shall review the whole record, or those parts cited by \n     a party. The record on review shall include the record before \n     the hearing officer and the decision of the hearing \n     officer. Due account shall be taken of the rule of \n     prejudicial error.\n       Decision. The Board shall issue a written decision setting \n     forth the reasons for its decision. The decision may affirm, \n     reverse, or remand to the hearing officer for further \n     proceedings. A decision of the Board that does not require \n     further proceedings before a hearing officer shall be entered \n     in the records of the offices as a final decision.\n\n    Section 407--Judicial Review of Board Decisions and Enforcement\n\n    \n    \n       In general. The United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Federal Circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any \n     proceeding commenced by a petition of a party aggrieved by a \n     final decision of the Board under section 406(e) in cases \n     arising under part A of title II, a charging individual or \n     respondent before the Board who files a petition under \n     section 210(d)4, the general counsel or a respondent before \n     the Board who files a petition under section 215(c)(5), or \n     the general counsel or a respondent who files a petition \n     under section 220(c)(3). The same court shall also have \n     exclusive jurisdiction over any petition of the general \n     counsel filed in the name of the Office and at the direction \n     of the Board, to enforce a final decision under section \n     405(g) or 406(e) with respect to a violation of part A, B, C, \n     or D of title II.\n       Procedures. The rules governing the naming of respondents \n     reflects the different procedural postures under which \n     appeals may arise. The goal is to make sure that the Office \n     is not a respondent in a petition filed by its employee, the \n     general counsel. Any party before the Board may be named \n     respondent if not so named if the party so elects within 30 \n     days after service of the petition. The section also provides \n     for a right of intervention for participants before the Board \n     who were not made respondents.\n       Law applicable. Proceedings under this section shall be \n     governed by chapter 158 of title 28, of the United States \n     Code, which applies to appellate court review of agency \n     orders. In order to tailor chapter 158 to review of \n     congressional adjudicatory processes, some changes are made \n     in that chapter's requirements. Under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2344, \n     the clerk is to serve a copy of the petition on the general \n     counsel; the authority of the Attorney General under 28 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2348 shall not apply, and a petition for review \n     shall be filed in the Office not later than 90 days after the \n     entry in the Office of the final decision under section \n     406(e) for which review is sought. The Office shall be an \n     agency as that term is used in chapter 158 of title 28, and \n     any reference to the Attorney General shall be deemed to \n     refer to the general counsel. The Office shall be named as \n     the respondent in any such action in order to defend the \n     decision of the congressional process.\n       Standard of review. The Standard of review in proceedings \n     under this section is the standard that applies under the \n     administrative procedures act, namely, that the court shall \n     set aside a final decision of the Board only if it determines \n     that the decision was arbitrary, capricious, and abuse of \n     discretion, or otherwise not consistent with law; not made \n     consistent with required procedures; or unsupported by \n     substantial evidence.\n       Record. In making determinations under this section, the \n     court shall review the whole record, or those parts cited by \n     a party. The record on review shall include the record before \n     the hearing officer, the decision of the hearing officer, the \n     record before the Board, and the decision of the Board. Due \n     account shall be taken of the rule of procedural error.\n\n                       Section 408--Civil Action\n\n       Jurisdiction. An individual who has made a timely request \n     for counseling and mediation, has completed those procedures, \n     and has elected not to file a complaint with the Office, may \n     file a complaint in the United States district court for the \n     district in which the employee is employed or for the \n     District of Columbia. The time period for filing such a \n     complaint is set forth in section 404. The defendant shall be \n     the employing office alleged to have committed the violation, \n     or in which the violation is alleged to have occurred.\n       Jury trial. In a proceeding under this section, any party \n     may demand a jury trial in circumstances where a jury trial \n     would be available in an action against a private defendant \n     under the relevant law made applicable by this act. In any \n     case in which a violation of section 201 is alleged, the \n     court shall not inform the jury of the maximum amount of \n     compensatory damages available under section 201(b)(1) or \n     201(b)(3).\n\n              Section 409--Judicial Review of Regulations\n\n       This section provides that in any proceeding brought under \n     Section 407 or 408 in which the application of a regulation \n     issued under this act is at issue, the court may review the \n     validity of the regulation in accordance with the provisions \n     of subparagraphs (A) through (D) of section 706(2) of title \n     5, United States Code, except that with respect to \n     regulations approved by a joint resolution under section \n     304(c), only the provisions of section 706(2)(B) of title 5, \n     United States Code shall apply. This simply means that if the \n     regulation has the force of law, the regulation cannot be \n     challenged as being inconsistent with the underlying statute \n     applied to Congress under this bill, but may only be \n     challenged on constitutional grounds. All other regulations \n     could be challenged as not complying with the statutory \n     provisions forming the substantive and procedural basis for \n     issuing the regulation.\n       The only means for challenging the validity of \n     the regulation is through a proceeding brought under \n     section 407 or 408 of this act. Thus, there is no ability \n     to challenge a regulation when issued, as would be \n     available under the Administrative Procedures Act, but \n     only through collateral challenge. If the court determines \n     that the regulation is invalid, the court shall apply, to \n     the extent necessary and appropriate, the most relevant \n     substantive executive agency regulation promulgated to \n     implement the statutory provisions with respect to which \n     the invalid regulation was issued.\n       In determining whether to hold the regulations invalid, the \n     court should give equivalent deference to the Board as to an \n     executive branch agency with statutory authority and \n     expertise in issuing the regulation only if the regulation in \n     question is identical to a regulation of an executive branch \n     agency. To the extent the Board modifies the executive branch \n     agency in issuing the regulation whose validity is challenged \n     under this section, the court of appeals is to provide no \n     deference to the Board's reading of the underlying statute \n     when it issued the regulation unless the regulation was \n     adopted by joint resolution, or in connection with the \n     regulations issued under section 220(e).\n\n          Section 411--Effect of Failure To Issue Regulations\n\n       In any proceeding under section 405, 406, 407, or 408, \n     except a proceeding to enforce section 220 with respect to \n     offices listed under section 220(e)(2), if the Board has not \n     issued a regulation on a matter for which this act requires a \n     regulation to be issued, the hearing officer, board, or \n     court, as the case may be, shall apply, to the extent \n     necessary and appropriate, the most relevant substantive \n     executive agency regulation promulgated to implement the \n     statutory provision at issue in the proceeding.\n\n            Section 412--Expedited Review of Certain Appeals\n\n       This section authorizes a direct appeal to the Supreme \n     Court from any interlocutory or final judgment, decree, or \n     order of a court upon the constitutionality of any provision \n     of this act. In such a case, only the constitutional issue \n     would be before the court.\n\n                 Section 413--Privileges and Immunities\n\n       Under section 413, the authorization to bring judicial \n     proceedings under sections 407 and 408 shall not constitute a \n     waiver of sovereign immunity for any other purpose, or of the \n     privileges of any Member of Congress under the speech and \n     debate clause, or a waiver of wither the Senate or the House \n     of Representatives, including under article I, \n     [[Page S631]] section 5, clause 3, or under the rules of \n     either House relating to records and information within its \n     jurisdiction.\n\n                 Section 414--Settlement of Complaints\n\n       Under section 414, any settlement entered into by the \n     parties to a proceeding described in sections 210, 215, 220, \n     or 401 shall be in writing and not effective until approved \n     by the Executive Director. Nothing in this act shall affect \n     the power of the Senate and the House of Representatives, \n     respectively, to establish rules governing the process by \n     which a settlement may be entered into by such House or by \n     any employing office of such House.\n\n                         Section 415--Payments\n\n       Except as provided in subsection (c) of section 415, only \n     funds which are appropriated to an account of the Office of \n     the Treasury for the payment of awards and settlements may be \n     used for the payment of awards and settlements under this \n     act. A prevailing party may recover exclusive compensation \n     for his or her claims from such appropriated funds. Funds in \n     the account are not available for awards and settlements \n     involving the General Accounting Office, the Government \n     Printing Office, or the Library of Congress.\n       Awards and settlements may not be paid from the Claims and \n     Judgment Fund of the Treasury. Nothing in this act authorizes \n     the Board, the Office, the Director, or a hearing officer, \n     without further authorization, to direct that amounts paid \n     for settlements or awards be paid from official accounts of \n     the employing office. This act does not affect the power of \n     each House to determine how settlements or awards shall be \n     paid.\n       Subsection (b) provides that except as provided in \n     subsection (c), there are authorized appropriations of such \n     sums as may be necessary for administrative, personnel, and \n     similar expenses of employing offices which are needed to \n     comply with this act. These expenses could be such items as \n     funding management side labor negotiations under section 220. \n     These expenses are costs of adhering to the act, but not \n     costs of complying with adjudicative decisions remediating \n     violations, which are addressed in section 415.\n       Under subsection (c), funds to correct violations of the \n     Americans With Disabilities Act and the Occupational Safety \n     and Health Act may be paid only from funds appropriated to \n     the employing office or entity responsible for correcting \n     such violations.\n\n                      Section 416--Confidentiality\n\n       A principal distinction between the administrative dispute \n     resolution proceedings conducted under this act and the \n     proceedings in district court authorized under section 408 is \n     the confidentiality of the administrative proceedings. Under \n     this section, all counseling, mediation, and hearings are \n     confidential. The record developed in the hearing and the \n     decisions of hearing officers and the board may be made \n     public only for purposes of judicial review under section \n     407. This Requirement of confidentiality does not preclude \n     the Executive Director from disclosing to committees of \n     Congress information sought; however, such information \n     shall remain subject to the confidentiality requirements \n     of this section.\n       Final decisions entered under section 405(g) or 406(e) \n     shall be made public if it is in favor of the complaining \n     covered employee, or in favor of the charging party under \n     section 210, or if the decision reverses a decision of a \n     hearing officer which had been in favor of a covered employee \n     or a charging party. The Board may make public any other \n     decision at its discretion. Nothing in the act prohibits the \n     employing office from making public a final decision in its \n     favor.\n\n                   Title V--Miscellaneous Provisions\n\n               Section 501--Exercise of Rulemaking Power\n\n       This section provides that sections 204 and 401 and the \n     rules issued pursuant to them are an exercise of the \n     rulemaking power of the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate and shall be considered part of the rules of each \n     House. These rules shall supersede other rules of each House \n     only to the extent that they are inconsistent with them. The \n     House and the Senate each retain their constitutional rights \n     to change these rules (insofar as they relate to such House) \n     at any time, in the same manner, and to the same extent as \n     each House may change its other rules.\n\n       Section 502--Political Affiliation and Place of Residence\n\n       This section permits employing offices to consider the \n     party affiliation, domicile, or political compatibility with \n     the employing office of an employee as referred to in \n     subsection (b) of this section with respect to employment \n     decisions. The term employee here means an employee on the \n     staff of leadership offices, committees and subcommittees, \n     employees of the staff of a member, an officer of either \n     House or a congressional employee elected or appointed by the \n     House or Senate and applicant for these positions.\n\n Section 503--Nondiscrimiantion Rules of the House of Representatives \n                               and Senate\n\n       This section provides that the Select Committee on Ethics \n     of the Senate and the Committee on Standards of Official \n     Conduct of the House of Representatives retain full power, in \n     accordance with the authority provided to them by the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, with respect to the \n     discipline of members, officers, and employees for violating \n     rules of the Senate and the House of Representatives on \n     nondiscrimination in employment.\n\n            Section 504--Technical and Conforming Amendments\n\n       This section amends the Government Employee Rights Act so \n     that it remains in effect for certain Presidential appointees \n     and for certain State employees, and repeals the remaining \n     sections of the act as of the date this act takes effect.\n\n              Section 505--Judicial Branch Coverage Study\n\n       This section requires the judicial conference of the United \n     States to prepare a report by the Chief Justice to Congress \n     on the application to the judicial branch of the 11 laws made \n     applicable to Congress by this act. The report is to be \n     submitted by December 31, 1996, and shall include any \n     recommendations the Judicial Conference may have for \n     legislation to provide to employees of the judicial branch, \n     protections, and procedures under these laws, including \n     administrative and judicial relief, that are comparable to \n     that provided to congressional employees under this act.\n\n                    Section 506--Savings Provisions\n\n       This section provides a method for the transition from the \n     previous dispute resolution processes under which \n     congressional employees were covered to the process \n     established by this act. The purpose of this section is to \n     ensure that claims that are in the process of being resolved \n     are not extinguished, and that they will be adjudicated under \n     current law.\n\n                       Section 507--Severability\n\n       This section provides that if any provision of this act is \n     held to be invalid, the remainder of this act shall not be \n     affected.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I stated a few moments ago I hope that our \ncolleagues who are watching in their offices or staffs working in the \noffices will get interested Senators who have amendments to propose--\nand I would add that they are all on the Democratic side--let us get \nthem over here because we are going to be time limited on consideration \nof this bill as far as time for amendments. The majority leadership has \nindicated, as I understand it, a desire to close out this bill at 7 \no'clock tomorrow evening if at all possible.\n  Now, granted, considering that we also have our respective parity \ncaucuses tomorrow which takes us out of the Senate Chamber here from \nabout 12:30 to 2:15, we lose that time. It means that we are going to \nbe very hard pressed to consider all the amendments we have on the list \nby that time. So I would urge my colleagues to get their amendments \nover here and let us get debating on them and so we can get them all \nconsidered. I would hate to see anyone get closed out tomorrow night \nwith not enough time on the Senate floor to consider their amendments.\n  Mr. President, in the opening days of the 104th Congress I think we \ncan accomplish a reform that is long, long overdue. We can finally \neliminate the congressional double standard under which we have enacted \nlaws that apply to everyone but ourselves.\n  Now, by enacting laws for others and then exempting ourselves, we \nhave done great damage to the public perception of Congress.\n  When I go back home and make speeches in Ohio and open it up for \nquestions or you remark about the fact that you would like to see \nCongress covered by the same laws that cover everyone else in this \ncountry, laws that address individual concerns, organizational \nconcerns, Government concerns, and so on, but that we want to make \nthose same laws apply to them apply here on Capitol Hill where we have \nexempted ourselves for many years, I can tell you from personal \nexperience there is nothing guaranteed to get you a rousing ovation any \nfaster than bringing that up as something you want to correct. This has \nbeen true for a number of years.\n  We in Congress I sometimes think do not really understand the real \nimpact of these laws because we do not have to follow them here. And \nthat is an irritant to other people around the country.\n  Our efforts to apply the law on Capitol Hill go back many years. I \nstated in my opening statement the other day that back in 1978, just a \nfew years after I came to the Senate, I proposed a resolution to assure \nthat all Senate employees would be protected against employment \ndiscrimination. I referred then to Capitol Hill being the last \nplantation and incurred the ire of some of my colleagues for that \nremark at that time. The resolution did not pass. It is \n[[Page S632]] only in just the last few years that we have finally \nenacted some substantial legal protection for Senate employees. So we \nare not quite as bad off as we were back then in 1978. Our employees \nare now covered under the civil rights laws and certain other \nemployment laws, and they can take their cases to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals. But despite this progress, what we still have is a \nunacceptable. It is a patchwork quilt of coverage and exemptions here \non Capitol Hill. And it has not been easy to solve this problem.\n\n  As I have often said, we should apply the same laws to ourselves as \nwe apply to the private sector. But there is a difference here on \nCapitol Hill compared to businesses in the rest of the country. That \nis, we have the concerns of our Members--and they are legitimate \nconcerns--who believe that the Constitution requires us to preserve \nsubstantial independence of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives. That is not just because it is a personal preference \nor an ego matter with those particular Members. In the private sector \nthese laws are normally implemented by the executive branch and the \njudicial branch. But there are many Senators--and this is not the \nprerogative of one side or the other--there are many Senators, both \nDemocrats and Republicans, who have expressed genuine concern through \nthe years about politically motivated prosecutions that might result if \nwe ignore the principle of separation of powers as we apply these laws \nto the Congress.\n  I think everyone should understand that concern about separation of \npowers has probably been at the heart of the delay, of why legislation \nin this regard has not been considered more seriously through the \nyears. I think we have taken care of it in this bill. The separation of \npowers is very, very real. It is in the Constitution. When one branch \nof government gains ascendancy over another, or authority over another \nbranch of government, it is a very serious matter. Many of our Members \nthrough the years have been very concerned about this.\n  Last year, in a meeting with our then majority leader, Senator \nMitchell, he asked me to work on a bipartisan solution for this. In the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee we had as a starting place the very \nexcellent bill introduced by Senators Grassley and Lieberman. Then, \ntogether with those two Senators and other Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle, we worked hard to reach a solution. I think we succeeded \nwith this bill. We included even stronger applications of the laws to \nCongress and we also included the text of that constitutional \nindependence, that separation of powers that I just mentioned. Our \nlegislation won broad bipartisan support, but unfortunately it was \nblocked on the Senate floor in the closing days of the 103d Congress.\n  So I am particularly gratified that the Congressional Accountability \nAct of 1995 is modeled closely on that proposed legislation from last \nyear. Also, our new minority leader, Senator Daschle, introduced our \ncongressional accountability legislation from last year. He did that \nthe other day. But that is not the vehicle that we are on here today. \nThat proposed legislation by Senator Daschle included the gift ban and \nlobbying reform, which we dealt with to some extent on the floor the \nother day, as additional amendments to this bill that just covers \ncongressional coverage.\n  So, I am pleased our solution to congressional coverage was \nintroduced as a separate bill as part of Senator Daschle's \ncomprehensive congressional reform proposal. But regardless of that, we \nhave strong bipartisan support, I believe, for this bill.\n  Let me urge once again--I will break in the middle of my comments \nhere to urge any of my colleagues who have amendments to this bill to \ncome to the floor. Tomorrow we are going to be very short of time to \nconsider all of the amendments. I urge any of the staff or any of the \nSenators who are watching these proceedings in their offices to, if at \nall possible, get their amendments over here to the floor so we do not \nfind ourselves in a time shortage tomorrow afternoon, because it is my \nunderstanding the majority leader has indicated it is his intent to end \nconsideration of this bill by about 7 o'clock tomorrow evening.\n  Let me give a little more background on this legislation. Though \nCongress has taken strides in recent years to apply antidiscrimination \nand employee protection laws to its employees, there is a patchwork of \ncoverage that remains that allows certain exemptions to these laws and \npermits different applications to different employees. This has helped \ncreate the impression among many citizens that Congress exempts itself \nfrom the same employment and antidiscrimination laws that it applies to \nthe general public and to other entities of government.\n  There have been a number of statements. People have commented on the \nfact that on November 8 the people of this country sent a message they \ndid not want business as usual anymore. I think that was a generally \naccepted message that was received here on Capitol Hill. But there is \nanother aspect of this, too. We apply laws to the rest of the country \nand the citizens of this country in their places of employment or their \nbusinesses or their organizations and we say, in all fairness, here is \nwhat you have to do. Here is what the Federal Government says. Whether \nit is civil rights or whatever, we say this is the way it is going to \nbe because it is right for our people. Repeat, ``right for our \npeople.'' We base our legislation on that, what is right for our \npeople. Are our people out there being dealt with fairly by their \nemployers? By their Government? By their local governments? By whatever \nwe are passing legislation on here? But at the same time we say what is \nright for workers out there, what is right for employees out there, \nwhat is right for people working in communities, is not necessarily \nright for those working on Capitol Hill. So we do not cover them. We \nexempt them.\n  What kind of possible justification can there be for exempting what \nis right for everybody else in this country? Regardless of whether we \nare treating ourselves differently, is it right for our employees that \nthey have the same protections of employment rights? Of organizational \nrights? Of whatever other rights we insist on giving to everybody else \nin this country and yet we say we do not want to give our own people \nthat same coverage? We do not want to deal that fairly with our own \nemployees here on Capitol Hill? That is just flat not right.\n  So I bring this down not just to the perception of what other people \nsay around the country, or the perception that Congress exempts itself \nand so we are somehow above the law, but let us bring it down to this. \nIs it right for our people or is it not right for our people who work \nfor us right here on Capitol Hill to have the same protections that \neverybody else here in this country has? Is it right? To me that is the \nmost powerful argument for passing congressional coverage.\n  We can say the perceptions are out there that we are dealing \ndifferently and so the people do not like that--but is it right that \nour people here on Capitol Hill, the people who man the elevators and \nthe Government Printing Office and everything else around here that \ngoes to support congressional action--is it right that they get the \nsame protections as other people around this country? The answer to \nthat has to be that it is right. And that is the reason why I think we \nhave a lot of bipartisan support for this legislation.\n  Congress has responded in the last few years to the call for a \nuniform application of employment and antidiscrimination protections to \nour employees. We made some moves. A Bipartisan Task Force on Senate \nCoverage, which was established in 1992 in the 102d Congress, and the \nJoint Committee on the Organization of Congress, which was also created \nin 1992, both proposed recommendations for congressional compliance \nwith employment laws. Numerous witnesses before the joint committee and \nin hearings of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee expressed the \nsentiment that exemptions for congressional coverage had to end. The \ntime had finally come.\n  There were several significant pieces of legislation introduced in \nthe 103d Congress that drew from the work of the joint committee and \nthe Task Force on Senate Coverage. I had a bill in. It was a Glenn \nsubstitute to H.R. 4822, which followed action taken by the Senate \nRules Committee on a substitute version of S. 1824, which contained \nsections on congressional coverage. There was other action by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee on S. [[Page S633]] 2071, which is \nsubstantially similar to the substitute to H.R. 4822 plus overwhelming \npassage by the House of its version of H.R. 4822.\n  Senator Mitchell sought unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of my substitute to H.R. 4822, as modified by a \nmanagers' amendment, on October 6, 1994. But there was objection to \nproceeding. Senator Lott objected to the motion to move to \nconsideration of the bill and this Republican objection prevented any \nfurther consideration of the measure in the 103d Congress.\n  S. 2, the Congressional Accountability Act, is substantially--almost \nidentical. It is very similar to the managers' amendment to the \nsubstitute to H.R. 4822 that was brought before the Senate at the end \nof the 103d Congress, as well as the congressional coverage language \nthat is part of the current leadership congressional reform package, \nwhich was S. 10, that we have already dealt with a couple of days ago.\n  Just a little short summary statement of what is provided in the \nlegislation today. S. 2, the Congressional Accountability Act, would \napply a number of Federal workplace safety and labor laws to the \noperations of Congress. The bill also provides a new administrative \nprocess for handling complaints and violations of these laws. I had not \nmentioned that in any detail before, but that is a very key part of \nthis legislation and addresses the difficulties that Members have had \ndealing with this separation of powers through all of these years, \nwhich has been the basic reason why legislation has been held up.\n  I do not quarrel with those concerns. They are very real concerns. In \nother words, if you had an administration so inclined and they wished \nto go into a super enforcement of OSHA or clean air or whatever the \nbill was, and you wish to apply some sanctions to Congress in return \nfor getting something else that a President wanted sometime, would they \ndo that? I think those of us who have been around here for a while have \nseen some pretty politically motivated executive branch officials who \njust might take such action against the legislative branch. I do not \nthink that would be commonplace, but should we even set up in law the \npossibility that that might happen?\n  So the second part of what I just read, as a summary: The bill also \nprovides a new administrative process for handling complaints and \nviolations of these laws, which is a key toward dealing with this \nproblem of separation of powers. We set up a separate process by which \npeople can bring complaints about how they are being dealt with. That \nis a very key part of this legislation, and something that is different \nfrom most of the proposals that occurred back through all of these \nyears. I may run through some of the major provisions.\n  First, in the application of workplace protection and \nantidiscrimination laws, S. 2 would apply to several Federal laws \nregarding employment and the operation of legislative branch offices \nand provide an administrative process for handling complaints and \nviolations--provide an administrative process for handling complaints \nand violations--a key part of this legislation.\n  The following laws would be applied to legislative branch employees. \nFirst, under antidiscrimination laws, title VII of the Civil Rights Act \nof 1964 would apply; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, \ntitle I; Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990; Rehabilitation Act of \n1973; and under public services and accommodations under Americans with \nDisabilities Act, title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n1990, which prohibits discrimination in Government services provided to \nthe public; and title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n1990.\n  Workplace protection laws are very important. Why should we exempt \nour people in those areas of workplace protection laws? Are we a \nfactory? No, we are not. But should we protect those people here on \nCapitol Hill who work and have some concerns about their safety? \nWorkplace protection laws and fair labor standards: Should they be \nprotected? How can we say that they should not be protected? So under \nworkplace protection laws, we have the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n1938, concerning the minimum wage, equal pay, maximum hours, and \nprotection against retaliation, regulations which will be promulgated \nto track the executive branch regulations.\n  These regulations will take into account those employees who work \nirregular schedules or whose schedules depend directly on the Senate \nwhich, as we all know, is an irregularly scheduled body at best. Also, \nunder workplace protection laws; OSHA, the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Act of 1970; the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993; the \nEmployee Polygraph Protection Act; and Worker Adjustment and Retraining \nAct, which requires a 60-day notice of office closings or mass \nlayoffs--you might say we are not a factory, that we do not have to \ngive 60-day notice. But we do have people working for us here on \nCapitol Hill, such as the Government Printing Office and some others, \nthat should have the same protections that people out there in industry \nhave because they are performing at least a semi-industrialized \nfunction for us here on Capitol Hill.\n  The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, Family and Medical \nLeave Act--I read these before--Employee Polygraph Protection Act, \nWorker Adjustment and Retraining Act, the 60-day notice that I just \nmentioned; and another one, the Veterans Re-Employment Act, which \ngrants veterans the right to return to their previous employment with \ncertain qualifications if reactivated or if they are drafted.\n  Under labor-management relations, the Federal Service Labor-\nManagement Relations Statute of 1978, which applies to personal staff, \ncommittees, or other political offices, would be deferred unless rules \nare issued by the new Office of Compliance. We expect that Office of \nCompliance to get into operation just as quickly as possible after this \nlegislation is passed.\n  Who are covered employees? The compliance provisions for the \npreceding laws would apply to staff and employees of the House, of the \nSenate, the Architect of the Capitol, the Congressional Budget Office, \nthe Office of Technology Assessment, and the newly created Office of \nCompliance itself. Congressional instrumentalities, as they are called \nunder that title--instrumentalities are such organizations as the \nGeneral Accounting Office, the Library of Congress, and the Government \nPrinting Office--will be covered under some of these laws. But a study \nwill be ordered to discern current application of these laws to the \ninstrumentalities and to recommend ways to improve procedures.\n  This was necessary, at least in part, because some of these \ninstrumentalities had already taken action some years ago to make some \nof these laws apply to their own operations. So the General Accounting \nOffice has taken certain actions that the Library of Congress or the \nGovernment Printing Office has not taken. And so, rather than just \nsaying we set down in concrete mandates for all of these different \norganizations, we felt it was better to make a transition period where \nwe would have a study to discern current application of these laws to \nthe instrumentalities and to recommend ways to improve procedures.\n  What are the protections and the procedures for which people might \nseek remedy? The bill provides the following five- step process, which \nis similar to some current Senate procedures for employees with claims \nof violations of the Civil Rights and Americans with Disabilities Act \nand employment discrimination laws, for violation of family and medical \nleave protections, for violations of fair labor standards, violations \nof laws regarding polygraph protection, plant closing, and veterans \nreemployment violations. If there are concerns in those areas and an \nindividual or individuals wish to file a complaint, they would go \nthrough a several-step procedure.\n  The first step will be they would be required to go through \ncounseling, which could last up to 30 days and must be requested within \na 6-month statute of limitations.\n  If that does not take care of things, if you cannot counsel people \nout of this into an acceptable solution, then you go into step two, \nwhich is a mediation service. That, too, can last for 30 days, and must \nbe pursued within 15 days.\n  Let us say that the aggrieved party, or the person who feels they \nhave been aggrieved, feels at that point they have not been dealt with \nfairly. They have [[Page S634]] been through counseling and mediation. \nStep No. 3 they could take, if the claim cannot be resolved, is then a \nformal complaint and trial before an administrative hearing officer. \nThat would be the next step.\n  At that point, if the person still says, ``I don't feel I've gotten \njustice here, so I want to go ahead with this thing,'' there would be \nanother step. After the hearing, any aggrieved party may still appeal \nto the Office of Compliance's board of directors.\n  So at that point we are up to a four-step process--counseling, \nmediation, and the administrative hearing officer can still request \nthat this go before the board, the Office of Compliance's board of \ndirectors. Even at that point, after all these four steps, if a person \nfeels, no, I feel I still have not received my due or have not received \na fair shake, then they can take it outside to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for judicial review.\n  I think that gives the employees here on Capitol Hill tremendously \nincreased protection. The bill would allow employees to bring suit in \nFederal district court. Let me explain this a little bit. I mentioned \nthat five-step process. Another option is that if the employee did not \nwish to go through that whole process of counseling, mediation, the \nhearing officer, the board, and so on, the person could say, OK, after \nthat mediation step--just the mediation step now, counseling and \nmediation--at that point the aggrieved employee could start up a \nseparate track and go directly outside to the U.S. Federal district \ncourt, rather than proceeding to an administrative hearing. The \ndistrict court remedy would include the right to a jury trial. The \noption to seek district court redress could occur only after an \nemployee went through the counseling and mediation process. That is \nrequired, whichever track you want to go through--the counseling and \nmediation process.\n  Then you can decide whether you want to go up the first track I went \nthrough, the five-step process. Or you might say: I want to go outside, \nI am going directly to district court. That is in there because that is \nwhat any businessman or organization across this country can do. If \nthey have a problem and they do not get satisfaction from the agency or \nthe Government entity involved, they could go directly to district \ncourt and file suit. So we give our own employees here the right to do \nthe same thing if they feel they are not being dealt with fairly or \nthey prefer not to go up that more lengthy in-house procedure before \nthey could, as a last step, go to the U.S. Court of Appeals. So there \nis a dual track they can go through, and it is up to whoever would be \nfiling the charge.\n  With respect to discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, \nor national origin, remedies include reinstatement, back pay, \nattorneys' fees, and even other compensatory damages. That matches what \nhappens out in the world, the business world or organization world, out \nthere across the country.\n  For claims under the ADA, title II and title III relating to \ndiscrimination in Government services, we provide the following steps: \nA member of the public may submit a charge to the general counsel of \nthis Office of Compliance. The general counsel could call for \nmediation. The general counsel may file a complaint, which would go \nbefore a hearing officer for a decision. There could be an appeal to \nthe board and, once again, there could be an appeal to the U.S. Court \nof Appeals.\n  For violations of OSHA, the bill provides the following procedures: \nEmployees would make a written request to the general counsel, again, \nto conduct an inspection. The general counsel will not only conduct the \ninspection but will also inspect all facilities at least once each \nCongress as a normal course of events. We may not have the expertise to \ndo that, so they would most likely use detailees from the Labor \nDepartment, who are familiar with OSHA regulations and in administering \nOSHA law out in the civil sector. They could give advice in this area \nand even conduct inspections at the request of the general counsel.\n  Pursuant to that, citations may be issued by the general counsel and \ndisputes regarding citations could be referred to a hearing officer \nonce again.\n  Appeal of hearing officer decisions could go to the board. The board \nmay also approve requests for temporary variances. And, finally, an \nappellate court review of decisions of the board would be in order.\n  There would be a 2-year phase-in period for the OSHA procedures, to \nallow inspection and corrective action. A survey also would be \nconducted to identify problems and to prepare for unforeseen budget \nimpact. Some of these corrective actions might be expensive. So you \ncannot just say that we will put something in without considering the \nbudget impact here on Capitol Hill. Penalties would not apply under the \nOSHA provisions, because this would result only in shifting among \naccounts in the Treasury. In other words, you are going to find \nsomebody on Capitol Hill on OSHA violations and the money would go from \nthere to Treasury, transferring it from one pocket to the other in the \nTreasury accounts.\n  The following process applies to violations of collective bargaining \nlaw. First, petitions will be considered by the board and could be \nreferred by the board to a hearing officer. Charges of violations would \nbe submitted to the general counsel. Once again, they will investigate \nand may file a complaint. The complaint would be referred to a hearing \nofficer for a decision, subject to appeal to the board. Negotiation \nimpasses would be submitted then to mediators, and next a court of \nappeals review of board decisions will be available, except where \nappellate review is not allowed under the Federal service labor-\nmanagement relations statute. ``Employees who are employed in a bona \nfide executive, administrative, or professional capacity'' are not \ncovered by the minimum wage and maximum hours provision. Interns are \nalso exempted. In addition, compensatory time may not be offered in \nlieu of overtime. That does not apply to those I just mentioned--\nexecutive, administrative, or professional capacity people. Otherwise, \nwe have to abide by the same laws that apply to everybody else across \nthis country.\n  Otherwise, remedies for violations of rights of all other employees \nunder the FLSA will include unpaid minimum or overtime wages, \nliquidated damages, attorneys' fees and costs.\n  Let me briefly address the Office of Compliance, because they have a \ngreat deal of authority and would be a very important part of this \nwhole operation. S. 2 will establish an independent, nonpartisan Office \nof Compliance to implement and oversee the application of \nantidiscrimination worker protection laws. Under rulemaking, the office \nwill promulgate rules to implement these statutes. In other words, \nnormally we pass legislation here on the Hill, and it goes over into a \nbranch or agency of Government, and that branch or agency then writes \nthe rules and regulations that apply all across the country. That has \nbeen one of the hangups, because of this separation of powers through \nall these years. So we basically gave that authority for rulemaking to \nthis Office of Compliance. The office will promulgate rules to \nimplement the statutes. Congress may approve and change, by joint \nresolution, rules issued by the office. But if Congress fails to \napprove rules by the effective date within the legislation, then \napplicable executive branch rules would be applied.\n  Rules would be issued in three separate sets of regulations: One, \nthose that apply to the House of Representatives; two, those that apply \nto the Senate; and, three, those that apply to joint offices and the \ninstrumentalities of the Congress that I mentioned a moment ago. Rules \nfor each Chamber would be subject to approval by that body. Rules for \nthe Senate would be approved by the Senate. Rules for the House would \nbe approved by the House. I would presume that most of those will be \nthe same. I do not think there would be much difference from one body \nto the other, or to grant the force and effective law by joint \nresolution of the Congress, if that was required.\n  Rules for joint offices and instrumentalities would be subject to \napproval by concurrent resolution. This Office of Compliance will be a \nvery important office for Capitol Hill. It will be something new and \ndifferent.\n  Membership of this Office of Compliance: The office will be headed by \na five-member board that will be appointed to fixed, staggered terms of \noffice. The board will be appointed jointly by the Senate majority \nleader, the [[Page S635]] Senate minority leader, the Speaker of the \nHouse, and the House minority leader. Membership may not include \nlobbyists, Members, or staff except for Compliance Office employees. \nIts chair will be chosen by the four appointing authorities from within \nthe membership of the board.\n  Under settlement and award reserves: Payment for awards of House and \nSenate employees will be made in a new single contingent appropriation \naccount. All settlements and judgments must be paid from funds \nappropriated to the legislative branch, not from a Government-wide \njudgment account. In other words, it will be solely administered here \non Capitol Hill. Once again, concern about the separation of powers \ndictates that. There will be no personal liability on the part of \nMembers.\n  Mr. President, that is a thumbnail sketch in some detail here, a \nrundown of what this bill provides and how it will be administered and \nhow it would take care of some of these problems of separation of \npowers that have plagued consideration of this bill for all these \nyears.\n  So, Mr. President, I would only close by saying we do not plan to \nmake more lengthy speeches this afternoon. We have gone through some of \nthese things before. I thought it was worthwhile going through them \nagain, since we have gone through the weekend.\n  But I urge my colleagues in their offices, or their staffs, if you \nhave an amendment, let us get it over to the floor because the majority \nleader has indicated a desire to have action wound up on this, \nterminated by Tuesday evening, by tomorrow evening, at around 7 \no'clock.\n  And I say to my Democratic colleagues, we are the ones that have the \nproposed amendments to this bill. There are none pending on the \nRepublican side. They were able to convince all their Members to put \noff their concerns to a later time. That does not mean that I am \njoining them in that. I think we have every right on the floor here to \naddress whatever concerns Members have and whatever amendments they \nwish to put on this bill.\n  I can understand the majority's desire that there be no amendments to \nthe bill, but it has been a rare occasion in the history of the Senate \nwhen that has occurred.\n  But I urge my colleagues on the Democratic side who still have \namendments on this to get over here and get them presented, because we \nare going to fast run out of time tomorrow. If we do not consider some \nof these this afternoon, then we have a limited time tomorrow morning. \nWe go out for our respective party conferences tomorrow between 12:30 \nand 2:15, as is our custom. So that means we have a considerable block \nof time taken out right in the middle of the day and we will be coming \nback on the floor tomorrow with just a little bit of time left until we \nreach 7 o'clock tomorrow night. If everyone waits until that time to \nbring their amendments over, I am afraid some of them will get left out \nbefore we wrap this thing up tomorrow night. So I urge my colleagues to \nget their amendments over here to the floor so that they can have them \nconsidered today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been noted. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, after careful consideration of the issues involved, I \nhave determined that I must vote against the Congressional \nAccountability Act of 1995. I do not expect to persuade others, and \nthere may be no others who will vote against this act. I may be alone.\n  There should be no mistake about my intentions. I support the goal of \nthis legislation. It is the means for implementing the provisions in \nthe bill to which I largely object. I support holding all Senators \naccountable for the treatment of their employees. We should and we must \nevaluate our employees' job performance on the basis of merit, not with \nrespect to race or gender or age or national origin or religion or \ndisability. We should and we must pay our employees fair wages for the \nwork they do. We should and we must provide our employees with a safe \nenvironment in which to work. I have been in Congress now going on my \n43d year. I have always held to these principles. We should and we must \naccommodate the disabled and allow employees to take leave when they \nare blessed with the birth of a child or a family member becomes \nseriously ill.\n  Over the past several years the Senate has made considerable progress \nin this area. Most of the employment laws addressed in the bill before \nus already apply to the Senate: discrimination laws apply, the \nRehabilitation Act applies, the Family and Medical Leave Act applies, \nthe Americans With Disabilities Act applies. I believe I am correct in \nall of this. This is probably one of the best kept secrets around here \nand across the country. It will no doubt come as a surprise to the \nmedia so many of whom seem much more interested in our institutional \nfailings than in our many achievements.\n  Furthermore, contrary to popular misimpression, Members are subject \nto the laws they make in their capacities as private citizens. Members \nwho own businesses or act in any private capacity, must comply with all \nFederal, State, and local laws applicable to any business owner or \ncitizen. In addition, Members are subject to many laws not applicable \nto other citizens or private businesses, such as public financial \ndisclosure, including reporting assets and liabilities of themselves, \ntheir spouses, and their dependent children. In fact, the requirements \nand constraints under which Members of Congress live would be \nconsidered a outrageous intrusion on individual liberty and privacy in \nmost other contexts. I have no quarrel with any of those requirements.\n  This bill raises serious constitutional issues with respect to the \nstatus and functions of the Senate and of individual Senators.\n  The bill leaves unresolved a whole array of practical and \nadministrative issues that inevitably will impinge on the Senate's \ncapacity to perform its legislative and other functions. It delegates \nthese issues to a board having a broad and, in fact, unique combination \nof executive, legislative, and judicial authority encompassing a large \nnumber of legal issues in a way that is unprecedented in the Federal \nGovernment. As a result, we have in this bill an unknown and unknowable \npotential for serious dislocation and disruption of the Senate's \nconstitutionally ordained role.\n  Now, Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to explain these \nproblems in greater detail.\n\n\n                         Constitutional Issues\n\n                         The Bicameral Problem\n\n  This legislation establishes a bicameral office and a bicameral board \nwith plenary powers over all of the employment laws made applicable to \nthe Congress and to other legislative branch entities. This structure, \nI believe, is fundamentally inconsistent with the bicameral nature of \nthe Congress ordained in the Constitution. Proponents will be quick to \npoint out that the legislation provides for separate sets of rules for \nthe House, Senate, and the remainder of the legislative branch. But \nthis is no real solution to the basic problem. If this legislation is \nenacted, we will have a single bureaucracy making policy for the entire \nlegislative branch, however that policy may be packaged.\n  The Constitution indisputably establishes a bicameral legislature. \nThe Framers intended to create two separate and independent Houses of \nthe Congress as integral components of their overall plan of shared and \ndivided power. The Senate and House, by design and precedent, have \nunique and distinct roles within the constitutional structure. The \ndischarge of the Senate's unique responsibilities requires \nindependence. The intent of the Framers in this regard is obvious in \nthe plain words of the Constitution.\n  Article I, Section 5 of our Constitution provides that each House may \ndetermine the rules of its proceedings. Two principles are expressed in \nthis provision. First, each House is accorded the constitutional right \nof self-governance with respect to its internal operations. Second, \nneither House has the authority to govern the other [[Page S636]] House \nor to determine the rules of the other House. The bill before the \nSenate today is an affront to those constitutional principles. If this \nbill is enacted, the Senate's constitutional power of self-governance \nwill be seriously impaired. And the Senate's protection from \ninterference by the House of Representatives will begin to erode. \nConversely, the same is true with respect to the House. This is a \nslippery path we must not travel.\n\n\n                          Separation of Powers\n\n  Articles I, II, and III of the Constitution establish a government \nconsisting of three independent branches. The Framers of the \nConstitution separated the judicial, executive, and legislative \nfunctions for the purpose of limiting the power of any one branch, \nwhile providing distinct duties to each branch. This arrangement of \ndistinct branches, with different but interdependent powers, is the \nkeystone of the constitutional system for checking arbitrary power. As \nThe Federalist, No. 48, states, no branch of government may ``possess, \ndirectly or indirectly, an overruling influence over the others, in the \nadministration of their powers.'' This constitutional principle is \ntrampled in the bill before the Senate today. It permits the judicial \nbranch to intrude on and thereby directly interfere with the Senate's \nadministration of its powers. We should not so lightly allow the \nerosion of the very concepts that are at the core of our Constitution.\n  The last judicial statement to address this issue directly, firmly \nholds against diluting the principle of Separation of Powers. In 1986, \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held \nthat Members of Congress had absolute immunity under the speech and \ndebate clause for personnel decisions concerning positions of \nemployment relating to the legislative process. In Browning v. Clerk, \nU.S. House of Representatives, the court stated:\n\n       The speech and debate clause is intended to protect the \n     integrity of the legislative process by restraining the \n     judiciary and the executive from questioning legislative \n     actions. Without this protection, legislators would be both \n     inhibited in and distracted from the performance of their \n     constitutional duties. Where the duties of the employees \n     implicate speech or debate, so will personnel actions \n     respecting that employee.\n\n  This is not the first time the Senate has been down this path. In \n1985, we passed the Gramm-Rudman bill; our intentions were good, but \nour means were faulty. Like the bill before this body, the Gramm-Rudman \nbill failed to respect the constitutional principle of Separation of \nPowers. It delegated executive powers to a lesser legislative entity \nand it retained the Senate's ability to remove an executive officer. \nBut our error in passing that law was soon rectified. In 1986, 1 year \nafter Gramm-Rudman was enacted, the Supreme Court declared it to be \nunconstitutional. If enacted, this bill, which I think is similarly \nflawed, may be likely declared unconstitutional, but only after the \nSenate has expended considerable sums establishing the bicameral Board \nand eliminating the current Senate Fair Employment Office.\n  Let me explain more specifically how this bill permits unprecedented \njudicial intrusion into the Senate's affairs. Under this bill, a Senate \nor other congressional employee need not use the dispute resolution and \nenforcement procedure provided through this new Office of Congressional \nCompliance. Instead, he or she may file a lawsuit directly against a \nMember's office in Federal court in the district in which the employee \nworks. In the course of pretrial discovery, a Federal judge could order \na Senate employing office to produce documents and other information in \nthe possession of the employing office. The employee is entitled to a \njury trial. If the court finds in favor of the employee, it could order \nthe Senate office to submit periodic reports to the court to satisfy it \nthat the problems have been eliminated. The court also could appoint an \nindividual to inspect the Senate offices and to interview Senate \nemployees to satisfy the court that no employment problems reoccur. I \nsubmit that this level of intrusion by the judicial branch into the \naffairs of the legislative branch violates the constitutional doctrine \nof Separation of Powers, and it impermissibly intrudes on the Senate's \nconstitutional power of self-governance.\n  The potential for political mischief this provision creates should be \nobvious. Political opponents and possible challengers with law degrees \nwill be lining up to offer their services as counsel for plaintiffs in \nsuch cases.\n  Moreover, I suggest that this system eventually will lead to a \nconstitutional impasse. It will be only a matter of time before a court \nissues an order that intimately intrudes on the Senate's powers. At \nthis point, the Senate may very well refuse to comply. Such an impasse \nwill be unresolvable. The Supreme Court may order the Senate to comply, \nbut it is within the constitutional powers of the Senate to refuse. \nWhat is the compelling reason for passing a law that invites such a \nconstitutional showdown, particularly when we have a workable system in \nplace?\n\n\n                           power of the board\n\n  I have other concerns about this bill. It grants unprecedented \nplenary powers to a bicameral board. The Board will be the equivalent \nof the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Labor Department, \nthe Federal Labor Relations Authority, the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration, and other Federal agencies with enforcement \npowers. It will have the authority to submit legislation, to interpret \nlaws, to enforce the laws against the Senate, and against the offices \nof Senators. Never has this body granted so much authority over its \noperations and powers to an outside entity.\n\n\n                 Administrative and practical problems\n\n                         Collective bargaining\n\n  Mr. President, this bill, as I understand it, delegated to the Office \nand the Board the power to decide a whole range of very complicated and \npotentially highly political questions with respect to the application \nof these statutes in particular circumstances in the Senate. Let me \njust give you a few examples of what we are giving this Board and its \nassociated bureaucracy the authority to do.\n  The bill extends the rights and protections of the Federal Service \nLabor Management Relations Act to the Congress. This is the law that \nprovides for collective bargaining in the executive branch of the \nFederal Government. It should be noted that this statute is \nsubstantially different from the National Labor Relations Act, under \nwhich private sector employees collectively bargain and have the right \nto strike. When Congress applied collective bargaining laws to the \nexecutive branch, Congress recognized the distinctive character of that \nbranch of the Federal Government and its functions. Thus, Federal \nemployees do not have the right to strike. Nor can unions representing \nFederal employees bargain about wages. I would submit that the same \nconcern for the special role and function of the Congress should \nwarrant such full and careful consideration as well. Certainly we \nshould not assume in a simpleminded way that the Congress is just like \nthe executive branch or any other institution. But such a measured \napproach is not taken by this bill, in my judgment.\n\n\n                     unfair labor practice examples\n\n  Let me give some concrete examples of the kinds of policies that will \nbe made by this Board in the area of collective bargaining. The Board \nwill determine what an unfair labor practice is. And what is an unfair \nlabor practice? Under the Federal Labor Relations Act and annotated \ncase law, an unfair labor practice would include the following: Failure \nto bargain with the union over the effects of layoffs, moving offices \nfrom one location to another, reassigning duties of employees, hours of \nwork and break time. Do not be fooled by the argument that most Senate \nemployees will be exempt from these requirements. That is not obvious \non its face. In fact, the way this law has been construed in the \nexecutive branch, the right to organize and bargain collectively covers \nall nonsupervisory employees with minor exceptions. Senators might ask \nthemselves whether their legislative assistants are supervisory \nemployees by any credible standard. How may we suppose the Board will \ndecide?\n  The Board also will define the scope of appropriate bargaining units. \nThe questions here are even more significant from a institutional \nperspective:\n  First, will the bargaining unit be confined to a single Senate \noffice?\n  Second, will it encompass all Senate offices? [[Page S637]] \n  Third, will it encompass all Senate and House offices?\n  Fourth, will it include all employees with similar jobs in the \nSenate, in both Houses, or throughout the legislative branch?\n  On all of these questions, the legislation is silent other than to \nsay that the Board will make these decisions. Depending on the outcome, \nit could well be that we will have unions representing all legislative \nassistants and other classes of employees in the Senate--or in the \nSenate and House.\n  Remember, to be recognized as a representative of the bargaining \nunit, the labor organization only has to win a majority of the votes. \nThat means that if a majority of the legislative assistants in the \nSenate or in the House or in both Houses of Congress vote to have a \nunion, then that union is the sole bargaining authority for all \nlegislative assistants in the Senate or in the House or in both Houses \nof Congress. Senators will no longer have the ability to structure and \nmanage their staffs consistent with the unique needs of the States \nwhich they represent without first consulting with union \nrepresentatives. And who will bargain on behalf of management? \nIndividual Senators? The Senate leadership? The joint congressional \nleadership? The Board will decide.\n\n\n                   job classification and definition\n\n  The Board and its bureaucracy also will serve, in effect, as the Wage \nand Hour Division of the Department of Labor. In that capacity, it will \ndecide the following kinds of issues:\n  First, which employees must be paid time-and-a-half for overtime;\n  Second, what kinds of record keeping must offices maintain;\n  Third, whether or not the Board and its bureaucracy has the right to \ninspect detailed payroll records;\n  Fourth, what positions are comparable for purposes of the Equal Pay \nAct? Are the tasks performed by a legislative assistant who works for a \nrural Congressman the same as for a legislative assistant who works for \na Senator from the most populous State, for example?\n  These are important decisions which go to the heart of a Senator's \nability to represent those who sent him to the Senate and should not be \nleft to the unbridled discretion of an unelected and largely \nunaccountable Board and its bureaucracy.\n\n\n                             funding issues\n\n  And finally, Mr. President, there is the issue of cost. It is argued \nthat a bicameral board and bureaucracy will somehow be more efficient \nand cost-effective. I frankly believe that such optimism is based on \nlittle more than a pious hope. If our experience with Government \norganizations shows us anything, it is that they tend to expand and to \ncost more than what is originally estimated. I have not the slightest \ndoubt that the cost of this new bureaucracy, when all is said and done, \nwill far exceed the expenses of operating the Senate Office of Fair \nEmployment Practices. The annual operating cost of the Office of Senate \nFair Employment Practices is approximately $800,000. The bureaucracy \nenvisioned in this bill will inevitably be several times as large and \ncorrespondingly more expensive to the taxpayers. For example, section \n302 of the bill empowers the Board to appoint an executive director; \ntwo deputy executive directors; a general counsel; as many additional \nattorneys as may be necessary to enable the general counsel to perform \nhis duties; such other additional staff, including hearing officers as \nmay be necessary; and, the executive director may procure the temporary \nor intermittent services of consultants.\n\n  But even if costs were not an issue, even if for the purposes of \nargument one assumes that this office would achieve administrative \nefficiency, there is a larger question. At what point do we bend to the \npolitical demagoguery of the day and at what price does the Senate \nsurrender its constitutional right of self-governance and its \nindependence from the executive and judicial branches and from the \nHouse of Representatives?\n  One final point about funding, Mr. President. Under this legislation, \nthe director of this new bicameral bureaucracy can hire as many staff, \nconsultants, and inspectors as he wants. Elected representatives, both \nMembers of the House and Senators, will be without authority to review, \ncontrol, modify, or change any of these financial arrangements entered \ninto on the sole authority of the director.\n  It is highly irregular to empower the head of a new agency to create \nits organization and establish its budget without specific \nauthorization and appropriation. Under section 305, one will find the \nfollowing language:\n\n       Until sums are first appropriated pursuant to the preceding \n     sentence, but for a period not exceeding 12 months following \n     the date of the enactment of this Act--\n       (1) one-half of the expenses of the Office shall be paid \n     from funds appropriated for allowances and expenses of the \n     House of Representatives, and\n       (2) one-half of the expenses of the Office shall be paid \n     from funds appropriated for allowances and expenses of the \n     Senate, upon vouchers approved by the Executive Director.\n\n  The Appropriations Committee will thus be faced with a staff which is \nalready in place, with a salary structure that has already been \ndetermined, with expenses already obligated and a very difficult \npolitical situation.\n  This blank check on the Treasury of the United States is something, \nMr. President, that no member of the Appropriations Committee and, \nindeed, no Member of the Senate should condone. The American people \nshould understand that they are the ones who will be paying the bills \nfor this new bureaucracy; for paying time-and-a-half to congressional \nemployees; and for hiring all of these new attorneys, hearing officers, \nand consultants. Here is another example of the rhetoric of the day not \nmatching the actions of Senators. The rhetoric is--Let us make Congress \nlive by the laws it passes for everyone else. The action being taken \nwill result in costing American taxpayers millions of dollars and the \ncreation of a brand new bureaucracy.\n  The exemption from some laws has facilitated the Member's ability to \nserve his constituents and to do the business of the Nation. The Hill \nis not a 9-to-5 operation. The Nation's business cannot be confined to \nnormal business hours. Constituent problems do not always occur \nconveniently within the confines of a normal business day. In order to \nprovide maximum service to our Nation and to the people we represent, \nwe ask our staffs to work long and arduous hours, and we ask them to \nview their work as public service. Surely this ability to serve will be \nsomewhat compromised if we apply certain of these laws to employees of \nthe Senate and the House. Certainly the cost of providing present \nservices will go up under the requirement that we must pay overtime. \nEvery year we hear complaints about the cost of the legislative branch, \nand we have repeated efforts to cut the budget of the legislative \nbranch.\n\n  I wonder what the folks at the town meetings would say if after the \ncheering stopped, a Senator would explain that bringing the Hill into \ncompliance with certain laws would mean lessened services to the \ntaxpayer at a substantially greater cost. We will all comply with these \nlaws in our offices, but you, the taxpayer, will get less rapid \nattention to your needs, and you will have to foot the bill for this \npoorer service.\n  I am not at all sure that the cheering would continue. I am not at \nall sure that the cry for bringing the Hill into compliance with all of \nthese laws would be so popular if the public understood what taking \nthat step would mean in terms of their needs, the services they have a \nright to expect to receive, and their pocketbooks. But, that is the age \nin which we live. Anything that sounds good on the surface, we rush to \ndo. Anything which the talk show jockeys can whip up the public about \nbecomes the basis for legislation. Never mind whether or not it is \nreally in the public interest. Just enact something to quiet the latest \nfad criticism and move on.\n  Well, I cannot and I will not support a measure which will likely \nhave the effect of shortchanging my constituents in terms of the \nservices my office can provide and which then asks the shortchanged \ntaxpayer to foot the bill.\n  I congratulate Senator Glenn, who has spent many weeks and months of \nhard work in the effort to bring this bill to the floor and to improve \nupon it. And I also compliment his counterpart, Mr. Grassley, for his \ninterest and dedication to the legislation. I have made this statement \nin keeping with my own views, after the experience of working on this \nHill, now, for almost 43 [[Page S638]] years. My staff and I have \nalways felt that in taking on this job and in taking on the jobs as \nemployees in my office, that we are here to render a public service and \nwe have never felt that this was a 9-to-5 operation. I have always \nattempted to pay my employees in accordance with their merits and to \npay them well and to be liberal in leave time. And we have never felt, \nanybody on my staff--and I have attempted to set the example for them, \nthat we do not work from 9 to 5. We work until the job is done. If it \ntakes longer we stay here longer because we are in the service of the \npublic. And I do not find fault with others who feel otherwise about \nit. And there is much good, I am sure, to be achieved in passage of the \nlegislation in many ways. But I have outlined the reasons why I will \nnot vote for it.\n  As I stated in the beginning, I anticipate that I may be the only one \nwho feels this way about it. I do not come here expecting to persuade \nanyone else. My feelings are based on my own experience and on my own \nknowledge of the problems that we confront here and I do not seek to \ndisparage the viewpoints of others who may want to disagree with me.\n  Mr. President, if I have any time remaining I yield it back and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. President, I withhold the suggestion.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, Senator Byrd, in his experience here as \nmajority leader, minority leader, repeat majority leader and so on, has \nan experience level in this body that no one can match. And when he \nrises and expresses his concerns about things it is of great importance \nto us because he has studied these things and no one is a greater \nconstitutional scholar on what is provided for, for the Senate and the \nHouse, the separation of powers, and making certain that the balance of \npowers within our form of government remains intact and protected. When \nhe rises to oppose this legislation it is of particular concern to me \nand I want to just address a couple of the items very briefly here. I \ndo not want to get into a big debate on this.\n  I would say we have passed, through the years, much legislation that \napplies all across this country. We did that in the assumption that \nwhat we were doing was right. It was right to apply certain protections \nof workplace conditions and of how people were dealt with out there on \nsafety in the workplace and on wages and conditions of employment and \nso on. And we applied them all across this land. Some of the arguments \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia makes are the same \narguments that businessmen across this country have made. They feel \nthey are treating their employees fairly. Yet we impose laws upon them.\n  We are not without being justifiably criticized, sometimes, here on \nCapitol Hill. I remember some newspaper articles just a couple of years \nago of some of the working conditions in the Government Printing \nOffice. That is an instrumentality of the Congress. They were \natrocious. They did not even come close to passing safety and OSHA \nregulations that we apply all across the country to every other \nprinting plant and every business across this country. So I would just \nsay if it is right that we impose these laws on other businesses across \nthis country, is it not also right that we apply those for the \nprotection of our own employees here on Capitol Hill?\n  At the same time, I know everyone relates to the situation in his or \nher own office. What is going to happen in our office on this? Let me \nsay we provide in this legislation that employees who are employed in a \n``bona fide executive, administrative or professional capacity are not \ncovered by the minimum wage and maximum hours provision.'' That means, \nthen, that the people who are covered are basically clerical people, \npeople like that in our offices. We can say that even they are required \nsometimes to work irregular hours. And that is true, they are, just as \nout in the private industry sometimes people who are temporary \nemployees or something are required to work very irregular hours. Where \nthat is a norm for the conditions of employment in private industry, \nthey can make an appeal from that and get relief from the requirements \nof the law. That is done on a regular basis by those who have their \nemployees working very irregular hours.\n  The same way here on Capitol Hill, that would be the province of the \nboard, to issue regulations like that right here if we wish to be \nexempted from that. If we did not, if our clerical personnel, for \ninstance, and those who normally out in industry would be working a \nregular shift, say--if they are not exempted by the board then I would \nsay we are treating ourselves, then, just like everybody else in the \ncountry. If a person out there running a business has some irregular \nworking hours and applies for relief from that so he does not have to \ncomply with certain regulations, then I think we would do the same \nthing here. If we find it is not working right we would appeal to the \nboard. In other words, the board would be the authority here. Just as \nthere is an appeals process out there in private industry, we would \nhave our own appeals process here.\n  But I want to point out that bona fide executive, administrative or \nprofessional capacity--they are not covered by these minimum wage or \nmaximum hour provisions. That would cover our LA's, our legislative \nassistants, who would be considered as professionals. As far as the \nright to strike, that is prohibited here. I was looking up the \nlanguage--I did not get it--just before I took the floor. But that is \nprohibited as it is in other Government activities also.\n  I would say all we tried to do in this, after all these years of \nhaving this objection about the separation of powers--and that is a \nvery real one, and has been a problem for me all those years, too, as \nit has for my distinguished colleague from West Virginia. He was one \nwho rose many years ago on the floor here and was very concerned about \nthe separation of powers. He brought some of this up a long time ago, \nand rightly so, because we should not be giving away authority, back \nand forth, here. So what we did, instead of having the executive branch \nhave the authority to just say, ``OK, we are going up on Capitol Hill \nand we are going to run a check on OSHA considerations and we are going \nto do it on our own and we will enforce it by law''--that gets into a \nvery sticky area, as the Senator from West Virginia knows. And it has \nbeen one of his main complaints about this.\n  We set up this Office of Compliance which will set rules that are \nappropriate to the unique operations of the Congress. They will have \nconsiderable authority. But we will have the appeals process, also.\n  Another area of the board's authority that I think may be \nmisunderstood, and I want to clarify also, is most of the rules for the \nCongress could probably be approved once the board sees them. The rules \nand regulations will have to come back for approval. I think most of \nthose can be a joint resolution that applies to both the House and the \nSenate, probably most of it. If there are requirements, though, for one \nbody or the other to treat itself differently because of the different \noperation of the House and Senate, then those rules have to be approved \nby each House regarding their own operations. And if we would deem it \nnecessary here in the Senate to say our operation here is unique to the \nHouse and we think the rule here should be applied in a different way \nand we passed that, and the House passed a different resolution with \nregard to their operations, then the board would administer those rules \nfor that body according to what that body approved for itself. The \nSenate rules that applied that the board would administer might not be \nthe same rules of the House as it applies to them. But the board would \nbe administering the rules as approved by each body for its own \noperations. I was not sure that was clearly understood.\n  So it gives us the maximum flexibility, I think, and gives us \nprotection for the unique nature of congressional operations, both the \nHouse and the Senate, and allows for the peculiar nature of and the \nunique nature of the activities of both the House and the Senate.\n  So we try to foresee these things. We may not have done a perfect job \non it. Senator Grassley and Senator Lieberman put the bill in last \nyear. We worked together on this. But I think I fairly described how \nthis whole thing [[Page S639]] would operate. I do not know if Senator \nGrassley wants to add anything or not. But that should clarify some of \nthe concerns of my distinguished colleague.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Ohio \nfor his consideration of some of the concerns I have expressed and for \nhis explanation.\n  I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever as to his sincerity and his \nconscientiousness and his dedication to doing the right thing for and \nby everyone concerned. As I stated in the beginning, I guess I see this \nthrough the perspective of having managed an office here on the Hill \nfor going on 43 years. And I do not expect any other Members of this \nbody to agree with me on this. But I do thank the Senator. I salute him \nfor his dedication and for his tenacity in working as long as he has to \nbring this legislation to the Senate. This is something that he feels \nstrongly about and I think I heard him speak about many times, even in \nour party conferences.\n  So I do not for one moment feel that what I think about the \nlegislation is necessarily right. I approach things, generally \nspeaking, feeling that I can be wrong. But it is pretty hard after 43 \nyears to share a viewpoint that is different from the one that has \nworked very well, I think, in my office over the years. But I admire \nthe Senator. I like him and am very fond of him.\n  I hope he will understand that I come to the floor not to engage in a \ncrusade against this bill or to persuade another mind. I simply wanted \nto state my own views, and that is it. On the next question, I hope we \ncan be together.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, without repeating what my good friend \nfrom Ohio, Senator Glenn, had to say about our respect in this body for \nthe views of Senator Byrd, I would just simply say that I associate \nmyself very much with the remarks of Senator Glenn. I would like to \nmake some commentary on the issues raised by the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia and follow along on what the Senator from Ohio has \nsaid. Our intent as we approach the writing of this legislation is to \nbe very cognizant of the separation of powers and constitutional \narguments that can be made.\n  One of the first points that was made is that these laws already \napply to Congress, or at least some of these laws apply to Congress. As \nto those that do not apply to Congress, Senators have a responsibility \nto make a conscientious effort to make sure that the principles of the \nlaw are applied out of a matter of fairness to those employees that are \nworking for Congress as an institution or working for individual \nSenators.\n  The laws that now apply to Congress do so in a way that is, in a \nsense, in name only. I have been involved with the application of some \nof these laws because I had what I considered a major victory at the \ntime to get civil rights laws applied to Congress in the fall of 1991. \nBut the remedies that we provided were not the same remedies for Hill \nemployees that private-sector employees have.\n  So I say that the law applies kind of in name only. It is on paper. \nBut the absence of the identical remedy for employees of Capitol Hill \nmakes current coverage inadequate.\n  The agency that we set up here, the Office of Compliance, is a single \nagency that does not make policy for the two houses of Congress. No \nrule can be adopted without the concurrence of the membership of the \nbody to whom the rule applies, and there is no infringement upon the \nindependence of the Senate on the one hand, the independence of the \nHouse on the other hand, or the constitutional principle that each \nHouse can adopt its own rules.\n  There is a separation of powers. But constitutional analysis is not \nso general as to say that the Supreme Court will decide a case based \nupon an argument that the separation of powers has been violated. The \nclaim must be more specific than that.\n  In the case law, the Supreme Court refuses to strike down legislation \non the broad argument that it somehow violates constitutional \nseparation of powers. Specific constitutional provisions must be cited, \nnotwithstanding the novelty of the arrangement that we have set up in \nthis legislation. The Supreme Court's decision upholding the \nconstitutionality of the Sentencing Commission and the independent \ncounsel--these have been court cases within the last 5 or 6 years--\ndemonstrates this point.\n  In my opening statement, I mentioned that executive branch employees \nhave some of the same rights that we want to now give to Hill employees \nunder existing legislation we have already applied to the private \nsector.\n  Well, when an executive branch employee's rights are in question, \nthese rights are protected by the judicial branch. It is as simple as \nthis: no one has ever found judicial enforcement of the rights of \nexecutive branch employees to be unconstitutional. So my good friend, \nwho spoke eloquently on this point, said that the judicial branch \nshould not enforce a decision against a Member of Congress or Congress \nas an institution because it violates separation of powers. Nobody \nraises that argument when the judicial branch enforces an executive \nbranch employee's right under existing law; so why should that be a \nproblem for applying those laws to us? An independent, impartial \nperson, or the institution of the judiciary protects the rights of \nexecutive branch employees. No one questions this.\n  And there has never been an impasse between the executive branch and \nthe judiciary when any of these cases has been decided. When President \nNixon was ordered to comply with a court decision during Watergate, \npure and simple, he did. If the President of the United States can obey \na judge's decision saying that the most powerful executive in the \nentire world must obey a court order, then why would we as individual \nMembers of Congress have any question whatsoever if we have done \nsomething wrong and the independent judiciary or any one of its judges \nmade a decision and issued an order enforced upon a Member of Congress.\n  The only way, then, that there could be an impasse between Congress \nand the judiciary is if Congress refused to comply with the Court order \ninterpreting the Constitution. It is one thing for opponents of this \nlegislation to argue that Congress should be above the law, and, of \ncourse, I disagree with that; but it is breathtaking to argue that \nCongress should be above the Constitution.\n  The board's determinations regarding bargaining units and covered \nemployees under collective bargaining and overtime will not take effect \nuntil Members of Congress themselves approve the regulations. And I \nhave faith that for all the reasons that have been expressed by the \nSenator from West Virginia that Congress is different, long hours are \nexpected, that when we deal with these regulations, my colleagues will \nact to preserve their constitutional responsibilities. The board is \nunelected, but the board that governs the Office of Compliance that \nwill write the regulations is not unaccountable, and it is not \nuncontrollable.\n  The bill addresses separation of powers as well, by providing for \nlegislative branch, rather than executive branch enforcement. The bill \nwas crafted to take into account constitutional issues, and I believe \nthe courts would permit Congress to exercise these powers against its \nown activities. Moreover, the bill expressly prevents waiver of any \ncongressional prerogative.\n  One last point that I want to make is that there was reference to the \nBrowning case, decided by the D.C. circuit in 1986. That was a case \nwhere there was a discharge of an official reporter at the House of \nRepresentatives, and it was challenged by that reporter. The Court held \nthe congressional defendant to be immune under the speech and debate \nclause. The standard was ``whether the employee's duties were directly \nrelated to the due functioning of the legislative process,'' and ``if \nthe employee's duties are such that they are directly assisting Members \nof Congress in the discharge of their functions, personnel decisions \naffecting them are legislative and shielded from judicial scrutiny.''\n  If Members heard during the previous speeches that Browning may \neffect what we can do here on congressional coverage to protect our \nemployees because they might be an extension of our legislative duties, \nunder the speech and debate clause, you should observe that the Supreme \nCourt, 2 years later, [[Page S640]] in 1988, issued an opinion that \nrequires Browning to be revisited. And here the Court was deciding what \nis referred to as the Forrester case. This case unanimously held that a \nState court judge did not have judicial immunity in a suit for damages \nbrought by a probation officer whom that judge had fired. The Court \nexplained that in determining whether immunity attaches to a particular \nofficial action, it applied a--this is their words--``functional \napproach.'' And then, ``Under that approach we examine the nature of \nthe functions with which a particular official or class of officials \nhas been lawfully entrusted, and we seek to evaluate the effect and \nexposure that particular forms of liability would have on the \nappropriate exercise of those functions. Officials who seek exemption \nfrom personal liability have the burden of showing that such an \nexemption is justified by overriding considerations of public policy.''\n  Thus, it is ``the nature of the function performed, not the identity \nof the actor who performed it, that informs our immunity analysis.''\n  So you can see that in Forrester, the Supreme Court is telling us \nthat the Browning decision is not as compelling as it was for the 2 \nyears before the Forrester case came before the Supreme Court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, everything sounds so good, it is almost hard \nto believe it. The general public out there believes that we are \napplying the same rules to our own institution as we apply to them. \nThat is not true. That is not true. In the Americans With Disabilities \nAct, for instance, we excluded title II. We hear this rhetoric that we \nput that in. We excluded title II. Title II is buildings and \ntransportation. You wait until we have to change the other subway. That \nis fine, but the last one cost $16 million. I wonder what the others \nare going to cost. That is not coming out of my pocket or the Senator's \npocket; it is coming out of the taxpayer's pocket.\n  The congressional exemptions in the statutes as provided by this bill \nwill do a lot of things. If the same laws are applied to Congress as to \nthe private sector, the statutory provisions must be the same. The \nstatutory provisions are not the same. The remedies available to \nemployees must be the same, the regulations must be the same, and the \nprovisions for judicial enforcement and review must be the same as it \napplies to the private sector. But, no, we do not do that.\n  We do not do that. No, we do not.\n  The Republican bill creates a special agency, creates a special \nagency, to enforce selective provisions of law to the Congress. We set \nup a special agency. We do not just say that the provisions that apply \nto the small employer down there, the small businessman, will apply to \nus. We do not do that.\n  Under the bill, Congress will have its own special regulations. We \nset up our own special regulations. Separation of powers, sure. But we \nare out there telling our general public, our constituents, that we are \ngoing to apply the same thing to us as we apply to them. Now, I may \nvote for the bill, but I am going to tell you one thing, I want the \ngeneral public to know what we are doing and what we are not doing.\n  Congress will have its own special regulations that may vary for each \nHouse. We may not have the same provisions in the Senate as they have \nin the House. It will vary between the House and the Senate, its own \nrules of procedure, not what the general public has--its own agency \nwith its own inspectors with its own staff with its own general counsel \nwith its own executive director and its own board. Now, you know, the \ngeneral public out there does not have all that as we are setting up \nfor ourselves.\n  The law will not result in Congress being subjected to the same laws \nthat apply to the private sector. It is a continuation of special \ntreatment of Congress by Congress. Any rose should smell so sweet.\n  The repeal of the exemption for Congress in the various civil rights \nand labor statutes would be the fulfillment of what the Republicans \nreally promised by the Democrats. We would be holding them to their \npromise, not to their slogans.\n  So when you get right down to it, it is very simple. You just say all \nthe statutes that apply to the business people out there apply to us. \nThat is very simple. But, no, we are making it complicated. We excluded \nthe Members of the Senate and the Members of the House. We are giving \nthe Senate and the House the opportunity to set up different rules, and \nthe expense is going to be tremendous.\n  Impact on confidentiality: The bill provides its office proceedings, \nincluding hearings before a hearing officer and before the board on \nappeal, will be confidential. It would permit public release only of \nthe hearing officer's or board's decision, provided the complainant's \nname had been redacted. However, trial de novo will likely become the \nmore popular avenue for the employee to pursue. A trial is usually not \nconfidential and the parties would be named in the complaint.\n  Just a lot of things that we are doing here.\n  The bill requires the office to develop a system for the collection \nof demographic data respecting the composition of congressional \nemployees, including race, sex, wages and a system for the collection \nof information on employment practices, including family leave and \nflexible work hours, and report annually to Congress on the information \ncollected under such system.\n  How many employers out there have that done for them? How many?\n  And so we are saying we are applying the same laws to Congress that \nwe are applying to our constituents. Not true. Not true. You can say \nwhat you want to, get up here and make all these grandiose statements \nfor 30-second sound bites, but when you get down to it and you read the \nbill, we are taking care of Congress. We are giving immunity to \nCongress. The immunity is there. Self-enforcement has not worked very \nwell. And that is what is happening here. Self-enforcement is what is \nhappening here and it has not worked very good.\n  Two years ago, Congress passed legislation to extend coverage of \nseveral employment discrimination laws to the Senate. A Fair Employment \nPractices Office was established and employees were promised fair \ntreatment. It was certainly an intent of these actions to provide some \nprotection against arbitrary employment decisions to employees of the \nSenate. With this change in the majority, we have had employees that \nwere within a few weeks of retiring, few months of retiring, and \nnondesignated employees--they were not Democrat or Republican, \nIndependent or otherwise, they were professionals--the professionals \nwere fired so you could hire some more designated. We will see \nemployees terminated for the sake of termination.\n  And we are going to have a lot of cases, a lot of cases, when you \nfire a professional that is there because he is a professional, not \nbecause he is a Republican or Democrat or an Independent, whatever he \nmight be. Is this action consistent with the intent of this \nlegislation?\n  If the same laws are to apply to Congress and to the private sector, \nthe statutory provisions must be the same. The enforcement agency must \nbe the same, the remedies available to employees must be the same, the \nregulations must be the same, and the provisions for judicial \nenforcement and review must be the same as applied to the private \nsector. But, no, Congress is being good to itself again. Congress is \nbeing good to itself again. We are given immunity.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that we will look at what is coming down \nthe pike. And I think it is appropriate. But let us not fool the \ngeneral public. Let us not say we are applying the same laws to \nCongress that we have applied to them, because we are not.\n  We will get in the argument about separation of powers and all this \nsort of thing. But then that is an argument where you can take care of \nyourselves.\n  Eight-thousand employees are now serving in the Senate. We will go to \napproximately 24,000 employees that will be covered; counseling up to \n30 days; mediation, 30 or more; inspections for OSHA and ADA, title II. \nYou hear we have put ADA, we have applied that to the Senate. We have \nnot.\n  Investigation and initiation of charges: In addition to Senate OFEP \n[[Page S641]] staff above, the bill requires a five-person hearing \nboard and two, House and Senate, deputy directors. We do not need all \nthose. Just eliminate the statutes' exemptions for us and let the \nstatutes apply to us.\n  So I will have more to say on this, I guess, before we get through. \nBut I just want to be sure that people understand that we are not \napplying the same laws that we apply to our constituents to the \nCongress. I hope that there will be an admission that we are not doing \nthat.\n  We are doing more than we have been. I have been for it for a long \ntime. I got the Fair Employment Practices Office set up. Who had the \nresponsibility of that? That is a $900,000 annual budget. We have had \nseveral cases we have settled. All those things have been transpiring. \nAnd wonder who paid for that? The taxpayers paid an additional \n$900,000, plus whatever the costs were. And whatever happens in this \ninstance, the taxpayers are going to pay for it. We have immuned \nourselves. Confidentiality is there. All of that.\n  And so, I hope those that who are listening understand that what we \nare doing is in the right direction, but it is not what we are saying \nwe are doing. We are doing something far different.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is S. 2.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is there a pending amendment, Mr. President?\n  The Ford amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Ford amendment No. 4 to S. 2.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 8\n\n     (Purpose: To modify amendment No. 4 to S. 2 to clarify Senate \n            regulations on the use of frequent flier miles)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 8 to the Ford amendment.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. FORD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an objection. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       1. On line 7 of the first page, strike from paragraph (a): \n     ``or House of Representatives'';\n       2. On line 10 of the first page, strike from paragraph (b): \n     ``Committee on House Oversight of the House of \n     Representatives and the'';\n       3. On line 9 of the second page, strike from subparagraph \n     (2) of paragraph (c): ``the House of Representatives and'';\n       4. On line 8 of the first page, strike from paragraph (a): \n     ``Government'' and substitute ``office for which the travel \n     was performed''.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my friend and colleague from Kentucky \nhas offered an amendment which as it relates to the Senate codifies \nexisting policy. It is not possible, it is my understanding, under \nSenate rules, for a Member of the Senate to convert frequent flier \nmileage acquired as a result of Government travel to personal use.\n  So, Mr. President, my assumption is that the amendment is designed to \nestablish such a policy for the other body, and it is my view, and I \nthink the Senator from Kentucky might--he can speak for himself--have \nobjected to the House passing a Senate rule when he was chairman of the \nRules Committee. Maybe he would not have. But it is my view that since \nthe Senate has already curbed this problem--I am not sure exactly when \nthe rule was adopted--it would be best that we not use this vehicle \nthat Senator Grassley and Senator Lieberman have been working so hard \non to impose a standard on the House that it may well adopt for itself \nat a time of its own choosing.\n  But this issue of the use of frequent flier miles acquired as a \nresult of the expenditure of taxpayers' dollars to provide travel for \nSenators going back and forth to their States has long since been \nsolved. It is not a problem in the Senate.\n  One concern I do have about the particular crafting of the amendment \nby my friend and colleague from Kentucky is that I gather the money \nsaved by his amendment would accrue to ``the Government.'' Under the \ncurrent system, it is my understanding that the frequent flier mileage \naccrued goes to the office of the Senator; it is assigned to that \nparticular office and then, of course, can be used to defray travel for \nthe Senator back and forth to his State, thereby saving the taxpayers \nmoney.\n  So it seems to me better if we continue the policy of allowing the \nSenator to accumulate these miles for his own Government travel back \nand forth to his State, thereby saving taxpayers money for that \nparticular office.\n  That is essentially my point, Mr. President, in offering this second-\ndegree amendment. It is to simply limit the operation to the Senate, \nbecause basically that is already our policy, and to refrain from \nseeking to establish this standard for the House because I think they \nare not likely to take kindly to our advice about how they ought to \nhandle this matter.\n  Let me just briefly go over a short statement here that outlines what \nI have said extemporaneously.\n  The Senate abides by travel regulations promulgated by the Senate \nRules Committee. These travel regulations prohibit using frequent flier \nmiles accrued from official business for personal use. They do allow \nthe office which accrued the miles to use them for additional travel. \nThus, the Senate regulations save the taxpayers money by allowing \nSenators to use accrued frequent flier miles to fly back and forth to \nour respective States.\n  To the extent that the Ford amendment codifies existing Senate \npolicy, I would argue that it is probably not necessary because that is \nalready our policy. But a consequence of the amendment of my friend may \nbe that the frequent flier miles would be wasted and unusable.\n  Under our current regulations, as I just outlined earlier, bonus \nmiles accrue to the office that pays for the ticket. That office may \nthen use the accrued miles for additional official travel.\n  The amendment of my colleague would have the miles accrued to ``the \nGovernment.'' The airlines, as I understand it, do not allow the \npooling of bonus miles, not by private citizens and not by Government \nagencies. So if an office with accrued miles must turn them over to \n``the Government,'' those miles would in all likelihood be lost. The \nresult would be an increase potentially in the cost of Government to \nthe taxpayers.\n  Finally, just let me reiterate what I said earlier, that I hope we \nwould not try to impose our longstanding rule on the House. It seems to \nme that they are not likely to respond to that kindly and may well deal \nwith this issue at a time of their choosing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. The other Senator.\n  Mr. President, I think my colleague, Senator McConnell, has a very \nweak argument. What he is saying is let the House continue to take \ntheir frequent flier mileage and use it personally; take your wife and \nfamily to Europe on a nice trip, or go out to California on miles \nearned by official expense.\n  That is number one. Number two, the House says they are going to do \nthis. Fine. I listened very closely to our majority leader, Senator \nDole, when he said this bill, in all probability, will be accepted by \nthe House and we will not have to go to conference. So if this \namendment is not included in S. 2, then the House will continue for a \nperiod of time being able to use their frequent flier miles for \npersonal use. And I do not think the taxpayers want to do that.\n  And, if we approve this modification, or amendment, that my colleague \nhas submitted, then the purpose of Senator Feingold and I is just moot. \nThere is no need of having the amendment, since the Senate already has \nits rule. I would prefer to keep it in. But nevertheless--and I am \naware of the usual [[Page S642]] practice that each House not legislate \nwith regard to the operations of the other House. While this \nunderstanding is generally, and I underscore generally, honored, there \nhave been a number of circumstances where it has not.\n  One recent major incident, and I underscore major, was the House \ninsistence that the Senate official office accounts--if you remember \nthat, we are just getting over that, we are just getting over that--\nthat the Senate official office accounts be modified by adoption of \nrestrictive language in the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act of \n1991. That, in effect, was a major implementation of new rules by the \nHouse on the Senate. That change affected every Member of the Senate, \nand required the adoption of an extensive interpretive ruling by the \nSenate Ethics Committee, which my colleague should know plenty about \nsince he is on the Ethics Committee.\n  The net effect of the amendment that deletes the House from this \namendment is to permit the House Members to continue to convert \nfrequent flier awards earned with taxpayers' money to personal use. Is \nthis the congressional accountability that we talked about? It would be \nthe only unit of Government that is allowed to do that. The executive \ndoes not allow it. The Senate does not allow it. But the House flies \nanywhere they want to on the perks from taxpayers' dollars. I \nunderstand you want to let the House go ahead and do it. It seems to me \nthat if we want to be accountable here--sure we use, on our side in the \nSenate, those miles that are compiled from official trips back home to \nhave more trips or to reduce the cost of our offices. It is pretty \ngood, $300 or $400 a round trip, two or three trips, save $1,000; save \n$100,000 in the Senate. It begins to mount up. So the House, with 435 \nover there, it would be $435,000 that you would get back. You know, \njust a little bit.\n  So I would say to my friend that if this bill is going to become \nlaw--as I understand the majority leader insists that it will, if we do \nnot amend it too much--just to put this in the bill, I do not think the \nHouse will vote against it just because we say to them they cannot use \ntaxpayers' dollars for personal use. If you want to vote for that, let \nthe House use it for personal use, you are going to get an opportunity, \nprobably tomorrow afternoon around 2:15, or 2:30. But this amendment \nwould modify the amendment I proposed with Senator Feingold by deleting \nthe reference to the House of Representatives, and the proposal is just \nnot acceptable. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to make it clear it is not the \nview of this Senator that this vote on the second-degree amendment I \nhave offered is in any way condoning of the use of frequent flier miles \nfor private use--private use of frequent flier miles acquired as a \nresult of Government travel. That is certainly not my view. It is not \nthe view of the Senate. And the vote on the amendment I offered will be \nsolely on the issue of whether or not the Senate ought to be making \nrules for the House. That is my view. I guess reasonable people can \ndiffer about that.\n  But in no way could a vote for the second-degree amendment I have \noffered be construed as condoning the policy that the Senate does not \nhave. We have not had this for quite some time. So I personally \ncertainly do not support the use of frequent flier miles accrued as a \nresult of Government travel for private use. I know my friend from \nKentucky was not implying that. But it is also my view that a vote for \nthis second-degree amendment is not a vote to condone the use of \nfrequent flier miles acquired as a result of Government travel for \nprivate use.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, what our distinguished colleague from \nKentucky, Senator Ford, is trying to do here is say if the Government \npays the bills and there is a rebate of some kind, the Government \nshould get the benefit, not the individual. It is that simple.\n  For the life of me, I do not see how anyone can argue against that, \nparticularly people elected over in the House now who are supposed to \nbe cleaning up Government and all that sort of thing. In other words, \nright now over in the House the more you travel, the more trips you can \ngenerate back and forth, the more you personally gained for you and \nyour family in free travel paid for by the taxpayers. How anybody can \njustify that I do not know. I realize the House sets their own rules \nand we apply our own rules but I submit to my distinguished colleague, \nSenator McConnell, we have had rules applied back and forth between the \nbranches from time to time in the past. I think there are lots of \nexamples of that.\n  I see this as almost a maximum personal perk. How can you have a more \npersonal perk than all your travel back and forth between here and the \nwest coast? You travel many, many, many thousands of miles. Or Hawaii, \nthe Senators from out there, you build up a bundle of credit that over \nin the House they can use for personal family travel. They can take a \ntrip around the world if they build enough of it up, at taxpayers' \nexpense. I just do not see how anybody can justify that, that \nGovernment-paid-for tickets, with a rebate coming back, that rebate \nshould not go to the Government that paid for it. That goes back to the \ntaxpayers who paid for it to begin with. I do not think this thing of \nhaving the House determine its own rules--we have made rules back and \nforth that applied to different Houses in the past.\n  I will at the appropriate time, probably tomorrow morning, since we \nhave just discussed this a short time ago, but I will probably have an \namendment after we dispose of this one that would ask the GSA, the \nGeneral Services Administration, that supervises the travel, that they \nnegotiate with the airlines to include a frequent flier mile reduction \nin the original cost of the tickets. Why should that not inure to the \nGovernment going in? We should not argue about who gets the benefits of \nkickbacks later on, on frequent flier miles, but say if there is a \nreduced cost to the Government beyond the normal Government-reduced \nprice, Government rate, for frequent flier miles in addition to \nGovernment-reduced rates, apply those frequent flier reductions in the \noriginal cost of the ticket. It seems to me that is very simple and \nsolves the whole problem. So I will introduce that tomorrow at the \nappropriate time. But I rise in strong support of the proposal of \nSenator Ford.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first I want to make a unanimous-consent \nrequest. I am doing it for the Republican leadership and it is my \nunderstanding it has been approved by the Democratic side of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 on Tuesday, \nJanuary 10, the Senate proceed to vote on the McConnell second-degree \namendment to the Ford amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I now ask for the yeas and nays on the \nMcConnell amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I want to clear up one item with my \ncolleague as it relates to his interpretation of whether it belongs to \nthe Government or to the office. Under the rules of the Senate, and \nlegislative counsel advised us to draft the amendment that way, it \nsays:\n\n       Discount coupons, frequent flier mileage, or other evidence \n     of reduced fares obtained on official travel shall be turned \n     in to the office for which the travel was performed so that \n     they may be utilized for future official travel. This \n     regulation is predicated upon the general Government policy \n     that all promotional materials such as bonus flights, reduced \n     fare coupons, cash, merchandise, gifts, credits toward future \n     free or reduced cost of services or goods earned as a result \n     of trips paid by appropriated funds, are the property of the \n     Government and may not be retained by the traveler for \n     personal use.\n\n  [[Page S643]] So, it is the Government money but it is returned to \nthe office. So the language in the amendment is there based on the \nrules of the Senate, and they would apply as a result of this \namendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by Senator McConnell, the junior Senator from Kentucky. Just \nlast week, this body overwhelmingly rejected an attempt to change the \nfilibuster rules. We did that for a very important reason. We believe \nthat it is an integral part of the functioning of this body within our \nconstitutional system to protect minority interests and minority points \nof view in debate and consideration of legislation. So we decided to \nmaintain a historic Senate rule, and we voted for recognition of our \nuniqueness when we did that. The House of Representatives and the \nSenate are two distinctly different bodies. They are entitled to adopt \ndifferent rules, and one House should not dictate the rules of the \nother.\n  The underlying bill before us, S. 2, recognizes this principle. The \nunderlying bill, as Senator Lieberman and I have introduced it, sets up \ndifferent rules for the House and the Senate so long as those rules do \nnot infringe upon the statutory and regulatory rights of employees of \nCongress and the individual offices within Congress.\n  So no amendment should be offered, including the amendment by the \nsenior Senator from Kentucky, that tells the other body what it must do \nin an area unrelated to the provisions of this bill. Under the second-\ndegree amendment, Senators would be barred from converting frequent \nflyer miles earned on official business to personal use. That happens \nto be the existing rule in the Senate. I think the point has been very \nclearly made, that none of the 100 Senators may use frequent flyer \nmiles for anything but official business.\n  It is all right to make our Senate rule into legislation, and, if \nSenator McConnell's amendment is adopted, that is what we will be \ndoing. We will be putting in statute language that is already a rule of \nthe Senate. But we should let the House make its own rule in this \nregard. The other body is currently studying the treatment of frequent \nflyer miles in the private sector. They will want to conform their \nrules to the existing prevalent practice, and we should allow the other \nbody to proceed on that course. I do not think there is any doubt but \nwhat they will be dealing with this as they know they should deal with \nit, as they dealt with it last August. Then, it did not get through in \nthe final process of legislation.\n  So I argue that the process going on in the other body, and our \nrespect for the rights of the other body, should be satisfactory to \nanyone. In the meantime, we should remember that the amendment of the \nsenior Senator from Kentucky has no relationship to this bill.\n  If I have spoken more than once, I have spoken a dozen times to make \nthe point that the underlying legislation is something that was clearly \nan issue in the last election. Whether you are a Republican or \nDemocrat, you were probably elected on a proposition that you would \nvote for this. I did not run into anybody in the campaign who was \nagainst this legislation, Republican or Democrat. Now what we are doing \nis carrying out the will of the people, the mandate of that election, \nto get this bill passed and get it passed as quickly as we can. And the \npurpose of doing it as quickly as we can is so that we can show the \npeople of this country that it is no longer business as usual.\n  So I believe that enacting existing Senate rules into law sometimes \nmay be appropriate. So I will support the second-degree amendment. I \nwant S. 2 to pass and to pass quickly, and adopting the second-degree \namendment, I think, will further our goal because it is not going to \ncomplicate the bill. This is a matter of whether or not the other body \nis going to be turned off toward our legislation by the proposition \nthat we are trying to tell them what to do to their own rules, because \nthey have a constitutional right to adopt their own.\n  So I hope everyone will support the second-degree amendment by \nSenator McConnell.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, just briefly in conclusion, I was \nlistening to all the speakers on the other side with great interest. \nTheir parties controlled the House of Representatives for 40 long \nyears. I am curious as to why we have not felt the need here in the \nSenate to dictate this particular House rule in the past. We could have \ndone that at any point. I do not know how long the House has had this \npractice but probably a long time. I just do not see the urgency or the \npropriety just because the management currently changed in the House as \nof last week that the Senate start dictating internal House policy.\n  I agree with Chairman Grassley that this is just not an appropriate \nthing to do, and a vote on the second-degree amendment that I have \noffered is in no way a condoning of the practice that we do not allow \nhere. We serve in this body. We do not allow this. I do not think we \nought to start off the year telling the House what ought to be in their \ninternal operating mode.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to address the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the senior Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  You try a lot of things on this side that do not work. We voted \noverwhelmingly for a lobbying bill, gift bans, and everybody on the \nother side voted for it, 93 to 5, overwhelmingly. Some go out of here, \nand the only excuse they had for not voting for it this time is that \nthey want to set the agenda. They want to introduce their own lobbying \nbill-gift ban bill.\n  Now we are trying to uphold something that is absolutely the right \nthing to do, and they say we should not impose it on the House. If they \nhave been doing it for a while, why not correct it now? Do not wait \nmonths from now.\n  The distinguished majority leader said that this is a bill that would \nbe acceptable on the House side. If it is going to be accepted on the \nHouse side, why not have something in there that is right? Let us do \nthe right thing instead of letting it go. If something bad has \nhappened, if something bad is going on, let us correct it now. Let us \nnot wait until we are down the pike. If anyone wants to pass this \nunderlying bill, sure, let us pass the underlying bill, but not by \nsetting up a new, special and separate bureaucracy by Congress for \nCongress.\n  You go out and tell your constituent tomorrow that you are immune \nfrom prosecution. He is not. Tell him about the special committee set \nup to set your rules, and he does not have any. Tell him about the \nspecial counsel you are going to hire for yourself, and he does not \nhave any. Do you think this is applying the laws that you put on the \nsmall businessman to Congress? Think again.\n  So if the underlying bill is that bad, why not add something on it \nthat might do a little good? Just stop the use of perks from taxpayers' \ndollars for personal use. It is not the first time I have tried to do \nthis. Why is it in the Senate? In 1991 we did it. As the chairman of \nthe Rules Committee I tried. I think I was fair to everybody. I do not \nbelieve anybody in the Senate can say that I did not attempt to be fair \nwith every Member. A lot of things we tried to prevent.\n  So if you are going to allow the imagery going out of here applying \nthe laws to the Senate and the House that you apply to your \nconstituents, which is not really true because you are setting up \nsomething different that is costly, wait until you get on the 1988 \nDisability Act when we begin to get into title II. Everybody said we \nhave covered it under ADA. We have not. Now we are finally getting \naround to it. The Russell subway is not handicap accessible, the subway \non the House side is not. We have a lot of things to do. I want my \ncolleagues to know that we are setting up a special bureaucracy for \nCongress by Congress. The more [[Page S644]] things change the more \nthey stay the same.\n\n  There is one thing we can change: taking taxpayers' dollars and using \nthem for personal perks. I do not care if it has been going on for 40 \nyears. Why should it go on for 41? And if the majority leader is \nright--and I have to accept his word that this bill will be accepted by \nthe House and not go to conference--then we just delay the personal \nperks of the Members on the other side. I do not think they object to \nthis. We are the ones that are objecting. I have not had anybody from \nthe House run over here and say: Ford, you cannot do that, you cannot \ntake my perk away from me. I want to continue to get my frequent flier \nmiles so I can take my family to Europe or Hawaii or San Diego or \nMiami. We want to take a vacation on the taxpayers.\n  If you want to say that is what we want you to continue to do, then \nvote for Senator McConnell's amendment, and we will just pull ours \ndown. It will not make any difference at all.\n  So I hope people will look at this. The fabric of the legislation has \nto be accurate. There cannot be a 30-second sound bite in legislation. \nYou can have a 30-second sound bite out in the campaign, but when we \ndevelop the fabric of the legislation here, that fabric has to meet \nwhere the rubber meets the pavement. It has to be accurate. You said \nsomething and now we are going to do it. But this legislation does not \ndo it. I can give you chapter and verse, chapter and verse. There are \nabout 24,000 employees that you are putting under this. You will have \nto have supplemental appropriations to pay for it--more than once a \nyear, in my opinion. And I am for it, but I think all you have to do is \njust waive our exemptions and let us do what our constituents have to \ndo. Very simple.\n  Oh, the separation of powers. If you are going to have separation of \npowers, that is one thing. But separation of powers is so costly under \nthis bill, we will never see the end of tens of millions of dollars we \nare going to have to spend, because we are doing for Congress by \nCongress again, and the more things change the more they stay the same. \nI think in this instance we ought to change it just a little bit and \nsay you cannot use your constituents' tax dollars for personal perks. \nIt is a very simple vote. It will not take long, about 15 minutes \ntomorrow. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chair recognizes the Senator from \nCalifornia, [Mrs. Feinstein].\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise, not to discuss this subject, \nbut to discuss another. I had a placeholder at 5:30 to introduce four \namendments to this bill. But knowing that the proponents of the bill \nwould very much like to have it passed without amendment, I simply \nwould like to make a statement about these amendments and then hope to \nwork on a bipartisan basis to achieve some consensus and propose them \nlater.\n  Mr. President, the amendments I was going to propose were in an area \nof congressional reform, which is as important as any area in this \nbill. It is campaign spending reform. I think campaign spending reform \nactually is more important, because it has so solidly conditioned the \natmosphere of the public with respect to campaigns.\n  I was going to propose four amendments, the first, on spending \nlimits. As I understood it, there was substantial objection to the \npublic finance aspect of spending limits. The amendment I would propose \nwould contain the spending limits of the prior Senate bill. In other \nwords, the limit per State would be based on voting-age population. It \nwould range from a high of $8.1 million in a large State such as \nCalifornia and a low of $1.5 million in the smallest State. In exchange \nfor complying with these voluntary spending limits, a candidate would \nbe entitled to a half-price discount broadcast rate, a reduced postage \nrate, and a complying candidate would be able to match an opponent that \nwould not abide by the spending limit or exceed the spending limit \nwithout regard for the individual contribution limit of $1,000. That \nwould be the balance.\n\n  The second amendment would limit PAC contributions to 20 percent of \nthe total raised.\n  The third amendment would require a candidate to state at the end of \ntheir television ad in the last 4 seconds, clearly and definitively, \nspeaking on the tube, that ``I believe the facts in this advertisement \nto be true.''\n  The fourth amendment would be in the area of personal funds. They \nwould require a candidate to declare if they intend to spend in excess \nof $250,000 or, second, in excess of $1 million in the race, within 15 \ndays of qualifying as a candidate. If their answer was in the \naffirmative, then gradually the individual contribution limits \napplicable to the opponent would be raised. So, again, you would have \nthe opportunity to achieve a more level playing field.\n  Let me briefly state the rationale. I think there is probably no \ncampaign in the Nation that better demonstrates the need for campaign \nspending reform than does the recent California Senate race. In my own \nelection, and in others around the country, voters, I believe, saw some \nof the worst features of campaigns repeating themselves. There were \nspiraling campaign costs. More than $45 million was spent in the \nCalifornia Senate race. There was a virtual arms race of negative \npolitical advertisements day after day, beginning in February in \nCalifornia. One area my amendment would address, for example, is where \nthere was a negative ad in the sense of one candidate referring to \ntheir opponent, the station broadcasting the ad would have to make a \ndisclaimer. That is, this station has no way of ascertaining the truth \nof the ad that is about to appear. One of the problems we found is that \npeople automatically believe a paid commercial spot is true, in the \nsame way they believe a paid commercial spot for a product is true, \nand, of course, there is legitimate recourse for a false commercial \nspot. What we found is that there is no recourse for a false political \nspot. The station must run the spot, even if it is blatantly false.\n  Therefore, why not have the station come forward and say that this \nstation has no way of ascertaining the truth or falsity of the spot \nwhich is about to appear.\n  The total amount of funds spent in the 1994 election cycle nationally \nis staggering. Spending by Senate and House candidates who survived \nprimaries was $596 million, up 17 percent from 1992 and up 50 percent \nfrom 1990. Fifty percent more funds were spent in this race than just 4 \nyears ago. Democratic candidates spent a record of $292 million, up 8 \npercent from 1992. And Republican candidates spent a record of $294 \nmillion, up 29 percent from 1992.\n  The source of this is the Federal Election Commission.\n  Now, we all know that there is no room in campaigns for people with \nsensitive feelings.\n  However, in the 1994 campaign, negative messages, groundless attacks \non character, and distorted images dragged political advertising to a \nnew low.\n  I would like to quote from an op-ed appearing in the New York Times \nand authored by Regionald Brack, chairman of Time Inc., and also \nchairman of the Advertising Council, which sponsors public-service ads. \nHe reports:\n\n       The cutthroat ads followed a disturbing formula. In \n     clipped, agitated tones, attack your opponent's character. \n     Distort his or her record. Associate him or her with \n     extremists or unpopular political figures. To awaken fear, \n     work in a between-the-lines racist message; foster suspicion, \n     insinuate corrupt behavior. And by all means, steer clear of \n     substantive issues.\n\n  Examples abound.\n\n       This year one ad implied that a candidate might have lied \n     about drug abuse.\n       At least two candidates suggested that their opponents' \n     political philosophies were somehow to blame for the \n     kidnapping and murder of a 12-year-old and for the lethal \n     rampage of a foe of abortion.\n       Each political party charged that the other would \n     significantly erode Social Security, Medicare, and other such \n     programs dear to the electorate.\n\n  It is these 30-second negative ads that are driving politics in \nAmerica today and turning away the American voter.\n  These ads, which are short on substance and long on attack, are \nshaping the political debate.\n  A post-election poll indicated that 75 percent of the respondents who \nsaid they voted in November said they were [[Page S645]] turned off by \nnegative ads. In an election in which only 39 percent of the eligible \nvoters went to the polls, 58 percent of those who did not vote said \nnegative ads had influenced their decision to stay home.\n  Now, what is the problem? What I found the problem to be, is that \neven if a candidate wants to take the high road and deal with issues, \nthe simple fact is you cannot. And I want to tell you why.\n  Focus group after focus group suggests this: The negatives drive \nthrough; the positives do not.\n  When you ask in a focus group what do you remember most about this or \nthat candidate, what they remember are the negative ads, and what they \ndo not believe are the positive ads of record and accomplishment that a \ncandidate may run. Therefore, what you find, as you watch poll numbers \nin big races, is that a candidate has to respond in kind to negative \nads and if you try to respond to an attack with positives, the poll \nnumbers drop. You also have to respond in quantity and equally to the \nopponent to have an effect.\n  Consumers can file a complaint about false advertising of consumer \nproducts. But the aggrieved candidate has no legitimate recourse in a \nrace. In my campaign, one television station began to run its own \ndisclaimer before an attack ad saying that although the ad, they \nbelieved, was not correct, they still had to run it.\n  Another disturbing problem is the specter of super-wealthy candidates \nbeing able to buy a seat. In the 1994 election, several candidates \nreceived as much as 16 to 17 percent of their total funds from loans \nout of their own pockets--the highest proportion since at least 1986.\n  At least one way, I believe, the campaign system can offset the \nadvantage of personal wealth without running afoul of the First \nAmendment and the Buckley versus Valeo decision is simply to loosen the \nconstraints on the opponent. If a candidate declares up front that, \n``I'm going to contribute either $250,000, up to $1 million, or over $1 \nmillion in personal funds,'' then the individual contribution limits on \nthe opponent are adjusted gradually so that the opponent then can \ncompete.\n  Last, I strongly believe that campaign reform must look at the \nprevalence of contributions by PAC's. There is a real distortion in the \npublic's mind that policymakers are beholden to special interests, and \nthe special interests are the so-called PAC's, which overshadow average \ncitizens, and impair, the public believes, an official's ability to \nmake policy decisions based on national interests.\n  Current law is thought to favor PAC's in two key respects. Most PAC's \nqualify as multicandidate committees and, as such, they may contribute \nup to $5,000. Now, in prior legislation, the Senate has banned PAC's \naltogether, and the House has opposed such a move.\n  It seems to me that a fair compromise between the two is simply to \nlimit the amount of PAC dollars a candidate can receive so that it does \nnot exceed 20 percent of whatever the candidate raises.\n  So I hope, Mr. President, in the future, to present these amendments, \neither separately or as a whole. There is no public finance in any of \nthem. We would establish a campaign spending limit. We would be able to \nbetter bring about truth in advertising. We would be able to level the \nplaying field when personal wealth is considered. And we would be able \nto reduce considerably the so-called involvement of special interests \nin campaigns.\n  They are simple, they are direct, they make sense.\n  So I will, in the days to come, be approaching, on both sides of the \naisle, Members in hopes that I can put together a bipartisan commitment \nto just these four simple amendments and move them forward, either \nseparately or as a whole.\n  I thank you for your indulgence, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for her willingness not to offer those amendments. I thank \nher very much, because it will help us hurry the legislation through \nthis body and to the President of the United States.\n  I also want to assure her for our leader--because he has said so many \ntimes himself that there will be an ample opportunity to discuss the \nissues that she wants to bring up, as well as the campaign finance \nreform issue will be discussed--that there will be plenty of \nopportunity to do that.\n  I say that not only to assure the Senator from California of that \nopportunity, but also to suggest to other people on her side of the \naisle, on the Democratic side of the aisle, who have amendments that \ndeal with campaign finance reform--and there still are a few of the 20 \nyet to deal with tomorrow--that maybe they will follow the example of \nthe Senator from California and not offer their amendments so that we \ncan get done with this bill earlier tomorrow.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, this morning the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, by a vote of 9 to 4, reported S. 1, the Unfunded Mandate \nReform Act of 1995. Because of the great importance of this legislation \nto the State and local governments of this country, the bill is \nexpected to be taken up by the Senate this week. Therefore, no official \nreport of the committee will be filed on this legislation. To do so \nwould delay the start of the bill's consideration. When a report is to \nbe filed, each Member is entitled to a minimum of 3 days to prepare \nadditional views. After it is filed, printed, and made available, the \nbill must lay over for 2 days before it may be considered.\n  Therefore, I am publishing instead a statement of the chairman on S. \n1, which contains the very information, such as a legislative history \nand a section-by-section analysis, that would have been included in the \nreport to accompany the legislation, had one been filed. Much of this \nis similar to the official committee report that was filed on the bill \nlast year, when the committee reported S. 993, the predecessor of S. 1.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement of the Chairman, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, on \n               S. 1--Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995\n\n\n                               i. purpose\n\n       The purpose of S. 1--the ``Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of \n     1995''--is to strengthen the partnership between Federal, \n     State, local and tribal governments by ensuring that the \n     impact of legislative and regulatory proposals on those \n     governments are given full consideration in Congress and the \n     Executive Branch before they are acted upon. S.1 accomplishes \n     this objective through the following major provisions: a \n     majority point of order in the Senate to lie against Federal \n     mandates without authorized funding to State, local and \n     tribal governments; a requirement that the Congressional \n     Budget Office (CBO) estimate the cost of Federal mandates to \n     State, local and tribal governments as well as to the private \n     sector; a requirement that Federal agencies establish a \n     process to allow State, local and tribal governments greater \n     input into the regulatory process; and, a requirement that \n     agencies analyze the costs and benefits to State, local, and \n     tribal governments of major regulations that include federal \n     mandates.\n\n\n                             ii. background\n\n       On October 27, 1993, State and local officials from all \n     over the Nation came to Washington and declared that day as \n     ``National Unfunded Mandates Day.'' These officials conveyed \n     a powerful message to Congress and the Clinton Administration \n     that unfunded Federal mandates imposed unreasonable fiscal \n     burdens on their budgets, limited their flexibility to \n     address more pressing local problems, forced local tax \n     increases and service cutbacks, and hampered their ability to \n     govern effectively.\n       The Committee on Governmental Affairs heard that message, \n     and on November 3rd scheduled a Full Committee hearing on the \n     issue. Witnesses from all levels of State and local \n     government, from big cities on down to small townships, \n     testified at the hearing on how unfunded Federal mandates \n     adversely affected their ability to govern and set \n     priorities. Mayor Greg Lashutka of Columbus, Ohio summed up \n     the problems best when he said: ``Others have called it \n     [unfunded Federal mandates] spending without representation. \n     Across this country, mayors and city councils and county \n     commissioners have no vote on whether these mandated \n     spending programs are appropriate for our cities. Yet, we \n     are forced to cut other budget items or raise taxes or \n     utility bills to pay for them because we must balance our \n     budget at our level.''\n       Mayor Ed Rendell of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was more \n     emphatic: ``What is happening is we are getting killed. In \n     most instances, we can't raise taxes. Many townships are at \n     the virtual legal cap that their State government puts on \n     them, or in my case in Philadelphia I took over a city that \n     had a $500 million cumulative deficit that had raised four \n     basic taxes 19 times in the 11 years prior to my becoming \n     mayor. We have driven out 30 percent of our tax base in that \n     time. I can't raise taxes, not because I want to get \n     reelected or because it is politically feasible to say that, \n     but because that would destroy what is left of our base, and \n     our base isn't good enough.''\n       Further, Mayor Rendell noted how Federal mandates forced \n     undesirable tradeoffs against tackling more needy local \n     problems: ``So when you pass a mandate down to us and we have \n     to pay for it, the police force goes down, the firefighting \n     force goes down. Recreation departments are in disrepair. Our \n     rec centers are in disrepair because our capital budget is \n     being sopped up by Federal mandates, by the need to pay for \n     Federal mandates.''\n       Susan Ritter, County Auditor, Renville County, North \n     Dakota, and David Worhatch, Township Trustee, Hudson, Ohio \n     gave their perspective of how Federal mandates negatively \n     impact the smallest of governments with a description of some \n     specific examples. Ms. Ritter noted that the town of \n     Sherwood, with a population of 286, will have to spend one \n     half of its annual budget on testing its water supply. Mr. \n     Worhatch noted how well-intentioned Federal mandates can have \n     unintended consequences at a township-level that thwart the \n     original purpose of the mandate. He pointed to strict \n     regulations that could force the closure of a local landfill. \n     That closure could lead to greater midnight dumping--an \n     undesirable result.\n       The Federal-State-local relationship is a complicated one. \n     It is a blurry line between where one level of government's \n     responsibility ends and another begins. Local officials decry \n     unfunded State mandates as much as they do unfunded Federal \n     ones. State officials then tell local officials that those \n     mandates aren't theirs, but rather that they come from the \n     Federal government and that States are just the conduit. \n     The Federal government officials sometimes accuse State \n     and local governments of falling down on their share of \n     responsibilities when using Federal aid to carry out a \n     Federal program. Likewise, State and local governments say \n     that the regulations that go with accepting that aid are \n     too onerous, and getting more so. They blame Federal \n     agencies for promulgating burdensome and inflexible \n     regulations. The agencies say that it is not their fault \n     and claim that they are only carrying out the will of \n     Congress in implementing statutes. Congress asserts that \n     agencies have the statutory authority to allow State and \n     local governments more leeway and flexibility in \n     regulation and that therefore the responsibility lies \n     there. What is lost in the debate is need for all levels \n     of government to work together in a constructive fashion \n     to provide the best possible delivery of services to the \n     American people in the most cost-effective fashion. Vice \n     President Gore's National Performance Review recognizes \n     this fundamental issue in its report--``Strengthening the \n     Partnership in Intergovernmental Service Delivery.'' The \n     report notes:\n       ``Americans increasingly feel that public institutions and \n     programs aren't working. In fact, serious social and economic \n     problems seem to be getting worse. The percentage of low-\n     birth-weight babies, the number of single teens having \n     babies, and arrest rapes for juveniles committing violent \n     crimes are rising; the percentage of children graduating from \n     high school is falling; welfare rolls and prison populations \n     are swelling; median incomes for families with children are \n     falling; more than half of children in female-headed \n     households are poor; and 37 million Americans have no basic \n     health care or not enough.''\n       ``Why? At least part of the answer lies in an increasingly \n     hidebound and paralyzed intergovernmental process.''\n       The report goes on to explain how the 140 Federal programs \n     designed to help families and children are administered by 10 \n     departments and 2 independent agencies. Fifteen percent of \n     them are directly administered by the Federal government, 40 \n     percent by States, and the remaining 40 percent by local, \n     private or public groups.\n       Whether these programs, as well as many other Federal \n     programs, work or not hinges on the ability of Federal, State \n     and local to work together as partners in carrying the \n     [[Page S647]] program's responsibilities. When that \n     coordination breaks down, the whole program suffers and \n     program's objectives, be they improved environmental \n     protection, reduced crime, better education, etc., fall \n     short.\n       State and local officials emphasized in the Committee's \n     hearings of November 3, 1993, April 28, 1994, and January 5, \n     1995, that over the last decade the Federal government has \n     not treated them as partners in the providing of effective \n     governmental services to the American people, but rather as \n     agents or extensions of the Federal bureaucracy. In their \n     view this lack of coordination and cooperation has not only \n     effected the provision of services as a local level but also \n     carriers with it the penalty of high costs, costs that they \n     then pass on to local citizens.\n\n     A. The cost of Federal mandates to State and local governments\n\n       There has been substantial debate on the actual costs of \n     Federal mandates as well as on their indirect costs and \n     benefits. Suffice it to say that almost all participants in \n     the debate would conclude that there is not complete data on \n     the aggregate cost of Federal mandates to State and local \n     governments. So there is a need to develop a baseline of what \n     the aggregate cost of Federal mandates is to State and local \n     budgets.\n       Notwithstanding the difficulty in preparing reliable cost \n     estimates, the Committee believes that a strengthened and \n     more thorough analytical process applied to legislation and \n     regulation that impacts State, local and tribal governments \n     is not only worthwhile, but achievable. There have been good \n     faith efforts made in the past to measure the cost impacts of \n     Federal intergovernmental mandates.\n       The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations' \n     (ACIR) 1993 report ``Federal Regulation of State and Local \n     Governments: The Mixed Record of the 1980s'' examined the \n     procedures by which Congress measures the impact of \n     legislation on State and local governments. Since 1981, the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has been preparing cost \n     estimates on major legislation reported by Committee that is \n     expected to have an annual cost to State and local \n     governments in excess of $200 million. According to CBO, on \n     average roughly 10 to 20 reported bills per year exceed to \n     $200 million threshold. These figures translate to between 2 \n     and 4 percent of the total number of bills reported out of \n     Committee. CBO estimates that about 11 percent of all bills \n     reported out of Committee each year have some cost impact on \n     State and local governments. A breakout on a year-by-year \n     basis between 1983 and 1988 is shown below.\n\n                       TABLE 5-5.--STATE AND LOCAL COST ESTIMATES PREPARED BY CBO, 1983-88                      \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Estimates prepared         1983      1984      1985      1986      1987      1988       Total      Average \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor bill approved by                                                                                            \n committee..................       483       554       367       465       393       559       2,821         470\nOther.......................        90        87       166       125       138       127         733         122\n                             -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total.................       573       641       533       590       531       686       3,554         592\n                             ===================================================================================\nEstimates with no state/                                                                                        \n local cost.................       496       584       488       543       448       598       3,157         526\nPercent.....................        87        91        92        92        84        87          89          89\nEstimates with some cost....        77        57        45        47        83        73         382          64\nPercent.....................        13         9         8         8        16        11          11          11\nEstimates with impact above                                                                                     \n $200 million...............        24         6        14         8        22        15          89          15\nPercent of total............         4         1         3         1         4         2           3           3\nPercent of bills with some                                                                                      \n cost.......................        31        11        31        17        26        21          23         23 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource.--Congressional Budget Office Bill Estimates Tracking System, in Theresa A. Gullo, ``Estimating the      \n  Impact of Federal Legislation on State and Local Governments,'' in Michael Fix and Daphne A. Kenyon, eds.,    \n  ``Coping with Mandates: What Are the Alternatives?'' (Washington, DC: Urban Institute Press, 1990), p. 43.    \n\n       The Committee also asked CBO to provide it with more recent \n     cost estimates and to examine the number of bills that cross \n     a $100 million annual threshold. In 1991, CBO scored 5 bills \n     to cost State and local governments in excess of $100 million \n     apiece. Another 8 bills had significant costs to State and \n     local governments, but fell under the $100 million threshold. \n     Further, CBO determined that for another 6 pieces of \n     legislation for which they were unable to come up with \n     specific estimates--5 bills would probably fall under the \n     $100 million mark, one would probably exceed that total.\n       In testimony before the Committee on April 28, 1994, Dr. \n     Robert Reischauer, Director of CBO, noted that preparing \n     thorough and reliable State and local cost estimates is not \n     easy. He presented the following reasons for the difficulty \n     CBO sometimes has in preparing the estimates: Preparing the \n     estimates requires the use of many different methodologies; \n     the estimating process does not always yield firm estimates. \n     Further, completing the estimates does take time--time that \n     may not be readily available in the normal legislative \n     process; and, legislative language may lack the detail \n     necessary to estimate the costs.\n       Dr. Reischauer further stated that these constraints apply \n     even more so to the preparation of cost estimates on private \n     sector mandates. The Committee does believe that part of \n     CBO's difficulty in performing these estimates lies in CBO \n     not having adequate resources to conduct the estimates. \n     Therefore, S. 1 authorizes an increase in funding for CBO of \n     $4.5 million for each of Fiscal Years 1996 through 2002. \n     CBO's budget currently stands at just over $23 million.\n       Federal environmental mandates head the list of areas that \n     State and local officials have claimed to be most burdensome. \n     A closer look at two of the studies done on the cost to State \n     and local governments of compliance with environmental \n     statutes does indicate these costs appear to be rising. A \n     1990 EPA study (prepared in conjunction with the \n     Environmental Law Institute) ``Environmental Investments: The \n     Cost of a Clean Environment,'' estimates that total costs of \n     environmental mandates (from all levels of government) to \n     State and local governments will rise (in constant 1986 \n     dollars) from $22.2 billion in 1987 to $37.1 billion by the \n     year 2000--a real increase of 67 percent. According to the \n     Vice President's National Performance Review report on the \n     EPA, this figure when adjusted for inflation reaches close to \n     $44 billion on an annual basis by the year 2000. EPA \n     estimates that costs to local government will increase the \n     most (70 percent) while the impact on State governments is \n     less (48 percent), but still significant. Over the 13 year \n     span, the average real increase in costs to State and local \n     governments translates to 5.2 percent on an annual basis.

These estimates use a mid-range discount rate of 7      \n  percent and include funding to meet EPA's air, water, land, chemicals,\n  and multi-media regulations.                                          \n\n       The City of Columbus, Ohio also noted a trend in rising \n     costs for city compliance with Federal environmental mandates \n     in its study: ``Environmental Legislation: The Increasing \n     Costs of Regulatory Compliance to the City of Columbus.'' The \n     City examined its cost of compliance with 13 Federal \n     environmental and health statutes and concluded that its cost \n     of compliance with those statutes would rise from $62.1 \n     million in 1991 to $107.4 million in 1995 (in 1991 constant \n     dollars), a 73 percent increase. The City estimates that its \n     share of the total city budget going to pay for these \n     mandates will increase from 10.6 percent to 18.3 percent over \n     that timeframe. These calculations were based on \n     an unchanging total city budget between 1991 and 1995; \n     assuming a 3 percent annual real growth rate in the budget \n     reveals a lesser increase from 10.6 percent to 16.1 \n     percent.\n       In addition to environmental requirements, State and local \n     officials cite other Federal requirements as burdensome and \n     costly: compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     and the Motor Voter Registration Act; complying with the \n     administrative requirements that go with implementing many \n     Federal programs; meeting Federal criminal justice and \n     educational program requirements. While all these programs \n     clearly carry with them costs to State and local governments, \n     they can have benefits both to society as a whole--a fact \n     that State and local officials concede. It is the aggregate \n     impact of all Federal mandates that has spurred the calls for \n     mandate reform and relief. However, to truly reach a better \n     understanding of the Federal mandates debate, it is necessary \n     to look at the Federal funding picture.\n\n             B. Federal aid to State and local governments\n\n       It is readily apparent that Federal discretionary aid to \n     State and local governments both to implement Federal \n     policies and directives as well as to comply with them saw a \n     sharp drop in the 1980s before rising again in the early \n     1990s--although in real terms Federal aid is still \n     significantly below its earlier levels.\n       An examination of Census Bureau data on sources of State \n     and local government revenue shows a decreasing Federal role \n     in funding to State and local governments. In 1979, the \n     Federal government's contribution to State and local \n     government revenues reached 18.6 percent. By 1989, the \n     Federal share of the State and local revenue pie had steadily \n     shrank to 13.2 percent before edging [[Page S648]] up to 14.3 \n     percent in 1991--the latest year that data is available (see \n     accompanying chart).\n\n  The Federal Government's contribution to State and local government \n                        revenues\\1\\ (1970-1991)\n\n                          Percent of State and local government revenue\nYear:\n  1970.............................................................14.6\n  1971.............................................................15.8\n  1972.............................................................16.4\n  1973.............................................................18.0\n  1974.............................................................17.6\n  1975.............................................................17.8\n  1976.............................................................18.3\n  1977.............................................................18.5\n  1978.............................................................18.7\n  1979.............................................................18.6\n  1980.............................................................18.4\n  1981.............................................................17.8\n  1982.............................................................15.9\n  1983.............................................................15.2\n  1984.............................................................14.9\n  1985.............................................................14.7\n  1986.............................................................14.4\n  1987.............................................................13.6\n  1988.............................................................13.3\n  1989.............................................................13.2\n  1990.............................................................13.3\n  1991.............................................................14.3\n\n\\1\\U.S. Census Bureau--Government Finances Series, 1970-1991. Chart \ntabulated by Staff of Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n       A closer look at patterns in Federal discretionary grants-\n     in-aid programs during the 1980s confirms the finding that \n     the Federal government lessened its financial support of \n     State and local governments. According to the Federal Funds \n     Information Service (FFIS), between 1981 and 1990 Federal \n     discretionary funding to State and local governments rose \n     from $47.5 billion to $51.6 billion, a nominal increase of \n     8.6. percent. However, this figure when adjusted for \n     inflation (using the GDP Price Deflator) tells a much \n     different story: Federal aid dropped 28 percent over the \n     decade--a 3.1 percent real decline on an annual average \n     basis.\n       A number of significant Federal aid programs to State and \n     local governments experienced sharp cuts and, in some cases, \n     outright elimination during the decade. In 1986, the \n     Administration and Congress agreed to terminate the general \n     revenue sharing program--a program that provided \n     approximately $4.5 billion annually to local governments and \n     allowed them broad discretion on how to spend the funds. \n     Since its inception in 1972, general revenue sharing had \n     provided approximately $83 billion to State and local \n     governments. Funding for Urban Development Action Grants, \n     another significant program, was also terminated within \n     this timeframe.\n       Between 1981 and 1990, funding for numerous Federal-State-\n     local government grant programs was substantially trimmed, \n     among them: Economic Development Assistance (47.5 percent--\n     decrease is in nominal dollars), Community Development Block \n     Grants (21.1 percent), Mass Transit (30.2 percent), Refugee \n     Assistance (38.4 percent), and Low-Income Home Energy \n     Assistance (17.6 percent). These cuts were partially offset \n     by increases in funding in other areas--primarily in housing \n     and health and human services programs.\n       The early 1990s saw a resurgence in funding for Federal-\n     State-local discretionary aid programs. Funding rose from \n     $51.6 billion in 1990 to $67.4 billion in 1993, a nominal \n     increase of 30.6 percent and an inflation-adjusted average \n     annual gain of 5.6 percent. This growth was driven primarily \n     by expansions in funding for Head Start, Highway Funding, and \n     Compensatory Education. Still, even with this recent growth, \n     between 1980 and 1993 discretionary funding declined 18.2 \n     percent in real dollars--an average annual real decrease of \n     1.4 percent.\n       In simple terms, over the last decade or so, State and \n     local governments have gotten less of the Federal carrot and \n     more of the Federal stick. The Committee has responded to \n     State and local officials' calls for change, and has reported \n     out bipartisan mandate reform legislation.\n\n\n                        III. LEGISLATIVE HISTORY\n\n       In the 103rd Congress, eight bills were introduced and \n     referred to the Committee that addressed, at least in part, \n     the subject of Federal mandates on State and local \n     governments. Bill sponsors included: S. 480--Levin; S. 563--\n     Moseley-Braun; S. 648--Gregg; S. 993--Kempthorne; S. 1188--\n     Coverdell; S. 1592--Dorgan; S. 1604--Glenn; and, S. 1606--\n     Sasser. Several major concepts were contained in most of the \n     bills, among them: analysis of the costs of legislation and \n     regulation on State and local governments; a prohibition or \n     restriction on new Federal mandates without funding; and, \n     points of order enforcement. Senator Kempthorne's \n     legislation, the original S. 993--the ``Community Regulatory \n     Relief Act of 1993''--had the strongest support, with more \n     than 50 cosponsors. After two hearings and extensive meetings \n     and discussions with State and local government \n     organizations, the Administration, Senators and their \n     staff, and the public interest community, the Committee \n     crafted a legislative proposal that drew from many of the \n     provisions of the eight bills, as well as incorporating \n     several new provisions.\n       On June 16, the Committee marked up and reported out S. 993 \n     with an amendment and an amendment to the title. Chairman \n     Glenn offered a substitute bill to the original Kempthorne \n     Bill, titled the ``Federal Mandate Accountability and Reform \n     Act of 1994'', which passed by unanimous voice vote. Several \n     other amendments offered by members of the Committee were \n     also adopted, including an amendment by Senator Dorgan to \n     include the private sector under the CBO and Committee \n     mandate cost analysis requirements of Title I of S. 993, and \n     a Glenn amendment to allow CBO to waive the private sector \n     cost analysis if CBO cannot make a ``reasonable estimate'' of \n     the bill's cost.\n       S. 993 as amended and reported by the Committee was \n     considered by the Senate on October 6, 1994, without a time \n     agreement. After some debate and the introduction of several \n     additional amendments to the bill, the Senate proceeded to \n     other items without taking any votes. The Senate adjourned \n     without further consideration of S. 993.\n       In the 104th Congress, Senator Kempthorne introduced S. 1--\n     the ``Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995''--on January 4, \n     1995, and the bill was concurrently referred both to the \n     Governmental Affairs Committee. On January 5, the \n     Governmental Affairs Committee held a joint hearing on the \n     bill with the Budget Committee. On January 9, the \n     Governmental Affairs Committee voted to report the bill, S. \n     1, by a vote of 9-4 after adopting an amendment by Senator \n     Glenn and two by Senator Levin. Voting ``aye'' were Senators \n     Roth, Stevens, Cohen, Thompson, Cochran, Grassley, Smith, \n     Glenn, and Nunn (with Senators McCain and Dorgan voting \n     ``aye'' by proxy). Voting ``nay'' were Senators Levin, Pryor, \n     Lieberman, and Akaka.\n\n\n                    IV. SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS\n\n       S. 1 sets up a legislative and regulatory framework that is \n     based on three relatively simple concepts:\n       To better understand the impact of Federal mandates on \n     State, local and tribal governments, and on the private \n     sector, before policymakers act in either the Congress or the \n     Executive Branch.\n       To ensure that the needs and views of State and \n     local governments are given full consideration before the \n     Congress or the Executive Branch imposes new Federal \n     mandates without funding.\n       To establish a point of order in the Congress against \n     unfunded federal mandates on State, local and tribal \n     governments.\n       A more detailed description of the most important \n     provisions in the bill follows below.\n\n                         Section 1. Short Title\n\n       This section identifies the short title as the ``Unfunded \n     Mandate Reform Act of 1995.''\n\n                          Section 2. Purposes\n\n       This section establishes the purposes of the Act.\n\n                         Section 3. Definitions\n\n       This section breaks the definition of Federal mandates into \n     two components: Federal intergovernmental mandates and \n     Federal private sector mandates.\n       The section amends the Congressional Budget and Impoundment \n     Control Act of 1974, by adding several new definitions. It \n     stipulates that a ``Federal intergovernmental mandate'' means \n     any legislation, or a provision therein, or regulation that \n     imposes a legally binding duty on State, local or tribal \n     governments. This would include legislation or regulation \n     that seeks to eliminate or reduce the authorization of \n     appropriations of Federal financial assistance to State, \n     local and tribal governments should they not comply with that \n     legislation's or regulation's duties. The subsection also \n     provides that legislation or regulation would be considered a \n     Federal intergovernmental mandate if it sought to reduce or \n     eliminate an existing authorization of appropriations for the \n     purposes of complying with some previously imposed duty. The \n     Committee believes that if the Federal Government imposes \n     legally binding duties on State, local or tribal governments, \n     and provides financial assistance to them to carry out or \n     comply with those duties, then S. 1's provisions should apply \n     if the Federal government subsequently reduces the \n     authorization of that aid, while continuing to keep the \n     existing duties in place. Exempted from the provisions of \n     this subsection is legislation or regulation that authorizes \n     or implements a voluntary discretionary aid program to \n     State, local and tribal governments that has requirements \n     or conditions of participation specific to that program.\n       Included, as part of the definition of Federal \n     intergovernmental mandates, are Federal entitlement programs \n     that provide $500 million or more annually to State, local or \n     tribal governments. This would currently include nine large \n     Federal entitlement programs, seven of which are either \n     exempt from sequestration or subject to a special rule under \n     the Budget Act. The nine are: Medicaid; AFDC; Child \n     Nutrition; Food Stamps; Social Security Block Grants; \n     Vocational Rehabilitation State Grants; Foster Care, Adoption \n     Assistance, and Independent Living; Family Support Welfare \n     Services; and, Child Support Enforcement. Any legislation or \n     regulation would be considered a Federal intergovernmental \n     mandate if it: (a) increases the stringency of State, local \n     or tribal government participation in any one of these nine \n     programs, or (b) caps or decreases the Federal government's \n     responsibility to provide funds to State, local or tribal \n     governments to implement the program, including a shifting of \n     costs from the Federal government to those governments. The \n     legislation or regulation would not be considered a Federal \n     intergovernmental [[Page S649]] mandate if it allows those \n     governments the flexibility to amend their specific \n     programmatic or financial responsibilities within the program \n     while still remaining eligible to participate in that \n     program. In addition to the nine previously-mentioned \n     programs, also included are any new Federal-State-local \n     entitlement programs (above the $500 million threshold) that \n     may be created after the enactment of this Act. The Committee \n     has included this provision in the legislation because of its \n     concern over past and possible future shifting of the costs \n     of entitlement programs by the Federal government onto State \n     governments.\n       ``Federal private sector mandate'' is defined to include \n     any legislation, or a provision therein, that imposes a \n     legally binding duty on the private sector.\n       ``Direct costs'' is defined to mean aggregate estimated \n     amounts that State, local and tribal governments, and the \n     private sector will have to spend in order to comply with a \n     Federal mandate. Direct costs of Federal mandates are net \n     costs; estimated savings will be subtracted from total costs. \n     Further, direct costs do not include costs that State, local \n     and tribal governments and the private sector currently incur \n     or will incur to implement the requirements of existing \n     Federal law or regulation. In addition, the direct costs of a \n     Federal mandate must not include costs being borne by those \n     governments and the private sector as the result of \n     carrying out a State or local government mandate. Finally, \n     the Committee intends that direct costs be calculated on \n     the assumption that State, local and tribal governments \n     and the private sector are in compliance with relevant \n     codes and standards of practice established by recognized \n     professional organizations or trade associations.\n       ``Private sector'' is defined to cover all persons or \n     entities in the United States except for State, local or \n     tribal governments. It includes individuals, partnerships, \n     associations, corporations, and educational and nonprofit \n     institutions.\n       Independent regulatory agencies are excluded from the \n     definition of a Federal ``agency''. The definition of ``small \n     government'' is made consistent with existing Federal law \n     which classifies a government as small if its population is \n     less than 50,000. ``Tribal government'' is defined according \n     to existing law.\n\n                         Section 4. Exclusions\n\n       The Committee believes that several types of unfunded \n     mandates should be properly excluded from the requirements of \n     this Act. These include Federal legislation or regulation \n     that: enforces constitutional rights of individuals; \n     establishes or enforces statutory rights to prohibit \n     discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, \n     national origin, or handicapped or disability status; \n     requires compliance with Federal auditing and accounting \n     procedures; provides emergency relief assistance or is \n     designated as emergency legislation; and, is necessary for \n     national security or ratification or implementation of \n     international treaties.\n       A number of these exemptions are standard in many pieces of \n     legislation in order to recognize the domain of the President \n     in foreign affairs and as Commander-in-Chief as well as to \n     ensure that Congress' and the Executive Branch's hands are \n     not tied with procedural requirements in times of national \n     emergencies. Further, the Committee thinks that Federal \n     auditing, accounting and other similar requirements designed \n     to protect Federal funds from potential waste, fraud, and \n     abuse should be exempt from the Act.\n       The Committee recognizes the special circumstances and \n     history surrounding the enactment and enforcement of Federal \n     civil rights laws. During the middle part of the 20th \n     century, the arguments of those who opposed the national, \n     uniform extension of basic equal rights, protection, and \n     opportunity to all individuals were based on a States \n     rights philosophy. With the passage of the Civil Rights \n     Acts of 1957 and 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, \n     Congress rejected that argument out of hand as designed to \n     thwart equal opportunity and to protect discriminatory, \n     unjust and unfair practices in the treatment of \n     individuals in certain parts of the country. The Committee \n     therefore exempts Federal civil rights laws from the \n     requirements of this Act.\n\n                      Section 5. Agency Assistance\n\n       Under this section, the Committee intends for Federal \n     agencies to provide information, technical assistance, and \n     other assistance to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) as \n     CBO might need and reasonably request that might be helpful \n     in preparing the legislation cost estimates as required by \n     Title I. Through the implementation of various Presidential \n     Executive Orders over the last decade, agencies have \n     developed a wealth of expertise and data on the cost of \n     legislation and regulation on State, local and tribal \n     government and the private sector. CBO should be able to tap \n     into that expertise in a useful and timely manner. Other \n     Congressional support agencies may also have developed \n     information on cost estimates and the estimating process \n     which might be helpful to CBO in performing its duties. CBO \n     should not attempt to duplicate analytical work already being \n     done by the other support agencies, but rather use as needed \n     that information.\n\n\n             Title I--Legislative Accountability and Reform\n\n       Section 101. Legislative mandate accountability and reform\n\n       This section amends title IV of the Congressional Budget \n     and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 by creating a new section \n     408 on Legislative Mandate Accountability and Reform. \n     Subsection (a) establishes procedures and requirements for \n     Committee reports accompanying legislation that imposes a \n     Federal mandate. It requires a committee, when it orders \n     reported legislation containing Federal mandates, to promptly \n     provide the reported bill to CBO so that it can be scored. \n     The Committee is concerned that the CBO scoring process not \n     unnecessarily impede or slow the legislative process. With \n     this view in mind, the Committee would urge the relevant \n     authorizing committees to work closely with CBO during the \n     committee process to ensure that legislation containing \n     federal mandates, as well as possible related amendments to \n     be offered in markup, be scored in a timely fashion.\n       The committee report shall include: an identification and \n     description of Federal mandates in the bill, including an \n     estimate of their expected direct costs to State, local and \n     tribal governments and the private sector, and a qualitative \n     assessment of the costs and benefits of the Federal mandates, \n     including their anticipated costs and benefits to human \n     health and safety and protection of the natural environment. \n     If a mandate affects both the public and the private sectors, \n     and it is intended that the Federal Government pay the public \n     sector costs, the report should also state what effect, if \n     any, this would have on any competitive balance between \n     government and privately owned business.\n       Some Federal mandates will affect both the public and \n     private sectors in similar, and in some cases nearly \n     identical, ways. For example, the costs of compliance with \n     minimum wage laws or environmental standards for landfill \n     operations or municipal waste incinceration are incurred by \n     both sectors. There has been some concern expressed that \n     subsidization of the public sector in these cases could \n     create a competitive advantage for activities owned by State, \n     local or tribal governments in those areas where they compete \n     with the private sector. In any instance where this might be \n     the case, Congress should be aware of that impact and the \n     effect on the continuing ability of private enterprises to \n     remain viable, and carefully consider whether the granting of \n     a competitive advantage to the public sector is fair and \n     appropriate.\n       For Federal intergovernmental mandates, Committee reports \n     must also contain a statement of the amount, if any, of \n     increased authorization of Federal financial assistance to \n     fund the costs of the intergovernmental mandates.\n       This section also requires the authorizing Committee to \n     state in the report whether it intends the Federal \n     intergovernmental mandate to be funded or not. There may be \n     occasions when a Committee decides that it is entirely \n     appropriate that State, local or tribal governments should \n     bear the cost of a mandate without receiving Federal aid. If \n     so, the Committee report should state this and give an \n     explanation for it. Likewise, the Committee report must state \n     the extent to which the reported legislation preempts State, \n     local or tribal law, and, if so, explain the reasons why. To \n     the maximum extent possible, this intention to preempt should \n     also be clear in the statutory language.\n       Also set out in this section are procedures to ensure that \n     the Committee publishes the CBO cost estimate, either in the \n     Committee report or in the Congressional Record prior to \n     floor consideration of the legislation.\n\n                         Duties of the Director\n\n       New section 408(b) of the Congressional Budget and \n     Impoundment Control Act requires that the Director of CBO \n     analyze and prepare a statement on all bills reported by \n     committees of the Senate or House of Representatives other \n     than appropriations committees. This subsection stipulates, \n     first, that the Director of CBO must estimate whether all \n     direct costs of Federal intergovernmental mandates in the \n     bill will equal or exceed a threshold of $50,000,000 \n     annually. If the Director estimates that the direct costs \n     will be below this threshold, the Director must state this \n     fact in his statement on the bill, and must briefly explain \n     the estimate. (Although this provision requires only a \n     determination by CBO that the threshold will not be equalled \n     or exceeded, if, in cases below the threshold, the Director \n     actually estimates the amount of direct costs, the Committee \n     expects that he will include that estimate in his explanatory \n     statement.) If the Director estimates that the direct costs \n     will equal or exceed the threshold, the Director must so \n     state and provide an explanation, and must also prepare the \n     required estimates.\n       In estimating whether the threshold will be equalled or \n     exceeded, the director must consider direct costs in the year \n     when the Federal intergovernmental mandate will first be \n     effective, plus each of the succeeding four fiscal years. In \n     some cases, the new duties or conditions that constitute the \n     mandate will not become effective against State, local and \n     tribal governments when the statute becomes effective, but \n     will become effective when the implementing regulations \n     become effective. In such cases, the Director must consider \n     direct costs in the first fiscal year when the regulations \n     are to become effective, and each of the next four fiscal \n     years.\n       The $50,000,000 threshold in this legislation for Federal \n     intergovernmental mandates is [[Page S650]] significantly \n     lower than the threshold of $200,000,000 in the State and \n     Local Cost Estimate Act of 1981 (2 U.S.C. 403(c)). The \n     threshold in the 1981 Act also included a test of whether the \n     proposed legislation is likely to have an exceptional fiscal \n     consequence for a geographic region or a level of government. \n     The Committee believes that, in the context of this present \n     legislation, applying a threshold for specific geographic \n     regions or levels of government would be too subjective or \n     too complex. However, the significantly lowered threshold \n     of S. 1 should provide an extra margin of protection for \n     particular geographic regions or levels of government \n     affected by Federal intergovernmental mandates.\n       If the Director determines that the direct costs of the \n     Federal intergovernmental mandates will equal or exceed the \n     threshold, he must make the required additional estimates and \n     place them in the statement. These additional estimates may \n     be summarized as follows:\n       An estimate of the total amount of direct costs of the \n     Federal intergovernmental mandates. This is an aggregate \n     amount, broken out on an annual basis over the 5-year period.\n       An estimate of any increase in the bill in authorization of \n     appropriations for Federal financial assistance programs \n     usable by the State, local, and tribal governments for \n     activities subject to the Federal intergovernmental mandates.\n       The amount of increase in authorization of appropriations \n     would be calculated, as the sum of the increased budget \n     authority of any Federal grant assistance, plus the increased \n     subsidy amount of any loan guarantees or direct loans.\n       The Director of CBO must also estimate first whether all \n     direct costs of Federal private sector mandates in the bill \n     will equal or exceed a threshold of $200,000,000 annually. In \n     making this estimate, the Director must consider direct costs \n     in the year when the Federal private sector mandate will \n     first be effective, plus each of the succeeding four fiscal \n     years. In some cases, the new duties or conditions that \n     constitute the mandate will not become effective for the \n     private sector when the statute becomes effective, but will \n     become effective when the implementing regulations become \n     effective. In such cases, the Director must consider direct \n     costs in the first fiscal year when the regulations become \n     effective, and each of the next four fiscal years. If the \n     Director estimates that the direct costs will equal or exceed \n     the threshold, the Director must so state and provide an \n     explanation, and must also prepare the required estimates. \n     These additional estimates may be summarized as follows:\n       An estimate of the total amount of direct costs of the \n     Federal private sector mandates. This is an aggregate amount, \n     broke out annually over the 5-year period.\n       An estimate of any increase in the bill in authorization of \n     appropriations for Federal financial assistance programs \n     usable by the private sector for activities subject to the \n     Federal private sector mandates.\n       If the Director determines that it is not feasible for him \n     to make a reasonable estimate that would be required with \n     respect to Federal private sector mandates, the Director \n     shall not make the estimate, but shall report in the \n     statement that the reasonable estimate cannot be reasonably \n     made. No corresponding section applies for Federal \n     intergovernmental mandates.\n       If the Director estimates that the direct costs of a \n     Federal mandate will be below the specified threshold, the \n     Director must state this fact in his statement on the bill, \n     and must briefly explain the estimate. (Although this \n     provision requires only a determination from CBO of whether \n     the threshold will or will not be exceeded, if, in cases \n     below the threshold, the Director actually estimates the \n     amount of direct costs, the Committee expects that he will \n     include this estimate in his explanatory statement.)\n\n                      Point of order in the Senate\n\n       This section provides that a point of order lies against \n     any bill or joint resolution reported by a committee that \n     contains a Federal mandate, but does not contain a CBO \n     estimate of the mandate's direct costs. A point of order \n     would also lie against any bill, joint resolution, amendment, \n     motion, or conference report that increased the costs of a \n     Federal intergovernmental mandate by an amount that caused \n     the $50,000,000 threshold to be exceeded, unless that same \n     amount were fully funded to State, local and tribal \n     governments.\n       Such action would have to specify that the funding of the \n     mandate's full costs would be by way of; (1) an increase in \n     entitlement spending with a resulting increase in the Federal \n     budget deficit, (2) an increase in direct spending paid for \n     by an increase in tax receipts, or (3) an increase in the \n     authorization of appropriations.\n       If the third alternative is used (authorization of \n     appropriations), the specific appropriation bill that is \n     expected to provide funding must be identified. The mandate \n     legislation must also designate a responsible Federal agency \n     that shall either: implement an appropriately less costly \n     mandate if less than full funding is ultimately appropriated \n     (pursuant to criteria and procedures also provided in the \n     mandate legislation), or declare such mandate to be \n     ineffective. In other words, the authorizing committee should \n     expect that unless it expressly plans otherwise, its \n     mandate will be voided if the appropriations committee at \n     any point in the future under-funds the mandate. \n     Therefore, if a ``less money, less mandate'' alternative \n     is both feasible and desired, it is incumbent upon the \n     authorizing committee to specify how the agency shall \n     implement that alternative.\n       Appropriations bills are not subject to a point of order \n     under this section. If such a bill did seek to impose a \n     federal mandate, it would likely be subject to the point of \n     order that lies against legislating on an appropriations \n     bill.\n       The Committee expects that during those instances when the \n     Parliamentarian must rule on a point of order under this \n     section, there may be occasions when there is a need for \n     consultation regarding the applicability of this Act. This \n     section provides that on all such questions that are not \n     within the purview of either the House or Senate Budget \n     Committee, it is the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee or \n     House Government Reform and Oversight Committee that shall \n     make the final determination. For example, on the question of \n     whether a particular mandate is properly excluded from \n     coverage of the Act as bill which enforces constitutional \n     rights of individuals, the Governmental Affairs Committee \n     would be the appropriate committee to consult. On a question \n     regarding the particular cost of such a mandate, the Budget \n     Committee would be the appropriate committee.\n\n        Section 102. Enforcement in the House of Representatives\n\n       This section specifies the procedures to be followed in the \n     House of Representatives in enforcing the provisions of this \n     Act.\n\n           Section 103. Assistance to committees and studies\n\n       This section requires the Director of CBO to consult with \n     and assist committees of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives, at their request, in analyzing proposed \n     legislation that may have a significant budgetary impact on \n     State, local or tribal governments or a significant financial \n     impact on the private sector. It provides for the assistance \n     that committees will need for CBO to fulfill their \n     obligations under the provisions of S. 1.\n       This section also states that CBO should set up a process \n     to allow meaningful input from those knowledgeable, affected, \n     and concerned about the Federal mandates in question. One \n     possible way to establish this process is through the \n     formation of advisory panels made up to relevant outside \n     experts. The Committee leaves it to the discretion of the \n     Director as to when and where it is appropriate to form an \n     advisory panel; however, the Committee does encourage the \n     Director to form these panels where feasible and helpful \n     in performing the requisite studies. The membership of the \n     panels should represent a fair balance of interests and \n     constituencies, as well as include those expert in the \n     areas of economic and budgetary analysis, but the \n     Committee believes that when the Director convenes an \n     advisory panel, he should appoint State, local or tribal \n     officials (including their designated representatives) to \n     the panels.\n       This section encourages authorizing committees to take a \n     prospective look at the impact of Federal intergovernmental \n     and private sector mandates before considering new \n     legislation. It stipulates that committees should request \n     that CBO undertake studies in the early part of each Congress \n     of the potential budgetary and financial impact of Federal \n     mandates in major legislation expected to be considered in \n     that Congress.\n\n              Section 104. Authorization of appropriations\n\n       This paragraph authorizes appropriations for CBO of \n     $4,500,000 per year for FY 1996 through 2002. The Committee \n     recognizes that additional resources and personnel are needed \n     for CBO to fully perform its duties under this Act along with \n     continuing to carry out its current responsibilities. The \n     Committee understands that the current policy and practice at \n     CBO is to rely on in-house personnel to conduct studies and \n     cost estimates, rather than contracting these duties to \n     outside entities. The Committee supports this policy and \n     urges the Appropriations Committee, in funding this \n     authorization, to increase CBO's authority to hire additional \n     personnel in order to fulfill its new duties under this Act.\n\n               Section 105. Exercise of rulemaking powers\n\n       This section provides that the terms of title I are enacted \n     as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives, and that either house may change \n     such rules at any time.\n\n  Section 106. Repeal of the State and Local Cost Estimate Act of 1981\n\n       This paragraph rescinds the provisions of the State and \n     Local Cost Estimate Act of 1981.\n\n                      Section 107. Effective date\n\n       Title I will take effect on January 1, 1996 and apply only \n     to legislation introduced on or after that date. This is to \n     give CBO the time to develop the proper methodologies and \n     analytical techniques in order to develop a more thorough \n     cost estimating process, as well as to give Congress \n     opportunity to provide adequate resources to CBO in the \n     annual appropriations process.\n\n\n             Title II--Regulatory Accountability and Reform\n\n                    Section 201. Regulatory process\n\n       Under this section, agencies must assess the effects of \n     their regulations on State, local and tribal governments, and \n     the private sector, including resources available to \n     [[Page S651]] carry out Federal intergovernmental mandates \n     contained in those regulations. In keeping with both \n     statutory and regulatory objectives, agencies shall seek ways \n     to minimize regulatory burdens that significantly effect \n     State, local and tribal governments.\n       Subsection (b) requires agencies to develop an effective \n     process to permit elected officials of those governments (or \n     their designated representatives) to provide meaningful and \n     timely input into the development of regulatory proposals \n     that contain significant Federal intergovernmental mandates. \n     This provision mirrors Section 1(b) of President Clinton's \n     Executive Order 12875--``Enhancing the Intergovernmental \n     Partnership''--which seeks to establish a closer partnership \n     between Federal agencies and elected and other State, local \n     and tribal officials in the regulatory process. The Committee \n     expects agencies to fully and faithfully implement this \n     section as well as the other provisions in the E.O. On \n     January 11, 1994, OMB Director Leon Panetta and OIRA \n     Administrator Sally Katzen issued guidance on the \n     implementation of the E.O. Concerning Section 1 of the E.O., \n     that guidance states, ``intergovernmental consultation should \n     take place as early as possible, and preferably before \n     publication of the notice of proposed rulemaking or other \n     regulatory action proposing the mandate. Consultations may \n     continue after publication of the regulatory action \n     initiating the proposal, but in any event they must occur \n     `prior to the formal promulgation' in final form of the \n     regulatory action `containing the proposed mandate.''' Early \n     and extensive intergovernmental consultation can help promote \n     the development of more cost-effective Federal regulation as \n     well as help all the participants in the process reach a \n     better understanding of the proper needs and responsibilities \n     of each level of government in implementing or complying with \n     a Federal requirement.\n       OMB's guidance also outlines with whom agencies \n     should consult in State, local and tribal government. The \n     Committee feels strongly that agencies should follow the \n     OMB guidance concerning consultation with elected \n     officials, including their representatives, from all \n     levels of smaller governments because these officials are \n     responsible for balancing the competing claims on the \n     government's revenue base from many program \n     responsibilities. The OMB guidance further discusses how \n     Federal agencies should also confer with the designated \n     representatives of elected officials as well as with \n     program and financial officials from State, local and \n     tribal governments. program officials clearly are able to \n     offer information and guidance to their Federal \n     counterparts on the likely effectiveness of any Federal \n     regulatory proposal, while financial officials can offer \n     important perspectives on their government's ability to \n     pay for the mandate. In consulting with financial \n     officials, Federal agencies should look to the applicable \n     treasury, budget, tax-collection, or other financial \n     officers in State, local and tribal governments.\n       Subsection (b) also states that the intergovernmental \n     consultations should be consistent with the requirements \n     established in existing Federal law governing the regulatory \n     process. In particular, the Committee believes that agencies \n     must ensure that the consultation process not subvert or \n     violate in any way the public disclosure and sunshine \n     provisions of existing law and Executive Order, including the \n     Administrative Procedure Act.\n       Subsection (c)(1) has agencies establishing plans to \n     inform, advice, involve and consult with small governments \n     before implementing regulations that might significantly or \n     uniquely affect those governments. The Committee believes \n     that Federal agencies should undertake a special effort to \n     ensure that officials from small governments have an \n     opportunity for significant input into the regulatory \n     process. According to the Census Bureau, small governments \n     (population below 50,000) make up 97 percent of all general \n     purpose governments in the United States. A full 67 percent \n     of all general purpose governments serve fewer than 2,500 \n     people. Yet despite their prevalence, small governments have \n     a relatively small presence in the Nation's Capital where \n     Federal regulatory policies and decisions are made. It is the \n     Committee's sense that Federal agencies have not always been \n     aware of, or have adequately considered, small governments' \n     capabilities in implementing certain regulatory requirements. \n     This has resulted in the promulgation of regulations in \n     certain cases that have not only over-burdened small \n     governments to the point of widespread non-compliance, but in \n     so doing fails to achieve those regulations' goals \n     and objectives. The Committee believes that one way to \n     achieve the twin goals of more cost-effective regulation \n     and greater rates of compliance on significant regulations \n     that impact small governments is for agencies to establish \n     plans for outreach to small governments. Such plans might \n     incorporate activities such as greater technical \n     assistance to small governments; regional planning \n     activities, conferences, and workshops; and establishment \n     of small government advisory committees, or appointment of \n     small government representatives on existing advisory \n     committees. One good approach is embodied in the \n     recommendations of the National Performance Review Report \n     for the Environmental Protection Agency. The NPR EPA \n     Report recommends that the agency convene a series of town \n     meetings across the United States to discuss more flexible \n     ways to achieve environmental protection.\n\n  Section 202. Statements to accompany significant regulatory actions\n\n       This section states that before a Federal agency \n     promulgates any final rule or notice of proposed rulemaking \n     that includes any intergovernmental mandate that is estimated \n     to result in an annual aggregate expenditure of $100,000,000 \n     or more by State, local or tribal governments, and the \n     private sector, the agency must complete a written statement \n     containing the following:\n       Estimates of the anticipated costs to State, local and \n     tribal governments, and the private sector, of compliance \n     with the mandate, including the availability of Federal funds \n     to pay for those costs;\n       Future costs of Federal intergovernmental mandate not \n     estimated above, including estimates of any disproportionate \n     budgetary effects on any particular regions of the United \n     States or on particular States, local governments, tribal \n     governments, urban or rural or other types of communities;\n       A qualitative, and if possible, a quantitative assessment \n     of costs and benefits anticipated from any Federal \n     intergovernmental mandate, including enhancement of public \n     health and safety and protection of the natural environment;\n       An estimate of the effect on the national economy of the \n     mandate's impact on private sector costs;\n       A description and summary of input, comments, and concerns \n     received from State, local and tribal government elected \n     officials; and,\n       A summary of the agency's evaluation of those comments and \n     concerns, and the agency's position supporting the need to \n     issue the regulation containing the Federal intergovernmental \n     mandates.\n       Subsection (b) requires agencies to summarizes their \n     written statements and include that summary in the \n     promulgation of the notice of proposed rulemaking and in the \n     final rule. Subsection (c) states that preparation of the \n     written statements may be done in conjunction with other \n     analyses. This subsection ensures that agency actions be \n     compatible with the regulatory planning and coordination \n     provisions of the President's scheme for regulatory review as \n     governed by Executive Order 12866--Regulatory Planning and \n     Review.\n       The Committee believes that proper agency assessment of the \n     impact of major regulations on State, local and tribal \n     governments can lead to better and more cost-effective \n     Federal regulation as well as reduce unreasonable burdens on \n     smaller governments. The spirit and intent of this section is \n     meant to be entirely consistent with the relevant portions of \n     E.O. 12866. As part of its principles, the E.O. states, \n     ``each agency shall assess the effects of Federal regulations \n     on State, local, and tribal governments, including \n     specifically the availability of resources to carry out those \n     mandates, and seek to minimize those burdens that uniquely or \n     significantly affect such governmental entities, consistent \n     with achieving regulatory objectives. In addition, as \n     appropriate, agencies shall seek to harmonize Federal \n     regulatory actions with related State, local, and tribal \n     regulatory and other governmental functions.'' The Committee \n     strongly endorses these principles and supports their full \n     implementation.\n\n       Section 203. Assistance to the Congressional Budget Office\n\n       This section requires the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget to collect the written statements \n     prepared by agencies under Section 202 and submit them on a \n     timely basis to CBO. The reason for this section is that CBO \n     may find useful agency assessments and analyses in performing \n     the required cost estimates on legislation. As OMB already \n     collects these assessments and related information from all \n     agencies under Executive Order authority, it makes good sense \n     that OMB also supply that information to CBO as a matter of \n     routine.\n\n       Section 204. Pilot program on small government flexibility\n\n       This section requires OMB, in consultation with \n     Federal agencies, to establish at least two pilot programs \n     to test innovative and more flexible regulatory approaches \n     that reduce reporting and compliance burdens on small \n     governments while continuing to meet overall statutory \n     goals and objectives.\n       The Committee believes that Federal agencies should \n     experiment with some new and innovative approaches on \n     regulations that affect small governments. Such a pilot \n     program would embody some of the recommendations of the Vice \n     President's National Performance Review. For example, the NPR \n     report for the Environmental Protection Agency recommends \n     that the agency establish a pilot project to assist a \n     community in assessing its environmental and community health \n     risks and how to direct resources to priority problems. The \n     Committee's wish is that similar sorts of initiatives be \n     tried by at least one other agency.\n\n\n                       title iii--baseline study\n\n           Section 301. Baseline study of costs and benefits\n\n       This section establishes a Commission on Unfunded Federal \n     Mandates.\n\n   Section 302. Report on unfunded Federal mandates by the Commission\n\n       This section provides that the Commission shall review the \n     role and impact of unfunded Federal mandates in \n     intergovernmental relations, and make recommendations to the \n     President and Congress on how State and [[Page S652]] local \n     governments can participate in meeting national objectives \n     without the burden of such mandates. It shall also make \n     recommendations on how to allow more flexibility in complying \n     with mandates, reconcile conflicting mandates, terminate \n     obsolete ones, and simply reporting and other requirements. \n     The Commission shall first develop criteria for evaluating \n     unfunded mandates, and then shall publish a preliminary \n     report on its activities under this title within 9 months of \n     the enactment of this Act. A final report shall be submitted \n     within 3 months of the preliminary report.\n\n                        Section 303. Membership\n\n       This section provides that the Commission shall be composed \n     of 9 members--3 appointed by the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives (in consultation with the minority leader), 3 \n     by the majority leader of the Senate (in consultation with \n     the minority leader), and 3 by the President. No Member or \n     employee of Congress may be a member of the Commission.\n\n Section 304. Director and staff of commission; experts and consultants\n\n       This section provides for the appointment of the staff and \n     Director of the Commission, without regard to certain Civil \n     Service rules. It also grants the Commission the authority to \n     hire on a temporary basis the services of experts and \n     consultants for purposes of carrying out this title, as well \n     as the right to receive detailees from Federal agencies on a \n     reimbursable basis, if approved by the agency head.\n\n                   Section 305. Powers of commission\n\n       This section provides the Commission with the authority to \n     hold hearings, obtain official data, use the U.S. mails, \n     acquire administrative support services from the General \n     Services Administration, and contract for property and \n     services.\n\n                        Section 306. Termination\n\n       The Commission shall terminate 90 days after submitting its \n     final report.\n\n              Section 307. Authorization of appropriations\n\n       This section authorizes the appropriation to Commission of \n     $1 million.\n\n                        Section 308. Definition\n\n       This section defines the term ``unfunded federal mandate'', \n     as used in title III.\n\n\n                       title iv--judicial review\n\n                      Section 401. Judicial review\n\n       This section provides that nothing under the Act shall be \n     subject to judicial review, that no provisions of the Act \n     shall be enforceable in an administrative or judicial action, \n     and that no ruling or determination under the Act shall be \n     considered by any court in determining the intent of Congress \n     or for any other purpose.\n\n\n                     v. regulatory impact statement\n\n       Paragraph 11(b) of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate requires Committee reports to evaluate the \n     legislation's regulatory, paperwork, and privacy impact on \n     individuals, businesses, and consumers.\n       S. 1 addresses Federal government process, not output. \n     It will directly affect and change both the legislative \n     and regulatory process. It will not have a direct \n     regulatory impact on individuals, consumers, and \n     businesses as these groups are not covered by the bill's \n     requirements.\n       However, the implementation of S. 1 will likely have an \n     indirect regulatory impact on these groups since a primary \n     focus of the bill is to ensure that Congress assess the cost \n     impact of new legislation on the private sector before \n     acting. In so much as information on private sector costs of \n     any particular bill or resolution may influence its outcome \n     during the Congressional debate, it is possible that this \n     bill may ease the regulatory impact on the private sector--\n     both on individual pieces of legislation as well as overall. \n     However, it is impossible at this time to determine with any \n     specificity what that level of regulatory relief may be.\n       S. 1 does address the Federal regulatory process in three \n     ways: (1) It requires agencies to estimate the costs to \n     State, local and tribal governments of complying with major \n     regulations that include Federal intergovernmental mandates; \n     (2) It compels agencies to set up a process to permit State, \n     local and tribal officials to provide input into the \n     development of significant regulatory proposals; and (3) It \n     requires agencies to establish plans for outreach to small \n     governments.\n       However, with the exception of the third provision, the \n     bill will not impose new requirements for agencies to \n     implement in the regulatory process that are not already \n     required under Executive Orders 12866 and 12875. The bill \n     merely codifies the major provisions of the E.O.s that \n     pertain to smaller governments.\n       The legislation will have no impact on the privacy of \n     individuals. Nor will it add additional paperwork burdens to \n     businesses, consumers and individuals. To the extent that CBO \n     and Federal agencies will need to collect more data and \n     information from State, local and tribal governments and the \n     private sector, as they conduct their requisite legislative \n     and regulatory cost estimates, it is possible that those \n     entities will face additional paperwork. However, although \n     smaller governments are certainly encouraged to comply with \n     agency and CBO requests for information, they are not bound \n     to.\n\n\n                         VI. CBO COST ESTIMATE\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 1995.\n     Hon. William V. Roth,\n     Chairman, Committee on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 1, the Unfunded \n     Mandate Reform Act of 1995.\n       Enactment of S. 1 would not affect direct spending on \n     receipts. Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply \n     to the bill.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Robert D. Reischauer.\n       Enclosure.\n\n       Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate--January 9, 1995\n\n       1. Bill number: S. 1.\n       2. Bill title: Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995.\n       3. Bill status: As ordered reported by the Senate Committee \n     on Governmental Affairs on January 9, 1995.\n       4. Bill purpose: S. 1 would require authorizing committees \n     in the House and Senate to include in their reports on \n     legislation a description and an estimate of the cost of any \n     federal mandates in that legislation, along with an \n     assessment of their anticipated benefits. Mandates are \n     defined to include provisions that impose duties on states, \n     localities, or Indian tribes (``intergovernmental mandates'') \n     or on the private sector (``private sector mandates''). \n     Mandates also would include provisions that reduce or \n     eliminate any authorization of appropriations to assist \n     state, local, and tribal governments or the private sector in \n     complying with federal requirements, unless the requirements \n     are correspondingly reduced. In addition, intergovernmental \n     mandates would include changes in the conditions governing \n     certain types of entitlement programs (for example, \n     Medicaid). Conditions of federal assistance and duties \n     arising from participation in most voluntary federal programs \n     would not be considered mandates.\n       Committee reports would have to provide information on the \n     amount of federal financial assistance that would be \n     available to carry out any intergovernmental mandates in the \n     legislation. In addition, committees would have to note \n     whether the legislation preempts any state or local laws. The \n     requirements of the bill would not apply to provisions that \n     enforce the constitutional rights of individuals, that are \n     necessary for national security, or that meet certain other \n     conditions.\n       The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) would be required to \n     provide committees with estimates of the direct cost of \n     mandates in reported legislation other than appropriation \n     bills. Specific estimates would be required for \n     intergovernmental mandates costing $50 million or more and, \n     if feasible, for private sector mandates costing $200 million \n     or more in a particular year. (CBO currently prepares \n     estimates of costs to states and localities of reported \n     bills, but does not project costs imposed on Indian tribes or \n     the private sector.) In addition, CBO would probably be asked \n     to assist the Budget Committees by preparing estimates for \n     amendments and at later stages of a bill's consideration. \n     Also, at times other than when a bill is reported, when \n     requested by Congressional committees, CBO would analyze \n     proposed legislation likely to have a significant \n     budgetary or financial impact on state, local, or tribal \n     governments or on the private sector, and would prepare \n     studies on proposed mandates. S. 1 would authorize the \n     appropriations of $4.5 million to CBO for each of the \n     fiscal years 1996-2002 to carry out the new requirements. \n     These requirements would take effect on January 1, 1996, \n     and would be permanent.\n       S. 1 would amend Senate rules to establish a point of order \n     against any bill or joint resolution reported by an \n     authorizing committee that lacks the necessary CBO statement \n     or that results in direct costs (as defined in the bill) of \n     $50 million or more in a year to state, local, and tribal \n     governments. The legislation would be in order if it provided \n     funding to cover the direct costs incurred by such \n     governments, or if it included an authorization of \n     appropriations and identified the minimum amount that must be \n     appropriated in order for the mandate to be effective, the \n     specific bill that would provide the appropriation, and a \n     federal agency responsible for implementing the mandate.\n       Finally, S. 1 would require executive branch agencies to \n     take actions to ensure that state, local, and tribal concerns \n     are fully considered in the process of promulgating \n     regulations. These actions would include the preparation of \n     estimates of the anticipated costs of regulations to state, \n     localities, and Indian tribes, along with an assessment of \n     the anticipated benefits. In addition, the bill would \n     authorize the appropriation of $1 million, to be spent over \n     fiscal years 1995 and 1996, for a temporary Commission on \n     Unfunded Federal Mandates, which would recommend ways to \n     reconcile, terminate, suspend, consolidate, or simplify \n     federal mandates.\n       5.

Comparison with spending under current law: S. 1 would \n     authorize additional appropriations of $4.5 million a year \n     for the Congressional Budget Office beginning in 1996. CBO's \n     1995 appropriation is $23.2 million. If funding for current \n     activities were to remain unchanged in 1996, and if the full \n     additional amount authorized were appropriated, CBO's 1996 \n     appropriation would total $27.7 million, an increase of 19 \n     percent.\n       Because S. 1 would create the Commission on Unfunded \n     Federal Mandates, there is no funding under current law for \n     the commission.\n       7.

A bill to amend title 4, United States Code, to declare \nEnglish as the official language of the Government of the United \nStates; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n     legislation to make english the official language of the u.s. \n                               government\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto designate English as the official language of the U.S. Government.\n  Last year, tax forms were printed in a language other than English \nfor the first time in the 131 year history of the IRS. In addition, the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service is now conducting non-English \nlanguage citizenship ceremonies. I find these policies very disturbing. \nThe Government is sending a clear message that to live in the United \nStates, one must not learn the English language.\n  I believe such Government policies establish a dangerous and \nexpensive precedent. The idea that the U.S. Government can accommodate \nbetter than 300 foreign languages now found in America, is absurd.\n  In order to assimilate the various cultures and ethnic groups that \ncomprise this great land, we must use English. Of all the different \nhomelands and dialects introduced to the United States in the 18th \ncentury, the language the immigrants choose was English. They did not \nchoose French, German, or Spanish.\n  A common, established language allows individuals to engage in \nconversation, commerce and of course political discussion. A common \nlanguage serves as a bridge unifying a community by opening the lines \nof communication. In this diverse land of ours, English is the common \nline of communication we share. English is what allows us to teach, \nlearn about and appreciate one another. It is therefore important that \nthe Federal Government formally recognize English as the language of \nGovernment and pursue efforts to help new citizens assimilate and learn \nthe English language.\n  The inability to communicate fosters frustration and resentment. By \nencouraging people to communicate in a common language, we actually \nhelp them progress in society. A common language allows individuals to \ntake advantage of the social and economic opportunities America has to \noffer. The ability to maintain a law abiding citizenry is hindered and \nthe ability to offer true representation is certainly hampered if \nindividuals cannot communicate their opinions.\n  There might be concerns that this legislation will deprive non-\nEnglish speaking individuals of certain rights or services. Let me \nassure you it will not. This legislation does not deny individuals \ntheir right to use native languages in their private lives nor does it \ndeny critical services. This bill only affects the official functions \nof the U.S. Government. If anything, this legislation reflects the need \nto provide services that help non-English speaking people learn English \nand assimilate to America. Participatory democracy in this country \nsimply requires people learn the English language.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join in this effort to establish a \nnational language policy for the U.S. Government by cosponsoring the \nLanguage of Government Act of 1995.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BUMPERS:\n  S. 176. A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to convey the \nCorning National Fish Hatchery to the State of Arkansas; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n       the corning national fish hatchery conveyance act of 1995\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation that \nwould transfer the property rights in the Corning National Fish \nHatchery from the Federal Government to the State of Arkansas. In 1983, \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service closed this hatchery because of budget \nconstraints. Because the State of Arkansas was interested in \nmaintaining the Corning facility as part of its State hatchery system, \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service signed a Memorandum of Understanding \nwith the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission transferring the operation \nof the Corning Hatchery to the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission. The \nhatchery has even been renamed the William H. Donham State Fish \nHatchery.\n  Mr. President, it is time to give the State of Arkansas clear title \nto this property. The State has been operating and maintaining it for \nover 10 years [[Page S654]] without any Federal funding and it has \nbecome an important component of the State's fisheries program. The \nproposed transfer not only has the support of the Arkansas Game and \nFish Commission but also the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation and \nlook forward to its speedy passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 176\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Corning National Fish \n     Hatchery Conveyance Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONVEYANCE OF THE CORNING NATIONAL FISH HATCHERY TO \n                   THE STATE OF ARKANSAS.\n\n       (a) Conveyance Requirement.--The Secretary of the Interior \n     shall convey to the State of Arkansas, without reimbursement \n     and by no later than December 31, 1995, all right, title, and \n     interest of the United States in and to the property \n     described in subsection (b), for use by the Arkansas Game and \n     Fish Commission as part of the State of Arkansas fish culture \n     program.\n       (b) Property Described.--The property refereed to in \n     subsection (a) is the property formally known as the Corning \n     National Fish Hatchery, (popularly known as the William H. \n     Donham State Fish Hatchery), located one mile west of \n     Corning, Arkansas, on Arkansas State Highway 67 in Clay \n     County, Arkansas, consisting of 137.34 acres, (more or less) \n     and all improvements and related personal property under the \n     control of the Secretary that is located on that property, \n     including buildings, structures, and equipment.\n       (c) Reversionary Interest of United States.--All right, \n     title, and interest in property described in subsection (b) \n     shall revert to the United States if the property ceases to \n     be used as part of the State of Arkansas fish culture \n     program. The State of Arkansas shall ensure that the property \n     reverting to the United States is in substantially the same \n     or better condition as the time of the transfer.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 177. A bill to repeal the Ramspeck Act; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n                    the ramspeck repeal act of 1995\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce the Ramspeck Repeal \nAct, which would terminate the Ramspeck Act after a 2-year period. I \nbelieve the Ramspeck Act is obsolete and unfair, and the time has come \nto do away with it.\n  A description of the Ramspeck Act will quickly outline why I think it \nis unnecessary and unjustified. Signed into law in 1940, the Ramspeck \nAct provides exclusive privileges to former legislative and judicial \nbranch employees to secure career civil service positions with the \nFederal Government. The Ramspeck Act makes a special exception to \ncertain competitive requirements of civil service positions for \nindividuals who have served 3 years in the legislative branch or 4 \nyears in the judicial branch.\n  Under the Ramspeck Act, legislative branch employees are awarded \nstatus for direct appointment to a civil service position if they have \nbeen involuntarily separated from their job, and they are allowed 1 \nyear from their date of separation in which to exercise this privilege. \nFurthermore, the Ramspeck Act waives any competitive examination which \nranks applicants for a job for individuals who are former legislative \nor judicial branch employees. Therefore, if a competitive exam is \nrequired to rank candidates for a civil service position, the Ramspeck \nAct enables a select group of individuals to skip that hurdle, while \nassuring them of being able to be selected for the job.\n  Finally, individuals appointed under this act become career employees \nin the civil service without regard to the tenure of service \nrequirements that exist for all other civil service employees. Most \npeople who have successfully competed for a position with the civil \nservice must then serve a 3-year probationary period before they \nachieve career status with their agency. Ramspeck appointees, however, \nare afforded career status immediately.\n  It is not appropriate for former legislative employees to receive \nspecial reemployment privileges that allow them to jump ahead of their \nfellow citizens when seeking a civil service position. It is both \nreasonable and equitable to require former legislative or judicial \nbranch employees to compete for civil service jobs under the same terms \nthat other Americans have to. Leveling the playing field for qualified \nindividuals from the private sector who are interested in entering the \ncivil service is a worthy endeavor, Mr. President, and one of the \nprimary objectives of this proposal. By offering this legislation, I am \nalso continuing my efforts to make the Congress abide by the same rules \nthat our constituents live by.\n  Let me say that while I want to swiftly repeal the Ramspeck Act, I do \nnot want to act in a manner that has a partisan or punitive impact. \nThis proposal would have no impact on any former Senate or House \nemployees who lost their jobs in the November 1994 election. I \nrecognize that while the results of this November's election caused a \nlarge number of involuntary job losses among Democratic legislative \nemployees, and many of them may currently be trying to utilize the \nRamspeck Act to secure a civil service position. Clearly, Republican \nlegislative branch employees have utilized their eligibility under the \nRamspeck Act to seek civil service jobs after other elections, as well.\n  I strongly believe that the Ramspeck Act affords unfair employment \nprivileges for both Republicans and Democrats alike, to the detriment \nof their fellow citizens who may not have had the opportunity to work \nin the legislative branch. Therefore, the legislation I am introducing \ntoday would terminate this reemployment perk 2 years after the \nenactment of this measure.\n  A repeal of the Rampseck Act is warranted because it is wrong for \nformer legislative and judicial branch employees to be given special \nreemployment privileges that allow them to leap in front of equally \nqualified individuals--especially on the basis that they recently \nworked for a Senator or Congressmen who was recently defeated for \nreelection.\n  In closing, Mr. President, this legislation is about fairness and \nequal opportunity. The Ramspeck Act is an unnecessary and unjustified \nrelic from another era, and it's time we repealed it. I hope the Senate \nwill pass this legislation and take a sound step toward reforming a \npart of Federal civil service law that is an affront to the principles \nof merit-based job selections and true competition. I ask my colleagues \nto join with me in reaffirming these principals by supporting the \nRamspeck Repeal Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself and Mr. Leahy) (by request):\n  S. 178. A bill to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to extend the \nauthorization for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n      the commodity futures trading commission reauthorization act\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to \nreauthorize the Commodity Futures Trading Commission [CFTC] to exercise \nits responsibilities to prevent manipulation, prohibit fraud, maintain \nfinancial integrity, and encourage innovation in the Nation's futures \nand commodity options markets through regulation and oversight. This \nlegislation provides assurance to the national and international \nfinancial markets of the continuing authority of the CFTC, continues \nthe CFTC's responsibilities under existing law, gives adequate time to \ncomplete implementation of the extensive amendments included in the \nFutures Trading Practices Act of 1992 [FTPA] and allows time for \nreviews of the effects of that implementation. The CFTC was established \nby the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974 as a sunset \nagency, and its authority must be regularly extended by Congress. The \nFTPA authorized the agency for a period of only 2 years and the CFTC \nnow operates under authority granted by Congress through the \nappropriations process, a deficiency this bill will correct.\n  The CFTC's task of overseeing and regulating a rapidly expanding \nfutures industry has been, is, and will be enormous. The volume of \ncommodity futures and options contracts traded on the Nation's \ncommodity exchanges, or designated contract markets, for 1994 exceeded \nhalf-a-billion transactions. [[Page S655]] These transactions directly \nor indirectly effect the financial well being of family farms, \ncorporations, financial institutions, traders, and millions of \nindividuals through pooled investments. All of this trading is carried \nout within a self-regulatory framework overseen and supplemented by the \nCFTC, an agency of less then 600 employees.\n  The futures industry is an essential part of our Nation's financial \nmarkets and the CFTC is an essential player in the federal regulation \nof those markets. President Bush recognized the role of the CFTC in \nestablishing the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, in the \nwake of the October 1987 stock market collapse, which included the \nSecretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and \nthe Chairman of the CFTC. Former Secretary of the Treasury Bentsen \nreactivated the Working Group and the Chairman of the CFTC remains an \nactive and vital participant in its efforts. Reauthorization of the \nCFTC will express congressional intent that the agency continue its \nrole as a member of this group.\n  The volume of exchange traded futures and commodity options contracts \nand the increased importance of this trading to all sectors of the \nfinancial markets is not confined to the United States. New markets are \ndeveloping in other nations around the world and governments of those \ncountries are grappling with regulatory issues. The CFTC has taken a \nleading role in dealing with these governments on a variety of futures \nrelated matters. Reauthorization will assist the CFTC in its dealings \nwith these governments. This is an area of increasing importance as our \nfinancial markets compete with overseas markets to attract and serve \ncustomers around the world.\n  Along with increasing volume, connections with other financial \nindustries, and internationalization, the increasing complexity of \nfinancial transactions is a challenge facing the CFTC. The financial \nindustry is now able to construct a bewildering array of instruments to \nserve the investment, or risk management needs of their customers.\n  Often these instruments are lumped together under the term \n``derivatives.'' Exchange traded futures contracts governed by the \nrequirements of Federal law since 1922 and overseen by the CFTC since \n1974 are certainly one form of derivatives, since their value is \nderived from the value of an underlying commodity. Development of the \nover the counter instruments knows as derivatives led to the question \nwhether they were the economic or legal equivalents of futures \ncontracts. Since prior to FTPA, Federal law required all futures \ntrading to occur on organized exchanges, this led to legal uncertainty \nin the now huge derivatives market. Using the broad exemptive authority \ngranted by Congress in FTPA, the CFTC has been addressing this problem. \nReauthorization will give these new markets the confidence that the \nprocess will go forward in a orderly way.\n  While the markets overseen by the CFTC have grown immensely in \nvolume, variety of products, and diversity of users, the importance of \nfutures trading to agriculture cannot be overstated. The development of \nfutures trading allowed farmers to mitigate the boom and bust cycle of \nprices for their crops through intelligent marketing. Today futures \ntrading is an integral part of pricing and risk management for U.S. \nagriculture. The volume of exchange traded futures and commodity \noptions contracts on U.S. commodity exchanges totalled over 58 million \ntransactions in 1994. This trading affected not only the market \nparticipants, but ultimately all producers, processors, merchandisers \nand consumers of agricultural products with prices affected by exchange \ntrading. As the Congress reviews the current Federal commodity programs \nthrough hearings, and debates on the 1995 farm bill, the pricing and \nrisk shifting functions of the futures markets may take on even more \nimportance as we reconsider the role of the Federal Government in \nstabilizing prices and assuming price risks in agriculture. As we take \non this task, we need to assure ourselves that the futures markets are \noperated appropriately and are properly overseen.\n  Finally, after 4 years of hearings, debate, and consideration the \nCongress passed FTPA. The law addressed not only the tremendous growth \nin volume, variety of products, internationalization, and complexity \nissues discussed above; but also concerns about the interrelationship \nof the futures and securities markets in the wake of the October 1987 \nstock market collapse, fraudulent trading practices by numerous \nindividuals on the Nation's exchanges as disclosed by FBI undercover \noperations and CFTC investigations, and the negative effect on soybean \nprices precipitated by an exchange emergency action that angered many \nproducers. The Congress granted the CFTC new authorities to address \nthese issues. Further, the Congress directed the agency to undertake \nnumerous rulemakings and studies to implement the requirements of FTPA. \nThat law amended the Commodity Exchange Act to:\n\n       Improve the regulation of futures and options traded under \n     rules and regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading \n     Commission; to establish registration standards for all \n     exchange floor traders; to restrict practices that may lead \n     to the abuse of outside customers of the marketplace; to \n     reinforce development of exchange audit trails to better \n     enable the detection and prevention of such practices; to \n     establish higher standards for service on governing boards \n     and disciplinary committees of self-regulatory organizations; \n     to enhance the international regulation of futures trading; \n     to regularize the process of authorizing appropriations for \n     the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; and for other \n     purposes. . . .\n\n  The committee intends to commence hearings in the near future to \nreview the CFTC's progress in implementing FTPA. Enactment of this \nlegislation will assure orderly implementation of FTPA and assure \nindustry participants, commerce generally and the public of continued \noversight of this vital sector of the American economy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nI am introducing today be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 178\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``CFTC Reauthorization Act of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       Section 12(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. \n     16(d)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(d) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as \n     are necessary to carry out this Act for each of fiscal years \n     1995 through 2000.''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ROTH:\n  S. 179. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nfacilitate the apprehension, detention, and deportation of criminal \naliens, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 the criminal alien control act of 1995\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Criminal \nAlien Control Act of 1995. This comprehensive legislation addresses a \nproblem that has reached staggering proportions in this country: \ncriminal aliens.\n  Without question, there are many problems with our Nation's \nimmigration system. I hope that this is the year we undertake \ncomprehensive immigration reform, including changing the much-abused \nasylum process. But we cannot effectively reform our immigration system \nwithout addressing the problem of criminal aliens.\n  The problem of criminal aliens occupies the dangerous intersection of \ncrime and the control of our Nation's borders, two issues of great \nconcern to the American people. I hope we can all agree that there is \nno place in this country for people who come here and commit serious \ncrimes. Criminals are one commodity we do not need to import.\n  Last Congress, as ranking minority member of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, I conducted an investigation and held 2 \ndays of hearings on the problem of criminal aliens and the governmental \nresponse to that problem. Our investigation found that criminal aliens \nare a serious threat to our public safety that is costing our criminal \njustice system hundreds of millions of dollars. And the problem is \ngetting worse by leaps and bounds. [[Page S656]] \n  Criminal aliens now account for an all-time high of 25 percent of the \nFederal prison population and are, by far, the fastest growing segment \nof the Federal prison population. Throughout our Nation's criminal \njustice system, there are an estimated 450,000 criminal aliens--a \nstaggering number.\n  Although our investigation found that the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service is not adequately responding to the criminal \nalien problem, the INS does not deserve all of the blame. In fact, when \nit comes to criminal aliens, there is plenty of blame to go around and \nwe in Congress are not immune. Congress deserves blame because our \nFederal criminal alien deportation laws, created on a piecemeal and \npatchwork basis, set out an irrational, lengthy and overly complex \nprocess that prevents us from deporting criminals as rapidly as we \nshould be.\n  There are, however, many difficulties with the INS that have \nexacerbated this problem. For example, the INS is unable to even \nidentify most of the criminal aliens who clog our State and local jails \nbefore these criminals are released onto our streets. Also, many \ncriminal aliens, having been identified, are released on bond while the \nlengthy deportation process is pending. It should be a surprise to no \none that many skip bond and never show up for their deportation \nhearings.\n\n  One thing the IRS does is routinely provide criminal aliens with work \npermits legally allowing them to get jobs while their appeals are \npending. One INS deportation officer told my staff that he spends only \nabout 5 percent of his time looking for criminal aliens because he must \nspend most of his time processing their work permits.\n  As for actual deportation, the final step in the process, criminal \naliens often are not actually deported even when deportation orders \nhave been issued for them. According to the INS, there are more than \n27,000 aliens, including many criminal aliens, who have been ordered \ndeported yet remain at large. It is no wonder that one frustrated INS \nofficial told us that only the stupid and honest actually get deported.\n  Perhaps the ultimate indictment of the current system is that even on \nthose rare occasions when the system actually works and a criminal \nalien is deported, reentry into the United States is so easy that it \nmakes the whole process appear to be a giant exercise in futility. The \nsubcommittee obtained long lists of criminal aliens who have repeatedly \nbeen deported only to reenter the country illegally and commit more \ncrimes.\n  My legislation addresses the serious problem posed by criminal aliens \nby simplifying, streamlining and strengthening the deportation process \nfor these aliens who have been convicted of committing crimes in this \ncountry.\n  My legislation simplifies existing law by eliminating the confusing \narray of crimes for which criminal aliens are deportable. Under my \nlegislation, any alien who commits any felony is deportable--period.\n  My legislation streamlines the deportation process for criminal \naliens by, among other things, requiring aliens who are not permanent \nresidents and who wish to appeal deportation orders, to do so from \ntheir home countries, after they have been deported. My legislation \nfurther streamlines the process by allowing States and Federal judges \nto order the deportation of criminal aliens. Once an alien has been \nconvicted beyond a reasonable doubt of having committed a felony, \nhaving had the benefit of all the due process that is required in our \ncriminal justice system, there is no reason why the sentencing judge \nshould not also be permitted to enter an order of deportation at the \ntime of sentencing. My legislation also restricts the defense currently \nused by criminal aliens to delay or avoid deportation.\n  Also, as many of us know, certain State and local governments have \nbeen highly critical of what they see as the Federal Government's \ninability to effectively police our Nation's borders. Yet, some of \nthese same jurisdictions have passed laws and adopted official policies \nprohibiting their local police departments and other employees from \ncooperating with Federal immigration officials. I think that is \nhypocritical. I offered an amendment to the crime bill last year that \nwas adopted 93-6 that would cut crime bill funding to local entities \nthat adopt such policies of noncooperation, but my amendment was \ndropped in conference. A similar provision is included in this \nlegislation.\n  Through this comprehensive legislation, I believe we can begin to \neffectively address the growing serious problem of criminal aliens in \nthis country. I believe this is an essential step on the road to \nmeaningful reform of our Nation's immigration system and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 179\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to streamline and reform Federal job training programs \nto create a world-class work force development system for the 21st \ncentury, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                     the workforce development act\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Workforce \nDevelopment Act. This bill is a complement to S. 6, the Working \nAmericans Opportunity Act, which was introduced on the first day of \nthis Congress by Senator Daschle, Senator Breaux, other Senators, and \nmyself.\n  One of our top priorities for this session is to modernize the \ncurrent confusing and overlapping array of job training programs. In \ntoday's rapidly changing economy, we must provide more effective \nopportunities for workers to upgrade their skills and improve their \nearning power over the course of their careers.\n  Compared to other major industrial nations, the United States is \nstill in the Dark Ages of enabling workers and firms to adjust to \nchanges taking place in the economy. The policy foundations for our \ncurrent job training system was established during the years of the New \nDeal, the New Frontier, and the Great Society.\n  The primary challenge that most of our current programs were designed \nto address was to help various hard-to-serve groups to enter the labor \nforce. Many of these programs--such as the Job Corps--have been very \nsuccessful. Over the years millions of economically disadvantaged \nindividuals have benefitted.\n  As we move forward with new ideas to modernize our job training \nsystem we must not retreat from the commitment to provide the basic \nskills and support services which make it possible for large numbers of \ndisadvantaged Americans to achieve self-sufficiency in the labor \nmarket.\n  At the same time, we also need to respond to the new and powerful \neconomic forces which are disrupting the existing labor markets for \nmillions of working Americans and their families. As a result of \nincreased international competition, rapid technological change, \nreductions in defense spending, and the re-engineering and down-sizing \nof corporations, many men and women already in the labor force must be \nretrained to improve their skills and enable them to continue to \nproductive careers. In the evolving modern economy, this kind of \nretraining may be needed more than once, and often several times, over \nthe course of people's careers.\n  We also must respond to the concerns of the large numbers of two-\nincome families, and families with single heads [[Page S659]] of \nhousehold who face the difficult challenge of balancing work and family \nresponsibilities. We need a more flexible job training and employment \nsystem that can help the breadwinners in working families to move in \nand out of the labor force without losing their earning power.\n  Over the past decade, many private businesses have taken steps to \nstreamline their operations to deal with the profound changes taking \nplace in our economy. It is clearly time for the Federal Government to \nact as well to consolidate and coordinate current job training programs \nin order to give workers a greater opportunity to succeed. It is time \nfor a comprehensive overhaul of Federal job training policy. The \nWorkforce Development Act I am introducing provides action to \nstreamline and reform current policy. It encourages the States to \nexperiment with new approaches to make their own job training programs \nmore responsive to the real needs of working families.\n  A key element of both the Workforce Development Act and S. 6, the \nWorking Americans Opportunity Act introduced earlier this week, is the \nidea of making vouchers available to workers, so that they can purchase \nthe training programs of their choice. President Clinton is right in \nproposing vouchers as a means to enable market forces to help transform \nthe current excessively bureaucratic programs into a more effective \nsystem driven by the real needs of workers, job seekers, and firms in \ncommunities across the country.\n  Last year Senator Kassebaum and I began to work together to devise a \nnew strategy to create the type of work force development system the \nNation needs. In June we issued a joint statement on the Senate floor \nwhich laid out a series of principles to guide this reform. Several \nother Senators joined us at that time, and we subsequently received \nsupport from many other Senators on both sides of the aisle. Over the \ncourse of the summer and into last fall we worked together to lay the \ngroundwork for a bipartisan reform effort in the 104th Congress.\n  The Senate has a good record of bipartisan accomplishment in the area \nof work force development policy. When the Republicans controlled this \nbody in the 1980's, many of us worked closely with Senator Dan Quayle \nto pass the Job Training Partnership Act, which established the \nprinciple of a strong private sector role at the local level in \ndesigning training programs for disadvantaged and dislocated workers.\n  Similarly, in the last session of Congress, a bipartisan coalition of \nSenators joined in passing the School-To-Work Act. Much of the \nfoundation for this bill was laid by the landmark ``American choice'' \nreport issued in 1990 by a distinguished bipartisan commission led by \nformer Labor Secretaries Bill Brock and Ray Marshall. As a result of \nthis groundwork, the School-To-Work Act earned broad support from \nbusiness, labor, governors, mayors, and leaders in education. It is \ntime to apply that same sense of shared purpose to making all our job \ntraining programs more responsive to the needs of job seekers and \nworkers struggling to be competitive in our modern economy.\n  The legislation I am introducing today grew out of discussions with \nMembers of Congress on both sides of the aisle in the 103d Congress and \nwith the Clinton administration. It also draws on the innovative steps \nbeing taken in Massachusetts to meet this challenge and to define the \nproper role of the private and public sectors and Federal, State, and \nlocal governments in work force policy.\n  In addition to streamlining and reforming Federal job training \nprograms, this legislation will repeal duplicative or outmoded \nprograms, and encourage States and communities to rationalize many \nothers.\n  These efforts will give flexibility to the States to test ways that \nvouchers can best be implemented to help workers navigate or circumvent \nthe excessive bureaucracy that now exists. One-stop career centers will \nbe established to ensure that workers have an opportunity to make \neffective use of these vouchers. A new information system will produce \nreports on the effectiveness of training programs. All of the \nactivities authorized by this act will be paid for by cost savings \nachieved in existing programs.\n  The existing bureaucracy is unlikely to reform itself. The private \nsector, especially business, labor, and community leaders, will have a \nkey role in advising the public sector on all aspects of these reforms.\n  The Work Force Development Act also takes direct steps to assist \ncurrent workers. Assistance will be available to business and labor to \nupgrade the skills of adult workers and establish portable industry-\nbased skill credentials to serve as a passport to succeed in the labor \nmarket.\n  Finally, the bill establishes a timetable for further reform. By June \n1, 1999 a national board must submit recommendations to the President \nand Congress. To ensure that Congress acts on these recommendations, 20 \nseparate programs with more than $4 billion in funding will sunset \nSeptember 30, 1999.\n  I look forward to working closely with Senators on all aspects of \nthese fundamental issues. We need practical, not partisan or \nideological answers. Most of all, we need a job training policy that \ncan be for workers. I am hopeful that we can make landmark progress \ntoward that goal in this session of Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill and a copy of the \nbill be entered into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 180\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) increasing international competition, technological \n     advances, and structural changes in the United States economy \n     present new challenges to private firms and public \n     policymakers in creating a skilled workforce with the ability \n     to adapt to change and technological progress;\n       (2) the Federal Government should work with the private \n     sector to create a streamlined, high-performance workforce \n     development system that is driven by the needs of its \n     customers rather than bureaucratic requirements;\n       (3) such a system should actively encourage collaboration \n     among private sector firms and publicly funded education and \n     training efforts in order to assist jobseekers and workers to \n     adjust to structural economic changes;\n       (4) although it is necessary for the Federal Government to \n     consolidate or eliminate unnecessary programs, the primary \n     goal of Federal workforce development policy should be to \n     help facilitate transactions taking place between jobseekers, \n     workers, and business in local labor markets;\n       (5) while the Federal Government must maintain its \n     commitment to provide economically and educationally \n     disadvantaged individuals with skills and support services \n     necessary to succeed in the labor market, Federal workforce \n     development policy must also begin to provide incentives to \n     assist firms to help upgrade the skills of their front-line \n     workers;\n       (6) in order for labor markets to function more \n     effectively, there must be--\n       (A) timely, accurate information about the supply, demand, \n     price, and quality of services available in the job training \n     marketplace; and\n       (B) trained brokers available to assist customers to choose \n     the most suitable service;\n       (7) accordingly, the United States needs a comprehensive \n     integrated labor market information system to ensure that \n     workforce development programs are related to the demand for \n     particular skills in local labor markets, and a mechanism for \n     providing brokerage services to ensure that information about \n     the employment and earnings of the local workforce, and the \n     performance of education and training institutions, will be \n     available to jobseekers, workers, and firms;\n       (8) in order to bring more coherence to Federal workforce \n     development policy, there should be a single entity at the \n     Federal, State, and local level vested with the necessary \n     authority to strategically plan ways to transform the \n     separate training and employment programs into an integrated \n     and accountable workforce development system;\n       (9) these Federal, State, and local strategic planning \n     bodies should be structured in such a way to give businesses \n     and workers a meaningful role in shaping policy and \n     overseeing the quality of workforce development programs;\n       (10) in recent years, many States and communities have made \n     progress in developing new approaches to better integrate \n     Federal employment and training programs;\n       (11) the Federal Government should take more systematic \n     measures to encourage experimentation and flexibility, and to \n     disseminate best practices in the design and implementation \n     of a comprehensive workforce development system throughout \n     the country; and\n       (12) the Federal Government should address the findings of \n     this subsection through the implementation of immediate and \n     long-term improvements that result in the establishment of a \n     high-quality workforce development system needed for the \n     economy of the 21st century.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act--\n       (1) to take certain immediate actions, and to establish a \n     process for bringing about longer term improvements, that are \n     needed to begin the transformation of Federally funded \n     education and job training efforts from a collection of \n     fragmented programs into a coherent, integrated, accountable \n     workforce development system that--\n       (A) is based on the needs of jobseekers, workers, and \n     employers, rather than bureaucratic requirements;\n       (B) is accessible to any jobseeker, worker, or employer;\n       (C) focuses on accountability, performance, and accurate \n     information;\n       (D) provides flexibility and responsibility to the States, \n     and in turn to local communities, for design and \n     implementation of workforce development systems;\n       (E) requires the active involvement of firms and workers in \n     the governance, design, and implementation of such system;\n       (F) is linked directly to employment and training \n     opportunities in the private sector; and\n       (G) adopts best practices of quality administration and \n     management that have been successful in the private sector; \n     and\n       (2) to authorize appropriations under this Act for fiscal \n     year 1996 at the same level as appropriations are authorized \n     for fiscal year 1995 for the programs repealed under section \n     102(a).\n\n     SEC. 3.

There is \n     widespread consensus that these programs are not collectively \n     doing a good enough job of preparing workers for high skill \n     jobs in an increasingly competitive world economy.\n       This bill takes immediate action to streamline and reform \n     current job training programs. In addition, over the next \n     four years states will be encouraged to experiment with \n     creative new approaches to transform federally-funded job \n     training efforts from a collection of free standing \n     bureaucratically-driven programs into an integrated and \n     accountable market-driven workforce development system.\n       After examining lessons learned from the experimentation \n     taking place in the states, Congress will act upon \n     recommendations to create a new system to help workers to \n     compete in the 21st century economy.\n\n\n                 Title I Streamlining and Consolidation\n\n       This title immediately repeals 15 duplicative or outmoded \n     programs and encourages states to compete for grants to set \n     up integrated workforce development system that will, over \n     time, include one-stop career centers and voucher programs \n     for a wide range of adult training programs.\n       This title establishes an expedited wavier authority \n     process to allow states and communities to waive programmatic \n     requirements that may impede the ability of those that are \n     willing to embark on the challenge of building a more \n     integrated workforce development system.\n       This title also establishes a clear timetable and process \n     for taking action on the lessons learned from the experiments \n     undertaken by the states. By June 1, 1999, a tripartite \n     National Board must submit a joint resolution to the \n     President and Congress containing recommendations for a new \n     public/private workforce development system suitable for the \n     needs of the 21st century. To ensure that Congress acts on \n     these recommendations, twenty separate programs with more \n     than $4 billion in funding will sunset September 30, 1999. \n     The National Board will itself be sunsetted after if issues \n     this joint resolution.\n\n\n                  TITLE II MARKET BUILDING ACTIVITIES\n\n       This title establishes a framework at the federal, state, \n     and local levels for key stakeholders to work cooperatively \n     to build the information, accountability, and brokerage \n     systems needed to transform currently federally funded job \n     training programs into a market-driven workforce development \n     system.\n       At the federal level, new streamlined accountability, labor \n     market information and management systems will replace the \n     myriad of existing federal monitoring and compliance systems \n     currently utilized by separate categorical programs. All \n     states will receive grants to develop these new systems which \n     will, for the first time, give policy makers and individuals \n     a clear sense of how well each program is doing in preparing \n     and placing people in jobs. Each year the National Board will \n     issue a National Report Card documenting the performance of \n     the nation's workforce development system.\n       States will be given the opportunity to compete for multi-\n     year implementation grants to experiment with new approaches \n     to building a market-driven workforce development system. \n     States that receive these grants will create a new tripartite \n     State Workforce Development Council to replace the multiple \n     existing boards created by separate federal job training \n     programs. These Council's responsibilities will include \n     developing a strategic plan that identifies ways to integrate \n     existing job training, education and economic development \n     programs to meet the needs of critical industries in the \n     state; and developing a quality assurance system to provide \n     consumer reports on the supply, demand, price and quality of \n     job training services throughout the state.\n       At the local level, private sector led boards will be \n     established to bring coherence to job training activities at \n     the labor market level. These boards will identify the \n     training needs of critical industries in their region, and \n     develop strategies to redeploy public and private training \n     resources to respond to these needs. These boards will also \n     be responsible for establishing a network of one-stop career \n     centers to provide local jobseekers, workers, and businesses \n     universal access to a comprehensive array of quality \n     employment services.\n\n\n                 title iii  enhancing individual choice\n\n       This title will promote the establishment of a market-\n     driven workforce development system by establishing training \n     accounts that make vouchers available to individuals to allow \n     them to choose the education and training service most \n     appropriate for their own career advancement.\n       States that receive implementation grants to establish \n     market-driven workforce development systems will initially \n     establish training accounts from which dislocated workers can \n     receive vouchers. States will also have the option, over \n     time, of converting additional training programs into a \n     voucher system, subject to the approval of the National \n     Board.\n\n\n                   title iv  private-public linkages\n\n       This title take steps to begin to explicitly link federally \n     funded workforce development programs with training practices \n     and systems utilized by workers and firms in the private \n     sector.\n       These steps include: recommending changes in the tax codes \n     to encourage employers and workers to invest in training and \n     skills upgrading for both existing workers and hard-to-serve \n     individuals; analyzing how businesses and labor in the United \n     States are restructuring the workplace to provide continuous \n     learning for their employees; overseeing the degree to which \n     publicly funded education and training providers throughout \n     the United States are incorporating industry-based skill \n     standards into their program offerings; and making matching \n     grants available on a competitive basis to encourage firms to \n     develop innovative approaches to upgrade the skills of their \n     front-line workers.\n\n\n                   title v  labor market information\n\n       This title establishes a comprehensive labor market \n     information system to provide accurate, timely data to \n     improve the functioning of local labor markets. These new \n     information systems will allow job seekers, workers and firms \n     to determine where the growth industries are in their \n     communities, what skills jobs in these industries require, \n     and which local training providers are successfully meeting \n     the training needs of these industries.\n\n\n                                funding\n\n       This bill authorizes funding of $250 million in fiscal year \n     1996--$160 million for the market building activities \n     identified in Title II and the matching grants for incumbent \n     worker training in Title IV; and the remaining $90 million \n     for the development of the integrated labor market \n     information system described in Title V. The funds are not \n     new spending, but are cost savings realized from streamlining \n     activities undertaken in Title I.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 181. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code, of 1986 to provide \ntax incentives to encourage small investors, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  S. 182. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage investment in the United States by reforming the taxation of \ncapital gains, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     CAPITAL GAINS TAX LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two pieces of \ncapital gains tax legislation that will significantly change and \nimprove America's capital formation, tax fairness, and saving rate. \nThese bills are alternative solutions to reform a tax code that \ndiscourages investment and unfairly taxes investors on gains caused \nsolely by inflation. Enactment of either of these bills would \nstrengthen this Nation's precarious economic condition by stimulating \neconomic growth and creating new jobs.\n  These bills are the Small Investors Tax Relief Act of 1995 and the \nCapital Formation and Jobs Creation Act of 1995.\n  Mr. President, the first bill, the Small Investors Tax Relief Act of \n1995 [SITRA], features three simple provisions that solve several \nproblems that face America's small investors. First, it gives every \nindividual an annual exemption from capital gains of $10,000 \n[[Page S672]] per year. This amount is doubled on a joint return and \nthe thresholds are indexed for inflation. This provision will encourage \nlower- and middle-income taxpayers to save and invest in stocks, real \nestate, or a new business. It will also unlock billions of dollars of \nunrealized capital gains in this country and put it to work creating \nnew jobs.\n  Second, SITRA provides an annual exemption from tax for the first \n$1,000 of interest and dividends earned by individuals each year. The \nexemption threshold is $2,000 for joint returns and is also indexed for \ninflation. This provision will provide a tremendous incentive for \ntaxpayers to invest, rather than spend, their dollars. Our current tax \nlaw actually discourages savings by taxing every cent of earnings from \ninterest and dividends. The result is a miserably low saving rate for \nthe United States. All of our major trading partners enjoy a higher \nsaving rate than does than the United States. Yet, our long-term \nprosperity demands a higher rate of savings, according to practically \nevery economist. This bill will go a long way toward providing the \nencouragement that is now lacking for taxpayers to save money.\n  Finally, SITRA would provide for indexing the bases of most capital \nassets to eventually eliminate the unfair taxation of gains caused \nsolely by inflation. There is nothing fair about having to pay tax on \ninflationary gains. The tax on inflationary capital gains is not a tax \non income or even on the increase in the real value of the asset. It is \npurely a tax on capital very much like the property tax, but only \nassessed when the property is sold.\n\n  Mr. President, I am also introducing today the Capital Formation and \nJobs Creation Act of 1995. This bill is identical to the capital gains \ntax bill included in H.R. 9, which is part of the Contract With \nAmerica, introduced last week by Congressman Bill Archer. I commend \nCongressman Archer, the new chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, \nfor his expertise and many years of leadership in the area of capital \ngains taxation and I look forward to working with him on this issue.\n  This bill is also very simple. First, it would provide a deduction of \n50 percent of net capital gains realized. Thus, only half of a \ntaxpayer's capital gains would be subject to taxation. Second, it would \nalso index the bases of capital assets to ensure that inflationary \ngains are eliminated. Finally, it would allow a capital loss deduction \nfor losses suffered on a sale or exchange of a taxpayer's principal \nresidence.\n  Mr. President, the debate about whether to cut the tax on capital \ngains has been very loud, long, and partisan. Our colleagues have heard \nmuch from both sides of the issue for many years. For the first time in \nseveral years, however, there is a realistic possibility that Congress \nwill pass legislation this year to lower the tax on capital gains.\n  The two bills I am introducing today offer different approaches to \nincreasing economic growth, creating jobs, and enhancing fairness to \ntaxpayers. I urge my colleagues to take a look at these bills as we \nconsider how to best improve our Tax Code this year. I will have more \nto say on the need for capital gains tax reductions and the different \napproaches of these two bills in the days to come. My main purpose in \nintroducing these bills today is to get these ideas before my \ncolleagues and before the Nation. I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the Small Investors Tax Relief Act of 1995 and the Capital Formation \nand Jobs Creation Act of 1995 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 181\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; AMENDMENT OF 1986 CODE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Small \n     Investors Tax Relief Act of 1995''.\n       (b) Amendment of 1986 Code.--Except as otherwise expressly \n     provided, whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is \n     expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a \n     section or other provision, the reference shall be considered \n     to be made to a section or other provision of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to provide that pay for Members of Congress shall be \nreduced whenever total expenditures of the Federal Government exceed \ntotal receipts in any fiscal year, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n              the congressional fiscal responsibility act\n\n    \n    \n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I introduce S. 183, the \nCongressional Fiscal Responsibility Incentive Act, which provides that \nthe salary of Members of Congress be reduced by 10 percent whenever the \nFederal Government is unable to balance the budget at the close of a \nfiscal year. If further provides that such a reduced salary level \nremain in effect until the Government is successful in achieving a \nbalanced budget. The bill's requirements would ``sunset,'' however, \nupon passage of a balanced budget constitutional amendment by both \nHouses of the Congress.\n  It is a fundamental responsibility of Government to live within its \nmeans. When it fails to do so, damaging economic consequences result--\neither in terms of increased levels of inflation, higher interest \nrates, or diminished levels of capital for private investment. The \nprincipal reason for the Federal Government failing to balance its \nbudget is that Members of Congress find it difficult to resist \ntemptations to spend more money than they are willing to raise from \ntaxpayers. There is strong political incentive for Members to engage in \ndeficit spending. On the one hand, they reap the benefits of such \nspending by pleasing individuals who are its beneficiaries. On the \nother hand, they do not have to displease other individuals who would \notherwise have to pay higher taxes to support the spending.\n  This political incentive structure encourages deficit spending and \nthe negative economic consequences which flow from such spending. In \npart, I support the balanced budget constitutional amendment because I \nbelieve that it would alter these incentives. However, until such time \nas the balanced budget amendment is passed by both Houses of the \nCongress I would propose a more limited restructuring of incentives. \nThe proposed legislation would hold Members collectively responsible \nfor year-end deficits by reducing their pay.\n  Such a pay reduction is premised upon the fact that the Congress has \nfailed in an essential responsibility when it has failed to legislate a \nbalanced budget. By demonstrating an inability to contain its appetite \nfor spending, the Congress has acted irresponsibly by imposing upon the \npresent and future generations of the American people the burdens of \ndeficit spending. As a result, the long-term fiscal stability of the \ncountry which Members of Congress have been selected to govern is \neroded. The disincentive toward deficit spending contained in S. 183, \nwhile admittedly an imprecise counterweight to the political incentives \nwhich operate in favor of deficit spending, at least balances to some \ndegree the calculus of forces confronting Members who are tempted by \nthe lure of deficit spending.\n  Section 1 of S. 183 sets forth in short title, the Congressional \nFiscal Responsibility Incentive Act. Section 2(a) defines the essential \nprocedures by which a determination is made at the end of each fiscal \nyear whether or not a balanced budget has been achieved. If it has not \nbeen achieved, the 10 percent pay cut takes effect immediately. Such a \nreduction in pay is maintained until it is determined, by the same \nprocedures, that a balanced budget has been achieved for a subsequent \nfiscal year. Section 2(b) sets forth procedures designed to ensure that \nthe objectives of this legislation are not undermined in various ways. \nIt would require that measures to increase congressional pay not be \ncombined in bills laden with other subjects and it would require that a \nexplicit rollcall vote be cast on pay increases. Finally, section 3 \nwould have the proposed legislation take effect in connection with the \nfirst fiscal year beginning after its enactment. It would also \n``sunset'' the legislation upon the passage of a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment by both Houses of the Congress. Under this \namendment, a balanced budget would become the norm and further deficit \nspending would require the express support of a three-fifths super \nmajority of each House of the Congress.\n  Mr. President, S. 183 is not a panacea for our current fiscal \nproblems. However, until such time as a balanced budget amendment is \nplaced into the Constitution, it would effect a small but potentially \nimportant step toward more responsible Government.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATFIELD:\n  S. 184. A bill to establish an Office for Rare Disease Research in \nthe National Institutes of Health, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n            the office for rare disease research act of 1995\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, last October, I was distressed as \nI confronted two painful losses: the death of a very dear friend of \nmine, Eric Lopez, and the demise of my legislation to create an Office \nfor Rare Disease Research at the National Institutes of Health. It was \ndevastating yet apt that both were lost at the same time, because it \nwas Eric and his rare debilitating disease, Epidermolysis bullosa, that \noriginally inspired me to introduce this legislation.\n  I am proud to announce that the National Institute of Arthritis, \nMusculoskeletal and Skin Diseases will rename the National Registry of \nEpidermolysis bullosa in honor of Eric Lopez. His courage and \nperseverance helped to raise the public's awareness of this disease \nthrough the establishment of the Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa \nResearch Association, known as DEBRA.\n  Eric personalized the plight of a large group of Americans afflicted \nby rare diseases. Last session, my legislation passed the Senate but \nran out of time in the House. We were so close to enacting this bill \nthat we cannot justify its dissolution now. In the memory of Eric and \nmany others like him, let us endorse this legislation with unanimous \nconsent.\n  Diseases are labeled as rare when less than 200,000 people are \nafflicted; however, grouped together, these diseases affect over 10 to \n20 million Americans. Collectively, the term ``rare'' appears to be a \nmisnomer. A large portion of our population is battling diseases that \nare not only extremely difficult to diagnose but also difficult to \ntreat and almost impossible to cure. These individuals exist as islands \nwithout answers, without support systems, and paramount, without hope. \nAmbiguous symptoms involving multiple organ systems lead to years of \nfrustration in testing and misdiagnosis for the sufferers. The medical \nprofession also shares in this frustration as the information to aid in \ndiagnosis is nonexistent or scarce at best. There are currently no \ncenters of research, information, or support for the patient or the \nphysician. In today's environment of progressive health care, this is a \ntravesty.\n  Research is the most vital aspect of medicine, as we look to \ndiscovering cures. NIH has 20 Institutes of research that are centered \naround groups of diseases or organ systems. Rarely do these separate \norganizations communicate and coordinate research initiatives. \nObviously, such a fragmented approach further worsens the status of \nresearch on multisystemic diseases, such as the rare diseases, and \nlends itself to repetition and duplication of [[Page S678]] projects. \nUnlike the larger, more visible diseases such as heart and kidney \ndisease, oftentimes the rare diseases are lost in the bureaucratic \nshuffle.\n\n  My legislation avoids the establishment of yet another bureaucratic \ncenter by delineating and defining the duties of the already existing \nOffice of the Director of NIH. Foremost, the Office will formulate a \nstrategic plan for rare disease research which will support research, \naward grants and contracts, and coordinate efforts among Institutes and \nother Federal agencies. Identification of present research projects, \nboth private and Federal, and of opportunities and needs for future \nresearch will assist in preventing unnecessary duplication. \nCoordination among the Institutes will facilitate research efforts and \nthereby increase the effectiveness of every Federal dollar expended.\n  In addition, the bill establishes a National Advisory Council on Rare \nDisease Research, which will be composed of individuals appointed by \nthe Director of the NIH. The Council will review and assess research \nneeds, priorities, and funding to advise the NIH on the development and \nimplementation of the strategic research plan.\n  Finally, my legislation establishes a national research database, \naccessible to both medical professionals and the public. This will \nconnect researchers with patients for clinical trials, provide \nphysicians and individuals with information on trials, and connect \npatients with support groups. This database will provide the necessary \ninformation to cohesively plan an attack on these diseases.\n  In these times of tightening fiscal resources, Federal expenditures \nneed to be stringently examined for worthiness and applicability to the \nmajority of population. Despite the inability to put a dollar value on \nhuman suffering, it is still our duty as legislators to address and \nhopefully diminish it. The legislation I reintroduce today has the \nmerits of assisting many Americans in desperate need and, not necessity \nby requiring further expenditure of Federal dollars. The funding for \nthis program was included in the appropriations bill for NIH in fiscal \nyear 1995 and, therefore, is already available. This is an ideal \nopportunity to demonstrate that humanitarianism can coexist with \nfinancial acumen. Let us open this congressional session with a \nbipartisan triumph and enact this legislation as soon as possible.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill, along with a \nletter from the National Organization of Rare Disorders be placed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 184\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mark O. Hatfield,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Attention: Meagan Sexauer.\n\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: The National Organization for Rare \n     Disorders (NORD) fully supports your effort to enact \n     legislation to create the Office for Rare Disease Research at \n     NIH. As you know, creation of a central office to coordinate \n     the various research activities on behalf of these diseases \n     was the primary recommendation of the National Commission on \n     Orphan Diseases. The Commission's report was submitted to \n     Congress in 1989, and until now Congress has not acted upon \n     those recommendations.\n       The scope of the orphan disease problem is enormous. There \n     are more than 5,000 of these disorders, each one affecting \n     fewer than 200,000 Americans. Combined together all rare \n     disorders touch the lives of an estimated 20 million \n     Americans. They cripple, maim and kill thousands of people \n     every year, yet little research is being pursued on most of \n     these illnesses. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) \n     support the vast majority of biomedical research on rare \n     disorders because there is little interest in the private \n     sector to pursue development of treatments that have such \n     limited commercial value due to their small potential \n     markets.\n       The various institutes of NIH are responsible for research \n     on diseases that effect specific body systems. Yet many rare \n     diseases cross the boundaries of each institutes' \n     responsibilities. For example, a rare disease may have \n     neurological and immunological components (NINDS and NIAID), \n     dermatological symptoms (NIAMS), effect infants and children \n     (NICHD) and be inherited (NIGMS and the Human Genome Center). \n     An Office for Rare Disease Research at NIH would coordinate \n     these various research efforts in order to avoid duplication \n     and waste of precious resources. It would also develop and \n     operate a rare disease clinical database so that patients and \n     physicians could locate research projects relevant to their \n     disease. Conversely, since 47% of rare disease researchers \n     complain that it is difficult to locate a sufficient number \n     of patients to participate in clinical protocols, the Office \n     and the database would greatly alleviate this problem.\n       Senator Hatfield, so much of public policy is directed \n     toward ``major'' health threats; rare disorders are treated \n     as if they are ``minor'' problems. The suffering is quite \n     real, the morbidity and mortality is immeasurable, and the \n     hopelessness of knowing that research is not being pursued is \n     devastating not only to 20 million patients but to their \n     families and friends. The suffering of these people is not \n     ``minor,'' and the frustrations of rare disease scientists is \n     compelling. When they cannot get funding for their research, \n     when they cannot find a commercial sponsor to market a new \n     treatment, when they cannot locate patients for clinical \n     trials, they are forced to change their focus and move to \n     diseases that have more chance of attracting funds.\n       The Office of Rare Disease Research will provide hope and \n     comfort to masses of Americans with rare disorders who \n     continue to fall through the cracks of biomedical research, \n     and a safe haven for scientists who have devoted their \n     careers to these devastating illnesses. It will also signify \n     for the first time that the federal government, through a \n     carefully planned and coordinated program, is determined to \n     eradicate orphan diseases.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Abbey S. Meyers,\n\n                                                President.\n\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BUMPERS:\n  S. 185. A bill to transfer the Fish Farming Experimental Laboratory \nin Stuttgart, Arkansas, to the Department of Agriculture, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n     the stuttgart national aquaculture research center act of 1995\n\n    \n    \n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \ntransfer the Fish Farming Experimental Laboratory in Stuttgart, AR, \nfrom the Department of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture. \nThis legislation also requires that the name of the lab be changed to \nthe Stuttgart National Aquaculture Research Center. [[Page S679]] \n    \n    \n  This Fish Farming Experimental Laboratory was established under the \nFish and Rice Rotation Act of 1958, with a mandate to conduct research \nrelated to the commercial production and harvesting of warm water fish. \nWhen the lab was established, there was little or no information \navailable to commercial fish farmers about warm water aquaculture. \nThanks in large part to the lab, which has pioneered research in such \nareas as fish nutrition, water quality management and fish disease \nprevention, commercial fish farming is now one of the fastest growing \nindustries in the country.\n  Originally, the legislation creating the lab, provided that it be \nadministered by the Department of Agriculture. However, because the \nDepartment of the Interior already had an established fisheries \nprogram, Congress placed the program under the Department of the \nInterior's Fish and Wildlife Service. In retrospect, this decision was \na mistake. The Department of Agriculture, not the Department of the \nInterior has become the lead Federal agency in the research, \ndevelopment, and promotion of commercial aquaculture. While the \nDepartment of the Interior is involved in the aquaculture arena, its \nemphasis is more conservation related.\n  My belief that the Department of the Interior is no longer the \nappropriate agency to administer the lab was confirmed when during an \ninternal reorganization the Stuttgart lab was transferred from the Fish \nand Wildlife Service to the National Biological Survey [NBS]. As my \ncolleagues know, the NBS is charged with developing an inventory of \nplant and animal species and their habitats. A worthy endeavor, but one \nthat is in no way related to the lab's statutory mission of developing \nmethods for the commercial production of aquatic species. I believe it \nis only a matter of time before the staff and the resources of the lab \nare redirected toward research efforts that are more in keeping with \nthe mission of the NBS.\n  I have expressed my concerns to Secretary of the Interior Bruce \nBabbitt, who agrees with me that the Department of Agriculture is a \nmuch more appropriate place for the Stuttgart lab. The Department of \nAgriculture recognizes that private commercial aquaculture is an \nimportant and growing component of the U.S. economy and is committed to \nproviding a broad range of services to it. I have no doubt that the \nFish Farming Experimental Laboratory can complement and enhance the \nDepartment's existing and growing aquaculture program.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support this legislation and \nI look forward to its speedy passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 185\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of American in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Alaska Wetlands Conservation \n     Credit Procedures Act of 1994''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, \n     approximately 170,200,000 acres of wetlands existed in Alaska \n     in the 1780's and approximately 170,000,000 acres of wetlands \n     exist now, representing a loss rate of less than one-tenth of \n     1 percent through human and natural processes;\n       (2) according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife more than 221 \n     million acres of wetlands existed at the time of Colonial \n     America in the area that is now the contiguous United States \n     and 117 million of those acres, roughly 53 percent, have been \n     filled, drained, or otherwise removed from wetland status;\n       (3) Alaska contains more wetlands than any other State, and \n     more wetlands than all other States combined;\n       (4) eighty-eight percent of Alaska's wetlands are publicly \n     owned, whereas only 26 percent of the wetlands in the \n     contiguous 48 States are in public ownership;\n       (5) approximately 98 percent of all Alaskan communities, \n     including 200 of 209 remote villages in Alaska, are located \n     in or adjacent to wetlands;\n       (6) approximately 62 percent of all federally designated \n     wilderness lands, 70 percent of all Federal park lands, and \n     90 percent of all Federal refuge lands are located in Alaska, \n     thus providing protection to approximately 60 million acres \n     of wetlands;\n       (7) more than 60 million acres of wetland are conserved in \n     some form by land designations that restrict utilization or \n     degradation of wetlands;\n       (8) 104 million acres of land were granted to the State of \n     Alaska at statehood for purposes of economic development;\n       (9) approximately 43 million acres of land were granted to \n     Native Alaskans through regional and village corporations \n     and native allotments for their use and between 45 percent \n     and 100 percent of each Native corporations' land is \n     categorized as wetlands;\n       (10) development of basic community infrastructure in \n     Alaska, where approximately 75 percent of the nonmountainous \n     areas are wetlands, is often delayed sometimes prevented by \n     the wetlands regulatory program for minimal identifiable \n     environmental benefit;\n       (11) the 1899 Rivers and Harbors Act formerly regulated \n     disposition of dredge spoils in navigable waters, which did \n     not include wetlands, to keep navigable waters free of \n     impairments;\n       (12) the 1972 Clean Water Act formed the basis for a broad \n     expansion of Federal jurisdiction over wetlands by modifying \n     the definition of ``navigable waters' to include all ``waters \n     in the United States'';\n       (13) in 1975, a U.S. District Court ordered the Corps to \n     publish revised regulations concerning the scope of the \n     section 404 program, regulations that expanded the scope of \n     the program to include the discharge of dredged and fill \n     material into wetlands;\n       (14) the wetlands regulatory program was expanded yet again \n     by regulatory action to include isolated wetlands, those that \n     are not adjacent to navigable waters, and such an expansion \n     formed the basis for burdensome intrusions on the property \n     rights of Alaskans, Alaskan Native Corporations, the State of \n     Alaska, and property owners in Alaska;\n       (15) expansion of the wetlands regulatory program in this \n     manner is beyond what the Congress intended when it passed \n     the Clean Water Act and the expansion has placed increasing \n     and unnecessary economic and administrative burdens on \n     private property owners, small businesses, city governments, \n     State governments, farmers, ranchers, and other for \n     negligible environmental benefit associated with wetland \n     permits;\n       (16) for Alaska, a State with substantial conserved \n     wetlands and less than 1 percent private, noncorporate land \n     ownership, the burdens of the current wetlands regulatory \n     program unnecessarily inhibit reasonable community growth and \n     environmentally benign, sensitive resource development;\n       (17) Alaska villages, municipalities, boroughs, city \n     governments, and Native organizations are experiencing \n     increasing frustration with the constraints of the wetlands \n     regulatory program because it interferes with the location of \n     community centers, airports, sanitation systems, roads, \n     schools, industrial areas, and other critical community \n     infrastructure;\n       (18) policies that purport to achieve ``no net loss'' of \n     wetlands reflect a Federal response to the 53 percent loss of \n     the wetlands base in the South 48, a calculation that \n     excludes Alaska wetlands;\n       (19) total wetlands loss in Alaska is less than one-tenth \n     of 1 percent of the total wetlands acreage in Alaska;\n       (20) individual landowners in Alaska have experienced \n     devaluations of up to 97 percent of their property value due \n     to wetlands regulations and the tax base of many communities \n     has diminished by those regulations.\n\n     SEC. 3 AMENDMENT TO THE FEDERAL WATER POLLUTION CONTROL ACT.\n\n       The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et \n     seq.) is amended--\n       (a) in section 101(a) (33 U.S.C. 1251(a)) by--\n       (1) striking ``and'' at the end of

Mr. President, the bill that I have sent to the \ndesk makes a very simply point. We can spend money just as easily \nthrough the Tax Code as we can through the appropriations process or \nthrough the creation of mandatory spending programs.\n  I think we should be honest about the hundreds of billions of dollars \nthat we spend each year through tax expenditures. Spending is spending, \nwhether it comes in the form of a Government check or in the form of a \nspecial exception from the tax rates that apply to everyone else.\n  Tax expenditures or tax loopholes allow some taxpayers to lower their \ntaxes and leave the rest of us paying higher taxes than we otherwise \nwould pay. By requiring that Congress establish specific targets for \ntax expenditures as part of the budget reconciliation process, this \nbill simply places tax expenditures under the same budgetary scrutiny \nas all other spending programs.\n  Tax spending does not, as some would say, simply allow people to keep \nmore of what they earned. Rather, it gives them a special exception \nfrom the rules that oblige everyone to share in the responsibility of \nthe national defense and protecting the young, the aged, and the \ninfirmed.\n  Mr. President, we all have been heartened by the recent drops in \nprojected budget deficits. Recent CBO figures show the deficit dropping \nto $166 billion in 1996, largely due to the success we had in passing \nthe largest deficit reduction package during the 103d Congress.\n  However, we cannot rest on that success. Although it was a good \ndownpayment on deficit reduction, it is not enough. Even if we succeed \nin reducing the deficit further by cutting discretionary spending, we \nwill not even begin to touch the national debt.\n  We cannot afford to be timid, Mr. President. Our children's way of \nlife is dependent upon our acting on the Federal deficit today and \ntomorrow and every year thereafter until we restore fiscal sanity to \nour budget. We cannot wait until we grow our way out of the debt. And \nwe should not and cannot wait until deficits start drifting up in the \nlatter half of this decade before we do something.\n  The Congressional Budget Office tells us that the national debt held \nby the public will rise from approximately $3.5 trillion to roughly $6 \ntrillion in 2004. At that time, the national debt will equal almost 55 \npercent of our gross domestic product. By 2004, interest payments on \nthat debt will be approximately $334 billion, or over 3 percent of our \ngross domestic product. One recent report stated that these interest \npayments will cost each of today's children over $130,000 in extra \ntaxes over the course of their lifetime. Our national debt is nothing \nless than a mortgage on our Nation's, and our children's future.\n  Mr. President, let us not kid ourselves. Addressing our burgeoning \ndebt will not be easy. If it was, we would have done it years ago. \nBalancing the budget is going to require sacrifice from every American. \nIt also means that we are going to have to take a hard look at what we \nspend the taxpayers' money on. And that means all of our spending \nprograms, tax expenditures included.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that requires Congress, in our \nbudget resolution process, to simply establish targets for reducing tax \nexpenditures, just as we do for other spending items. Those targets \nwould be enforced through a separate line in our budget reconciliation \ninstructions for reductions in tax expenditures. We already do this for \nother entitlement programs. There is no reason not to do so for tax \nexpenditures. The Senate would pass a budget resolution asking the \nFinance Committee to reduce tax expenditures, for example, by $10 \nbillion a year or $20 billion or whatever the Senate decides is \nprudent. It would be up to the Finance Committee to meet those targets \nthrough the reconciliation process.\n  This separate tax expenditure target would not replace our current \nrevenue targets. Instead, it would simply ensure that the committee \nwould take at least that specified amount from tax expenditures. Or, in \nother words, we would ensure that the committee would not raise the \ntargeted amount from rate increases or excise tax increases.\n  I expect to hear from those who will say that I am trying to increase \ntaxes. I strongly disagree. I am simply trying to draw the Senate's \nattention to the very targeted spending we do through [[Page S682]] the \nTax Code, spending that is not subject to the annual appropriations \nprocess; spending that is not subject to the Executive order capping \nthe growth of mandatory spending; spending that is rarely ever debated \non the floor of the Senate once it becomes part of the Tax Code. The \npreferential deductions or credits or depreciation schedules or timing \nrules that we provide through the Tax Code are simply entitlement \nprograms under another guise. Many of them make sense, Mr. President. \nAnd I would be the first to admit that. Many, however, probably could \nnot stand the light of day if we had to vote on them as direct spending \nprograms.\n\n  Given our critical need for deficit reduction, tax spending should \nnot be treated any better or worse than other programs. It should not \nbe protected any more than Social Security payments or crop price \nsupport payments or Medicare payments or welfare payments.\n  What am I really talking about? I am talking about letting wealthy \ntaxpayers rent their homes for 2 weeks a year without having to report \nany income. That is already in the Tax Code. I am talking about \nproviding production subsidies in excess of the dollars invested for \nthe production of lead, uranium and asbestos--three poisons on which we \nspend millions of dollars each year just trying to clean up. That is \nalready in the code. I am talking about tax credits for clean-fuel \nvehicles, cancelation of indebtedness income for farmers or real estate \ndevelopers, special amortization periods for timber companies' \nreforestation efforts, industrial development bonds for airports or \ndocks, special treatment of capital construction funds for shipping \ncompanies, et cetera.\n  Mr. President, before we see a long line of people coming down to \ndefend these programs that I just mentioned, let me be clear that this \nbill does not pinpoint any specific expenditures. It simply requires \nthat these programs be treated in a manner similar to other entitlement \nprograms.\n  The Joint Tax Committee estimates the revenue lost from these tax \nexpenditures each year. While interaction effects make it difficult to \npinpoint exact costs--how one tax expenditure interacts with another--\nthe Joint Tax Committee list will add up to over $425 billion in 1995. \nUnchecked, this list will grow by $60 billion to over $485 billion by \n1999. Perhaps more interesting, however, are the administration's \nestimates of what the ``outlay equivalents'' for these tax expenditures \nare each year, in other words what they would cost us if they were \ntransformed into direct spending programs, as opposed to hidden \nspending programs in the Tax Code. The administration's estimate for \noutlay equivalents in 1994 added up to $550 billion; by 1998, this \namount is expected to grow to over $660 billion. At a time when we are \nproperly talking about other spending cuts, I do not believe that tax \nexpenditures should be out of bounds.\n  I am not suggesting that we eliminate all these programs. In fact, \nmany of them I support. All I am suggesting is we put them under the \nsame scrutiny that we put on other entitlement programs.\n  If we are serious about deficit reduction--and for our Nation's \nfuture I sincerely hope that we are--then every segment of spending \nwill have to be examined. We will not do it through discretionary \nspending cuts alone. Indeed, what is an area of the budget that is \nshrinking in terms of gross national product. We will not be able to do \nit through entitlement cuts alone. In order to achieve equitable, \nlasting deficit reduction, we will meet to consider tax expenditures as \nwell.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I list Mr. Daschle and Mr. Kerry as original sponsors. I ask \nunanimous consent to have the text of the bill printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                 S. 98\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize and congratulate \nthe University of Colorado football team on a great season. The CU \nBuffaloes finished their season with 11 wins and 1 loss. On January 2, \n1995, they became the Fiesta Bowl champions, earning the No. 3 ranking \nin the Nation.\n  Mr. President, Colorado won as a team but, three individuals deserve \nspecial recognition for their accomplishments. First, congratulation to \nCU tailback Rashaan Salaam who rushed for 2,055 yards this past season. \nRashaan is only the fourth person in collegiate football history to \nattain this mark. He has received honors including being named All-\nAmerican, All-Big Eight, and the NCAA rushing champion for 1994. In \nDecember, Rashaan became the first CU Buffalo to receive the coveted \nHeisman Trophy. Next, CU quarterback Kordell Stewart has earned \nacknowledgment for his on-the-field leadership of the CU Buffaloes for \nthe past two seasons. Korell holds 38 school records, including the \nmost total offensive yards by a player, total passing yards, and most \ntouchdown passes thrown. He also is the Big Eight Conference all-time \ntotal offense record holder by gaining 7,770 passing and rushing yards. \nThe final notable individual is head coach Bill McCartney. Through \nCoach McCartney's leadership and motivation the CU Buffaloes football \nprogram has become one of the strongest in the Nation.\n  This was Bill McCartney's 13th and final season as head coach. He \nretires [[Page S683]] as the winningest coach in Colorado's 104-year \nhistory. Bill McCartney coached the Buffaloes to three Big Eight \nchampionships and a national title during the 1990-91 season. I wish \nall the best to Rashaan Salaam, Kordell Stewart, and Bill McCartney in \nthe future.\n    \n    \n  It gives the people of the State of Colorado great pride to see the \nCU Buffaloes attain this level of excellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/09/senate-section/article/S682-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--S. 169\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
