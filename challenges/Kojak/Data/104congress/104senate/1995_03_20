I thank the Chair for his recognition.\n  Mr. President, I would like to begin by addressing some of the \nremarks that were made on Friday by the distinguished Democratic \nleader. I think it is pretty clear now what the strategy of the \nopponents of S. 4 will be.\n  Very frankly, Mr. President, it will be to attempt to foist off on \nthe American people the idea that a majority vote in one House \nconstitutes a veto. It will be the idea that the traditional belief \nthat a two-thirds majority is required to override a veto is now \nreplaced by a simple majority in one House.\n  Mr. President, as a result of the 1994 elections, the American people \nsent a message and a clear and unequivocal one that they want the pork-\nbarrel spending stopped. They want it stopped. They figured out that \nthe money that they sent to Washington, DC, does not all come back. In \nfact, it comes back to different States and congressional districts in \ndifferent amounts, but some of it always stays here in Washington, DC.\n  In Senator Daschle's remarks on Friday, he said:\n\n       The President is prepared today or tomorrow or any time to \n     reiterate what he said all along.\n\n  He said he just came from a meeting with the President of the United \nStates.\n\n       He supports the line-item veto. It is that simple. There is \n     no question about it.\n\n  Mr. President, if that is true, and I do not question the \ndistinguished minority leader's remarks, I would like to hear from the \nPresident. We on this side of the aisle would like to hear \n [[Page S4154]] from the President. The American people would like to \nhear from the President of the United States. I would like to see a \nstrong letter from the President of the United States to every Member \nof this body before we take up the debate on S. 4 this afternoon and \namending it that he supports the line-item veto, and the line-item veto \nmeans two-thirds vote by both Houses in order to override.\n  If there is no question about it and if the President of the United \nStates is committed, as he was in the quote from ``Putting People \nFirst'' where he said he needed a line-item veto, where he personally \ntold me 2 years ago that he was in support of the line-item veto, and \njust recently in a number of public occasions the President of the \nUnited States has said that he is in favor of the line-item veto, it is \ntime for the President to weigh in and support it and support it \nstrongly. Otherwise, what is going to happen is that those who know \nthey no longer can take the line-item veto head on and defeat it on a \nprocedural motion or just defeat it on a straight up-or-down vote will \nmake every attempt to succeed by us being unable to get 60 votes to cut \noff debate because they will support a watered-down, meaningless \ncharade that they call a line-item veto which allows an override of the \nPresident's veto by the majority of one House of Congress.\n  Mr. President, it took a majority vote of two Houses of Congress in \norder to put the pork in. So let us not kid ourselves about what the \nissue is here.\n  I have to go back, though. The distinguished minority leader said--\nthe fact is so for most Democrats:\n\n       I have supported a line-item veto since coming to the \n     Congress. I did 15 years ago and I do today. I always have. I \n     believe that it is an important aspect of good legislating.\n\n  I wish that that had been displayed on the numerous occasions in the \nlast 8 years that Senator Coats and I tried to get the line-item veto \nup for a vote. We were blocked from doing so, Mr. President, on each \noccasion on the votes, on a procedural matter which prevented us from \ngetting an up-or-down vote.\n  In 1989, Senator Daschle voted ``no'' as far as allowing the line-\nitem veto to be brought up, as the vote was on a budget point of order. \nA budget point of order was raised against our efforts to bring up the \nline-item veto as an amendment. In November 1989, Senator Daschle voted \n``no.'' In 1990, Senator Daschle voted ``yes.'' In 1992, Senator \nDaschle voted ``yes.'' And on a motion to table in 1993, Senator \nDaschle voted to table.\n  So I must say that the position of my friend from South Dakota on \nthis issue has been somewhat mixed.\n  In 1993 on a motion to waive the Budget Act, the vote was 45 to 52. \nSenator Daschle voted ``no'' to waive the Budget Act as late as 1993, \nso that we could bring the line-item veto up for consideration.\n  But I will accept Senator Daschle at his word. I will accept the \nminority leader at his word that ``everybody wants a line-item veto.'' \nBut if they really do support the line-item veto, Mr. President, they \nwill support the meaning of the word ``veto.''\n  The word ``veto,'' according to the Constitution of the United \nStates, calls for a two-thirds majority in order for the veto to be \noverridden. Section 7 of the Constitution of the United States:\n\n       Every Bill which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a \n     Law, be presented to the President of the United States; if \n     he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, \n     with his Objections to that House in which it shall have \n     originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their \n     Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such \n     Reconsideration two-thirds of that House shall agree to pass \n     the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to \n     the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, \n     and if approved by two-thirds of that House, it shall become \n     a Law.\n  Mr. President, the Constitution of the United States describes what a \nveto is and what is required in order to override that veto.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from South Dakota goes on to say:\n\n       I recognize that 43 States have already done what we would \n     like to do here. Forty-three States have already acknowledged \n     that Governors ought to have an opportunity to review and \n     send back for further review items in legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, he does not mention that it requires a two-thirds vote \nto override a Governor's veto. In the 43 States out of 50 that have \nline-item vetoes that Senator Daschle obviously approves of, there \nobviously clearly is a two-thirds vote required in order to override.\n  Mr. President, may I ask how much time is divided between the two \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order there are 209 minutes for each \nside. The Senator from Arizona has used 8 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, last Friday, the Democratic leader, as I mentioned, \ntook the floor of the Senate to lay out his views regarding the line-\nitem veto, which I assume are in league with many others on the other \nside of the aisle. I must say I found the statements confusing and \ncontradictory. The Senator from South Dakota vowed his support for the \nline-item veto, then in the course of remarks expressed his opposition \nto the pending bill and the expected substitute, both of which provide \ntrue line-item veto authority.\n  Mr. President, he alleged that the separate enrollment substitute was \nsomething the Senate has never seen before. The facts are quite to the \ncontrary. The Senate voted on this measure in 1985. It has been \nintroduced in every Congress since that time. In fact, two separate \nenrollment bills have been introduced in this session, cosponsored by \nSenators on the other side of the aisle and cosponsored by a number of \nour Democratic colleagues.\n  But most confusing of all, the Senator from South Dakota went on to \npledge his support for a measure that is not a line-item veto at all, a \nprocess known as the expedited rescission which would allow a simple \nmajority in either House to block a Presidential veto of wasteful or \nunnecessary spending. I am disturbed by the contradiction, and it begs \nthe application of the tried and true admonition: ``Watch what we do, \nnot what we say.''\n  I just quoted from the Constitution of the United States, but I wish \nto emphasize again that this issue of the line-item veto will come down \nto whether we enact a true veto, which is a two-thirds majority in both \nHouses in order to override a President's veto and eliminate the \nunnecessary spending and wasteful spending that has become epidemic to \nthe point where we now have nearly a $5 trillion national debt, or \nwhether we will enact some kind of sham or charade or false line-item \nveto which will allow the President's veto to be overridden by a simple \nmajority of one House.\n  Mr. President, that is simply not acceptable. It is also, frankly, a \nterrible fraud that we would perpetrate on the American people.\n  Each year the Library of Congress distributes an information packet \non legislative procedures which House and Senate Members send to their \nconstituents, many of whom are students educating themselves on how \nCongress works. This packet describes the veto override process as \nfollows:\n\n       Overriding a veto requires a two-thirds vote of those \n     present who must number a quorum and vote by rollcall.\n\n  That is what we tell students, and it is perfectly correct. But in \nthis Chamber in classic Orwellian fashion we seem to be redefining the \nprocess and, contrary to the facts, call expedited rescission a veto. \nWhy? Because it is politically convenient. It sounds tougher.\n  Mr. President, the American people have not had enough reform. They \nhave had enough rhetorical bait and switch. Substance is what counts, \nsubstance is what the American people deserve, and substance is what we \nare duty bound to legislate.\n  Let me also point out, Mr. President, that by a vote of 294 to 130, \nthe other body adopted the line-item veto that we are considering today \nand will be taking up formally this afternoon. The same proposal of a \nsimple majority in one House was also voted in the other body, and that \nvote was overwhelmingly in rejection of it. I have talked to the \nleadership of the other body, and the fact is clear that they will not \naccept anything less than a true line-item veto.\n  I must say I was somewhat surprised, if not a little amused, by the \nremarks of the Senator from South Dakota in which he criticized \nseparate enrollment as too cumbersome and time consuming. The President \nof the United States, the Speaker of the House, and \n [[Page S4155]] the President pro tempore will have to sign more \npaperwork.\n  I know they are busy people, and I am sorry for the extra burden but, \nMr. President, if eliminating wasting of the taxpayers' dollars and \nreducing the deficit spending on this and future generations is not \nimportant, please tell me what is. If our political leadership is not \nhere to ensure that the fruits of our constituents' labors are not \nsquandered and that Government functions in a lean and efficient \nmanner, then what are we here for? Is it about the debated trappings of \nthe Founders' oak desks, gilded ceilings, and marble halls, no matter \nhow it is exercised?\n  No, I do not believe it. I categorically reject that any extra \npaperwork resulting from the line-item veto is a waste of time. Given \nthe tens of billions of dollars that will be saved, it may be the best \ncost beneficial expenditure of time in the Federal service.\n  As Senators, we take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of \nthe United States. There is not one amongst us who does not regard that \npledge, that responsibility with the highest sense of duty and \nobligation.\n  When we debate the issue of public expenditures, there is always \nintense discussion regarding the intention of our Founding Fathers. Mr. \nPresident, the Framers vested the President with veto authority as part \nof that miraculous system of checks and balances that distinguishes our \nnational character from any other in the history of mankind. They knew \nthat the veto was an essential check on the legislative branch. They \nhad no idea how wise they were.\n  Mr. President, I will show you the first spending bill approved by \nCongress. It was one page. And I can tell you that what the Congress in \nits early years enacted were single-page bills that were addressing one \nitem and were sent to the President's desk.\n  It was not until sometime around the Civil War that the so-called \nriders began to be added to appropriations bills and other bills, and \none of the first to really complain vociferously about it was President \nGrant. And, of course, as we know, that has proliferated and \nproliferated to the point where I remember in 1984 when President \nReagan, speaking in the State of the Union Message had displayed a \n1,300-some page--I believe it was 2\\1/2\\ pounds--continuing resolution.\n  Now, Mr. President, which would the American people prefer, a 1,300-\npage continuing resolution, most of which had never been seen or read \nby the majority of the Members of both bodies, much less the President \nof the United States, or would they prefer a single bill that they know \nis going to contain much-needed and vital funds, their taxpayers' \ndollars for much-needed projects or efforts? I think the answer is \nobvious. I think it is long ago time for us to look seriously at single \nenrollment.\n  Another thing about single enrollment is that maybe we will reduce \nsome of the rampant numbers of riders and additional appropriations and \nitems that are tucked into appropriations bills which most of us never \nsee until long after the bill is passed and has reached the President's \ndesk.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at the way we used to do business in the \nearly days, and when we are debating this issue of the intentions of \nthe Founding Fathers I do not believe that there was a single Founding \nFather who believed that we would be considering bills of thousands of \npages in length with tens of thousands of line items associated with \nthem. I think we could avoid many items--for example, fruit and \nvegetable market analysis, Russian wheat aphid, wood utilization \nresearch, et cetera, et cetera--that we find highlighted on an annual \nbasis unfortunately after the fact.\n  Let us take a look and see what 200 years has done to the legislative \nprocess. I want to show the continuing resolution, as I mentioned, in \n1984. It is thousands of pages of every kind of spending. We told the \nPresident either to swallow the whole thing or to shut down the \nGovernment. Is this what James Madison and Thomas Jefferson had in \nmind? I do not think so.\n  In the coming days, some will question whether we have the \nconstitutional authority to separately enroll bills for presentation to \nthe President, even though article I section 5 of the Constitution \nleaves to Congress the determination of its rules and what shall \nconstitute a bill. I wonder where those who handwring about the \nconstitutionality of separate enrollment were in 1984? I did not hear \nany outcries of indignation of the constitutionality of thousands of \npages of continuing resolution passed in the form of a single bill.\n  In 1985, when the Senate debated separate enrollment, the argument \nwas made that the President never sees the details of appropriations \nbills and that the line-item veto would simply empower bureaucrats at \nthe Office of Management and Budget. They used the ignorance argument \nto oppose separate enrollment.\n  Mr. President, the allegation of Presidential ignorance cries out for \nseparate enrollment. Perhaps it is high time the Chief Executive sees \nwhere taxes are going specifically. Maybe when he is asked to affix his \nconsentual signature to a sentence saying that millions of dollars will \nbe appropriated for a research participation center at a specific \nuniversity or for military construction at a base to be closed by the \nPentagon, the bells will ring, the lights will flash, and line-item \nveto of our expenditures will give rise to line-item responsibility by \nthose both in the legislative and executive who have been invested with \nstewardship in the public purse. Allowing the President to remain \nignorant of what it is he signs is a very poor and uncompelling \nargument against the line-item veto.\n  The assertion will also be made that line-item veto will give the \nPresident the opportunity to extort Members of Congress; the President \nwould get a leg up in the executive-legislative contest, or tit for \ntat. The President would say, either I get your vote for this bill that \nI want, Congressperson, or I will kill your project.\n  There are two fundamental flaws in this argument. First, despite \nbeing an extremely cynical assessment of the President, it completely \nignores the court of public opinion, before which the President and \nevery other elected official must be called to account and the \njudgments of which vote-seekers are extremely sensitive to. Legislative \nextortion, if it were to occur, would be a gold mine for the fourth \nestate which is always eager to shed sunlight on such mischief. No \ndoubt practitioners in the public arena would feel the swift rebuke of \npublic disapproval.\n  The second is the argument never takes into account the current and \nmore supportive practice of log rolling, ``I'll support your pork if \nyou support mine,'' which leaves its mark on practically every \nappropriations bill and which has given Congress approval ratings \nsomewhere between Stalin and peptic indigestion. The ``go along to get \nalong'' is far more dangerous than the prospects of legislative \nextortion which, if it does occur, would only manifest itself if \nMembers willingly give in to such pressure. Surely we think better of \nourselves and our colleagues than that.\n  The debate that will take place over the next several days is sure to \nbe spirited and the debate we are certain to hear much more about is \nthe balance of power. The allegation that line-item veto distorts the \nbalance of power will become, I suspect, the mantra. The statement will \nbe made, and it is correct, that Congress retains the power of the \npurse. How have we exercised that power? What is the fruit of that \nvirtually unchecked authority? Yearly deficits of nearly $250 billion, \nan amount that will triple in 10 years if we stay the present course; a \n$4.6 trillion millstone of debt we have hung around the neck of future \ngenerations; a yearly budget one-fifth of which must be dedicated to \npay the interest on our debt.\n  Mr. President, I point out again, from the earliest days, from the \nearliest Congresses of the United States, expenditures and revenues \nwere roughly equal. I have a chart that indicates that was so \nthroughout this Nation's history.\n  Also throughout this Nation's history, beginning with Thomas \nJefferson, Presidents exercise the right to impound funds. Thomas \nJefferson impounded $50,000 which the Congress of the United States had \nappropriated to procure gunboats. The threat no longer existed, the \nPresident of the United States, President Jefferson, did not \n [[Page S4156]] spend that money, and from then on every President of \nthe United States, to a greater or lesser degree continued that \npractice of impoundment of funds.\n  In 1974, the Congress of the United States passed the present Budget \nand Impoundment Act which deprived the President of the United States \nof that ability and put the rescission process basically into the hands \nof the legislative branch. In other words, if the President of the \nUnited States proposes a rescission and if the Congress does not act, \nthen that rescission is not enacted. So, by merely passively reacting \nto a Presidential rescission, the Congress of the United States \nvirtually stymies any President's efforts to reduce wasteful and pork-\nbarrel spending.\n  In 1974, that is when expenditures and revenues began to diverge in a \ndramatic fashion. We have not, throughout this Nation's history, had \nthis burgeoning debt that I just described, or anything like it, except \nin times of war. And the Congress and the people of the United States, \nwhen those times of war were over, have quickly acted to bring us out \nof deficit by their practice of appropriating so the debt was removed, \nbecause for nearly 200 years Congress and the people of the country \nrealized that a burgeoning debt, laid on future generations of \nAmericans, is nearly an unconscionable act--it is, in fact, an \nunconscionable act.\n  But in 1974, because of the shift in power, the shift in power that \nwill be debated right here on this floor, the ability of the executive \nbranch of the United States to exercise fiscal responsibility and \nfiscal restraint on the Congress of the United States disappeared and \nthe deficits began to grow and the debt began to accumulate.\n  I will have a pie chart at some time during this debate that shows \nhow much of the Federal budget in 1974 was spent on paying interest on \nthe national debt. It was a very small amount, somewhere around 1 or 2 \npercent.\n  Now, this year, we will spend more on paying interest on the national \ndebt than we will on national defense. I do not know how you pay off a \n$4.6 trillion debt. I do know this, that there are many experts who are \nsaying that the recent decline in the dollar was directly related to \nthe Congress' failure to enact a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States because our debt is so large and \nrequires such a huge influx of foreign dollars that we are very \nvulnerable to the vagaries of the investment policies of foreign \ninvestors and foreign nations.\n  All that aside, I do not know, as the Senator from Missouri stated so \neloquently on Friday in his presentation, how in the world you can \nexpect any family, any business, any government to operate on a \ncontinuously deficit basis and not sooner or later have a crisis of \nenormous proportions. And the longer we wait and the larger this debt \ngets, the greater will be the cataclysm when we finally face up.\n  I was fascinated, again on Friday, when we strayed back into the \nissue of Social Security and raiding the Social Security trust funds \nand the terrible impact that a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution would have on the Social Security trust funds. I not so \nproudly point out I was one of two Republicans who voted for the \namendment that would protect Social Security. But the fact is, we \ncannot protect Social Security, we cannot protect Medicare, we cannot \nprotect anything--there is nothing we can protect--if this country goes \nbankrupt; if we do not stop amassing this huge debt that is a millstone \naround the neck of future generations of Americans.\n  So, to argue that Social Security must be protected I think is a \nlegitimate argument. But to ignore the consequences of a failure to \nbalance our budget on Social Security or any other program--because \neither the country goes bankrupt or\n we debase the currency through inflation thereby reducing the national \ndebt in real terms. And what happens, though, when you debase the \ncurrency? When you debase the currency, as we have found time after \ntime in other nations throughout the world, and nearly so in this \nNation a couple of times, you destroy the middle class and the middle \nclass is the fundamental pillar of democracy as we know it.\n\n  So let us not kid ourselves about balance of power. The balance of \npower has resided basically in a very fundamentally balanced fashion \nfor nearly 200 years. In 1974 that balance of power was skewed \ndramatically on the side of the legislative branch.\n  Let me also mention another thing that seems to come up quite often. \nDuring the many years that passed, 8 years that I have been a Member of \nthis body, when I would bring up the line-item veto, one of the first \nresponses would be, ``Well, you would not support that if it was a \nMember of the other party who was President.'' I have always stoutly \ndenied that to be the case, and indeed I am now proving that is not the \ncase. But the fact is, too, that this President of the United States \nwill probably, if when given this power--and I believe he will sooner \nor later be given this authority--will veto an item that I think is \nwrong. Because he and I are of different philosophy and different \nparty, he will take some executive actions that I do not agree with. It \nmay be harmful in the short term, especially in the area of national \nsecurity. Clearly, I am in strong disagreement with the administration \non how much funds should be spent on national defense and this \nPresident of the United States may choose to veto some items especially \nbrought up on the floor, such as the ballistic missile defense \ncapability. I am willing to take that risk because, if we bankrupt the \ncountry, we are not going to have any ballistic missile defense \ncapability at all.\n  So I would like to state again, it matters not who is the President \nof the United States or what persuasion or what party. What matters is \nthat are we going to be able to stop the terrible things that have gone \non for so long which have caused us to find ourselves in a deplorable \nsituation where paying off the national debt is rapidly becoming one of \nthe largest portions of our national budget.\n  Mr. President, in the case of the separate enrollment being \nconstitutional, I think it is important for us to consult with various \nleaders who are experts on the Constitution. I think it is important \nthat we understand that the Congress has the right to present a bill to \nthe President of the United States. As I mentioned article 1, section \n5, each House of Congress has unilateral authority to make and amend \nrules governing its procedures. A separate enrollment speaks to the \nquestion of what constitutes a bill. It does nothing to erode the \nprerogative of the President as that bill is presented. Under the \nrulemaking clause, our procedures for defining and enrolling a bill are \nfor ourselves to determine alone.\n  There is precedent provided in the House rule, the so-called Gephardt \nrule. Under this rule the House clerk is instructed to prepare a joint \nresolution raising the debt ceiling when Congress adopts a concurrent \nbudget resolution which exceeds the statutory debt limit. The House is \ndeemed to have voted on and passed a resolution on the debt ceiling \nwhen the vote occurs on the concurrent resolution. Despite the fact \nthat a vote is never taken, the House is deemed to have passed it.\n  The American law division of the Congressional Research Service has \nanalyzed separate enrollment legislation and found it constitutional.\n  Johnny Killian wrote:\n\n       Evidently, it would appear to be that simply to authorize \n     the President to pick and choose among provisions of the same \n     bill would be to contravene this procedure. For a separate \n     enrollment, however, a different tack is chosen. Separate \n     bills drawn out of a single bill are forwarded to the \n     President. In this fashion, he may pick and choose. The \n     formal provisions of the presentation clause would seem to be \n     observed by this device.\n\n  Laurence Tribe also has observed that the measure is constitutional. \nHe recently wrote,\n\n       The most promising line item veto idea by far is . . . that \n     congress itself begin to treat each appropriation and each \n     tax measure as an individual ``bill'' to be presented \n     separately to the President for his signature or veto. Such a \n     change could be effected simply, and with no real \n     constitutional difficulty, by a temporary alteration in \n     congressional rules regarding the enrolling and presentment \n     of bills.\n       Courts construing the Rules Clause of Article I, Sec 5 have \n     interpreted it in expansive terms, and I have little doubt \n     that the sort of individual presentment envisioned by such a \n     rules change would fall within Congress' broad authority.\n  [[Page S4157]] The distinguished Senator from Delaware, Senator \nBiden, during his tenure as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwrote extensive additional views in a committee report on a \nconstitutional line-item veto. He wrote about a separate enrollment \nsubstitute he offered:\n\n       Under the separate enrollment process instituted by the \n     statutory line-item veto, the items of appropriation \n     presented to the President would not be passed according to \n     routine lawmaking procedures. Congress would vote on the \n     original appropriations bill, but would not vote again on the \n     separately enrolled bills presented to the President. The \n     absence of a second vote on the individual items of \n     appropriation has raised questions of constitutionality. For \n     the following reasons, such concerns are unfounded.\n       1. No change in congressional authority:\n       Each House of Congress has the power to make and amend the \n     rules governing its internal procedures. And, of course, \n     Congress has complete control over the content of the \n     legislation it passes. Thus, the decisions to initiate the \n     process of separate enrollment, to terminate the process \n     through passage of a subsequent statute, to pass a given \n     appropriations bill, and to establish the sections and \n     paragraphs of that bill, are all fully within Congress' \n     discretion and control.\n       A requirement that Congress again pass each separately \n     enrolled item would be only a formal refinement--not a \n     substantive one. It would not prevent power from being \n     shifted from Congress to the President, because under the \n     statutory line-item veto Congress will retain the full extent \n     of its legislative power. Nor would it serve to shield \n     Congress from the process of separate enrollment, because \n     Congress will retain the discretion to terminate that \n     process.\n       2. House Rule XLIX: Statutory Limit on Public Debt.\n       Rule XLIX of the House of Representatives empowers the \n     enrolling clerk of the House to prepare a joint resolution \n     raising the debt ceiling when Congress adopts a concurrent \n     resolution on the budget exceeding the statutory limit on the \n     public debt.\n       This procedure, which has been in existence since 1979, \n     provides a clear precedent for the separate enrollment of \n     items of appropriation. The House never votes on the joint \n     resolution. Nonetheless, the House is ``deemed'' to have \n     voted on the resolution because of its vote on the concurrent \n     resolution. House Rule XLIX states, in part:\n       The vote by which the conference report on the concurrent \n     resolution in the budget was agreed to in the House * * * \n     shall be deemed to have been a vote in favor of such joint \n     resolution upon final passage in the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n  The committee report continues:\n\n       House Rule XLIX has not been found unconstitutional because \n     of its modification of routine lawmaking procedures. The \n     joint resolution engrossed by the clerk is transmittal to the \n     Senate for further action, and then presented to the \n     President for his signature. This process has been in effect \n     for a decade. Despite the absence of a separate vote by the \n     House on the joint resolution, there have been no \n     constitutional challenges.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to quote from an editorial written in the \nLos Angeles Times on July 23, 1985.\n\n       Growing support for the line-item veto in the Senate and \n     the House is a reflection of the Pogo principle in \n     contemporary politics, ``we have met the enemy, and they is \n     us.'' The budget process is in shambles, the deficit is out \n     of control * * *\n\n  Mind you, Mr. President, this was written in 1985.\n\n       The budget process is in shambles, the deficit is out of \n     control, and Congress is the problem. Our systems of checks \n     and balances which functions adequately, even brilliantly in \n     most areas, is out of kilter in the area of the budget. \n     Congress has too much power over the purse and the President \n     has too little. The line-item veto is, while neither the \n     miracle cure that the proponents promised nor the disaster \n     that the opponents feared, is one of the few available tools \n     to redress imbalance. The fundamental issue is fiscal \n     responsibility, and it has little to do with partisan \n     politics or the current budget wars that pit a Republican \n     President against a Democratic House, and even against his \n     own Republican Senate. A larger principle and a longer \n     perspective are at stake. When 100 Senators and 435 \n     Representatives have primary responsibility for the budget, \n     no one is adequately responsible. The traditional veto power \n     of the President, which worked well until the 1970's, is \n     still sufficient to keep most other legislation in check. But \n     it is too unwieldy to impose significant discipline on the \n     appropriations process. In 1983, and 1984, the 98th Congress \n     produced 623 bills that were sent to the White House and \n     signed into law. Only 27 were appropriations bills. But they \n     made up in size and scope for what they lacked in number, \n     dispensing hundreds of billions across the entire range of a \n     myriad of Federal programs.\n       Very occasionally, Presidents have been bold enough to veto \n     one or another of these behemoth appropriations bills because \n     they have objected to particular provisions. More often, the \n     massive nature of the modern appropriations process has \n     overwhelmed the executive veto power, and the President \n     acquiesces in bills that by any standards are badly flawed. \n     By giving the President a stronger role, the line-item veto \n     would instill a new and needed measure of Presidential \n     accountability and Federal spending, and reduce the excesses \n     of a congressional process that too readily focuses on \n     individual districts and separate interests, not the national \n     interest. In any event, the line-item veto is hardly a \n     riverboat gamble. Forty-three States have already given a \n     similar power to their Governors who universally regard it as \n     an indispensable tool of budget control, at least until they \n     become U.S. Senators.\n       Presidents since Grant have sought the line-item veto, but \n     until now Congress has refused to cede the power, and with \n     considerable justification because earlier Congresses seldom \n     brought in budgets that were unbalanced. The Congress has \n     only itself to blame for the irresistible pressure to yield \n     some of its power to the President. We gave that to the \n     Treasury with massive tax cuts and huge increases in military \n     spending\n      in the past 4 years and the country will continue to sink \n     into an irreversible morass of deficits unless corrective \n     action is taken. Everybody talks about balancing the \n     budget, but nobody is currently doing much about it. \n     Congress claims it is the President's fault for failing to \n     use the veto: ``Stop us before we spend again.'' The \n     President pleads, in turn, that he fervently detests \n     deficits but does not have the power to fight them fully. \n     So let us give it to him and help him live up to his own \n     rhetoric, and let us see to it that Congress will be \n     looking over its shoulders as it packages and passes \n     future appropriations bills.\n\n  Mr. President, that is from a column, written in the Wall Street \nJournal on July 23, 1985, by Senator Edward M. Kennedy. I agree with \neverything Senator Kennedy says. If he was worried about the debt and \ndeficit being out of control in 1985, it has increased by trillions of \ndollars since then. I look forward to working with him and other \nMembers on the other side of the aisle who, back in 1985, supported a \nmotion to invoke cloture on the then separate enrollment bill that was \nbrought up at that time.\n  Mr. President, I am also going to address the issue of the separate \nenrollment and how many extra items that would require for the \nPresident's signature. Mr. President, this is the Commerce, State, and \nJustice appropriations bill. It was the longest appropriations bill \nthat was passed last year. As you can see, it is about an inch thick, \nand it is in fairly small print. Of all of the 13 appropriations bills, \nthis is the longest. Using modern computers which, I am happy to say, \nour enrolling clerks in the Senate and the House have access to, it \ntook approximately 4 hours to take this bill, which was the longest of \nthe appropriations bills, and convert it into this, which is 500 \ndifferent bills.\n  Mr. President, there is a difference between these two. But the fact \nis that the statements that are made about a Mack truck that will be \nrequired to take it down to the White House, et cetera, et cetera, do \nnot work.\n  I also suggest, when you are looking at this, Mr. President, that \nthere is probably good opportunity that about this much of it would \nprobably never appear, never have to be enrolled if the line-item veto \nwere a threat because there are probably about this many appropriations \nthat were added that were unnecessary, wasteful, and, in some cases, \noutrageous. So when we are talking about the huge difference that it \nwould make, as far as enrolled items are concerned, as opposed to a \nregular appropriations bill, yes, there is a difference.\n  If there is a difference between these two and taking the time for \nthe President of the United States to sign 500 bills, I would ask how \nmuch would we save in tens of billions of dollars of wasteful and \nunnecessary spending, and would it be worth that additional time? I \nthink the American people would argue that if it takes a little extra \ntime to have a bill signed separately and it would save billions of \ndollars, they would opt for the latter.\n  Mr. President, finally, I say--and I do not want to take too much \ntime because the time is equally divided on both sides--this afternoon \nwe will be in formal debate on S. 4. I expect the majority leader to \ncome forward with a substitute to S. 4, which is a compromise that we \nhave agreed to, and there are certain aspects of it that I think \nimprove the bill. There are also aspects of it which I think are \nnegotiable.\n  We know where the crisis will lie. Sometime on Wednesday or Thursday, \na motion to invoke cloture will be \n [[Page S4158]] voted on, which, as we all know, requires 60 votes. I \ndo not know how that will turn out. I am confident that, of the 54 \nMembers on this side of the aisle, they will all vote in favor to cut \noff debate, even if one or two of them may oppose the bill in its \npresent form. I look forward to negotiating with them and working with \nthem. But the fact is, to not even have this issue come to a final vote \nbefore the Senate would be a very serious mistake.\n  I also want to point out that the construction of the issue, again, \nlies not on whether it is separate enrollment, not whether some new \nentitlement programs are covered and which ones, not whether targeted \ntax benefits is covered or not; it will boil down to one single issue, \nhave no doubt about it, and that is whether we would have a two-thirds \nvote on the part of both bodies in order to override the President's \nveto--that is what 43 Governors have and that is what the \nconstitutional meaning of veto is--or whether we will have a majority \nvote of one House, sufficient to override the President's veto, which \nwill then make the very meaning and intent of trying to impose some \nkind of fiscal discipline on the entire U.S. Government a sham and a \ncharade.\n  I know that my partner, the Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats], feels \nas I do, that we would be willing to negotiate any other aspect of this \nlegislation, because there is no legislation which cannot be improved. \nBut there is one nonnegotiable issue. It is nonnegotiable with the \nother body, which voted overwhelmingly in favor of this legislation and \nagainst a watered-down version of it, and that is the two-thirds \nversion.\n  For the record, by a vote of 294 to 134, with 70 members of the \nDemocratic Party voting ``yes,'' this version of the bill was passed, \nwith a two-thirds majority required. There was a Stenholm expedited \nrescission substitute that was defeated by 266 to 156.\n  I believe that is the will of the American people. They are fed up. \nThey are tired of pork, tired of wasteful and outrageous expenditures \nof their tax dollars. I believe that this issue is a defining issue if \nwe are ever going to achieve that goal.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be equally divided on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are here before the U.S. Senate and the \nAmerican public today to talk about a line-item veto. Mr. President, we \nhave talked recently about a lot of issues that some people believe are \ngimmicks. We know, for example, that we, the Congress of the United \nStates, have the power to more evenly match the money that we receive, \nthe money that we spend, in effect, to do a better job of balancing the \nbudget.\n  Another one of the gimmicks that is floating around is term limits. \nThat is to arbitrarily have a cutoff date as to how many years a person \ncan serve in the House or the Senate. Mr. President, we know that the \nmost important and effective term limit is the ballot box.\n  On November 8, we had a remarkable term limit go into effect. I was \nspeaking to one of my friends in the House of Representatives just the \nother day. This man is beginning his third term, and out of 435 Members \nof Congress, I think he is number 180. He is way below half. I have \nserved 8 years in the Senate. I am 56th, I believe, in seniority. So I \nam almost in the top half, having been here only 8 years. There is a \nhue and cry to do things with what we call quick fixes; to do things \nthat sound good, to divert attention from our solving problems in the \nway that our Founding Fathers established in the Constitution as to how \nthey should be handled.\n  Let us talk, Mr. President, about the line-item veto. The Articles of \nConfederation, which was an original document for a very short period \nof time that directed this country, had a form of line-item veto in it. \nThe man who drew up the Constitution of the United States determined \nthat was something that was not good and should not be in the \nConstitution.\n  The effort to have a line-item veto is not something that was first \ndevised by President Reagan, who was the first to bring it up in recent \nmemory. No, that is not the case. The fact is, the line-item veto comes \nup about every 20 years and has since this country was formed.\n  Why has it not passed up to this point? It has not passed because it \nis a bad idea. It is a bad idea, especially bad for States that are \nsparsely populated.\n  Mr. President, if, in fact, the President wanted to line-item veto \nsomething, it would make good sense, and I am sure his advisers would \nindicate, that the President likely should not go after the State of \nCalifornia, the States of New York, Texas, or Florida, but rather \nshould go after South Dakota, Wyoming, Nevada, Idaho, States with small \ncongressional delegations who do not have the ability to fight back \nwith strength, with numbers.\n  The line-item veto is not opposed by liberals. The line-item veto, \nMr. President, is opposed by some of the most outstanding conservatives \nin the country. For example, James Kilpatrick, who is certainly a bona \nfide conservative, has written on numerous occasions about the line-\nitem veto, and has said, among other things:\n\n       There is, indeed, something ridiculous, perhaps \n     hypocritical is a better word, in the current fit of hand-\n     wringing over the deficit. All the old demands for a quick \n     fix are surfacing once more. The line-item veto, in its pure \n     or impossible form, would not work at the Federal level. At \n     least it would not work as effectively as its advocates \n     suppose. There are no line items for Social Security \n     benefits, food stamps, crop subsidies, interest on the \n     national debt, and other untouchable programs.\n\n  Mr. President, we not only have James Kilpatrick, but two qualified \nconservatives who wrote an article together--they have written many \narticles, but I am going to refer to one-- Bruce Fein and William \nBradford Reynolds. Bruce Fein is certainly, by all accounts, one of the \nleading constitutional scholars in America today. People may not agree \nwith his results all the time, but liberals, moderates, and \nconservatives agree that he is a fine constitutional scholar. And \nWilliam Bradford Reynolds, of course, is a partner in a large D.C. law \nfirm and he worked for President Reagan as an assistant attorney \ngeneral. He was the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights during \nthe Reagan administration.\n  What these two men have said is, ``The short answer is that the line-\nitem veto is unconstitutional.'' These gentleman go on at some length, \nMr. President, to point out the historical arguments behind the line-\nitem veto. And if you read anything about the line-item veto, you \nrealize that the Founding Fathers consciously kept out of the \nConstitution any ability of the President to interfere with the ability \nof the Congress, especially the House of Representatives, to do \nanything with the purse.\n  The historical argument is concluded by another professor that they \ntalk about, largely by negative inference, that the veto authority in \nthese settings did not entirely foreclose the exercise of the line-item \nveto. They debunked that. They say that certainly is not the case.\n  Then, Mr. President, they go on to outline why the Founding Fathers \ndid not want anything to do with the line-item veto. And it goes back \nto the battles that were held in England over the centuries dealing \nwith the power of the King and the power of the Parliament. As you \nknow, during those battles, wars were fought. And what the Founding \nFathers did not want to have happen is that, after the Congress set a \nstandard as to spending, as to money, they did not want the President \nto be able to go in and willy-nilly nitpick those moneys.\n  In fact, when the Colonies were here, the Founding Fathers knew what \nKing George and other kings had done to the Colonies. The King of \nEngland had the power, after the Colonies passed a law, to repeal it. \nThe Founding Fathers wanted no part of that.\n  So, the Founding Fathers reacted, according to Reynolds and Bruce \nFein, reacted strongly to make sure that \n [[Page S4159]] there was nothing to allow the President to overrule \nthe actions of the Congress.\n  And after the constitutional fathers met and deliberated for long \nperiods of time, what emerged was a veto power. They were very \nrestrictive in what power the President of the United States should \nhave.\n  Mr. President, that was based, I repeat, on centuries of dealing with \nParliament and the King and decade after decade of dealing with the \nColonies and the King of England. And what emerged is set forth in \narticle I, section 7, clause 2 of the Constitution.\n  A look at the genesis of this, Mr. President, is that during the \ncourse of the debates in the Constitutional Convention, it clearly \nshows and, in fact, disabuses any notion that it was intended as a \nline-item veto authority to the President's power under clause 2. The \nveto power in explicit terms applied to ``any enrolled bill,'' and the \nPresident's constitutional authority was solely to approve it or not. \nThe Constitution does not suggest that the President may approve part \nof a bill or indicate any Presidential prerogative to alter or revise \nthe bill presented.\n  In fact, to put it another way, the Congress acts as the author of \nthe legislation, the bill, and the President as the publisher. Absent, \nas indicated by Fein and Reynolds, an extraordinary consensus in \nCongress, the President retains the ultimate authority to decide, in \neffect, whether to publish the law. He does not have to. That is the \nkey.\n  That is what I said when I first came on this floor today. We now \nhave in our constitutional framework the ability of the President to \nveto a bill if he does not like it. We have had Presidents who have \nbeen courageous and have done that.\n  The most successful in exercising the veto, according to Fein and \nReynolds, was Rutherford B. Hayes. He did not like these unrelated \nriders. We do it now. But he did not like it. He wanted legislation to \nbe germane. As an effort to prove his point, he kept vetoing \nappropriations bills, and it paid off. It paid off for him, Mr. \nPresident, because Congress usually is unwilling to take the heat of \nbeing responsible for having something that is ridiculous in an \nappropriations bill. So Rutherford B. Hayes was extremely good in what \nhe did, in chastening Congress.\n  But also take a more recent example. President Bush. I am a member of \nthe Appropriations Committee. We passed appropriations bills. There was \none where President Bush said, if you put--this is very controversial. \nWhether you are pro-life pro-choice, it is very controversial.\n  Whether we agree or disagree with President Bush, he said, ``You put \nabortion language in that appropriations bill, and I will veto it.'' He \ndared Congress to do that. Congress did it. He accepted their dare, and \nhe vetoed. It was late in the session. People said he would never do \nthat. Well, he did it.\n  Who prevailed? The President of the United States prevailed. That was \ntaken out by the Congress and sent to him in a form he wanted. The \nPresident today has the right to veto appropriations bills. We have 13 \nappropriations bills. If there is something in them that he does not \nlike, he can veto the whole bill.\n  I believe if there is as much bad in those appropriations bills, that \nis what he should do and not violate the Constitution. I believe that, \nas with President Bush, such a response, according to Fein and \nReynolds, is far more likely to produce the desired legislation \nstripped of objectionable riders than would be the unconstitutional and \nwholly irresponsible exercise of a line-item veto, which would most \ncertainly not be upheld in a court.\n  So we have talked about conservatives. Certainly Kilpatrick is a \nconservative. Certainly Fein is a conservative. Certainly Reynolds is a \nconservative. I do not think anyone would dispute that George Will is a \nconservative.\n  George Will, Mr. President, is also opposed to the line-item veto. He \nhas written about it on a number of occasions, but most recently \nFebruary of this year. George Will, as we all know, has a great way of \nputting things on paper. Certainly, his ability to put things on paper \nto him is much better than his spoken word.\n  This article he wrote is outstanding because what he indicates is \nthat the State of North Carolina refused to ratify the Constitution \nuntil we had the Bill of Rights. Their State constitution has never \ngiven the Governor any veto power. He goes on to say that we should \nfollow that example. They should carry the threshold question--the \nCongress--of whether the line-item veto merely serves conservative \nvalues. He goes on to say that it does not. I am not going to belabor \nthe point, Mr. President, other than to say that I think it is clear \nthat conservative scholars, conservative pundits, conservative writers, \nbelieve the line-item veto--I should not say all of them, but a \nsignificant number, and certainly the respected scholars I have \nmentioned. I could have gotten more of the writers that I have \nmentioned. I could have gotten more, but I think certainly it is \nenough.\n  Will ends by saying the intended consequence of a line-item veto is \nto deter spending, but lacks a national rationale. However, the \nunintended consequence might be to make Congress even more \nconscienceless than it is about voting such spending. Indeed, the line-\nitem veto might result in increased spending if Presidents agreed not \nto exercise it on legislative projects in exchange for legislative \nsupport on other matters. The Nation should not be overeager to do what \nliberty-loving North Carolina has been so reluctant to do.\n  My point as far as this phase of my presentation, Mr. President, is \nthat the line-item veto is not being opposed by a bunch of Northeastern \nliberals, as is referred to so often by some of my friends in Nevada, \nbut rather some of the more thoughtful opposition to the line-item veto \ncomes from conservatives throughout this country, not the least of \nwhich are George Will, James Kilpatrick, Bruce Fein, and William \nBradford Reynolds.\n  It is not just opposition from the conservatives. There are many \nothers who oppose the line-item veto. For example, Mr. President, there \nis an excellent column that was written, again in February of this \nyear, by Cokie and Stephen Roberts in the Baltimore Sun. I think it \ndoes a good job of talking about why the line-item veto is an \nineffective way to achieve what we need to achieve, and that is to do a \nbetter job of matching our income with our outgo.\n  It is pretty clear that, according to Roberts, the Founders left no \ndoubt that Congress, particularly the House of Representatives, elected \nevery 2 years, should control the purse. I do not think there are many \nwho would dispute that. They go on to say:\n\n       We think it is pretty clear that the line-item veto would \n     shift power down Pennsylvania Avenue from Capitol Hill to the \n     White House. That is why Executives--Presidents and Governors \n     of both parties like it. Taking some of the purse string out \n     of the body closest to the people might not be so bad if it \n     resulted in a real ratio of red ink. It won't. A swipe at a \n     highway here, a dam here, even a space station or super \n     collider won't make a significant dent in the deficit.\n\n  That is debatable.\n  They go on to say that a President could line-item the entire space \noperation, the entire highway program, all agriculture subsidies, all \neducation subsidies, eliminate every item in what is called the \ndiscretionary budget, including the entire U.S. Congress and its staff, \nall the Federal courts and prisons, wipe out everything the Government \npays for except defense, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and \ninterest on the national deficit, and there would still be a budget \ndeficit.\n  But, Mr. President, in the legislation that is before the Congress, \nor certainly will be--the amendment that I have seen I understood will \nbe offered--the President will be unable to line-item anything in these \nfour or five big programs. This is why, representing a small State, I \nam opposed to the line-item veto.\n  They go on to say: And think of the political mischief. The President \nwants to punish a State that did not support him in the last election. \nEasy. Just line out programs of benefit to Kansas, for example. A \nPresident, eager to please his friends and punish his enemies, could \nhappily lose the veto and never lose anything.\n  As it stands now, Presidents often swallow something they do not like \nin order to get something else they like in legislation, and that means \nthey have \n [[Page S4160]] to share power, that they cannot control spending \nsinglehandedly. That is just fine with us, and I submit, Mr. President, \nthat is just fine with the Founding Fathers, because that is what they \nintended.\n  Carrying forward with my point that the opposition to the line-item \nveto does not come from the conservatives or the moderates, but also \nfrom the liberals, the Las Vegas Review Journal, a paper in Las Vegas, \nhad an article which ran over the weekend by Joe Sobran--who writes a \ncolumn from Washington, DC--and he says, among other things:\n\n       The drive to amend the Constitution is really a way of \n     passing the buck. Like a man who blames his wife for his own \n     infidelity, the Republicans are saying in effect that the \n     fault for their own inability lies in the Constitution.\n\n  That is not the way it is, Mr. President. I believe that the line-\nitem veto, as it is presented here, is a ploy, a dodge, a gimmick. And \nI believe the case is extremely overstated. We know that 46 percent of \nevery dollar we spend is entitlements. We know that about 14 or 15 \npercent of what we spend is interest on the debt. That is 60 percent. \nWe know that 20 percent, approximately, is for defense. And usually \nthose defense numbers come to Congress from the President--not usually, \nthey do come to Congress from the President--so the President is not \nlikely to hack away at his own budget that he has presented. Twenty \npercent of the budget is domestic discretionary spending.\n  My fellow Senators should understand, as should the American public, \nthat the amount of discretionary domestic spending has dropped \nsignificantly and it is dropping every time we appropriate moneys. What \nis discretionary domestic spending? It deals with the National \nInstitutes of Health. It deals with construction of highways, bridges, \nand dams. It deals with our parks--Lake Mead recreation area, \nYellowstone, and Yosemite. It deals with education. That is what \ndiscretionary domestic spending is. The only area the President can \nline-item veto is discretionary domestic spending.\n  Now, what we have before us is a moving target. We at first were told \nwe will go with S. 4. Then we were told we are going to go with the \nMcCain balanced budget procedure. Then we were told a compromise had \nbeen worked out with Senators Exon and Domenici. When there was general \nacceptance of that proposal on this side of the aisle, it was \ndetermined--because we supported it--it must not be good and, \ntherefore, it went back to the drawing board. I think we do not want to \nsolve these problems as much as talk about them.\n  I think the legislation suggested by Senators Domenici and Exon, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee and the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee--two men who have had a great deal of experience dealing with \nmoney matters relating to this Government--I think it was a good \ncompromise. It did not give away constitutional prerogatives to 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue. It was a good compromise, something I could \nsupport.\n  But now we have something different. Now we have a process where, \nwhen an appropriations bill passes, it would be broken up into hundreds \nof line items. This is absolutely unconstitutional. It just will not \nsail. We know that.\n  There have been a number of different things written on this. For \nexample, I see the Presiding Officer here, the senior Senator from the \nState of Iowa. The Iowa Law Review says:\n\n       Arguably, the bicameral process is violated if the \n     enrolling clerk presents proposed legislation to the \n     President in a form not approved of by the House and the \n     Senate. The presentment clauses, therefore, may require that \n     a bill is presented to the President, for approval or veto, \n     be in the form in which the bill passed through both Houses. \n     Otherwise, such a bill is unconstitutional.\n\n  So, in effect, if we pass a bill and we sent it to the enrollment \nclerk and the enrollment clerk breaks this up into different sections, \nit is unconstitutional. We cannot send something to the President and \nhave somebody else chop it up for us. If we want 400 separate \nappropriations bills, then we have to present them to the President. We \ncannot have an enrolling clerk do that. It is clearly unconstitutional, \nand many scholars have written about this, but the most recent, I \nthink, and one of the most erudite is that from the Iowa Law Review.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Put differently, Congress cannot delegate to an enrolling \n     officer in either House the legislative function of deciding \n     how many appropriations bills shall be presented to the \n     President, or the form those bills shall take.\n\n  The only thing that can go to the President is what we pass in the \nform that we pass it. Otherwise, you can imagine the mischief that \ncould take place.\n  So now this moving target has a bill that is going to break up the 13 \nappropriations bills into thousands of different bills--not hundreds, \nbut thousands of different bills. I think that that is certainly unwise \nand something that we should not do.\n  Reading from a Harvard Law Review article:\n\n       Item veto advocates may be overstating their case * * * \n     much of the budget is uncontrollable.\n\n  About 60 to 80 percent--if we include defense, it is 80 percent. If \nwe do not include defense, it is 60 percent.\n\n       * * * of the budget is ``nondiscretionary,'' and, as such, \n     is not even addressed by the appropriations process. Of the \n     remaining 40 percent that is considered discretionary \n     spending, nearly half is appropriated for defense \n     expenditures.\n\n  As I outlined earlier.\n\n       The congressional ``pork barrel'' spending so commonly \n     criticized thus only constitutes approximately 20 percent of \n     the budget. Yet, it would be difficult to cut a substantial \n     portion of this spending because much of this money funds \n     worthwhile projects, such as highway repair or cancer \n     research. These figures demonstrate that even a President \n     armed with the line-item veto could hardly spare the country \n     from outrageous debt overnight * * * A determined President \n     using the line-item veto might be able to cut * * * 1 percent \n     * * * of the total annual budget.\n\n  And that is a worthwhile goal, if it does not violate the \nconstitutional prerogatives established by our Founding Fathers.\n  Mr. President, we had published last week ``The Senate of the Roman \nRepublic.'' You will recall over the last Congress, the senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia gave a number of speeches dealing with the line-item \nveto and the loss of power of the Roman Empire indicating that when you \ngive away power that the legislative branch has to the Executive, as \nthey ultimately did with the great Caesar, it destroys a country. And \nthat is what he wrote about. His opening statement, I think, is worth \nreading, paragraph 2:\n\n       In search of antidotes for this fast-spreading fiscal \n     melanoma of suffocating deficits and debts, the budget \n     medicine men have once again begun their annual pilgrimage to \n     the shrine of Saint Line-Item Veto, to worship at the altar \n     of fool's gold, quake remedies--such as enhanced rescission, \n     line-item veto, and other graven images--which, if adopted, \n     would give rise to unwarranted expectations and possibly \n     raise serious constitutional questions involving separation \n     of powers, checks and balances, and control of the national \n     purse * * *.\n       On the other hand, Mr. President, some of these people \n     inside Congress, and outside Congress, who constantly press \n     for the line-item veto, enhanced rescissions or other quack \n     nostrums know, or ought to know, that these are nothing more \n     than placebos, spurious magic incantations, witch's brew, and \n     various brands of snake oil remedies.\n\n  Skipping a paragraph or two:\n\n       Mr. President, the deficit problem is not caused by \n     congressional appropriations. Since 1945, and through last \n     year, beginning with Truman, and following with Eisenhower, \n     Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan and Bush, the \n     total appropriations--supplementals, regular, and \n     deficiencies--have amounted to about $200,848,154,902 less \n     than the totality of all the budget requests that these nine \n     Presidents have submitted during all those years.\n\n  So, in short, Mr. President, the Congress has the terrible reputation \nof being spendthrifts, spending all this money we do not have. Every \nyear we have come in with less money through Democratic Presidents and \nRepublican Presidents than they have submitted to us. I think that says \na lot.\n  Just like the battle that took place with the balanced budget \namendment, that was an effort to balance the budget using Social \nSecurity moneys. We need not change the Constitution to balance the \nbudget. We have the authority to do that. The President today has the \nauthority to veto appropriations bills. If there is spending that is \nout of line in those bills, he has the right and, I believe, the \nobligation if it is something that is not in the best interest of the \npeople of this country to veto it. If it is something that is as \n [[Page S4161]] outrageous as some people would lead us to believe, his \nveto will be upheld and we would send him back an appropriations bill \nthat did not have that information in it, did not have that request in \nit.\n  For example, there was a lot of public outcry because in an \nagriculture appropriations bill there was a provision in it a few years \nago that appropriated $500,000 to the State of North Dakota to \ncommemorate, to redo--I do not know what they were going to do with the \nmoney--the home of Lawrence Welk. The American people thought it was \noutrageous. The President had the right if he wanted to veto that \nagriculture appropriations bill.\n  Had that bill come back here, that would have been taken out in a \nsplit second. The fact of the matter is, it was taken out in the next \nyear in a rescission and the money was never spent, as outrageous as it \nwas. But the President has the power today to veto outrageous \nexpenditures in appropriations bills. We do not need to pass a new law \nto change the balance of power, to mess with the Constitution, to have \nthe President veto bills. We have 13 appropriations bills.\n  If every one of them has pork or something he does not like, he can \nvote to veto either one of them and go to the American public and say \nthe reason I did that was because there was an appropriation here for \nLawrence Welk's home in North Dakota, or whatever else is outlandish in \nthat appropriations bill, and 99 times out of 100, his veto would be \nupheld.\n  Now, for us to say, well, he is not going to do it because it is a \nbig appropriations bill and it would just cause friction between the \ntwo branches, I would rather have a little more friction between the \ntwo branches than to give up our power to the executive branch.\n  Remember, our Founding Fathers, in setting up the separate but equal \nbranches of Government--the legislative, executive, and judicial--set \nthem up so there would be friction between the branches; we would have \nto fight for power. That is what they wanted. They wanted us to fight \nfor prerogative, with the legislative, executive, and judicial branches \nof Government. We do not need a new bill passed. We do not need to \namend the Constitution for a line-item veto. The President can veto any \none of the appropriations bills, if he wants, or all 13 of them. Had we \nhad a little more courage in the past by Presidents, there would be a \nlot less bad stuff in those bills. I again use the example of President \nBush. You may not agree with what he did, but on the abortion issue he \nsaid, ``You put that in there, I am going to veto it.'' He vetoed it, \nand he won. The Executive usually always wins because it is hard to \noverride a Presidential veto.\n  Some have described the line-item veto as a panacea for congressional \nmisspending. We know that is not the case. Others have described it as \nresulting from a profound shift in the balance of powers as we know it.\n  I say the Senate had an opportunity--I hope we still do--to take up \nand consider a line-item veto that would allow us to impose greater \nchecks on our spending process without upsetting the balance of power \nbetween the executive and legislative branches of Government. That is \nwhy I like the Domenici-Exon approach. It did not hack away from the \npower of the executive branch but yet it gave the President more \nability than he now has to look at matters that are wrong in our \nspending. I think that is what we should have done. I hope we can still \ndo it. And while we are talking about having this line-item veto, I \nhope, Mr. President, that we do not lose sight of the fact we should \ntake a look at taxes.\n  We have heard described lots of times, with the 13 appropriations \nbills, the bad parts of those appropriations bills, and the people who \ncomplain have something to complain about. There were things in those \nappropriations bills such that I believe the President should have \nvetoed the whole bill. If he did that more often, we would have better \nappropriations bills.\n  However, the one thing we have not talked about is what about the \nbills that come from the Finance Committee? What about these bills that \nhave little tax shelters, tax dodges, and tax gimmicks for \ncorporations? We have bills that are reported out of the Finance \nCommittee where they take care of one corporation, they take care of \none individual, one sector of our economy at the expense of another. If \nwe are going to start having all of these line-item vetoes, I believe \nwe should have a line-item veto for tax bills.\n  A bill comes out of the Finance Committee every year, a big bill, and \nin it usually are mischievous things, in this Senator's opinion, that \nare put in by members of the Finance Committee, put in because of \npressure by special-interest groups, pressure by lobbyists, pressure \nfrom people at home, industries at home that are at the sacrifice of \nother parts of our economy. I think we should be able to line item \nthat. I support that.\n  Take the Domenici-Exon approach and put in there the additional \nability that the President would have to take out various items of that \ntax bill. I think that would be good.\n  I hope we are still going to have the opportunity to consider such \nlegislation. The minority leader has indicated he is going to prepare a \nsubstitute. I am told and I believe it will be comparable to the \nDomenici-Exon approach except it will have in it more ability of the \nPresident to look at line items in bills that come from the Finance \nCommittee. I hope that is the case.\n  It is my understanding that we have moved away from consideration of \neither of the line-item bills that were reported out of committee. \nTherefore, I hope the minority leader will move forward with an \nenhanced version of the Exon and Domenici legislation.\n  What we are going to take up, in my opinion, is an enormous \nbureaucratic nightmare as indicated by the Iowa Law Review article and \nother things that I have now in the Record. It would certainly be \nunconstitutional, in addition to being unworkable. The so-called line-\nitem veto bill supported by some now I believe ought to be called the \nPaperwork Enhancement Act. This is directly 2 weeks following our \npassage of the Paperwork Reduction Act. Now we will just turn right \naround and increase paperwork because that is what this would do.\n  It is most disappointing that we are passing up an opportunity today \nof acting on a bill that would assure widespread support on both sides \nof the aisle. The Domenici version of the legislation we could have \npassed last Friday. We would be out of here. But some people do not \nwant results. They want issues to talk about, gimmicks. I think that is \ntoo bad.\n  As I have indicated, the most popular of the two earlier measures was \nthe legislation put together by two qualified deficit hawks, Domenici \nand Exon. Domenici and Exon have earned the reputation, as I said, of \nbeing two of the most outspoken, toughest deficit hawks in the Senate. \nThe measure that they have drafted and reported out of committee made \ngreat strides toward eliminating some of the less than meritorious \ngains. It provided a procedure that would have allowed us to eliminate \nwasteful spending without undermining the constitutional duties imposed \non the legislative and executive branches of Government.\n  It was a commonsense proposal that would have eliminated spurious tax \nspending of taxpayers' dollars. In effect, what it did, within 10 days \nof the enactment of the appropriations bill or revenue bill, the \nPresident could propose a reduction or repeal of new appropriations, \nand as I have indicated, I hope that will be built upon. With the \nDaschle proposal, the President could also repeal targeted tax \nbenefits.\n  Under the Domenici-Exon legislation, the rescission bill, which is \nlimited to the President's proposal, would be introduced in Congress. \nWithin 10 days, Congress would have to vote on that bill. The floor \nrules are very simple. No amendments are allowed in the President's \nrescission bill. Motions to strike would be allowed. If Congress passes \nthe bill and the President signs it into law, you would in effect have \na lockbox, providing any savings, any of these savings would be devoted \nto the deficit by lowering the discretionary caps on spending.\n  The significance of this measure is that it provides for greater \nrescission authority without placing unbridled authority on the \nPresident, which the Founding Fathers and others have guarded against \nsince the days of the Constitution.\n   [[Page S4162]] The New York Times, in a recent editorial, made the \ncase as to why we ought to consider the Domenici legislation. Its \neditorial about a week ago said:\n\n       One version of the McCain-Coats legislation would \n     dangerously increase the President's already formidable \n     power. The other, sponsored by Senator Pete Domenici, would \n     give the President more power than he has now, \n     counterbalanced by reasonable congressional checks. The \n     Senate should go on with Mr. Domenici.\n\n  Unfortunately, we are not doing that. Unfortunately, the matter we \nare dealing with will shatter the separation of powers doctrine, so \ncarefully crafted by our Founding Fathers and so tightly guarded these \npast 200-plus years. Even if we were to accept this as a necessity to \nachieve the greater good, the line-item veto is rendered almost \nmeaningless by the economic reality of our current budget.\n  As I have indicated before, we need to get spending under control. \nMr. President, 46 percent of every dollar we spend is for entitlements; \n14 to 15 percent is for interest on debt, that is 60 percent; another \n20 percent is for defense.\n  The threshold question in consideration of any line-item veto is the \nextent the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers will be \ndisturbed. We know the Founding Fathers went to a great deal of effort \nto make sure that was set forth very clearly in article I of the U.S. \nConstitution. I believe we all want the President to have more \nauthority to get rid of matters that should not be in appropriations \nbills. Most of us agree that he, the President, should have the \nauthority of a line-item veto for taxing matters also that are harmful \nto the country, but we need to do that within the confines of the \nConstitution. The legislation that either has or will be offered \nsetting forth the enrollment procedures will not do that.\n  We should always realize the fallback position that we have is one \nthat is in the Constitution and that is the President now has the \nauthority to veto matters dealing with appropriations that are bad for \nthe country. He cannot veto a little piece of the bill, he has to veto \nthe whole bill. Why should he not be able to do that? Why should he not \ndo that? It has been done in the past, and I use the example of \nPresident Rutherford B. Hayes. It was difficult. It caused the country \nsome concern. But he prevailed.\n  So I respectfully submit that no matter how well-intentioned those \nare who are seeking to pass this legislation, recognizing the sincerity \nof the chief sponsor of the bill, the senior Senator from Arizona, and \nhow diligently he has worked on spending matters during the time he has \nbeen in the House and Senate, I again respectfully submit this is the \nwrong way to go. I believe we should adopt the Domenici approach and do \nwhat we can to make sure this well-intentioned legislation, offered by \nmy friend from Arizona, is defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I note with interest that the Senator from \nNevada, who voted against the balanced budget amendment, now opposes a \nmeaningful line-item veto, so I was interested in hearing him talk \nabout how spending is out of control. I would be interested in hearing \nany of his proposals for bringing spending under control.\n  I also remind him, if he could not find anything that the Founding \nFathers said concerning expenditures and revenues, I would refer him to \na letter from Thomas Jefferson to John Tyler, November 26, 1798. Thomas \nJefferson said:\n\n       I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our \n     Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for \n     the reduction of the administration of our Government to the \n     genuine principles of its Constitution. I mean an article \n     taking from the Federal Government the power of borrowing.\n\n  That was Thomas Jefferson's view.\n  I say to my friend from Nevada--he is my friend--in all due respect, \nif he thinks the status quo is acceptable to the people of Arizona or \nNevada or anybody else in this country, I think he is wrong. If he \nthinks one single majority vote in either House is really the meaning \nof veto, then I do not believe he is in consonance with the 43 States \nin this country out of 50 where it takes a two-thirds majority.\n  The meaning of the word ``veto'' is clearly defined in the \nConstitution as requiring a two-thirds majority. But I say to my friend \nfrom Nevada, in all due respect, where is it that the Senator from \nNevada wants to turn to get some fiscal discipline in this country? I \nwould like to hear his proposal. I reject his proposal that it would be \na single majority vote in either House, since it took a majority vote \nin two Houses to put the pork in. The only way you are going to get it \nout is through a two-thirds vote of both Houses, in my view; the threat \nof that.\n  As far as his argument goes that the President of the United States \nshould veto 1 of the 13 major appropriations bills, the Senator from \nNevada and I were both in the other body when we were doing continuing \nresolutions, when everything was thrown into one appropriations bill--\nevery single one was thrown into one massive appropriations bill. Did \nthe Senator from Nevada expect him to veto that? Of the 13 \nappropriations bills the Senator from Nevada knows there are billions \nof dollars in each one and if the President vetoes an entire bill he \nshuts down the Government; he deprives the people of this country of \nvitally needed programs. There is not a single appropriations bill that \ncomes to the President's desk that has billions of dollars in spending \nin it that, if the President vetoes it, will not deprive the people of \nthis country of much-needed Government services.\n  The only way the President of the United States can effectively do \nwhat 43 Governors in this country do is selectively veto appropriations \nthat are not needed and are unwanted and are wasteful.\n  At this point of the debate I am not going to tell the Senator from \nNevada about the outrageous spending going on in this country because I \nwill refrain from doing so for some time, but it is well known to the \nAmerican people. If the Senator from Nevada believes that is \nacceptable, that is fine with me. But when 83 percent of the American \npeople support a line-item veto, when the overwhelming majority of the \nAmerican people are sick and tired--sick and tired--of running a $4.6 \ntrillion debt, then it is time to act. If there is any living proof \nthat the Congress is unable to discipline itself it is the fact that we \ndo have a $4.6 trillion debt. In 1974 that debt was in hundreds of \nbillions; now it is in trillions with no end in sight.\n  If we do not do something--the Senator from Nevada rejects the \nbalanced budget amendment. ``That is not constitutional.'' He rejects \nmy line-item veto. ``That is not constitutional.'' I ask my friend from \nNevada, what does he want to do? What is it that needs to be done to \nbring this undisciplined, outrageous fiscal behavior under control? I \nwould be very interested in hearing that.\n  I know of no expert who believes that a single majority vote by one \nHouse is going to do the job.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I believe there are a number of things we \nneed to do. The first thing we need to do is approach the problems head \non. As I indicated during the debate on the balanced budget amendment, \nwhy do we not balance the budget the hard way, the honest way, and that \nis do it without using the surplus for Social Security? As has been \nindicated and was indicated in here last week by one of the Senators \nfrom North Dakota, the fact of the matter is you cannot use the surplus \nto retire the debt and also use it for Social Security. It can only be \nused for one. It cannot be used for both places because you cannot \nspend money twice, and that is what we try to do around here.\n  I believe we should have a balanced budget, but we should do it the \nhard way.\n  My friend from Arizona said, ``What needs to be done?'' There are a \nlot of things that need to be done. First of all, with the line-item \nveto, I believe--and this has not been responded to, of course--as I \nread from the articles, with a line-item veto we may be able to save 1 \npercent of the money--1 percent. Mr. President, 99 percent we could \nnot, 1 percent we could. When you have a budget of $1.5 trillion that \nis a worthy \n [[Page S4163]] goal. There is no reason you should not try to save 1 \npercent.\n  But I think we should do that with a procedure that allows the \nCongress not to give its power to the executive branch of Government. \nAnd I do not think the American public is concerned about two-thirds or \na simple majority, but rather that we do it. I am willing to support a \nveto that the President has, as long as it does not give up our \nconstitutional prerogative.\n  I also think that one of the things that needs to be done is deal \nwith the high cost of health care. We have done nothing about that \nproblem. We have done nothing. I recognize--certainly accept--that the \nlegislation that was attempted last year was too broad, we tried to do \ntoo much. We should have narrowed our scope and hopefully brought down \nto Earth some of the health costs that were going up every year. This \nyear, health care costs will go up over $100 billion. The No. 1 item \nthat is driving State, local, and Federal deficits is health care \ncosts. It is really hurting us. We have to do something to get that \nunder control. I do not see anything on the agenda this year to do \nanything about that.\n  What else needs to be done? I am watching very closely what is going \non in the House this week. They are going to come up with welfare \nreform. I think that is important. We need to do something on welfare \nreform. I believe we can save huge amounts of money with meaningful \nwelfare reform.\n  One of the areas we need to look at is immigration reform. We can \nsave lots of money.\n  The costs to the States of California, Nevada, even though we are not \na border State, suffer significantly because of the illegal \nimmigration, and Arizona and New Mexico. There are lots of places we \ncan go to save huge amounts of money. We have to make those tough, hard \ndecisions.\n  My friend from Arizona said, ``What do you want? A continuing \nresolution?'' I do not want a continuing resolution. We have in recent \nyears passed 13 separate appropriations bills. The President should \nveto those, and, if we send him a CR, a continuing resolution, which he \ndoes not like, veto that too. Because, if he is doing it based upon the \nfact that Lawrence Welk's home is in there or some kind of other \nappropriation that cries out for some type of relief, that we are going \nto accede to the President's wishes.\n  I say to my friend from Arizona, outrageous spending is not \nacceptable. Outrageous spending is not acceptable. We are spending too \nmuch money based upon our income, and we have to stop that. In addition \nto that, we are spending money in areas that we should not be spending \nmoney on. I am willing to work on those. I hope this year. We are \nawaiting the Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee to come forward with a budget that is going to be a glidepath \nthat will get us to a balanced budget in the year 2002 or some period \nthereafter. I look forward to working with my friends from the other \nside of the aisle to see that we can do that. But let us not do it with \ngimmicks, with things that sound good but really are not going to allow \nus to accomplish anything.\n  I am for a balanced budget amendment. But I want to exclude Social \nSecurity. I am for a line-item veto. But I do not want to accede \nauthority to the President of the United States. Presidents can be \nextremely mischievous, especially with a small State, having the \nability to say OK, Senator Reid, I see that you have here something in \nNevada that is very important in Nevada--maybe a new highway, maybe a \nnew bridge, maybe a dam that is important to the people of the State of \nNevada. He could say, ``If you vote with me on this item, I am not \ngoing to line-item veto that.'' Well, I would hope that I would be able \nto do the right thing in that instance. I hope I could. I hope the \nright thing would be to do what was the best for the people of the \nState of Nevada.\n  But let us not give the President that authority. He has not had it \nin over 200 years. He does not need it now. Veto is in the \nConstitution. It requires a two-thirds vote. That is why the President \nshould use that veto if he thinks there is outrageous spending in any \none of these 13 bills.\n  I would also be interested to hear during the debate today from those \non other side of the aisle to see if they are willing to put tax \nmeasures also in this form of rescission that we are giving to the \nPresident.\n  So I would hope that we could accomplish something through reasonable \nmen and women working together to recognize that there are provisions \nin the appropriations bills that are bad, that are wrong, and that the \nPresident should have the ability to send back to us something to take \nout more than he now has without giving up our constitutional authority \nto a President. I do not know who the President is going to be the next \ntime or the next time. But I want to leave this body recognizing that I \nkept intact the intent of the Founding Fathers.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as the saying goes, everybody is entitled \nto their opinion, but not everybody is entitled to the facts.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Nevada thinks that it is coincidence, \nthat it is just sheer coincidence, that from 1787 until 1974 the \naccumulated debt and deficit and yearly deficit was very low, except in \ntimes of war when that spiked up and then the Congress and the American \npeople would take action to reduce that debt again.\n  I do not know if the Senator from Nevada can see this chart. But in \n1974, we were running an annual deficit somewhere around $25 to $30 \nbillion. The Budget Impoundment Act was enacted in 1974 which prevented \nthe President of the United States from doing basically what the line-\nitem veto does; that is, the President of the United States, Thomas \nJefferson did it first with a $50,000 impoundment of money to purchase \ngunboats. It has been exercised by every President of the United \nStates. They will not spend the money thereby effectively exercising a \nline-item veto.\n  So basically, what we are talking about, what happened in the history \nof this country up until 1974 is that we exercised fiscal sanity. We \nhad elected men and women to the Congress of the United States and \nelected men to the Presidency of the United States who insisted that we \nnot lay a crushing burden of debt on future generations of Americans.\n  So in 1974, we passed the Budget Inpoundment Act. What happened to \nthe deficit? Did it happen by accident? Did all of a sudden we lose all \nsense of fiscal control? All of sudden, the United States just went on \na spending spree? Yes. Yes. Yes. We did. Why did we do it? Because \nthere was no restraint, either Republican or Democratic Presidents \nalike.\n  It is laudable that we have now reduced the annual deficit some, but \nall estimates are that the debt and the deficit after a couple of more \nyears will go up again and skyrocket. We have now accumulated a $4.6 \ntrillion debt, about $4 trillion more than we had in 1974.\n  So facts are facts. From the first Congress of the United States \nuntil 1974 we basically had a balanced budget. We for all intents and \npurposes did not spend more money than we took in. Thomas Jefferson in \n1789 clearly stated, as I just quoted:\n\n       I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our \n     Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for \n     the reduction of the administration of our Government to the \n     genuine principles of its Constitution. I mean an article \n     taking from the Federal Government the power of borrowing.\n\n  What we did, Mr. President, in 1974 with the passage of the Budget \nImpoundment Act was we gave the Federal Government the power of \nborrowing with no restraint. Now we borrow and borrow and borrow to a \n$4.6 trillion debt.\n  I agree with everything that my friend from Nevada said. We should \nenact health care reform. We should take care of the skyrocketing \nhealth care costs to Americans. We should do a lot of things. But what \nhave we done? Nothing, nothing to reduce the debt that is now $4.6 \ntrillion. Our forefathers must be rolling over in their graves when \nthey see what we have done, when they look at the mountains of Federal \nbudget that is being spent to pay interest on the debt that we have not \nstopped accumulating.\n  So I say to my friend from Nevada, I agree with everything he says. I \nappreciate his advice and counsel as far as what we can do to stop the \nspending. \n [[Page S4164]] But I would suggest to you that every President has \nsaid they need the line-item veto as a tool whether it be as President \nFord or President Carter or President Bush or President Reagan saw it, \nand now as President Clinton sees it.\n  I wonder how the Senator from Nevada reconciles his views with that \nof the President of the United States? The fact is that a veto is a \nveto is a veto, which means two-thirds majority, a majority vote in one \nHouse is less than an overriding veto because it took a majority vote \nin both Houses in order to put the unnecessary wasteful spending in.\n  So, I say to my friend from Nevada. I appreciate his input as far as \nthe macro issues that we have to resolve. I would also suggest to him \nthat the abuses that he describes would so naturally accrue to any \nPresident of the United States threatening Senators or Members of \nCongress who were doing certain actions, line-item projects in their \nState. I could hardly wait for a President of the United States to do \nthat to me.\n I could hardly wait. There are the media, the people of my State. It \nis the last time that a President of the United States or his party \nwould ever carry my State in a Presidential election if he tried to \nblackmail me or any representative of my State. In 43 States of \nAmerica, including a former Governor of Missouri who spoke on Friday--\nand I do not believe the Senator from Nevada was ever Governor--the \nGovernor never threatened to blackmail anybody. He said he could not \nbalance the budget in his State without having the line-item veto, \nwhich he and 42 other Governors have.\n\n  Again, I do not think we can reconcile the facts. There are opinions \nas to what happened and as to what we need to do. But there are facts \nthat indicate that the Federal debt and deficit are out of control and \nalmost every expert in America, including 83 percent of the American \npeople, say, ``Give the President of the United States the line-item \nveto.'' When they say veto, they mean veto, and they do not mean \noverriding by one House of Congress.\n  I say again to my friend from Nevada, with 70 Democrat votes, the \nline-item veto that is being proposed here was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives, and I believe their will is perhaps more in tune with \nAmerican public opinion today than is true over here in this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to vacate the floor shortly. But \nI want to make sure the record is very clear that there is no way I \nthink spending is now under control, even though we have made \nsignificant progress. This is the third year in a row where we have a \ndeclining deficit--the first time in 15 years. Federal payroll is about \n$150 million less; economic growth is the highest since the days of \nPresident Kennedy. Good things are happening, but we have much more to \ndo. What we have to do--and more important than anything else, as \nindicated by the Senator from Arizona--is to do something about the \ndeficit that is already here and the deficits that come about every \nyear. We must do something about that. I served a year on the \nentitlement commission. We have a lot of work to do and we have a lot \nof programs that need to be looked at, because 46 percent of every \ndollar we spend is for entitlement programs.\n  The Impoundment Act, there has been a lot written about that. But it \nwas an effort to go after President Nixon--the so-called imperial \npresidency that people talked about. I think a lot of things done as a \nresult of Watergate were not good Government. It was a reaction to a \nman rather than a form of Government. That is why I am so concerned \nabout what we do here.\n  The record should be very clear. The deficits have accumulated. But \nthe big jump, of course, as indicated on the chart my friend just \nshowed the Senate and the American public, occurred during the Reagan \nyears, when in fact we cut back on our income and increased spending \nconsiderably. We cut back on the revenues, reduced taxes, and increased \ndefense spending and other spending, and as a result of that, trillions \nof dollars in debt accumulated. We have to do a better job of taking \ncare of those problems than we did. The problem with the debt going up \nis not as a result of passing a law to do away with the Impoundment \nAct. It is as a result of simple mathematics. When you spend more than \nyou take in, you accumulate a debt. That is what happened beginning in \nthe Reagan years, and that is what is happening now. We need to get \nthat under control.\n  I am not here to argue that every matter and every appropriations \nbill is good. I think there are things in appropriations bills that \nshould not be in there, that are the result of compromises of committee \nmembers, and as a result of back-room politics, for lack of better \nwords. The President should have an easier way of getting to those \nitems, and I am willing to give him that. If we are unable to arrive at \nthat, I hope President Clinton, and other Presidents that follow him, \nwould be more demanding in what they ask in their appropriations bills. \nI am confident and hopeful that we can arrive at a reasonable \ncompromise in the next few days in this body.\n  It is my understanding that there is going to be no effort to stop \nthis motion from proceeding. We are going to go ahead to the bill. \nThere is no attempt to delay it. But I think it is a question of how to \napproach a problem. I believe that the approach of my friend from \nArizona--as well-intentioned and as desperate as he is to get spending \nunder control--is not the right way to go. I hope he and other sponsors \nof the legislation will step back and look at what we have in the \nDomenici proposal and see if the proposal that is going to be offered \nin the form of a substitute is not something that would better serve \nthis country. We need to get spending under control, and we need to \nwork on some of the things I have talked about and some of the \noutrageous things that the Senator from Arizona has talked about over \nthe years that have taken place in appropriations spending bills.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be deducted equally from both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, over the next few days, I intend to give \na series of speeches on the integrity of the Department of Defense \nbudget.\n  Before I get started, and for the benefit of all new Senators, I want \nto give some background on how I got involved with these defense \nissues.\n  I want to share a small piece of history with my colleagues. I think \nwe can learn from this history and hopefully we can avoid past \nmistakes. But we cannot learn from our mistakes if the history remains \nburied in old issues of the Congressional Record. So I want to share my \nexperiences with, particularly, my new colleagues, because over half of \nthe Members in the Senate today were not Members of this body 10 years \nago when President Reagan's massive military buildup was fiercely \ndebated right here in this Chamber. I think that was a defining \nexperience for me.\n  We made a major decision when we stopped the Reagan defense buildup \nthat, at that point, had been going on for 3 or 4 years. This process \nhelped to shape my thinking, as I said. Even though it took place more \nthan 10 years ago, I think it still is having some ripple effect today. \nIts mark on current defense policy is unmistakable. So it is important \nto understand the dynamics of that debate, at least from my \nperspective.\n  I was convinced--almost from day one--that the Pentagon, through its \nactions, was bent on launching a wasteful budget buildup. I was \nconvinced that we were about to throw huge sums of money at a problem \nbetter solved by structural reform and honest management.\n   [[Page S4165]] Let me say that by the time we finally made a \ndecision to stop the Reagan defense buildup and freeze the defense \nbudget, we had, in fact, wasted a lot of money.\n  So, seeing this, I did--and there were several others that did, as \nwell--what I could to stop this waste of money. I offered an amendment \nto freeze the defense budget. That was on the fiscal year 1986 budget \nresolution. My amendment was adopted on May 2, 1985, by a one-vote \nmargin of 50 to 49. That act alone threw a monkey wrench into the \nReagan administration's plan to continue their ramp-up of the defense \nbudget.\n  But, more than anything else, it was the spare parts horror stories \nin the early 1980's that changed my thinking on this issue. You know, \nthe $750 pair of pliers or the $7,000 coffee pot. The spare parts \nhorror stories were a turning point. They convinced me that the plan \nfor this massive ramp-up of defense expenditures was a colossal \ntaxpayer ripoff. These spare parts horror stories undermined the \ncredibility of the Reagan defense buildup. The spare parts horror \nstories turned me into a defense reformer. They drove me to \nwatchdogging and to digging into fraud, waste, and abuse at the \nPentagon.\n  That was early in my Senate career.\n  I began watchdogging from my vantage point as a member of the Budget \nCommittee and as chairman of the General Oversight Subcommittee of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I am not, nor ever have been, a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, and only served 4 short years on the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  So, as a conservative Republican, it is not easy for me to take on \nthese issues, not being on the appropriate committees. But if common \nsense tells me something is not right, I speak out and I dig. I am \nstill digging today, and I hope a lot of my colleagues are digging as \nwell.\n  As a consequence of my position on defense, I took a lot of heat from \nRepublicans during the 12 years of the Reagan-Bush administrations. \nMost of my colleagues on this side of the aisle think that defense is \nsome kind of sacred cow. They think it has been inoculated and should \nbe immune from criticism. They take a dim view of my position on \ndefense.\n  The Democrats, by comparison, gave me no heat at all. In fact, on \ndefense issues, I got a lot more support from Democrats than I did from \nRepublicans.\n  In the 1980's, Democrats--plus a handful of Republicans like Senator \nRoth, for example--helped me ferret out waste and abuse at the \nPentagon.\n  I had the privilege of working closely with a number of Democrats, \nsome in the House, some in the Senate--Senators like Senator Pryor, \nSenator Levin, Senator Boxer, and others--to bring about some defense \nreform. We worked together to freeze the Department of Defense budget. \nWe worked together to beef up independent testing of a new weapons \nsystem. We crafted the false claims bill, which brought $1 billion of \nfraudulent wasted money back into the Treasury, and we passed the \nwhistleblower protection legislation. And we worked together to cut out \nwasteful spending.\n  That is my point, Mr. President.\n  When we had a Republican President and a Democratic Congress, it was \nvery unpopular for a Republican Senator to take on a Republican \nPresident on defense. But I was not afraid to do it.\n  Then in 1993, as you know, we got a Democratic President with a \nDemocratic Congress. I kept right on doing what I had been doing--\ndigging into fraud, waste, and abuse at the Pentagon--even though some \nof my Democratic allies at that point seemed to disappear into the \nweeds because they did not want to be criticizing a Pentagon run by a \npolitical appointee of their party.\n  Now we have a Republican Congress, Mr. President, but we still have a \nDemocratic President. And it happens that this Democratic President is \nconsidered weak on defense.\n  Once again, it is very unpopular to tangle with the Pentagon. But I \nintend to keep right on doing it as we move into this budget season \nonce again.\n  Because the same old problems persist. So we need to keep right on \ndigging. We need to keep right on watchdogging just like before, \nbecause really, Mr. President, nothing has changed.\n  I only hope that the Members on the other side of the aisle will be \nthere when I and the American people need them. I say that because they \nare the President's party. I hope a few of my Republican allies will \nhelp me bring some fiscal discipline to the Pentagon budget.\n  I hope all the new Members of the Senate who were not here the last \ntime we debated this issue will study it very closely. I hope that the \nnew Republican Members who ran on a campaign of no longer business as \nusual, they ran on a campaign to make a difference, everything I have \nseen from the new Members of this body--who are all Republicans--they \nare showing, every Member, that they have not changed one iota since \nNovember 8, the night of their election.\n  They are equally committed to showing the people of this country it \nis no longer business as usual. They are equally committed to making \nsure that things change. They have made an impact on the other Members \nof this body who are not new, both Republican and Democrat. They are \nkeeping the focus where it ought to be.\n  I am saying, especially to those new Republican Members of this body, \nthat I hope they will take as tough a look at how money is being spent \nin the Defense Department and that they will not buy the argument that \nyou can throw money at the Defense Department and automatically get \nmore defense, any more than I know these new Members will accept the \nargument from the other side of the aisle on social welfare, education, \nand a lot of other domestic programs, that all we have to do somehow is \nspend more money and we automatically get more and better programs.\n  The fact of the matter is, it does not matter whether it is \nRepublicans or Democrats, Republican spending on defense or Democrat \nspending on social programs, we only get for our money what we make \nsure we get for our money. It is not how much money we appropriate. It \nis how that money is spent that we ought to be concerned about. And it \nwill determine whether or not we have a strong national security \nprogram, or whether we have a strong education program, or a strong \nwelfare program.\n  I hope that my allies--and I hope we have some new allies, as well--\nwill fight just as hard with me for a good, sound, defense policy now \nthat the Republicans are the majority party in this Congress. I hope \nthey will help me make sure that the taxpayers' money is spent wisely \nand, most importantly, according to law. I will have four or five \nspeeches later on in the next few days on how some of this money is not \nbeing spent according to law.\n  I hope they will help me make sure that the citizens get a full and \naccurate accounting of how their money was spent by the Pentagon. And I \nhope that my speeches will help set the stage for a better \nunderstanding of the problem and more sound decisions on defense. I \nhope they will help the new Senators understand that just throwing more \nmoney at the Defense Department will not automatically give Americans \ngreater and better defense.\n  Tomorrow I plan to talk about the accuracy of the Department of \nDefense budget and accounting data. As I go along, I hope to draw on my \nexperiences with the defense issues of the 1980's. I want to use those \nexperiences as a way of trying to bring today's defense debate into \nsharper focus. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/20/senate-section/article/S4164-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4165-S4187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             LINE-ITEM VETO\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, while we have several speakers lined up \ntoday to speak on the line-item veto, none is here at this time. I \nthink what I will do is take the occasion to delve into a little bit of \nthe history of line-item veto so we could at least make that part of \nthe record.\n  On Friday, I spoke at length in response to the minority leader's \npresentation before the Senate, of his concerns and objections about \nthe line-item veto and the direction he thought he should go. I do not \nknow that I need to repeat those at this particular point.\n  Let me reflect back a little bit on how we got to this particular \npoint and why line-item veto was considered necessary by a number of \nour former \n [[Page S4166]] Presidents and a number of Governors, and in attempting \nto put it in the historical context, perhaps we can better understand \nthe case for it today.\n                     history of the line-item veto\n\n  Reflecting upon the experience of the U.S. Government, Confederate \nrebels met to draw up a new constitution.\n  An individual by the name of Robert Smith--not the same Robert Smith \nwho so ably represents the State of New Hampshire in the Senate today--\nbut Robert A. Smith, in addressing the people of Alabama, had this to \nsay: ``We have followed with almost literal fidelity, the Constitution \nof the United States,'' reflecting on his drafting of a constitution \nfor when they anticipated a new Confederate Government.\n\n       We have followed with almost literal fidelity the \n     Constitution of the United States, and departed from its text \n     only so far as experience had clearly proved that additional \n     checks were required for the preservation of the Nation's \n     interest. Of this character is the power given the President \n     to arrest corrupt or illegitimate expenditures, and at the \n     same time approving other parts of the bill. There is hardly \n     a more flagrant abuse of its power, by the Congress of the \n     United States than the habitual practice of loading bills, \n     which are necessary for governmental operations with \n     reprehensible, not to say venal dispositions of the public \n     money, and which only obtain favor by a system of \n     combinations among Members interested in similar abuses upon \n     the Treasury.\n\n  That speech could have been given yesterday. That speech can be given \ntoday. Yet here we have Robert Smith more than 100 years ago in writing \nwith his colleagues a new constitution, basing it upon the experience \nthat this Nation had at that point with its then Constitution, the \nexperience of granting to the legislative body a power that was not \nchecked by the checks and balances of those powers given to the \nexecutive branch.\n  As Robert Smith said, ``We basically are writing our new Constitution \non the basis of the existing U.S. Constitution because that \nConstitution is a sound model for what any new Constitution ought to be \nmade of.'' ``Yet,'' he said, ``based on our experience, that has \nclearly proven that there are some changes that need to be made, some \nadditional checks,'' as he said, ``were required for the preservation \nof the Nation's interest, checks necessary to arrest corrupt or \nillegitimate expenditures on the part of the legislative branch.''\n  I go on to quote Robert Smith:\n\n       Bills necessary for the support of the Government are \n     loaded with items of the most exceptional character, and are \n     thrown upon the President at the close of the session, for \n     his sanction, as the only alternative for keeping the \n     Government in motion. Even, however, under this salutary \n     check, the evil might be but mitigated, not cured, in the \n     case of a weak or highly partisan President, who would feel \n     that the responsibility of such legislation rested but \n     lightly on him, so long as the unrestrained power and duty of \n     originating appropriations depended upon a corrupt or pliant \n     Congress--hence the conventions of confederate States wisely \n     determined that the Executive was the proper department to \n     know and call for the moneys necessary for the support of \n     Government, and that here the responsibility should rest.\n\n  In closing, he said:\n\n       * * * By giving the President the power to veto \n     objectionable items in appropriation bills, we have, I trust, \n     greatly purified our Government.\n\n  America fought a painful and bloody war to save the Union. We are \nstanding here today because that war was won. Millions of our fellow \nAmericans won their freedom and put an end to one of the most \ndisgraceful chapters in American history. And yet a germ of an idea was \nborn in the Confederacy that took root across our country. The idea was \nenhanced accountability for the taxpayers money through the line-item \nveto.\n  After the Civil War, line-item veto authority spread like wildfire in \nthe States. Today, 43 Governors enjoy the same power we are fighting to \ngive the President of the United States--the authority to veto wasteful \nspending items.\n  Line-item veto became a reality in the U.S. possessions as well. \nCongress, though it failed to give the President line-item veto \nauthority, gave this power to the Governors General of the possessions. \nThe line-item veto was granted to the Governor General of the \nPhilippines in 1916, and the Governors of the territories of Hawaii in \n1900, Alaska in 1912, Puerto Rico in 1917, and the Virgin Islands in \n1954. Thus Congresses recognized the need for and virtue of this \nauthority which it has never given to the President of the United \nStates and to the American people.\n  States have been successfully using the line-item veto, many for over \n100 years. Today, almost uniformly, the Governors endorse giving the \nPresident of the United States the same tool for controlling spending.\n  A Cato Institute survey of 118 U.S. Governors and former Governors--\nincluding Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Michael Dukakis, and Bill \nClinton reveals a strong consensus that a line-item veto for the \nPresident would be an effective method of reducing the massive Federal \ndeficit: 67 of respondents were Republicans, 50 Democrat; 19 were \nserving Governors when they responded; 92 percent of the Governors \nbelieve that a line-item veto for the President would help restrain \nFederal spending; 88 percent of the Democratic respondents supported \nthe line-item veto; 55 percent of the Governors believe Congress has \ntoo much authority over the Federal budget, versus only 2 percent who \nthink the President has too much authority.\n  When asked ``Was the line-item veto a useful tool to you as Governor \nin balancing the State budget?'' 69 percent said the line-item veto was \na very useful tool, 23 percent said it was a somewhat useful tool, 7 \npercent said it was not useful, 91 percent of Democratic Governors said \nthe line-item veto was very useful or somewhat useful.\n  The survey also asked, ``Do you think that a line-item veto for the \nPresident would help restrain Federal spending?''\n  Ninety-two percent of the respondents replied yes.\n  Eighty-eight of Democrats agreed.\n  Since the Budget Reform and Impoundment Act of 1974, every President \nhas complained that Congress has usurped the executive branch's \ntraditional powers over the budget process. The Governors agree.\n  ``In your opinion, does Congress or the President have too much \nauthority over the Federal budget today?'' The survey asked. The \nmajority responded, ``Congress has too much power.''\n  Nine of ten Governors--regardless of party--support a line-item veto \nfor the President as a way to restrain spending. A majority of \nGovernors think that Congress has too much authority over the budget \nprocess.\n  Here is what some Governors have actually said:\n\n       The line-item veto is a useful tool that a Governor can use \n     on occasion to eliminate blatantly `Port Barrell' \n     expenditures that can strain the budget. At the same time he \n     must answer to the voters if he (or she) uses the veto \n     irresponsibly. It is a certain restraint on the legislative \n     branch.--Keith H. Miller, Alaska, Republican (1969-70).\n       I support the line-item veto because it is an executive \n     function to identify budget plan excesses and wasteful items. \n     It is an antidote for pork--Hugh L. Carey, New York, Democrat \n     (1975-83).\n       Congress's practice of passing enormous spending bills \n     means that funding for everything from Lawrence Welk museum \n     to a study of bovine flatulence slips through Congress. The \n     President may be unable to veto a major bill that includes \n     such spending abuses because the majority of the bill is \n     desperately needed. A line-item veto would let the President \n     control the irresponsible spending that Congress can't. A \n     line-item veto already works at the State level. It not only \n     allows a Governor to veto wasteful spending, it works as a \n     deterrent to wasteful spending legislators know will be \n     vetoed--Pete Wilson, California, Republican, (1991-?).\n       Legislators love to be loved, so they love to spend money. \n     Line-item veto is essential to enable Executive to hold down \n     spending--William F. Weld, Massachusetts, Republican (1991-\n     ?).\n       When I was Governor in California, the Governor had the \n     line-item veto, and so you could veto parts of a bill or even \n     part of the spending in a bill. The President can't do that. \n     I think--frankly of course, I'm prejudiced--Government would \n     be far better off if the President had the right of the Line-\n     item veto.--Ronald Reagan, California, Republican (1967-75).\n       I believe it provides a check and balance which is helpful \n     even if only because it requires legislators to consider the \n     potential for veto and may thereby make them more \n     accountable--Mike Sullivan, Democrat, Wyoming (1991-94).\n       It can be a surgical tool to highlight foolishness, and \n     thus help the Executive make his case.--Pete Du Pont, \n     Delaware, Republican (1977-85).\n       To the detriment of the Federal process, the President is \n     not held accountable for a balanced budget. Congress takes \n     control over budget development with its budget resolution, \n     after which, the President may only approve or veto 13 \n     appropriation bills. Without the line-item veto the President \n     has minimal \n      [[Page S4167]] flexibility to manage the Federal Budget \n     after it is passed--L. Douglas Wilder, Virginia, Democrat \n     (1990-94).\n  Almost every President since Ulysses S. Grant has made the same case \nas the Governors. Only one President in the 20th century has not \nrequested the line-item veto.\n  In a message to Congress on August 14, 1876, President Grant claimed \n``discretionary authority'' over the items of appropriations bills. In \nsigning the river and harbor bill he said:\n\n       If it was obligatory upon the Executive to expend all the \n     money appropriated by Congress, I should return the river and \n     harbor bill with my objections * * * without enumerating, \n     many appropriations are made for the works of purely private \n     or local interest, in no sense national. I cannot give my \n     sanction to these, and will take care that during my term of \n     office no public money shall be expended upon them * * * \n     under no circumstances will I allow expenditure upon works \n     not clearly national.\n\n  No objection was made to President Grant's interpretation.\n  After deprecating the practice of combining appropriations for a \ngreat diversity of objects, widely separated in their nature and \nlocality, in one river and harbor bill, President Arthur, in his second \nannual message to Congress, dated December 4, 1882, suggested two \nsuggestions to this problem:\n  First, enactment of separate appropriation bills for each internal \nimprovement, or, alternately, and\n  Second, a constitutional amendment empowering the Executive to veto \nitems in appropriations bills. He then listed 14 States whose \nconstitutions gave the item or specific veto authority to their \nGovernors and declared:\n\n       I commend to your careful consideration and the question \n     whether an amendment of the Federal Constitution in the \n     particular indicated would not afford the best remedy for \n     what is often a grave embarrassment both to Members of \n     Congress and the Executive, and is sometimes a serious public \n     mischief.\n\n  President Arthur repeated this recommendation in his third annual \nmessage, dated December 4, 1883, and in his fourth annual message, \ndated December 1, 1884.\n\n\n                      president franklin roosevelt\n\n  In his budget message for fiscal year 1939, President Roosevelt, \nafter calling attention to the use of the item veto ``in the majority \nof our States'' and remarking that ``the system meets with general \napproval in the many States which have adopted it,'' said:\n\n       A respectable difference of opinion exists as to whether a \n     similar item veto power could be given to the President by \n     legislation or whether a constitutional amendment would be \n     necessary. I strongly recommend that the present Congress \n     adopt whichever course it may deem to be the correct one.\n\n\n                            president truman\n\n  In the second volume of his memoirs, Harry S. Truman wrote:\n\n       One important lack in the Presidential veto power, I \n     believe, is authority to veto individual items in \n     appropriation bills. The President must approve the bill in \n     its entirety, or refuse to approve it, or let it become law \n     without his approval * * * As a senator I tried to discourage \n     the practice of adding riders deliberately contrived to \n     neutralize otherwise positive legislation, because it is a \n     form of legislative blackmail.\n                          president eisenhower\n\n  In reply to a House request for recommendations on possible budget \ncuts, President Eisenhower addressed a letter to Speaker Rayburn, dated \nApril 18, 1957, containing 10 recommendations including the following \none:\n\n       And, tenth, to help assure continuing economy on the part \n     of the Congress as well as the executive branch, take action \n     that will grant the President the power held by many State \n     Governors to veto specific items in appropriation bills.\n\n  The plea for a line-item veto was illustrated dramatically by \nPresident Reagan when he slammed down a 43 pound, 3,296 page spending \nbill. It was a bill that represented 1 trillion dollars' worth of \nspending--not one penny of which he had the power to veto, unless he \nrejected it all.\n  Most recently, President Clinton has asked that this Congress send \nhim the strongest line-item veto measure possible. He has called the \nline-item veto ``one of the most powerful weapons we could use in our \nfight against out-of-control deficit spending.''\n  He also said:\n\n       I am strongly in favor of a line-item veto. I have it. I've \n     used a bunch as Governor. And, interestingly enough, in my \n     last legislative session, I didn't have to use it one time \n     because I had it. See? . . . I keep telling my friends in \n     Congress, they would be better off. They think they have got \n     to pass some piece of pork barrel for the folks back home. \n     Let me take the heat.\n\n  Interestingly, many Presidents argued for the line-item veto while \nthey still had considerable leverage over spending. Until the Budget \nand Impoundment Act of 1974, Presidents exercised their authority to \nrescind money, and thus control spending they felt was wasteful. This \nwas a practice that had its origins with our first President.\n  In his article, ``The Line-Item Veto: Provided in the Constitution \nand Traditionally Applied,'' Stephen Glazier wrote:\n\n       At the beginning of our Government under the Constitution, \n     during the administrations of Washington and Adams, Congress \n     passed very general appropriations bills that permitted the \n     President not to spend appropriated funds . . . . In \n     Washington's day the practice was called ``impoundment.\n\n  Perhaps the most significant early impoundment was during Jefferson's \nPresidency, when he refused to spend $50,000 appropriated by Congress \nfor gunboats. He also refused to spend money on two new fortifications.\n  This instance and other early instances were mostly attributed to the \nfact that, unlike today, appropriations bills were\n\n     Quite general in their terms and by obvious . . . intent, \n     left to the President . . . the power for . . . determining \n     in what particular manner the funds were spent (1971 \n     hearings, testimony of Assistant Attorney General Rehnquist).\n  Under the Grant administration, we saw more significant withholding \nof funds. Upon signing a measure which appropriated funds for harbor \nand river improvements, Grant sent a message to Congress saying that he \ndid not plan to spend the total amount because some appropriations were \nfor ``works of purely private or local interest, in no sense \nnational.'' Grant asserted that no expenditures might be made except \nfor ``works already done and paid for'' (Congressional Record 5628 \n1876).\n  Grant's Secretary of War also refused to spend $2.7 million of the $5 \nmillion which had been appropriated by Congress. The House asked the \nPresident to respond with legal authority for impounding of funds. The \nSecretary of War replied that this act was in no way mandatory and that \nit was not fiscally practical or legally appropriate for the \nPresident's discretion to be limited than by the interests of the \npublic service. Most of Congress agreed with the President.\n  President Roosevelt impounded funds in the 1930's to cope with the \nemergencies of economic depression and war. In the 1940's Budget \nDirector Smith ordered impoundment of amounts ranging from $1.6 to $95 \nmillion which had been appropriated for the Civilian Conservation \nCorps' surplus labor force, civilian pilot training projects, surplus \nmarketing corporation among others, because the projects did not have \npriority ratings to obtain the scarce resources.\n  The Truman Presidency impounded funds appropriated for a 70-group Air \nForce and giant aircraft carriers.\n  Eisenhower impounded funds appropriated for various defense projects, \nmost notably funds for strategic airlift aircraft, $140 million, and \nprocurement of Nike-Zeus--$135 million--hardware; in 1956, $46.4 \nmillion to increase Marine Corps personnel strength was impounded. In \n1959, $48 million for hound dog missiles, $90 million for Minuteman \nProgram funds, $55.6 million for KC-135 tankers. In 1960, $35 million \nfor nuclear-powered carriers.\n  Kennedy's administration was responsible for a controversial \nimpoundment of funds for the RS-70 long range bomber. Congress \nappropriated nearly two times the amount that Kennedy had requested. \nSecretary of Defense McNamara refused to release the excess funds. \nLater, Congress voted to direct a lesser amount for the RS-70.\n  President Johnson felt impoundments for domestic programs were \nlegally sanctioned. Attorney General Clark said that the impoundment of \nhighway trust funds was lawful. The Budget Director said that it was \nthe general power of the President to operate for the welfare of the \neconomy and the Nation in terms of combating inflationary pressures.\n  The most controversial of Presidential impoundments were during the \nNixon Presidency. Each year since first assuming office, President \nNixon had \n [[Page S4168]] impounded 17 to 20 percent of controllable funds \nappropriated by Congress. Nearly $12 billion appropriated for the \nbuilding of highways--funds impounded of a cross-Florida barge canal, \non which $50 million had been spent and which was already one-third \ncompleted--and pollution control projects had been withheld. Hundreds \nof millions of dollars appropriated for medical research, higher \neducation--$18 million of the Indian Education Act, rural \nelectrification, rural environmental assistance, public housing--over \n$70 million of HUD's 312 housing rehabilitation, loan programs, urban \nrenewal and myriad other programs were impounded. In 1973, the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit became the highest court to \never decide a case dealing with Executive impoundments. In Missouri \nHighway Commission versus Volpe, the issue of whether the Secretary of \nTransportation could refuse to obligate highway funds which had been \napportioned to Missouri, because of the status of the economy and the \ncontrol of inflation. The court ruled that the highway funds could not \nbe lawfully impounded for the reasons asserted. This case did not, \nhowever, settle the constitutional question pending before the White \nHouse and Congress.\n  Because of the sweeping nature of the Nixon impoundments, Congress \nresponded. On October 27, 1972, Congress passed the Federal Impoundment \nand Information Act, which requires the President to submit reports to \nthe Congress and Comptroller General detailing certain information \nconcerning funds which are appropriated and partially or completely \nimpounded.\n  The act essentially forbade the President from impounding funds, \nunless Congress acted to approve that impoundment. But, the act did not \nforce Congress' hand. By simple inaction, the funds would automatically \nbe released.\n  Under current law, the President sends up his recommended cuts, and \nif Congress does not act to approve them, they become meaningless. The \ncuts simply die on the vine as Congress spends more and more and \naccuses everyone but themselves of fearing tough spending choices.\n  Over the years, the congressional attitude toward Presidential \nrescissions has become one of nearly total neglect. In 1991 President \nBush proposed 47 rescissions for a possible savings of $5.55 billion. \nOnly one rescission was approved by Congress. We saved $2.1 million--a \ndrop in the bucket.\n  Since 1974, Congress has approved a mere 30 percent of the \nPresident's rescissions. We have chosen to ignore more than $41 billion \nwhich the President identified as unnecessary spending.\n  In 1974, Congress ignored all the President's rescissions, a 100 \npercent failure rate. In 1975, 56 percent were ignored. In 1976, we \nfailed to enact 86 percent. More recently, in 1983, 100 percent of the \nPresident's rescissions were ignored. In 1984, we failed to enact 67 \npercent and in 1985 we failed to enact 60 percent. By 1986 and 1987, we \nfailed to enact 95 percent and 97 percent of those rescissions. Since \n1974, we have acted on only 31 percent of the President's rescissions. \nIn the meantime, our debt has more than quadrupled. Clearly, Congress \nhas found the new impoundment procedures a bit too convenient.\n  When I first came to the Senate in 1989, Senator McCain and I worked \ntogether to craft a legislative line-item veto to reverse these trends \nand restore some equilibrium between the Congress and the President. We \nhave offered that bill every Congress, and we have forced the Senate to \nvote on it. But our bill has always been subject to a filibuster or to \na budget point of order.\n  In November 1989, I first offered my legislation as an amendment to \nanother bill because the Senate would not even consider it on its own \nmerits. That effort failed by a vote of 40 to 51. In June 1990, Senator \nMcCain and I tried again. This time we went down by a vote of 43 to 50. \nProgress, though not much.\n  But each time I'd brought the line-item veto to the floor I was \nsubject to a chorus of advice. Address pork spending, I was told, while \nan appropriations bill is actually on the floor. Do not worry so much \nabout giving the President line-item veto authority. Just offer an \namendment to strike wasteful spending. So I tried it.\n  Right after Desert Storm, the Congress was called on to pass a dire \nemergency supplemental to defray the costs of the war. It was \nlegislation which came after noble sacrifice and unprecedented victory. \nAnd yet even this bill was a target of wasteful spending.\n  It contained $1 million for the Maine Department of Agriculture to \nstudy potato virus. It included $609,000 for poultry inspection; \n$351,000 for new furnishings for the Library of Congress; $100,000 for \nthe United States-Canada Salmon Commission. All this in a dire \nemergency supplemental to pay for the war costs of Desert Storm.\n  But perhaps most disturbing, the bill required that the Navy overhaul \nand upgrade the U.S.S. Kennedy at the Philadelphia Navy Shipyard, \ngiving it a Service Life Extension Program [SLEP]. This was a classic \ncase where special interests went far beyond what was actually needed \nor requested. The Navy strongly opposed the work for two compelling \nreasons.\n  First was cost. While the SLEP at Philadelphia would cost the \ntaxpayer $1 billion, the Navy felt that a simple overhaul--at half the \nprice--was all the work that was required. In addition, the Navy had \ndownsized its fleet, so extensive service to older carriers was not \nneeded. The Navy could simply deactivate the older carriers.\n  So the issue was $1 billion of spending that the Department of \nDefense said was unnecessary. I decided that this would be a good \ncandidate for an amendment on the floor. I would take the advice of \nthose who said that Congress can provide its own form of line-item veto \nby simply amending bills. That experience taught me a lot about the \nbusiness-as-usual pork practices that are now so common in this \ndistinguished body.\n  When I offered my reasons for opposing this spending, a good number \nof my colleagues agreed. My amendment passed with a healthy majority of \n56 votes. Yet when the doors closed on the conference committee, the \nfunding was quietly restored to the bill without debate. What was won \non the Senate floor after a lengthy floor debate, was quietly easily \nrestored behind closed doors.\n  Since that time, Senator McCain has gone to heroic lengths to \nscrutinize appropriations bills and help save the taxpayer money. He \nand his staff have been on the floor during debate on most \nappropriations bills to ensure that last minute deals funding \nunauthorized projects are not cut to slip spending into bills.\n  But those efforts alone are not enough. We have learned that they \nsimply do not work. We need true reform. We need the line-item veto. So \nwe have pursued our efforts in each Congress.\n  But we have not been the first in Congress to try. The line-item veto \nwas first introduced on January 18, 1876, by Congressman Charles \nFaulkner of West Virginia. It was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary where it died. About 200 line-item veto bills have since been \nintroduced. In nearly every succeeding Congress the proposal has been \nreoffered in varying forms.\n  The proposed amendment has for the most part been buried in the \nJudiciary Committees. Very few have been reported, and those which \nhave, were reported adversely.\n  In 1883 on a motion to suspend the rules so that the House Judiciary \nCommittee might be discharged and House Resolution 267 passed, the \nmotion was defeated: This has been one of the few occasions in which \nthe item-veto principle has been subjected to a vote in either House.\n  On April 21, 1884, for the first time, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nfavorably reported a Resolution--S. Res. 18 by Mr. Lapham of New York--\nproposing to amend the Constitution so as to confer on the President \nthe power to veto items in appropriation bills. By unanimous consent on \nDecember 9, 1884, Senate Joint Resolution 18 was made special order of \nbusiness for December 17. But on that date and again in February the \nresolution was passed over in the Senate indefinitely.\n  In this century, the line-item veto continued to be actively \nconsidered.\n  In 1938, the line-item veto passed the House of Representatives, but \nfailed to be considered in the Senate.\n  In 1957, Congressman Stewart Udall had this to say:\n\n       The tendency in the Congress naturally is that the local \n     interest is predominant. Each of us have projects, we have \n     Federal programs we feel are vital to our districts. In \n      [[Page S4169]] our system of checks and balances, it seems \n     to me a good argument can be made that it is good and it is \n     wise to have someone outside the legislative, namely the \n     executive, also weigh and particular proposal against the \n     national interest, and I think that is essentially what the \n     item veto would do.\n\n  Congressman Charles Bennett added:\n\n       As far as I can ascertain, our Constitution and practices \n     in the early days of our country contemplate that the \n     President would find the means readily available to him to \n     veto an appropriation. This is no longer possible for a \n     President in 1957, not because of any change in the \n     Constitution, but because of the practice of Congress in \n     bringing in very large bills from the standpoint of money and \n     from the standpoint of number of items and diversity of items \n     covered. The evil is not so great in authorizations, because \n     in authorizations there is no emergency generally involved. \n     There is an emergency in having adequate funds to carry on \n     the Government, and when you have a large sum of money in an \n     appropriations bill involving many employees and may facets \n     of Government, there is an emergency in passing such a bill; \n     so that the President has an almost impossible situation \n     confronting him if he desires to see any economies made in \n     these bills that are so multiplicitous in material and detail \n     and in dollars.\n\n  In 1957, the Nation ran a budget surplus of $3.4 billion, and our \ncountry's debt was $272 billion. In other words, the total debt our \nNation accumulated in the first 181 years of our history was \napproximately equal to our annual operating deficits today. And in \n1957, our Nation's books showed no red ink. Yet Members of Congress \nwere arguing for a significant change in the name of the national \ninterest and in the name of good government. They were arguing for the \nline-item veto.\n  Today, the situation has changed radically. The Nation's total \nFederal debt has increased 1,665 percent to $4.8 trillion. We will \nborrow more in 4 days this year than we borrowed in the entire year of \n1958.\n  The arguments of 1957 still stand. Line-item veto helps to balance \nthe parochial interest with the national interest; it enables a \nPresident to rationally deal with omnibus spending bills. Nothing has \nchanged but the urgency of our circumstances.\n  According to CBO:\n\n       Failure to reverse [current] trends in fiscal policy and \n     the composition of Federal spending will doom future \n     generations to a stagnating standard of living, damage U.S. \n     competitiveness and influence in the world, and hamper our \n     ability to address pressing national trends.\n\n  And when we proceed to S. 4 on Monday, it will be the first time in \nthe history of the U.S. Senate that the legislative line-item veto will \nbe actually considered as a free standing bill in its own right.\n  Last November, anger against Congress burnt white hot. With their \nvotes, the American people decisively demonstrated their deep \nfrustration with the status quo. Last week, the U.S. Senate fueled that \nanger and betrayed their trust. By failing to pass a balanced budget \namendment, we clearly demonstrated that we as an institution are more \nconcerned with preserving our power than with protecting our Nation's \nposterity.\n  Let us show the American people that we are serious about radically \nchanging the way Congress does business. Let's show them that we intend \nto present appropriations bills without embarrassment. Let's send the \nmessage to taxpayers that, under our guidance, their dollars will not \nbe wasted. Let us act to boldly eliminate the dual deficits of public \nfunds and of public trust. Let us resist the urge to continue business \nas usual.\n  Let us finally pass the line-item veto. The time has come.\n  As I said, this is a speech that could be given today, a time-\nhonored--``honored'' is the wrong word--a time-abused practice of the \nlegislative branch of submitting to the executive, to the President a \nbill which, as Smith says, is necessary for the support of Government \nbut loaded with illegitimate expenditures, knowing that the President's \nonly choice is to accept the entire bill or reject the entire bill, \nbecause he does not have the power to line-item veto, or to reject a \npart of that bill that is not necessary to the future of this country \nor not deemed a wise expenditure.\n  That is what we are all about. Nothing has changed. Nothing has \nchanged in over 130 years. Nothing has changed since the formation of \nthis country and the adoption of this Constitution because, as Smith \nsays, we are doing this based on our experience, what the legislature \nhas accomplished and what the country has experienced in terms of the \ninability to check, check, as he said, an illegitimate or corrupt \nexpenditure, the flagrant abuse of the power by the Congress through \nits habitual practice of loading bills necessary for governmental \nappropriations.\n  Subsequent to that, America fought a painful and bloody war to \npreserve the Union, to keep us one Nation, united. Millions of our \nfellow Americans won their freedom and put an end to one of the most, \nif not the most, tragic chapters in American history. Yet, at the time, \nthe germ of an idea was born in the Union that took root across the \ncountry. The idea has enhanced accountability for the taxpayers' money \nthrough the line-item veto.\n  After the Civil War, line-item veto authority spread like wildfire \nthroughout the States. Today, 43 Governors enjoy the same power that we \nare fighting to give the President of the United States: The authority \nto veto wasteful spending items.\n  Line-item veto became a reality in the United States possessions as \nwell, not just the States but the possessions. Congress, though it \nfailed to give the President line-item veto authority, gave this power \nto the Governors General of the possessions. The line-item veto was \ngranted to the Governor General of the Philippines in 1916 and the \nGovernors of the territories of Hawaii in 1900, Alaska in 1912, Puerto \nRico in 1917, and the Virgin Islands in 1954. Thus, Congress recognized \nthe need for and the virtue of this authority which it had never given \nto the President of the United States and to the American people.\n  States have been successfully using line-item veto since, many for \nover 100 years. Today, almost uniformly the Governors endorse giving \nthe President of the United States the same tool for controlling \nspending that they enjoy. As someone on this floor--it may have been \nthe Senator from Missouri who is presiding in the chair--said on \nFriday, we are not aware of any rush in any State legislatures across \nthe country in these 43 States to take away their Governor's authority \nunder line-item veto. If that is happening in any of the legislatures \nacross this land, we are not aware of it.\n  It seems to have worked very well, this check and balance system, the \npower to appropriate, the power to say, ``Yes, but not 100 percent of \nwhat you have sent we think is in the national interest, we in the \nexecutive branch think is in the national interest. We will take 97 \npercent of it, but this 3 percent just does not go to expenditures in \nthe national interest,'' and then to turn that back to the Congress, \nand the Congress, if it wants, can override that decision, but it takes \na two-thirds vote to do so.\n  A Cato Institute survey of 118 former Governors and current \nGovernors, including Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Michael Dukakis, and \nBill Clinton, reveals a strong consensus that a line-item veto for the \nPresident would be an effective method of reducing the massive Federal \ndeficit. One hundred eighteen former or current U.S. Governors, \nbipartisan--Jimmy Carter, Michael Dukakis, Bill Clinton, Ronald \nReagan--reveals a consensus and a support for a line-item veto.\n  That survey showed that 67 of the respondents were Republicans, 50 \nwere Democrats, 19 were serving Governors when they responded.\n  Ninety-two percent of the Governors--92 percent--believe that a line-\nitem veto for the President would help restrain Federal spending; 88 \npercent of the Democratic respondents supported the line-item veto; 55 \npercent of the Governors believe Congress has too much authority over \nthe Federal budget, and only 2 percent think the President has too much \nauthority.\n  Let me repeat that: 55 percent of the Governors believe that Congress \nhas too much authority over the Federal budget, and only 2 percent \nthink the President has too much authority.\n  When they were asked, ``Was the line-item veto a useful tool to you \nas Governor in balancing the State budget,'' 69 percent said the line-\nitem veto was a very useful tool, and 23 percent said it was a somewhat \nuseful tool. Only 7 percent said it was not useful. Ninety-one percent \nof the Democratic Governors said that the line-item veto \n [[Page S4170]] was a very useful or somewhat useful tool.\n  The survey also asked, ``Do you think that a line-item veto for the \nPresident would help restrain Federal spending?'' Ninety-two percent \nsaid yes; 88 percent of the Democrats agreed.\n  Since the Budget Reform and Impoundment Act of 1974, every President \nhas complained that Congress has usurped the executive branch's \ntraditional powersover the budget process. The Governors agree.\n  ``In your opinion,'' the survey went on to ask, ``does Congress or \nthe President have too much authority over the Federal budget today?'' \nThe survey said and the majority responded, Congress has too much \npower.\n  Let me quote from what some of the Governors have actually said:\n\n       Line-item veto is a useful tool that a Governor can use on \n     occasion to eliminate blatantly pork-barrel expenditures that \n     can strain the budget. At the same time, he must answer to \n     the voters if he or she uses the veto irresponsibly. It is a \n     certain restraint on the legislative branch.\n\n  Gov. Keith Miller, of Alaska, Republican Governor, 1969.\n\n       I support the line-item veto because it is an executive \n     function to identify budget plan excesses and wasteful items. \n     It is an antidote for pork.\n\n  Gov. Hugh Carey, of New York, a Democrat, who served from 1975 to \n1983.\n\n       Congress' practice of passing enormous spending bills means \n     that funding the Lawrence Welk Museum to the study of bovine \n     flatulence slips through Congress. The President may be \n     unable to veto a major bill that includes such spending \n     abuses because the majority of the bill is desperately \n     needed. The line-item veto would let the President control \n     the irresponsible spending that Congress can't. The line-item \n     veto already works at the State level. It not only allows the \n     Governor to veto wasteful spending, it works as a deterrent \n     to wasteful spending because legislators know it will be \n     vetoed.\n\n  That is a statement by current Gov. Pete Wilson, of California, \nRepublican.\n\n       I believe it provides the checks and balance, even if it \n     requires legislators to consider the potential for veto and \n     thereby makes them more accountable.\n\n  Gov. Mike Sullivan, a Democrat from Wyoming.\n\n       Legislators love to be loved, so they love to spend money. \n     Line-item veto is essential to enable the executive to hold \n     down spending.\n\n  That was spoken by William Weld, the current Governor of \nMassachusetts.\n\n       When I was Governor of California, the Governor had the \n     line-item veto, so you could veto parts of a bill or even \n     part of the spending in a bill. The President can't do that. \n     I think, frankly--of course, I'm prejudiced--Government would \n     be far better off if the President had the right of the line-\n     item veto.\n\n  Ronald Reagan, former California Governor.\n\n       It can be a surgical tool to highlight foolishness and thus \n     help the executive make his case.\n\n  Said Pete DuPont, Republican Governor of Delaware from 1977 to 1985:\n\n       To the detriment of the Federal process, the President is \n     not held accountable for a balanced budget. Congress takes \n     control over budget development within its budget resolution \n     after which the President may only approve or veto 13 \n     appropriation bills. Without the line-item veto, the \n     President has minimal flexibility to manage the Federal \n     budget after it is passed.\n\n  So said Douglas Wilder, Democrat Governor of Virginia from 1990 to \n1994.\n  Republicans, Democrats, liberals, conservatives, moderates, current, \npast, historical, virtually all have said the line-item veto works in \ntheir States. It worked for them. It worked in their relations with \ntheir legislators. It ought to apply to the Congress.\n  Senator Ashcroft, now presiding in the chair, eloquently spoke on \nFriday of the line-item veto and what it meant to him when he was \nGovernor of Missouri and how the interaction between the executive and \nthe legislature worked to eliminate unnecessary, unneeded spending of \nhard-earned, scarce taxpayers' dollars. And he had a terrific chart \nillustrating that it not only works when you are Governor of the State \nof Missouri, but it works when you are head of household or father of a \nhousehold and you sit down around the kitchen table with the family and \nsay, ``Let's plan out next month's or next year's budget, the things we \nhave to do, the things that we would like to do. Let's check our \nrevenues and see what funds might be available, everybody submit their \nrequest and let's go down the line and see what works.''\n  There might be an item that you have to line out and in many cases \nsubstitute something for that. Instead of the trip to Disney World that \neverybody would like to take every year and stay at the hotel right on \nthe grounds and not have to worry about being down the road or across \nthe street and driving in and parking but just get on the tram in the \nlobby of the hotel and go to the next exhibit, which we would all like \nto do but which most of us cannot afford to do once in a lifetime, let \nalone once every year, you might have to adjust. You might have to go \nto Sea World instead or you might have to, as Senator Ashcroft said, go \nto the State park for a vacation.\n  You line out some items. You substitute some others. You reduce it. \nYou negotiate. That is the process that takes place under line-item \nveto, and that is the process that would take place if the President \nwould have that line-item veto.\n  Almost every President since Ulysses Grant has made the same case as \nthe Governors made. Only one President in the 20th century has not \nrequested the line-item veto, only one. In his message to Congress on \nAugust 14, 1876, President Grant claimed discretionary authority of the \nitems of appropriations bills. In signing the river and harbor bill he \nsaid, and I quote:\n\n       If it was obligatory upon the executive to expend all the \n     money appropriated by Congress, I would return the river and \n     harbor bill with my objections. Without enumerating, many \n     appropriations are made for the works of purely private or \n     local interests and in no sense national. I cannot give my \n     sanction to these and will take care that during my term of \n     office no public money shall be expended upon them. Under no \n     circumstances will I allow expenditure upon works not clearly \n     national.\n\n  No objection was made to President Grant's interpretation of that. \nCongress knew that it had been caught with its hand in the cookie jar. \nDoes that mean expenditures on rivers and harbors are not necessary? Of \ncourse not. Some of those are very necessary. But in some years you \ncannot do as much as you would like to do in other years. And at other \ntimes there are higher priorities. Of course, the natural thing to do \nfor Congress is to want to spend that money because, as Governor Weld \nsaid, ``Legislators love to be loved and so they love to spend money.''\n  Nothing brings a smile to the face of your constituents or special \ninterest group more than the word ``yes.'' ``Yes, we will fund your \nrequest.'' ``Yes, we will give you everything you ask for.'' Boy, does \nthat make life easy as a legislator. It is fun to go home and say, \n``You know that request you asked me about 6 months ago? Done. I \nslipped it in the--such and such--appropriations bill. The President \nsigned it just the other day.'' You are a hero. They hold a dinner in \nyour honor. They give you a little plaque and you put it on the wall, \n``Legislator of the year.'' Of course, we love to be loved. Of course, \nwe love to go home and say ``yes'' to people.\n  However, under the process that we have operating today at the \nFederal level, we have a very convenient excuse to say ``yes,'' that \nallows us to say ``yes'' that is not available to most legislators. \nMost legislators are operating under either a balanced budget \nconstitutional prohibition, a constitutional mandate to require a \nbalanced budget or they are operating under line-item veto or both.\n  Do you know what that means? One of two things. It means that when \nthose interest groups come and say, ``Can you get this money for us?'' \nyou have to look them back in the eye and say, ``That may be a worthy \nproject and in fact I even support it, but here's my dilemma. Right now \nwe are running really close on the amount of revenues coming in and the \namount of expenditures going out. And there's only one of two ways that \nI can really address your request this year. The first is to look at \nsome other program and cut that out and substitute your program, take \nthe money from that and use it to pay for yours.''\n  Of course, that is not the preferred method today because nobody \nwants to go over to the other group and say, ``By the way, we are going \nto eliminate your program, cut your program so we can give it to the \nnew program over here,'' because everybody wants to please everybody.\n   [[Page S4171]] The second option available to them is to raise \ntaxes, to go to the public and say, ``We've got a new idea, a new \nprogram we would like to increase funding for. We are not willing to \ntake the heat to cut out any existing program and so we are going to \nhave to raise your taxes to generate more money.'' Not too many \nlegislators like to do that, like to run home and tell people they are \ngoing to raise their taxes.\n  Now, the Federal legislators have a third option. Here is the \nproblem. The third option is to say ``yes'' to everybody and then \nborrow the money to cover the expenditure, float some more debt so you \ndo not have to go to the constituents and say, ``We are going to raise \nyour taxes to pay for this.'' You do not have to go to some other \nprogram and say, ``We are going to have to cut your expenditures to pay \nfor this.'' You say ``yes'' to everybody. And you produce an unbalanced \nbudget--deficit spending--borrowing the money to pay for it, and we \nwill let some future Congressman worry about the implications of that.\n  Well, the future is now. The future is here. That time-honored \npractice has now led us to a nearly $5 trillion debt. Line-item veto is \none of the tools which we will use, if it is passed, to adjust \nsignificantly the way that Congress spends the taxpayers' dollars. I \ndeeply regret we did not pass a balanced budget amendment--it failed by \none vote--because it is a much more significant change in the way we \nwould do business.\n That would force us, year after year after year after year, in support \nof the Constitution of the United States, to not spend more money than \nwe take in. That would make honest legislators out of all of us. That \nwould bring integrity back to the halls of the Congress, in terms of \nthe way we address the people's interests and the people's wishes and \nthe way in which we handle the people's money.\n\n  That having failed, the only other real game in town that will bring \nchange in the way we make decisions about how to spend money is line-\nitem veto. Will it balance the budget? Absolutely not. I wish it would, \nbut it will not. But will it fundamentally change the way in which we \nlook at how we spend taxpayers' dollars? Yes, it will. And it will \nhelp. It will add up to some real significant savings. It will change \nthe way we do our business.\n  I contend, with all the promises, all the rhetoric, all the \nwonderful, ``Oh, we just need to summon up the will we need to get this \njob done,'' it just has not happened. Year after year, one decade after \nanother, for one reason or another, Congress has not summoned up the \nwill to get the job done. There is the human temptation of saying we \nwill do it after the next election--and then comes the next election, \nand then the next election, and before you know it, it is the next \ndecade, and before you know it we have a $5 trillion debt and, ``Yes, \nit is terrible, it is horrible, it impacts the next generation, but not \nyet; we are not quite there yet. See, we have these problems, those \nproblems, et cetera.''\n  So we are talking about fundamental structural change in the way \nCongress does it business. Line-item veto is the second best way I can \nthink of to do it. A balanced budget amendment is first. That failed. \nLine-item veto is a distant second, but frankly it is the only other \ngame in town. It is the only game we are talking about. If somebody has \na better structural way to change things around here, I am all for it.\n  Listen to the words of President Franklin Roosevelt. In his budget \nmessage for fiscal year 1939, President Roosevelt, after calling \nattention to the use of the line-item veto in the majority of our \nStates and remarking that the system meets with general approval in the \nmany States which have adopted it, said:\n\n       A respectable difference of opinion exists as to whether a \n     similar line-item veto could be given the President by \n     legislation or whether a constitutional amendment would be \n     necessary. I strongly recommend that the present Congress \n     adopt whichever course it may deem to be the correct one.\n\n  The bottom line is, even though some of us would like to amend the \nConstitution and give the President the constitutional line-item veto \nauthority, we do not have the votes to do that. We came one vote short \non balanced budget, and we do not have the votes to accomplish that on \nline-item veto. But we do have the votes to do it legislatively.\n  As Franklin Roosevelt said, ``* * * whichever course Congress may \ndeem to be the correct one.'' I do not know if it is the correct one, \nbut it is the doable one. We have a doable one. We have one that can \npass, and can be enacted into law. And, frankly--frankly--the way it is \nstructured, if it does not work, Congress can repeal it. I would regret \nthat. That is the problem with a statutory fix. But we can do it this \nCongress; we can do it this week.\n  President Truman said--and I think this is the most telling statement \nof all--in the second volume of his memoirs, Harry S. Truman wrote the \nfollowing:\n\n       One important lack in the Presidential veto power, I \n     believe, is the authority to veto individual items in \n     appropriation bills. The President must approve the bill in \n     its entirety or refuse to approve it or let it become law \n     without his approval.\n       As a Senator, I tried to discourage the practice of adding \n     riders deliberately contrived to neutralize otherwise \n     positive legislation [Truman said] because it is a form of \n     legislative blackmail.\n\n  I quoted that last week. Legislative blackmail, that is what it is. I \ndo not care what sugar-coating we put on it. I do not care what \njustification we raise. A lot of this pork-barrel stuff is legislative \nblackmail.\n  We may have a defense emergency bill to pay for operations in Haiti, \nRwanda, or Somalia that have already taken place, and the Defense \nDepartment accounts are drained. Or we may have a hurricane in Florida \nand we need emergency money to be appropriated to deal with those who \nare homeless and those who need health care and those who need \nemergency rations. Or we may have floods and earthquakes in California \nor floods in the Midwest, we have pressing national needs, and we \nconstruct a bill to take care of those needs. And at that point \nlegislators say, ``Aha, there is one the President has to sign. I mean, \nthis is an emergency. We have to get this money out in a hurry. That is \ngoing to have to go through the Congress. That is the one I will attach \nthis little item I have been carrying for the folks back home. That is \nthe one where I can get my, not national interest item, but parochial \ninterest item attached to. We will just attach that in committee, and \nwe will put it on the floor and we will send it to the President of the \nUnited States.''\n  It will be buried in there and the President will say, as every \nPresident in this century except one has said, ``If I only had the \nline-item veto, I could do what I have to do to accept that \nappropriations bill, but I could take out that unnecessary piece of \nspending that I know was attached on there just because they saw this \ntrain rolling through and this was a great vehicle to attach it to.''\n  Of course, let us understand if Congress wants to overturn that \ndecision of the President, it can do so. It has to come down here and \ndebate the item. Members have to cast their yea or nay on it so the \nfolks back home understand what they voted for and have the right to \nsay, ``What in the world? I did not send you to Washington, DC, to vote \nfor that item. What are you doing that for?''\n  Right now they do not have that because legislators have a very \nconvenient excuse. ``Oh, I don't support that either. But, you see, we \nhad this emergency, this bill came through, and Senator so-and-so from \nsuch-and-such a place snuck that devil in here and, boy, my dilemma was \neither deny the health payments to veterans or emergency funds for \nhomeless victims or money to take care of the farmers in the flooded \nMidwest, or reject all that in order to take care of Senator such-and-\nsuch's little item.''\n  The voters scratch their heads and say, ``Is there not a solution to \nthat?'' The solution is line-item veto.\n  Mr. President, I am going to skip some items here. My colleague from \nMississippi is on the floor. I am going to try to get to a point where \nI can wrap up.\n  But, there is a great history of abuses of the spending power by the \nCongress. It is a natural human tendency. I am not here pointing \nfingers at any of my colleagues. The only right I have is to point a \nfinger at myself. I am a legislator. As the Scriptures say, we have \nall \n [[Page S4172]] seen it and come short of--I am paraphrasing the \nScriptures here--come short of what our obligations are.\n  We are all guilty. We all know this is an abuse of power by the \nlegislative branch, by the spenders. So what we are saying here is let \nus institute a structural reform that really liberates all of us from \nthis insidious practice of adding pork-barrel spending to otherwise \nneeded appropriations bills. Let us make a structural change so we, as \na legislature, can restore some credibility and integrity to our work \nhere.\n  It is easy to read down the lists, Senator so-and-so did such-and-\nsuch. Look at this item. Look at that item. But I am not going to do \nthat. I am not going to do that because we are all guilty. We all need \nthe liberation of doing what I think in our hearts we know is right.\n  Mr. President, as has been stated often, this adds up to some pretty \nbig money. Senator McCain and I have been offering this alternately \nover the past many years. We have not been able to break through the \nfilibuster or we have not been able to break through the budget points \nof order to get the 60 votes necessary to get to a vote on the bill. We \ntrust there will not be a filibuster attempt on this issue. I guess we \nwill find out this evening at 5 o'clock when we go to the bill. We are \nappreciative of the fact that the Senator from West Virginia has \nconsented to allow us to not have a filibuster on the motion to proceed \nso we are going to go to the bill at 5 o'clock today. We will find out \nsoon whether or not the Congress is willing to go forward with this in \nserious debate and serious study.\n  There is going to be an alternative version, apparently, presented to \nthe version now on the floor. It will be, we believe, substituted for a \nversion that Senator McCain and I and others, Senator Domenici and \nothers have worked with Senator Dole on which we think is a stronger \nversion. We expand the scope of line-item vetoes to not only include \nappropriations but also target tax expenditures and new entitlements--\nnot existing entitlements but new entitlements. But there is going to \nbe a mild alternative presented, apparently, according to the minority \nleader--a mild alternative. We considered that, but we rejected it \nbecause it is not line-item veto. The same 51 votes that were collected \nto pass the appropriation in the first place can be used to thwart the \nPresident's efforts to stop that spending.\n  Veto means veto. Veto means two-thirds. Technically, the Constitution \ndoes not use the word ``veto.'' But it does call for a two-thirds \noverride by the Congress for bills not accepted by the President, or \nreturned to the Congress by the President. We are applying that same \nprinciple, that same rule, to the practice that the President is \ngranted that authority of taking out by line-item pieces of those bills \nrather than rejecting the whole. So, if there is going to be a measure \nwhich fundamentally alters the way in which this Congress operates, it \nhas to be a two-thirds vote. Anything short of that is a mild version \nthat will have little, if any, significant effect on the way we do \nbusiness.\n  I think that has been pretty well decided among at least Republicans. \nAnd I think it is supported by a number of Democrats who have supported \nline-item veto authority before, some of them former Governors, others \nwho believe that we could need some structural changes in the way that \nthis Congress operates. And we welcome and appreciate their support.\n  Members have been told, ``Just offer these amendments. If you do not \nlike something in a bill, offer an amendment.'' Senator McCain in \nparticular has gone to heroic lengths to scrutinize appropriations \nbills. But they always run up against budget points of order. They \nalways run up against reasons why it really cannot happen. Then the \naggregate, in the end, very little change is made and somehow these \nthings keep slipping through. Everybody scratches their head, and, \nsays, ``I don't know how that got in there. It is kind of embarrassing. \nBut I do not know how that got in there.''\n  For more than 100 years Members have been trying to strike \nunnecessary pork-barrel spending from appropriations, and the results \nare not all that good. In 1957 Congressman Stewart Udall said:\n\n       The tendency in Congress naturally is that the local \n     interest is predominant. Each of us have projects. We have \n     Federal programs we fell vital to our districts. In our \n     system of checks and balances, it seems to me a good argument \n     can be made that it is good and it is wise to have someone \n     outside the legislature, namely, the executive, also weigh \n     any particular proposal against the national interest, and I \n     think that is essentially what the line-item veto would do.\n\n  Mr. President, in 1957 this Nation ran a budget surplus of $3.4 \nbillion, and our country's debt at the time was $272 billion. The total \ndebt of our Nation accumulated in the first 181 years of our history \nwas approximately equal to this year's current operating deficit; 181 \nyears of effort, of spending the people's money by this legislature is \nequal today to 1 year of deficit spending.\n  In 1957 our Nation's books showed no red ink. Yet, even then Members \nof Congress were arguing for a change in the name of the national \ninterest and in the name of good government. Even when we did not have \na significant deficit, even when we were, the last time we operated at \na balanced budget on a current year, Members were arguing for a line-\nitem veto because they knew that it would stop a practice of, as Harry \nTruman said, ``blackmailing the President.''\n  Today however, the situation as we know has changed radically. The \nNation's total Federal debt has increased 1,665 percent; 1,665 percent \nto $4.8 trillion. Let us go back over that. One-hundred and eighty \nyears it took to get to $272 billion. That was in 1957. And since then \nit has increased. The debt has increased from $272 billion to $4.8 \ntrillion, a number I cannot begin to comprehend--1,665 percent \nincrease. Maybe this puts it in better perspective. We will borrow more \nin 4 days in 1995 than we borrowed in the entire year of 1958. We will \nborrow more in 4 days of this year, 1995, than we borrowed in the \nentire year of 1958. That is how far we have gone. The arguments of \n1957 still stand. Line-item veto helps balance the parochial interest \nwith the national interest. It enables the President to rationally deal \nwith omnibus spending bills. Nothing has changed but the urgency.\n  According to the CBO, failure to reverse current trends in fiscal \npolicy in the composition of the Federal spending will doom future \ngenerations--doom future generations. Every one of us knows that in our \nheart we will be dooming the future generations by what we are doing \nhere with the taxpayer dollars, and creating a debt which we will not \nbe able to pay as a Nation, which our children and grandchildren will \nnot be able to pay. They will not be able to buy a house at a \nreasonable interest rate. They will not be able to finance an education \nfor their children. We are dooming future generations.\n  That is the Congressional Budget Office conclusion. We will doom them \nto a stagnating standard of living, they said. We will damage U.S. \ncompetitiveness and influence in the world, and we will hamper our \nability to address pressing national trends. If there is time to do \nsomething, it is now, not next Congress, and not next century; now.\n  So when we proceed on this bill today at 5 o'clock, it will be the \nfirst time in the history of the U.S. Senate that the legislative line-\nitem veto will actually be considered as the freestanding bill in its \nown right.\n  Last November anger against this Congress burned white hot. With \ntheir votes the American people decisively demonstrated their deep \nfrustration with the status quo. Last week the U.S. Senate fueled that \nanger, and betrayed their trust 2 weeks ago by failing to pass a \nbalanced budget amendment. We demonstrated that we as an institution \nare more concerned with preserving our power than with protecting our \nNation's prosperity.\n  Let us show the American people that we are serious about changing \nthe way this Congress does business. Let us show them that we intend to \npresent appropriations bills without embarrassment. Let us send the \nmessage to taxpayers that under our guidance their dollars will not be \nwasted, and let us act to boldly eliminate the dual deficits of public \nfunds and of public trust. Let us resist the urge to continue business \nas usual. Let us finally pass the line-item veto.\n  Mr. President, the time is now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n   [[Page S4173]] Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to be heard on the line-item veto. \nBut just for a moment, I would like to observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Mack). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first, I want to thank several Senators for \ntheir tireless effort to put together a process whereby this line-item \nveto legislation could be considered by the Senate. Without the \ntenacity and the dedicated work and support of Senator Coats from \nIndiana, who has just been speaking, and Senator McCain of Arizona, the \nmoment for this consideration would never have occurred. I think they \ndeserve a lot of credit for pushing it through the years, many times as \namendments to other bills. They have seen their efforts meet with \ndefeat. But they continued to push for it because they know it is the \nright thing to do.\n  Also, I take note of the fact that they have worked with a number of \nother Senators to come up with a compromise that will be the basis for \nour consideration as the week goes forward. The majority leader, \nSenator Dole, has put a high priority on this legislation. He committed \nearly on that this would be on the Senate agenda early in the session. \nI think it is probably the fifth bill we have considered this year, and \nI think he certainly deserves credit for moving line-item veto to the \ntop of our priorities. Senators Domenici and Stevens have played \ndecisive roles in bringing us to the point where this legislation could \nbe laid down, so we could move forward on this important issue.\n  The quest for a line-item veto has been a 10-year quest. An idea so \nsimple has had a very complicated history; an idea so needed has been \nneedlessly blocked, in my opinion, by politics or by institutional \nconcerns which I do not think are well founded.\n  We hear from the opponents that there is a plan, perhaps, for a \nfilibuster against the compromise proposal that will be offered later \ntoday, sometime around 5 o'clock or later. We also hear from the other \nside that this may be opposed on a partisan basis, or that it is really \nnot needed by the people. I hope none of that will happen. We have had \ntoo much of that already this year. We have already had filibuster \nafter filibuster or slowdowns. We have had to go to cloture votes. This \nis an important substantive issue which should be debated fully, no \nquestion about that. But I hope we will not go to a filibuster. I hope \nwe will not get to accusations about the motives of Senators on both \nsides of this issue. It is an issue that the American people are \nfamiliar with. Basically, I think they understand it and support it. I \nthink we ought to go ahead and debate the merits and have a straight \nvote on the substance and not get into another protracted filibuster.\n  The line-item veto, as a matter of fact, has a history of bipartisan \nsupport. As my friend from Indiana, Senator Coats, pointed out, \nSenators Hollings, Bradley, and Biden have, in the past, offered bills \nsimilar to the compromise line-item veto proposal that we shall offer \nlater today. In fact, Senator Hollings has been very much involved in \nthis legislation in the past. Senator Bradley has, also.\n  In the past, Senators Exon, Graham of Florida, Kohl, Heflin, Simon, \nand Robb have all voted for a version of the line-item veto. The \ndistinguished minority leader, Senator Daschle, of South Dakota, has \nvoted for the line-item veto in the past. I assume he will vote for one \nin the next few days. He says he supports one version of the line-item \nveto. But it is a very, very, very weak approach, one that even \nPresident Clinton has said he could not support, because it would be \nvery difficult for the President--this President or future Presidents--\nto actually have their veto sustained, because in fact the Senate, by a \nsimple 51 vote or majority vote, could override that veto. At least, \nthat is as I understand the proposal that will be offered by the \nminority leader. So we will have to take a close look at that.\n  The line-item veto has not been just a Republican proposal. Senators \nof both parties, Presidents of both parties, who believe that we must \nrestore a constitutional balance and fiscal sanity, believe in giving \nthe President this line-item veto authority. That is why I hope we will \nmove quickly on this bill, with the least possible partisan bickering. \nWe need to allow the President --even a Democratic one--the ability to \nveto waste and pork or line items that have not been properly \nconsidered or sufficiently justified. We need to begin to get our debt, \nwhich now runs up to something like $13,000 for every man, woman, and \nchild in this country, under control. And it will continue to grow. As \nhas been stated today already, we are looking at a national debt of \nalmost $5 trillion. Where will it end?\n  I have been for this line-item veto as far back as the late 1970's, \nwhen President Carter was in office. I wanted to give him that \nauthority. I was for it during the Reagan-Bush years. I wanted them to \nhave that authority, and I am still for it. President Clinton has \nsupported it and wants to be involved in trying to get this legislation \npassed by the Senate. So it is bipartisan. It should be nonpartisan.\n  There have been differences of opinion, and different approaches have \nbeen offered in the past. But I think we have come to the point where \nwe have to quit arguing over the approaches and decide to go with one \nline-item veto or another, but it must be a real one, one that requires \na two-thirds vote for the Congress to override the President's action.\n  So we have before us one that will be offered this afternoon, a solid \nbill, one that has unity of purpose, to give this authority to the \nPresident. It points a way to a future of more controlled spending on \nthe Government's part. It will help us to begin to reduce the size of \nGovernment. It will not solve the deficit problem, but it can help. In \nfact, in discussing this matter with President Clinton, he said when he \nhad the legislative veto as the Governor of Arkansas, it was not that \nhe had to use it so much, it was just the mere presence, the mere \nexistence of that opportunity that provided a chilling effect on \nexcessive or wasteful spending.\n  Since we are talking about the future versus the past, let me say \nthat those who oppose the line-item veto, on the whole, in my opinion, \nreally are clinging to the past--the way it has been done over the \nyears here in the Congress. As a matter of fact, if you go back and \nlook at the history, Presidents all the way back to Thomas Jefferson \nhad ways, and, in fact, used different ways, to try to control \nGovernment spending. The tool used most often was impoundment.\n  So the Presidents had impoundment from Thomas Jefferson's days all \nthe way up to the 1970's when, during the Nixon administration, the \nCongress passed the Budget Impoundment Act of 1974. I voted for that \nact and sometimes I think maybe it was a mistake. When I first came to \nWashington as a young Congressman in 1973, I was amazed--having served \nas a staff member and then a Congressman--that really there was no \nprocess whereby the Congress looked at the budget. There was never any \nprocess where we racked up the revenues coming in and expenditures \ngoing out and added them up and admitted what the situation was, \nadmitted how much of a deficit we were creating each year and how much \nthat was adding to the national debt. There was no process to do that. \nI thought there should be a budget process in the Congress. So I \naccepted the Budget Impoundment Act of 1974, even though I was opposed \nto taking away the authority of Presidents to impound funds. I thought \nPresidents should have the authority to say, no, we should not spend \nthat, it is not the right way, or the times have changed, whatever; but \nthat authority was taken away. In its place we were giving to the \nPresident the ability to send up rescissions. But the truth of the \nmatter is that the Presidents' rescissions have not gotten much \nconsideration from the Congress. I will talk more about that in a \nmoment.\n  So, over the years, we have taken away the ability of the Presidents \nto really get involved in trying to control and limit or stop spending. \nSo if there \n [[Page S4174]] has been a shift in power in this area, it has been to \nthe Congress, away from the President. I tell people in my State of \nMississippi that Presidents do not even have the authority, are not \nrequired to, and do not sign budget resolutions, that they are out of \nthe budget process other than to send up a budget, and then the \nCongress sometimes considers it, sometimes throws it out in the street \nand ignores it, and Congress passes its budget resolution without the \nPresident being involved in having to sign a joint resolution on the \nbudget. I think the President should have that authority.\n  The President does have the authority to sign or veto appropriations \nbills en bloc. But he must sign it all, whole hog. He cannot say, ``We \nshouldn't spend in this area,'' or ``There is a problem in this area.'' \nHe has to sign it all or veto it all.\n  So Presidents over the years have lost a lot of their authority over \nhow the people's money is spent.\n  Now, I acknowledge under the Constitution the appropriations process \nrests in the Congress. We should originate the appropriations bills in \nthe House and vote on them in the Senate and we should have a very key \nrole. But I think it is important also that the President have a role.\n  Now, as a Member of Congress for the past 22 years, I have watched \nthe Congress on occasion try to control itself, control spending. But \nit never really has happened. Oh, occasionally we will rise up and cut \nspending a little bit. We did that in the 1980's. We saved a little in \nthe early 1980's. But then the temptation is too great to keep \nspending, more programs for everybody, more programs for everything, \nvery little consideration really being given to the taxpayers of \nAmerica.\n  And for those Americans that are preparing their income tax returns \nright now, I imagine they are pretty agitated, pretty angry, pretty \ndisgusted with the complicated forms, and taxes seem to be going up \nevery year to pay for a lot of wasteful spending and bureaucracy and \nregulations and waste and fraud.\n  We have to find a way to get a grip on it.\n  And there are those who will stand up, I am sure, in the next few \ndays or next couple of weeks and say, ``All Congress has to do is to do \nit. We do not need a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. We \ndon't need a line-item veto. All we need to do is do it.''\n  I agree. Let us do it. But for 22 years, I have watched the Congress \nnot do it. Congress cannot or has not controlled its insatiable \nappetite for spending the people's money. It is too easy to spend \nmoney. It is hard to control spending.\n  When we go home as Senators, we sometimes have conflicting messages \ngiven to us. Sometimes we want to please everybody. This applies to all \nof us; I do not exempt any of us; we all get involved in it. When we go \nhome, our constituents say to us, ``Control spending. You need to get \nthe deficit under control. What about the debt?''\n  And then, as we start out the door, they say, ``Oh, but don't cut Big \nBird. Don't cut the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.'' Or, ``Don't \ncut the farm subsidy.'' Or, ``Can you get us some more money for \nhighway construction, bridge construction, waterway projects, and \nFarmers Home Administration projects?''\n  And, by the time you get out the door, you have 17 requests sticking \nin your pockets for programs not to cut or places they want more money \nspent.\n  Now, you cannot have it both ways. We either are going to control \nGovernment spending or not.\n  Do the people really want the deficit brought under control or not? \nAre the people really worried about here and now, the present, their \nwants and desires, what they would like to have from the Federal \nGovernment, or does anybody worry about the debt that we are dumping \noff on our children and our grandchildren? When does fiscal \nresponsibility set in? It should set in now.\n  What we are talking about is change--changing the status quo. Are we \ngoing to continue the way Congress has done business for 40 years, or \nare we going to begin to get a grip on the size of the Federal \nGovernment, the waste in the Federal Government, controlling our \nspending appetite and, yes, allowing the President to be involved in \nthat process, also?\n  That is why we need this line-item veto. It will be one more \nmechanism, one more tool that can be used by Presidents to try to \ncontrol spending, not only in the appropriations area.\n  And I think the Appropriations Committee members are right. They are \nnot causing the major increases in spending and in the deficit every \nyear. So much of it is in the entitlement areas. So when it was \nsuggested by some of the Senators, in the compromise bill we are going \nto have offered later on today, that targeted entitlements ought to be \nincluded, I also said, ``I agree. Include everything. Anything that is \nspending.''\n  Any program that is targeted to a special interest or a small group \nof people or even one person or one corporation, give us, or the \nAmerican people, that one last avenue where it can be reviewed. Give \nthe President the line-item veto authority.\n  I trust the Presidents. At least, we know that it is that person who \nis the restraint of last resort. In the case of the Congress, quite \noften the people that are advocating programs are one of 535 people in \nthe House and the Senate. You cannot even get a grip on who really did \nit.\n  Somebody said, let us not shift this authority away from the Congress \nto the President. Well, as a matter of fact, it is not really the \nCongress. Out of 435 House Members, there might be 10 Congressmen that \nreally, really, know what is going in these appropriations bills or \nthese entitlement bills. In the Senate, maybe there is a half-dozen \nthat really knows what is in this appropriations bill or that \nappropriations bill, or what is in an entitlements package. So you are \nreally talking about giving the President of the United States one last \nopportunity to control the maneuvers of 18 or so Members of Congress. \nThat is what you are really talking about.\n  So I think the line-item veto, used to target wasteful spending, is \nthe wise thing to do. I am even willing to support a line-item veto \npower for an area that I refer to as the tax area.\n  Now, in Washington--and only in Washington--when the people get to \nkeep their money, their own money, the money they worked hard and \nearned, in Washington, that is called a tax expenditure. That is the \nGovernment spending money by letting the taxpayers keep their money. \nHow ridiculous can you get?\n  The man and woman out there working every day, 8, 10, 12 hours a day, \ntwo jobs, if they get to keep their money, in Washington, that is a tax \nexpenditure. Only in Washington can that happen.\n  But, a so-called tax expenditure or a tax cut can also be a special \ndeal. I have watched in wonderment in the past after we passed major \ntax bills, when I was in the House, the Ways and Means Committee would \nhave transition rules. I never quite figured out what that meant. But \nsooner or later, I figured out what it means is a lot of special deals \nfor a lot of Members of the House and particularly of the Ways and \nMeans Committee.\n  Every member of the Ways and Means Committee would get a little deal, \na little line item, a little insignificant thing, just a few hundred \nmillion here or maybe a billion there. And then it would come over to \nthe Senate. We would pass another tax bill. And then you would have the \ntransition rules and this member of the Finance Committee or that \nmember of the Finance Committee would get a special deal.\n  Maybe I am just mad because I never got one of those. But it puts a \nburden on me as a Senator looking out for my State. If I do not get \nsome of these special deals, my constituency maybe is left out and some \nother constituency in some other State gets a special deal.\n  But that is ridiculous. We should stop that kind of stuff. That is \nwhat leads to waste of the people's money, waste of the taxpayers' \ndollars.\n  And so if we can develop language that says, yes, in a narrow way, in \na targeted way, where there is a special deal for a limited number of \npeople or limited number of corporations, I am willing to look at that. \nLet the President look at that.\n  I mean he is not a czar. He is not some person off in some foreign \ncountry. We are talking about the President of our United States.\n   [[Page S4175]] I call the line-item veto accountability--\naccountability. Let us at least put the monkey on the President's back. \nLet him have the authority. And if he does not use it, then we know who \nto blame.\n  Now, you can hardly even find out who sponsored these transition \nrules. You cannot even dig around in a report and find out why this new \nFederal building is being built or who for. Let the President have this \nline-item veto authority. I think that it will begin to turn things \naround.\n  For the future, if we do not change our ways, it will be very bleak. \nHigher and higher deficits, less and less savings, bigger and bigger \nGovernment spending--these are what we have to look forward to without \nchange now.\n  And that is what the American people voted for in 1992 and in 1994. \nThey want change. Are they going to get it? Not unless there is a \nchange of attitude in this body.\n  We lost the balanced budget amendment by one vote. If any one of 34 \nSenators would have changed their vote, we would have added that to the \nConstitution or given the people a chance to vote on it to put it in \nthe Constitution through the ratification process.\n  And now the line-item veto. This would be a major step forward.\n  We have not let small differences of opinion block us from securing a \nbetter future. We should not let politics stand in the way of a better \nfiscal discipline in the future.\n  The forces of the past that are fighting with their last breath in \nthis city say that we are giving the President too much power if we \npass the line-item veto.\n  I just think that is wrong. The bill does not expand the power of the \nPresident. It allows the President to use the veto authority he already \nhas to pare out waste, pork, and abuse. Congress still has the power to \noverturn the President. If the President is truly wrong, the Congress \nwill overturn him.\n  Also, why be afraid of allowing this current President to use his \npower? We, on this side of the aisle--the Republicans--are ready to \ngive this authority to President Clinton so he can have the opportunity \nto pare spending. We believe the line-item veto wielded by any \nPresident is a way to limit Government.\n  People might say, well, maybe President Clinton just wants this \nspecial deal. Other Presidents might not have felt that way. Let me \njust read what some of the former Presidents have said, going all the \nway back--I mentioned Thomas Jefferson--but let me go back to Ulysses \nS. Grant. He urged the Congress to give him the line-item veto. He \nsaid, ``I will not complain about the extra workload.''\n  President Chester B. Arthur, after deprecating the practice of \ncombining appropriations for a great diversity of objects widely \nseparated in nature and locality in one river and harbor bill, \nPresident Arthur, in his second inaugural message to Congress on \nDecember 4, 1882, suggested that the Congress enact separate \nappropriations bills for each interim improvement, exactly what we are \ntalking about doing right here. He wanted that authority to line out \nsome of these projects that really were not justified.\n  President Franklin Roosevelt, in his budget message for fiscal year \n1939, pointed out the advantages of the line-item veto in the majority \nof our States and remarked that the system meets with great general \napproval in the many States which have adopted it. Forty-three State \nGovernors have this authority. Most of them have not abused it. And a \nlot of them do not use it very much.\n  Franklin Roosevelt supported this initiative. President Truman said, \n``One important lack in the Presidential veto power, I believe, is \nauthority to veto individual items in appropriations bills. The \nPresident must approve the bill in its entirety, or refuse to approve \nit, or let it become law without his approval.'' That is exactly what \nwe are talking about doing in the compromise legislation we will be \nconsidering later today.\n  President Eisenhower backed a line-item veto. And the list goes on. \nThe Presidents have all recognized the great need for this authority. \nThere have been many complaints in recent history, back in the 1960's, \n1970's, about the Imperial Presidency, but not enough about the \nspendthrift Congress.\n  If Congress alone could control our spending habits and cut out pork, \nwe would not have the deficit we have today. But we have it.\n  The line-item veto puts Congress on notice that every Government \nprogram and policy will be under scrutiny. Spending and tax policy will \nno longer be done in the dark. I could talk for a long time about how \nthat happens in some of our conferences that occur between the House \nand the Senate. The forces of the past say line-item veto will not \nsolve the deficit. I say the line-item veto is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  As the saying goes, it might just save $100 million there, or a few \nmillion there, or maybe $100 million there. Sooner or later, it adds up \nto real money. But it is a start, and it will help put such a chill on \na lot of useless spending that the President would never even have to \nuse the line-item veto.\n  Surely, a nation cannot spend without bounds forever. Surely, a \ncountry cannot rob from its children always. Surely, a government can \nchange its ways. The line-item veto is part of a comprehensive \nstrategy, including the balanced budget amendment, to limit the growth \nof Government. That is what we are talking about doing here today with \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, as the debate goes forward, I am going to talk more \nabout the specifics of how we will have separate enrollment in the \nlegislation we will be considering. I will talk more about the \nconstitutional questions that have been raised about this legislation. \nI think that will be a very important discussion.\n  I am satisfied that what we have proposed today, what will be laid \ndown this afternoon, is constitutional and we will debate that at great \nlength.\n  Just one final point before I yield, because I see there is at least \none other Senator waiting to speak. It has been maintained over the \nyears that the President has the rescission authority, but it is just \nthat they have not used it that much, or maybe the Congress just has a \nlittle different idea of how it ought to be used.\n  As a matter of fact, I remember when I was in the House one time, the \nPresident sent up--I guess this was during the Bush administration--\nsent up a couple billion dollars in rescissions. The distinguished \nRepublican leader in the House at the time, Bob Michel, called in his \nappropriators, the college of cardinals, who sat around the table and \nsaid: We have a couple of billion of rescissions from the President. \nCan we go forward with those? Can we have these savings? The college of \ncardinals went away and they came back and said, ``Well, we think maybe \nwe could get about $69 million out of $2 billion.''\n  What happened in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994? Congress enacted \nrescissions, but also replied to new spending. So it is the same old \ndeal. Even if the President tries to save a little money, Congress \nsays, ``Voila, a little more money. We can spend that.''\n  Mr. President, I am glad we have come to this point. I hope my \ncolleagues will really look seriously at this line-item veto. Let \nMembers make it bipartisan. Let Members have it supported by the \nCongress and by the President. The House of Representatives has already \ndone its job. The President, a Democrat, agrees with the Republican \nHouse. Now it is in the hands of the Senate.\n  We will make the decision on the line-item veto. I maintain that this \ndecision is a lot bigger than just this one item of the line-item veto. \nThe bigger issue is whether or not we really have any desire to control \nspending. If we do, we will adopt this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, under the unanimous-consent agreement, it \nis my understanding that time is to be allocated between the two \nmanagers of the bill. I would like to ask the Chair what the current \ntime situation is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans control an hour and the \nDemocrats control approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I might just note to my colleagues that we \nare getting kind a time imbalance situation here. It is our thought the \ntime would be allocated back and forth, and we would be roughly equal \nwhen we moved to the hour of 5 o'clock. That is not happening.\n   [[Page S4176]] I had a number of speakers for the proponents of \nline-item veto that wished to speak. I am concerned about the \nallocation of time and not having an opportunity to speak. I would just \nstate to my colleagues that those who are interested in speaking today, \nif they could notify me, we will try to ensure that they have the \nopportunity to speak. Those who are speaking in opposition to this, \nthis is a good time to come to the floor in order to state their \nopposition.\n  Otherwise, we may be in a situation where we have a lot more speakers \nfor a line-item veto than against a line-item veto, and run out of time \nfor those who are for, unless the minority is willing to yield some of \ntheir time, which they generously did on Friday. I just give that \nnotice to my fellow Senators.\n  I would now like to yield whatever time he may consume to the Senator \nfrom Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to have an opportunity \nto speak today on behalf of the line-item veto. As I have said many \ntimes over the course of the last several months, a balanced budget is \nan aspiration or a goal. It is like saying that we intend to live \nwithin our means. The question then becomes how do we move from an \naspiration to the actual achievement of our goal? One of the ways is to \nhave the right tools. The line-item veto is just that.\n  I was very interested in the comments offered by the Senator from \nIndiana, Senator Coats, earlier in the day. He was talking about \nspecial interests and their impact on the appropriations process. \nOften, a number of special projects are inserted to benefit specific \ndistricts or States. Then, when either the Senate or the President acts \non the bill, there is no real opportunity to knock these things out \nbecause they are voted on as a group. As a result, we end up spending a \nlot of money that we would not spend if each of these items were to be \nheld up individually to the light of day.\n  I think this is a critically important point. We should understand \nthat there is a difference between the national interest and the \nspecial interest; for example, it could be in the interest of an \nindividual State to get several transportation projects from the \nFederal Government. However, this allocation of funds, while in the \ninterest of the State, might not to be in the best interest of the \nNation.\n  All too frequently, Members who are elected to represent the State \ninterest or the interest of a specific district are willing to \nparticipate in putting these projects into legislation. Consequently, \nit is important to look at one person alone who is endowed with the \nability to protect the national interest, the President of the United \nStates. He is the only individual who is elected by citizens from every \nState and territory in the Republic.\n  So it is appropriate, then, that the President be given the tool with \nwhich to protect the national interest. I think the President needs \nthat tool. Every President this century, with the exception of one, has \nasked for it. They have asked for it even in times when we were not \nfacing the overwhelming deficits we are facing now.\n  If it is not good for America, in the long run, it cannot be good for \nour States. I think people all across America have finally decided they \ndo not want any more special favors for their locality if it means that \nthe United States as a whole will suffer. It is kind of like racing \nhome to a different room in a big house and putting more and more rich \ngoods and furniture into the room and not attending to the maintenance \nof the entire house.\n  I think we have come to the conclusion that if we do not protect the \nstructural integrity of our house, it will not matter how many benefits \nwe drag home to our room. For if the house falls down, those things \nwhich we think we are enjoying will be of little value.\n  Incidentally, the figures on the debt continue to rise. The end of \nthe debate over the balanced budget did not end the increase in the \ndebt of the United States. Every 4 days we increase the debt as much as \nwe did in the entire year of 1958. That is how headlong we are racing \ninto debt--$4,815,827,000,000 of debt, and we are moving, according to \nthe President's projected budgets over the next couple years, to a $6-\ntrillion-dollar-plus debt by the year 2000.\n  One of the things that was of interest to me in the last several \nweeks was the way in which the world markets responded to our failure \nto pass the balanced budget amendment. There was a crisis in confidence \nabout the value of the dollar, and no matter to whom you talked, no \nmatter which economist you interviewed, they all indicated there was a \nsubstantial impact of a loss of confidence that flowed from the failure \nof the U.S. Senate to pass the balanced budget amendment. One of the \nways the world markets reflect disenchantment is to devalue our \ncurrency. They just will not pay as much for a dollar as they once did. \nAnother way is that those who finance U.S. debt will be less likely to \nhold it.\n  What happens if the interest rate on our debt goes up? If interest \nrates go up by one-one hundredth of 1 percent--this is known as a basis \npoint in the financial industry--that is $350 million a year. If \ninterest rates go up by 1 percent it will cost the United States of \nAmerica $35 billion in additional interest.\n  So what we do here does make a difference. It makes a substantial \ndifference. It is time for us to enact the line-item veto so that we \ncan put a tool in the hand of the President of the United States to \nhelp him manage, in the national interest, the expenditure of the \nresources that the people of this great country provide as a basis for \nour conduct of government.\n  Some people try to estimate how much the President would be able to \ncut out of the budget. I believe almost all of the estimates about how \nmuch the President would cut underestimate the real impact of the line-\nitem veto. Because many of the projects which have been tucked away in \nappropriations bills are so embarrassing and self-serving, I do not \nbelieve any Senator would ever want to add them in the first place if \nthey thought they would come back for individual inspection. So, as a \nresult, I believe there would be a tremendous chilling effect on \nspending.\n  President Truman, who hailed from my home State of Missouri--and, of \ncourse, I hailed from his home State--said that there was a great deal \nof legislative blackmail that went on in bills that needed to be \nsigned. That is part of this culture of spending which is, in my \njudgment, a detriment to this country. It is not good for America. It \nis not good for our individual jurisdictions, and we must reject it.\n  I have said in the past, and I would like to say again, that the \npeople of this country all operate with the line-item veto. Every \nkitchen table in America has one. You sit down at the kitchen table, \nand you put your budget together. You talk with the family about what \nyou can afford and what you cannot afford.\n  The average family that sits down at the kitchen table engages in \nwhat I call kitchen table budgeting, and they do so in a way which \nprovides balance, as well as a set of spending priorities. I preformed \nthis same function not only as the head of my household, but also as \nGovernor of the State of Missouri. I can remember in every year having \nto knock out some expenditures, one year for staff expenses at the \npublic defender's office. We wanted to have the defense that was \nappropriate in our public defender's operations, but we had to cut a \ncouple hundred thousand dollars there. We simply had to draw the line \nthrough the increase.\n  I remember one year when some folks who were powerful politically \nwanted to have $15,000--just $15,000--to restore and repair a cemetery. \nIt was not a public cemetery. It was not a State cemetery. It was not \non State land. They thought they just might be able to talk their way \nthrough the legislature with it, and, sure enough, they did. But as a \nGovernor I had the opportunity to draw a line through it and to send it \nback.\n  There were other worthy things that had to be eliminated or reduced. \nThe lawyers of the State were building a new law school when I was \nGovernor, and I had a rule that I expected the institutions to come up \nwith 20 percent of the funds for capital projects. I thought, if we \nwere helping people with their education, some of these well-to- \n [[Page S4177]] do lawyers could chip in and help build the new law \nschool.\n  They got through the general assembly a full appropriation so that \nthey would not, these lawyers, these poor lawyers who were strapped for \nfunds, have to provide 20 percent of the funding. But I had to draw a \nline through those extra funds and knock it back to 80 percent. In the \nend, they came up with the resources, and we have a great new facility \nat one of the finest law schools in the country. The reason we did, \nthough, is that we have the kind of financial integrity that would \nprotect us in the long run. The Governor of the State has the \nresponsibility to keep spending in line. Mr. President, 43 Governors \ndo. I did not do anything special as Governor of the State of Missouri. \nIt is common for Governors to do that. And just as Governors do it, we \ndo it around our kitchen tables.\n  I have put together a chart here representing a budget for a normal \nfamily of four, a family that earns about $35,000 a year, monthly \nincome of $2,900.\n  The first thing you have to pay is your Federal income taxes. And if \nyou take this $670 and you subtract it from the $2,990, you get down to \n$2,320 for the month. You move down to food, subtract it, and you have \n$1,870. Then, you need to make your car payment. You subtract the $300 \nfrom the $1,870, and you come to $1,570.\n  You have a Super Nintendo that the kids are screaming for. That is \nanother $100. That would take you to $1,470. And clothing of 200 bucks \nto get the kids ready for summer. That takes you from $1,470 to $1,270.\n  Utilities are a must. That is $150 from $1,270 to $1,120. And then \nFreddy needs braces, and that is $150 a month, which takes you from \n$1,120 to $970; eliminating the trip to Disney World takes you to $820. \nAnd rent--you do not want to fail to pay the rent--$210. Car and \nproperty insurance, another $110. Wait a second. I see I have run out \nof money before I have reached the end of my list.\n  When you run out of money before you get to the end of your list, \nwhat you have to do is start to set priorities. You have to have a \nline-item veto or you go into debt. What are we going to do? Are we \ngoing to pay the interest on the credit card? We better. Are we going \nto continue to have a telephone? Well, that is probably a necessity in \ntoday's society.\n  How do you handle it, when you come down here and you are only a \nthird or two-thirds of the way through the list and you run out of \nmoney? Simply put, you make some adjustments in what you spend. You \nimplement what I call the line-item veto.\n  This is the way we handle it at our house. You know, we are $320 \nshort here at the end of the chart. We are going to have to make that \nup. If we knock out cable TV at $40 that will move us closer to our \ngoal. Unfortunately, we're not quite there. Perhaps you could knock out \nthis trip to Disney World; that would save you $150 a month over the \ntwelve months in which you would save for the trip. Suddenly, we are \n$190. We still, however, need $130 more.\n  Wait a second, Super Nintendo, you could remove that from the list of \nexpenditures. Now you are at $290. You still need another $30. You \ncould eliminate the swimming lessons at $30. That would get you to $0. \nOr, alternatively, you could reduce your general entertainment funding \nfrom $100 down to $70, score the swimming lessons as a form of \nentertainment, and still get to $0. Mr. President, this is the way the \naverage family does it. You simply sit down, total up your resources, \nand then ensure that you don't subtract more from your resources than \nyou actually have.\n  This is what proponents of the line-item veto want for the President. \nI want to put this big, black Magic Marker in the hands of the \nPresident. I trust him enough to say, ``President Clinton, you take the \nline-item veto and mark off the things that we can't afford. You mark \nout the provincial, you mark out the parochial, you mark out the \ntargeted spending that does nothing to help America. Then, you send it \nback here and force two-thirds of the Senate to vote to restore the \nindividual appropriations.\n  Mr. President, I believe it can work, and it is critically important \nthat it does work. Because the debt of this country is being displaced \non to the next generation. It is one of the truly tragic and unreported \ntragedy of our times. We need someone with the authority and the \nresponsibility to draw a line through the Super Nintendos, through the \nthings we do not fundamentally need and save this country for the next \ngeneration.\n  We are $4.8 trillion in debt and the yet-unearned wages of the next \ngeneration are calling out for management, calling out for fiscal \nrestraint, calling out for fiscal responsibility. We cannot allow \nourselves to continually be the subject of the legislative blackmail of \nwhich Harry Truman spoke. We should give the President the authority to \ndo in the Oval Office what every family does at the kitchen table.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on the subject of a line-item veto, let \nme say that I want to join with those who believe that we should fix \nresponsibility. Specifically, we have been trying over many years to do \njust that. Back in 1990, we reported out of the Budget Committee, by a \nbipartisan vote of 13 to 6, S. 3181, my separate enrollment line-item \nveto bill. Unfortunately, we were never able to see it enacted. I \njoined later with the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Senator \nBradley in extending this mechanism to wasteful tax expenditures as \nwell as appropriations. We had a 53 Senators support us in 1993, but \nbudget rules at the time would have required 60 votes.\n  I say fix the responsibility in the sense of fixing it to a single \nMember of not only 100 here, but 435 on the other side of the Capitol; \none in 535. I can put an amendment to any particular measure and, if I \nget a majority vote, it passes. I think the President of the United \nStates ought to be able to put up an amendment, so to speak, with \nrespect to the denial of a particular item and get a vote; namely, two-\nthirds to override what he may have disapproved of.\n  So often, the President will come, as President Reagan did during his \n8 years in office, with a big stack of books and papers. He would say, \n``Now look. Congress has given this to me at 12 o'clock last night, and \nI had to either sign it immediately or close down the Government the \nnext day.''\n  If my memory serves correctly, President Reagan vetoed only one \nspending measure at the very beginning of his first term. Thereafter, \nthere was almost a working agreement between the Congress and the \nPresident of what was veto bait and what would be approved by the \nPresident. In conference, the conferees would say, ``We will have to \nleave these things off.'' As a result, there was a sort of comity \nbetween the White House and the Congress that those vetoes were not \nnecessary.\n  I suspect the case was much the same with President Bush. However, I \nshould note that in his 4-year period, our past President never vetoed \none red cent of spending. He never vetoed a spending bill.\n  So it was not really a thing that was causing so much a culture of \ncostliness, as my distinguished friend from Missouri was previously \nreferring to, but in the public's mind, there was a cynical game being \nplayed in which neither the President nor the Congress was willing to \naccept responsibility for spending money on certain programs.\n  Mr. President, I used the line-item veto 35 years ago as Governor of \nSouth Carolina. It was very, very helpful to this particular Governor, \nat that time receiving a AAA credit rating, which I am sorry to observe \nat this particular time has been lost. But this Governor was the first \nsouthern Governor from Texas up through Maryland to get a AAA credit \nrating. I was proud of that. I could talk to my colleagues. I had the \nvetoes and used them to help balance the budget.\n  But without a line-item veto, we are treated to spectacles similar to \nthe flap over Lawrence Welk's home that occurred a few years ago. If I \nremember correctly, the distinguished former \n [[Page S4178]] Senator from North Dakota, Senator Burdick, did not \neven realize that someone had stuck in money for Lawrence Welk's home. \nThat was an embarrassment to both Houses of Congress, all the \nCongressmen and all the Senators.\n  A line-item veto not only fixes responsibility but, more than \nanything else, saves the body from the embarrassment and the charge \nthat we are willy-nilly passing pork-barrel projects.\n  Now, with respect to the relinquishment of power, as the old saying \ngoes down in my backyard, ``I studied my humility under the mental \nrules.'' You do not have to worry about the power of the Senator. In \nthis day and age we have Senators who not only hold up the President \nbut who hold up the whole Congress as well. You are not lacking power. \nIf a Senator wants to put in Lawrence Welk's home, and he does not like \nthe idea that the home has been vetoed by the President, he has plenty \nof opportunity to speak extensively if he pleases. But in the light of \nour fiscal dilemma, the present gamesmanship has to stop. I think it is \nunforgivable that we engage really in the procedures in the process \nrather than the substance.\n  I remember my distinguished friend, the chairman of the House Budget \nCommittee, said on December 18 on ``Meet the Press'' that he was coming \nin January with all of the spending cuts before they came with the tax \ncuts, and that he had three budgets and did not have to wait on the \nPresident's budget. He said that we would start moving immediately in \nJanuary. Of course, the House passed the tax cuts, and are yet to pass \nspecific spending cuts.\n  It is now getting toward the end of March and the Budget Committee \nhas yet to meet to start marking up a budget. They tell us it will be \nsometime in May before we even begin. Mr. President, I hope the Record \nwill reflect that at least this Senator thinks we ought to be getting \nto the substance.\n  If I could digress for a moment back to the debate on the balanced \nbudget amendment, I would like to refer one more time to section 13301 \nof the Budget Enforcement Act, wherein a line says: Thou shalt not use \nthe Social Security trust funds in any calculation of budget deficits.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this particular point to have printed in \nthe Record the vote at that time, on October 18, 1990, where we got a \nvote of 98 to 2 in favor of section 13301.\n  There being no objection, the vote was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                           [Rollcall No. 283]\n\n\n                               yeas (98)\n\n                         Democrats (55 or 100%)\n\n     Adams\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bentsen\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boren\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burdick\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Cranston\n     Daschle\n     DeConcini\n     Dixon\n     Dodd\n     Exon\n     Ford\n     Fowler\n     Glenn\n     Gore\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Metzenbaum\n     Mikulski\n     Mitchell\n     Moynihan\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Riegle\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanford\n     Sarbanes\n     Sasser\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Wirth\n\n                        Republicans (43 or 96%)\n\n     Bond\n     Boschwitz\n     Burns\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     D'Amato\n     Danforth\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Durenberger\n     Garn\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heinz\n     Helms\n     Humphrey\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kasten\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McClure\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Rudman\n     Simpson\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Symms\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wilson\n\n\n                                nays (2)\n\n                          Democrats (0 or 0%)\n\n                         Republicans (2 or 4%)\n\n     Armstrong\n     Wallop\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that an \narticle entitled ``Impact: Stop Playing Games With Social Security'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the State, Columbia, SC, Mar. 12, 1995]\n\n            Impact: Stop Playing Games With Social Security\n\n                      (By Senator Fritz Hollings)\n\n       ``Nobody, Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal, \n     moderate, is even thinking about using Social Security to \n     balance the budget.''--Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., ``Face the \n     Nation,'' Feb. 2\n       In the recent weeks of floor debate and television \n     interviews, many senators repeatedly pledged not to use \n     Social Security funds to balance the budget.\n       They even passed an amendment by Senate Majority Leader Bob \n     Dole to instruct the Budget Committee to develop a budget \n     that didn't use Social Security funds but would conform with \n     the constitutional balanced-budget amendment.\n       In the meantime, while Dole was struggling to pick up one \n     vote to pass the amendment, five Democrats vowed they were \n     ready, willing and able to vote for Social Security. In fact, \n     the night before the vote, the five sent Dole a letter of \n     commitment to vote for the amendment if Social Security were \n     protected.\n       On March 2, the constitutional amendment failed by one \n     vote. And over that weekend on ``Face the Nation,'' Dole \n     again reaffirmed his intent on Social Security when he said \n     ``We are going to protect Social Security.''\n       If he remains that committed, why did he refuse to put his \n     word on the line in black and white on March 2 and pass a \n     constitutional amendment by at least 70 votes? Because he \n     knew that accepting the five Democratic votes would have cost \n     him an equal number of votes of Republicans determined to \n     spend Social Security surpluses on the deficit.\n       Dole didn't want to expose his Republican troops or expose \n     the truth. While Republican rhetoric pledged to protect \n     Social Security, Sen. Pete Domenici, chairman of the Budget \n     Committee, and other Republicans were telling Dole that the \n     budget could not be balanced without using Social Security \n     surplus funds.\n       All of this word-batting--of saying one thing in public and \n     trying to work around it in private--has led Americans to \n     believe that there is a free lunch, that all we have to do to \n     eliminate the deficit is to cut spending. The vote on Social \n     Security exposes this myth.\n       Republican senators have no real intent on eliminating the \n     deficit; they just want to move it from the federal \n     government to Social Security.\n       Currently, Section 13.301 of the Budget Enforcement Act \n     prohibits the use of Social Security funds for the deficit. \n     But part of the balanced-budget amendment would repeal \n     current law.\n       Even with all the promises tendered to correct Social \n     Security with future legislation, any civics student knows \n     you can't amend the Constitution with legislation. That's why \n     the five Democrats--me included--insisted on including Social \n     Security protection in the wording of the constitutional \n     amendment.\n       Dole's stonewalling against our five votes on the \n     constitutional amendment reveals another harsh truth: $18 \n     trillion in spending cuts is necessary to balance the budget \n     in seven years. But many senators reveal their intent to use \n     Social Security surpluses when they state that only $1.2 \n     trillion is necessary. Let face realities:\n       There won't be enough cuts in entitlements. A jobs program \n     for welfare reform will cost. Savings here are questionable.\n       You can and should save some on health reform, but slowing \n     the growth of health costs from 10 percent to 5 percent still \n     means increased costs. Social Security won't be cut, and any \n     savings by increasing the age of retirement would be \n     allocated to the trust fund, not the deficit.\n       Both the GOP's ``Contract with America'' and President \n     Clinton have called for increases in defense spending. \n     Result: No savings.\n       Therefore, savings must come from spending freezes and cuts \n     in the domestic discretionary budget.\n       Coupling these cuts and freezes with a closing of tax \n     loopholes still isn't enough to meet the target of a balanced \n     budget in seven years. That's why Domenici has determined \n     that Social Security funds will have to be used.\n       But using Social Security won't eliminate the deficit. It \n     simply would increase the amount we owe Social Security. \n     Already we owe $470 billion to the trust fund. If we keep \n     raiding it, the government will owe Social Security more than \n     $1 trillion by 2002.\n      Harsh realities. But there's a fifth and even harsher \n      [[Page S4179]] reality. All of the spending cuts in the \n     world aren't politically attainable now. Domenici knows it's \n     hard to get votes for enough cuts. To his credit, he tried in \n     1986 with a long list of cuts by President Reagan and the \n     Grace Commission. But he got only 14 votes in the Senate.\n       Rep. Gerald Solomon, a New York Republican, also tried a \n     list of $1 trillion in cuts just a year ago in the House. He \n     got only 73 votes of 435.\n       In addition, the problem of balancing the budget with \n     spending reductions is exacerbated by the ``Contract with \n     America's'' call for a $500 billion tax cut.\n       The reality today is that a combination of cuts, freezes, \n     loophole closings and tax increases must be cobbled together \n     to put us on a glide path to balancing the budget. Now is the \n     time to stop the finger-pointing, the blaming of the other \n     guy. Now is the time to stop dancing around the fire of \n     changes in the process.\n       It's a pure sham to think that constitutional balanced-\n     budget amendment will give Congress discipline.\n       It you put a gun to the head of Congress, it will get more \n     creative. The proof is in the pudding that's being cooked all \n     over town.\n       Some tout abolishing departments like Commerce and \n     Education. But their functions would continue somewhere. \n     Others say send everything back to the states. But that way, \n     the states would pick up deficits instead of the federal \n     government.\n       Of course we know some want to use $636 billion in Social \n     Security funds. And there's talk of picking up $150 billion \n     by recomputing the Consumer Price Index and another $150 \n     billion by re-estimating the growth of Medicare and Medicaid.\n       There are even those who want one-time savings, like \n     selling the electric power grid or switching to the capital \n     budget system.\n       In other words, there are people throughout town who are \n     figuring out ways to make the federal budget appear balanced \n     with hardly any cuts. With a balanced-budget amendment, they \n     would be able to play this game for seven years.\n       Time out!\n       The gamesmanship, the charade, must stop. If this nonsense \n     goes on for seven years, the United States will be down the \n     tubes.\n       For all the talk about eliminating the deficit, the debt \n     snowballs. Why? Because we add $1 billion a day to the debt \n     by borrowing to pay interest.\n       In January and throughout February, I offered 110 spending \n     cuts or eliminations from domestic discretionary spending. \n     This was worth $37 billion in the first year and put deficit \n     reduction on the glide path toward a balanced budget by 2002.\n       But even if these politically impossible cuts were agreed \n     upon, the interest cost on the debt is growing at more than \n     $40 billion a year.\n       The United States is in a downward budget spiral and we are \n     meeting ourselves coming around the corner. Like the Queen in \n     ``Alice in Wonderland'' told Alice: ``It takes all the \n     running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to \n     get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as \n     that!''\n       Let's get past all the shenanigans. Let's include Social \n     Security protection in the balanced-budget amendment. Then we \n     could pass the amendment and get down to the hard work of \n     balancing the budget.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the point of this particular article, of \ncourse, is in responding to the statement of the distinguished majority \nleader that we will call up the balanced budget amendment later this \nyear. What the article plainly outlines it that we can call up the \nbalanced budget amendment this afternoon and immediately pick up five \nvotes if they only put in black and white what they say verbally. They \nsay time and time again that ``We are not going to use Social Security \nfunds.'' In fact, after the particular vote, the distinguished majority \nleader, on ``Face the Nation,'' said, ``We are not going to use Social \nSecurity funds.'' All we are asking for is to put that rhetoric into \nconstitutional language.\n  When Members on the other side of the aisle get into these demeaning \nantics of holding up signs depicting Senators as ``Wanted,'' like a \nrogue's gallery for flip-flopping, that, of course, is a double-edged \nsword. Maybe we should go out in front of the Capitol and get the \npictures of the leaders on the other side who voted for the Hollings-\nHeinz amendment in 1990 and who now have flip-flopped.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude this afternoon with a comment about a \nparticular article. I ask unanimous consent that this article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From the State, July 1991]\n\n                  Line-Item Veto Can Cut the Nonsense\n\n                        (By Ernest F. Hollings)\n\n       Taxpayers are fed up with spending bills that are chock-\n     full of baubles for the folks back home.\n       In one widely publicized line-item caper, the 1991 \n     agriculture (agricultural) appropriations bill earmarked \n     $500,000 to spruce up Lawrence Welk's birthplace in \n     Strasburg, N.D. Now we all know that, in Washington terms \n     $500,000 isn't ``real money,'' but thousands and thousands of \n     these little line-item outrages add up to real money indeed. \n     Budget Director Dick Darman now says that the 1991 federal \n     deficit will top $280 billion--a new record--with next year's \n     deficit skyrocketing to $348 billion. These mega-deficits--\n     and the nearly $380 billion in interest we pay annually on \n     the national debt--constitute the worst case of waste, fraud \n     and abuse in government today.\n       Right now, the burden of budget cutting is almost \n     exclusively in the hands of Congress, and--no surprise--this \n     one-sided arrangement just isn't working. Telling Congress to \n     cut out the pork is like telling Liz Taylor she can't have \n     any more husbands.\n       The line-item veto would give the President a cleaver and \n     oblige him to join the fray as a more active player in the \n     fight against waste. If he's politically courageous and puts \n     his veto where his mouth is, then those annual deficit totals \n     will start heading south instead of north.\n       Certainly, the line-item veto has worked superbly in South \n     Carolina, as well as in the other 42 states that have it. \n     During my term as Governor, I repeatedly used the line-item \n     veto to eliminate millions of dollars in unnecessary \n     spending. In the process, I was\n      able to balance four state budgets and win the first AAA \n     credit rating of any Southern state.\n       In contrast, the Washington budget process relegates the \n     executive to the sidelines. After the President submits his \n     budget proposal in January, he--along with members of his \n     party in Congress--can effectively wash his hands of the \n     messy business of actually writing a budget. He doesn't have \n     to cooperate in the drafting of bills, and the President can \n     even disclaim responsibility for the bills he signs into law.\n       Accordingly, we are subjected to the showmanship made \n     famous by President Reagan: With TV cameras rolling, the \n     President holds up the massive text of an appropriations \n     bill, feigns disgust at all the wasteful spending larded into \n     its thousands of line items, then signs the bill under mock \n     protest, claiming that the devil--i.e., Congress--made him do \n     it.\n       And who can blame him? As it now stands, the President has \n     only two options: He can sign an appropriations bill, or, if \n     he objects to one or more specific line item provisions, he \n     can veto the bill in its entirety. My line-item veto bill \n     would give the President a vital third option; to veto \n     wasteful specifics in an appropriations bill while signing \n     into law the overall measure.\n       Opponents of my bill invoke high-falutin constitutional \n     arguments; they claim that a Presidential line-item veto will \n     skew power toward the executive branch. But these critics \n     simply miss the point. The point of the line-item veto is to \n     eliminate waste and get a handle on the deficits. Given the \n     magnitude of our budget crisis, it is grossly self-indulgent \n     to make a fetish out of legislative prerogatives. The issue \n     here is not the separation of powers; the issue is Congress \n     and the White House sharing co-responsibility and co-\n     accountability for paying the bills.\n       The line-item veto has another purpose, too: To restore the \n     credibility of our government in Washington. Congress' \n     reputation as an institution suffers the death of a thousand \n     blows as these line-item excesses are made public on the \n     evening news.\n       My line-item veto bill has passed in the Budget Committee \n     with a 13-6 majority. But, realistically--with so many \n     senators of both parties jealous to protect their personal \n     and institutional prerogatives--it will be an uphill fight on \n     the Senate floor.\n       This opposition is misguided. With the budget ox in the \n     ditch, it is silly to squabble over whether Congress or the \n     White House will hoist him out. Clearly, it's a job we must \n     do together--urgently.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. This article is entitled ``Line-Item Veto Can Cut the \nNonsense.'' We put this article in our own hometown newspapers back in \nJuly 1991. We have been working many years now to get a line-item veto. \nI have used it, and 43 Governors use it today.\n  I commend the leadership on the other side of the aisle for bringing \nthis matter to the attention of our colleagues. As I understand it, \nwhen the Republican leadership presents their so-called compromise at 5 \np.m. today, they will put before the body legislation that includes the \nseparate enrollment mechanism that I have long championed. You should \nnot be misled by this political rhubarb about 2,000 items and 2,000 \nvetoes. That has not been the experience of any Governor, and it is not \ngoing to be the experience of the National Government.\n  The fact of the matter is that Prof. Laurence Tribe of Harvard gave \nto our good colleague, Senator Bradley from New Jersey, a letter \nsupporting the constitutionality of the separate enrollment mechanism.\n  I know the chairman of our Budget Committee, Senator Domenici of New \nMexico, has been trying hard to get a line-item veto of some ilk or \ncharacter \n [[Page S4180]] into the hands of the House and to pass the U.S. \nSenate. If the compromise is based on the separate enrollment approach, \nthen bless them all, because that is exactly what we voted out of the \nBudget Committee, Republicans and Democrats, 5 years ago. That is what \n53 Senators including Senator Bradley and myself voted for on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate. That is what stands constitutional muster. It \nallows the President to use his existing constitutional authority to \napprove or disapprove; and upon disapproval by veto, a two-thirds vote \nis required of both Houses to override.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as we all know, a couple weeks ago, we lost \nthe balanced budget amendment by one vote. We turned back the tide of \nchange that was pushed forward by the people of this country in the \nlast election. That vote truly prevented us from changing the economic \ncourse of this entire Nation. Fortunately, and hopefully, we will have \nanother vote on that issue at some point in the future. But, until that \ntime, we have a moral obligation and, I believe, an economic \nresponsibility, to continue the fight against increased deficits and a \nballooning national debt.\n  We in the Senate must take up that fight because it is obvious that \nthe President and his administration have abdicated all fiscal \nresponsibility and interest in ending the economic status quo. We just \nhave to look at the latest budget proposal offered by the \nadministration for fiscal year 1996. We still have $200 billion in \nannual deficits. We cannot allow them to be acceptable commodities for \nthe future. We have a $4.8 trillion debt and we can expect, with the \nadministration's projected budget for the next few years, that the \nbudgets will add another $1.3 or $1.5 trillion in addition to the \nnational debt. We have $200 billion currently in interest payments each \nyear. That certainly is something that needs to be addressed.\n  If you look at the President's budget estimates and what has been \nreestimated by the Congressional Budget Office, it is interesting, in \nthe March 8 CBO report, they reestimated the administration's deficits, \nbecause they were underestimated, over the next 5 years, by between $14 \nto $82 billion, for a total of $209 billion. In 1996, they \nunderestimate the deficit by $14 billion; in 1997, by $18 billion; in \n1998, $34.6 billion; in 1999, $58.6 billion; in 2000, $81.6 billion.\n  That is what we are addressing over the next few years. So while we \nhave lost the balanced budget amendment--at least for the time being--I \nhope then that we can consider and pass the line-item veto.\n  The line-item veto is an idea whose time has come. In reality, the \nline-item veto is an idea whose time came, went, and now has come back. \nIn 1974, the Congress passed the Impoundment Control Act which, among \nother things, stripped the President of the power to impound specific \nand often wasteful spending programs from the Federal budget. It was a \nright our Chief Executive had been afforded already for almost 200 \nyears.\n  Perhaps not coincidentally, 1974 marked the year that truly ushered \nin the era of perpetually unbalanced Federal budgets and established \none of Congress' worst fiscal losing streaks: 26 straight years of \nunbalanced budgets and mounting national debt. While the retention of \nPresidential impoundment powers in 1974 may not have prevented a $4.8 \ntrillion debt, it may have helped decrease part of the more than $4 \ntrillion that has been added to our debt since that period of time.\n  The line-item veto is another critical tool to help us reach our \ngoals and to put us on the path toward fiscal responsibility, and \nAmerica needs it now more than ever before.\n  I would like to first commend the sponsors of this bill for their \ntireless work and for their ongoing commitment to eradicating waste and \nunnecessary spending from the Federal budget. The Senator from Arizona \n[Mr. McCain] has argued the merits of a line-item veto for the past 7 \nyears, since his election to the Senate. He has been ably joined by the \nSenator from Indiana [Mr. Coats], whose record on fiscal responsibility \nis one of the best in this Chamber.\n  I think the majority leader deserves credit for his role in bringing \nthis legislation to the floor.\n  I am a cosponsor of the legislation, the original draft of S. 4, that \nprovides for a line-item veto.\n  I must admit in this debate that, unlike my colleagues from Kansas, \nArizona, and Indiana, I am a newer convert to the merits of the line-\nitem veto, so I understand the concerns and feelings of those who may \nbe reluctant and reticent to support a Presidential line-item veto. But \nI have come to the conclusion that it is necessary, over the last few \nyears, to support this legislation because we have been unable to \nenforce the kind of discipline necessary to control Federal spending.\n  I do not believe that any of us think that the decisions will be \neasy, but they never have been for any American generation pushing for \npositive change in our country.\n  As one poet said, ``Change is not made without inconvenience, even \nfrom worse to better.''\n  Despite these inconveniences, we must make a clean and swift break \nfrom the failed policies of the past--especially in our budgeting \nprocess. in the words of Thomas Schatz, president of Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste, ``The first step is to reverse old assumptions. \nCongress has often viewed programs as perpetual, without taking enough \ntime to evaluate their effectiveness.'' The premise has been: How much \nwas spent last year, and how much are we supposed to spend this year. \nAs Schatz says, our question should be ``whether the money is spent \nwell or should be spent at all.''\n  I believe that we have no other choice than to use all the tools \navailable to us to control Federal spending. The American people would \nhave a hard time believing in some of the things that we do provide \nfunds for--$1.1 million for a plant stress lab. I suppose pork just \nwould not be pork if Congress did not spend $1.5 million for a national \npig research facility. All these projects were identified by the \nCitizens Against Government Waste as examples in their annual analysis \nof the Federal budget, appropriately called the ``Pig Book.''\n  They also identified $213 million in pork projects in the 1994 \nInterior appropriations bill and an astounding $367 million in the 1993 \nInterior appropriations bill. While to many in Congress these numbers \nmay seem like a drop in the proverbial bucket, it is not insignificant \nto the American people. They want to know that their hard-earned tax \ndollars are being used wisely and efficiently.\n  Now, wasteful spending--pork--may be funny to comedians. It may \nprovide fodder for the cannons of American's radio talk show hosts, and \nit may be the perennial target of deficit and waste watchdog groups, \nbut, ultimately, it is not a laughing matter for the American taxpayer. \nAnd it has become Congress' worst oversight.\n  In these days of perpetual deficits and growing debt, the litany of \nFederal excesses gives new impetus for the waste-cutting power of a \nline-item veto. It will allow us to look at Government differently. It \nwill allow us to examine the Federal budget process differently. It \nwill allow us to change the power structure of an appropriations \nprocess that has bequeathed our Nation and future generations a legacy \nof deficits and debts. And it will allow us to finally put an end to \nthe fiscal status quo.\n  We hear time and time again that opponents of a line-item veto have \nsaid that the result of giving the President line-item veto authority \nis almost insubstantial, and insignificant considering the size and \nscope of the Federal budget. In fact, wasteful Government spending has \ncumulatively constituted a growing portion of our deficits and debt \nover the years. In fact, President Johnson used this authority to \neliminate 6.7 percent of Government outlays in 1967. An equivalent \npercentage of today's budget would amount to over $100 billion--nearly \nhalf of our fiscal year 1996 deficit.\n  A more striking example of the significance and impact of wasteful \nspending can be shown not between total dollars in wasteful spending \nand the total Federal budget, but between waste and the average family \nbudget.\n   [[Page S4181]] As Citizens Against Government Waste showed in 1994, \na median-income, two-earner family paid $5,581 in Federal income taxes. \nThis means that $10 billion in pork wastes the combined taxes of \napproximately 1.8 million median-income families. Eliminating $1 \nbillion in wasteful spending could actually provide $1,000 in tax \nrelief to 1 million American families.\n  The biggest cost of wasteful spending cannot and should not be \nmeasured in terms of dollars and cents. Even more important is the \neffect of wasteful Government spending in terms of moral imperative. \nCongress' fiscal irresponsibility demonstrates a clear lack of \nprinciple in our Nation's governing institutions, and it is a \ncontinuing debasement of our democratic process which results in an \nerosion of confidence.\n  Opponents of a line-item veto have also failed to address how they \nwould curtail Congress' ongoing practice of funding hundreds of \nprojects and programs each year without the benefit of hearings, proper \nlegal authorization, and frequently in violation of the rules against \nearmarking. We cannot continue to survive as a supposedly open, \ndemocratic, and free Government under late-night deals and last minute \ninsertions of wasteful programs in joint House-Senate conference \ncommittees. It is a practice that completely disregards the due process \nof lawmaking as enshrined by our Founding Fathers.\n  Since the power of Presidential impoundment was taken away in 1974, \nPresidents have been required to submit spending cut requests--\nrescissions--for congressional approval, but only one-third of these \nhave been granted. Under this current system, Congress can kill these \nrequests through inaction, leaving no one to be held responsible for \nthe wasteful spending often targeted by rescission requests.\n  Some opponents of this measure might suggest that, since the 1974 \nchange in law, Congress has actually rescinded $20 billion more than \nPresidents have requested. However, Congress has ignored 564 rescission \nproposals offered by Republican Presidents alone, and accepted only 37 \npercent of all rescissions proposals presented to it. And of the 1,084 \nrescissions proposed by Presidents from Ford to Clinton, Congress has \nignored all but 399. Just imagine how much more deficit reduction could \nhave been attained if both Congress' and the President's rescission \nproposals had been adopted.\n  Now, there is nothing wrong with the fact that Congress found about \n$93 billion in rescissions savings since 1974--and that $70 billion of \nthis amount was derived from original proposals independent of the \nPresident.\n  I am sure we will hear a lot about this later. But the very fact is, \nwe could have had a much greater reduction in our deficit if we had \naccepted both the Congress' and the President's rescission proposals. \nWe could have had a total of $143 billion in that time period, which \nwould have represented a 54-percent increase in total deficit reduction \nabove the amount actually rescinded.\n  Now, if Congress disagrees with the President with respect to his \nrescission proposals, most certainly Congress could come up with \nalternatives to respond to the President's bottom-line figures in terms \nof eliminating additional spending.\n  There was a very convincing study that was conducted by the General \nAccounting Office in 1992, which found that a Presidential line-item \nveto could, in fact, have saved $70.7 billion in unnecessary spending \nbetween fiscal years 1984 and 1989. As this figure indicates, even \nparing only the most egregious wasteful spending through the line-item \nveto will reduce the deficit. For those of us who are serious about \ndeficit reduction and responsible spending, $70 billion in deficit \nreduction over 5 years builds a very strong case for a strong line-item \nveto.\n  But while opponents will continue to persist about whether we should \ngive the line-item veto authority to the President, clearly it will \nmake a difference in terms of what we can do to the overall budget.\n  Rather than tilting the power of the purse in favor of the President, \nit would restore some of the balance that has been eroded by Congress' \nmisguided budget rules that favor excessive spending and eleventh-hour \nreconciliation bills--bills that have become a sanctuary for pork \nprojects.\n  I think we should point to the fact that more than 43 Governors in \nthis country are required to have a line-item veto of some kind, and \nmore than 49 State Governors have a balanced budget. So that the line-\nitem veto may be much less necessary at the State level, where most of \nthe Governors, with the exception of one, are required to balance their \nbudgets. But in the national level, we do not have a requirement for a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Without that requirement, without that self-imposed discipline, we \ncontinue to watch the rising tide of red ink and the continual rising \ntide of debts. This line-item veto could help provide substantial cuts \nin the deficit and Federal spending overall.\n  It will force each and every Member of the House and the Senate to \njustify the appropriations and the line items in each of the 13 \nappropriations bills. That they will have to rise and fall on their own \nmerit. That is what it is all about.\n  If there is anything I have heard from my constituents in the State \nof Maine over and over again is the fact that people are concerned \nabout the way in which our money is being spent. They want to know that \nit is being spent effectively and efficiently. They want to know that \nthere are merits and there are justifications for the way in which we \nappropriate their hard-earned taxpayers' dollars. That is the bottom \nline.\n  In the final analysis, if we do anything else with the line-item veto \nin addition to cutting spending, we may restore the public's confidence \nin the way in which we expend their money. Every time they hear example \nupon example of egregious spending and frivolous spending, it erodes \nthe public's confidence in the budget process, and more than anything \nelse, erodes the public's confidence in this institution and its \nelected officials.\n  That is why I feel so strongly about this line-item veto. It is one \nthat should be supported by Members of both parties. In fact, President \nClinton, during the course of his campaign in 1992, advocated a line-\nitem veto. He had some form of a line-item veto when he was Governor of \nArkansas. In fact, he promised during his campaign that he could ax $10 \nbillion in pork-barrel projects over 4 years if he was President of the \nUnited States. Since 1993, he has proposed $3.5 billion in rescissions \nand Congress has only accepted $1.4 billion. Now, the President has \ncalled on Congress to give him the line-item veto. It will be \ninteresting to see how many Members of the President's own party will \nrally to his side and support this measure.\n  I believe the burden of proof is on those who have opposed the \nbalanced budget amendment and those who oppose a line-item veto to \nsuggest ways in which we are going to cut Federal spending. More than \nthat is how we will reach a balanced budget over the next 7 years. This \nis an approach that makes sense.\n  People have asked me why Congress has not passed a line-item veto. \nThat is a very difficult answer to give. As I said earlier on, I had \nreservations about this legislation some years ago about wielding and \ngiving too much power to the President. And I have seen the mounting \ndebts and deficits, and the fact that since the last time the Senate \npassed a balanced budget amendment, but unfortunately Congress did not; \nin 1982 we have seen the debt grow by 309 percent, $3.5 trillion.\n  I think that Congress needs all the help we can get. It certainly \nneeds all the tools that it can use to reduce the size of this deficit, \nand ultimately and hopefully balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, it is my hope that we will be able to \nreach an agreement on a compromise that will give Members the necessary \ntools to address this most serious of economic problems facing our \ncountry. It is not only for the President but it is also the future \ngenerations. I encourage all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto support this measure. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine who has had \nlong experience on this issue, especially in the State of Maine in both \nbodies. I thank her for her very important statement on this issue. I \nhope \n [[Page S4182]] and know she will return to this debate as it continues \nin the coming days.\n  Very briefly, this morning I was talking about what had happened \nsince 1974, because that was the year in which the Budget Impoundment \nAct was passed. I now have those specific numbers. In 1974, the deficit \nwas $6.1 billion; the total debt was $483 billion. Repeating that, the \ndeficit was $6.1 billion; it is estimated in 1994 to be $203 billion. \nAnd as I mentioned, the debt was $483 billion in 1974. In 1994 it was \n$4.6 trillion--trillion dollars.\n  We are now carrying an annual deficit that is about half of what the \nnational debt was, the entire national debt. We have now gone from $483 \nbillion in 1974 to $5.2 trillion estimated in 1996.\n  This is my argument, Mr. President, that for most of our history \nrevenues and expenditures stayed basically the same, and it was not \nuntil 1974 with the passage of the Budget and Impoundment Act that we \nreally saw the deficits and debt explode. That is because of a lack of \ndiscipline imposed on the spending habits of Congress.\n  Mr. President, I just had given to me by staff a listing of the \nNational Taxpayers Union ratings for Congress, and I note with pleasure \nthat my colleague from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], is the eighth most \nfiscally responsible Member of this body.\n  I am sure he considers himself the first, but by an objective view he \nis rated the eighth. I think that is admirable and gives him a certain \ndegree of moral authority on this issue, since he has been one of the \nmost fiscally responsible Members of this body since 1981 when he came \nhere, although he does not look like he has been here that long.\n  I yield the Senator from Oklahoma such time as he may consume.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator \nMcCain, from Arizona, and I wish to join him in complimenting our \nfriend and colleague, the Senator from Maine [Ms. Snowe] for an \noutstanding speech. I agree with everything she said. It was not only a \nwell-researched speech, but one that had great impact. I hope my \ncolleagues will listen to it, and I hope the American people will \nlisten to it.\n  I also would like to compliment my good friend and colleague from \nArizona, Senator McCain, for his courage in continuing to bring this \nissue to the floor of the Senate. He is doing it at some risk, \npolitically. Certainly some risk to appropriation requests in his \nState. But he has not waivered. He has shown great conviction and \ncourage in bringing this issue up because he believes in it. I respect \nhim for that. I also happen to think he is right.\n  I also wish to compliment Senator Coats from Indiana for his courage, \nas well. This issue is not easy. These two Senators have been bringing \nthis issue to the forefront when it was most aggressively opposed by \nthe former chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd. I \nremember various times when other Senators would oppose an amendment by \nthese two Senators just because of the line-item veto. They might even \nagree with them on the underlying amendment, but they would oppose it \nbecause of their position on line-item veto. I just wish to compliment \nSenator McCain and Senator Coats. I hope that this year that their \nefforts will finally bear fruit, and we will pass a line-item veto.\n  I think it is vitally important that we pass this legislation. It \nwill save money, and I think we need to save money. We are spending too \nmuch. Our budget process does not work very well. A line-item veto is \nnot a panacea. It will not solve all the problems, and it will not \nbalance the budget. But it will help.\n  I think the first and most important reform would be passing a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. We tried. We fought \nthat issue for a month. Unfortunately, we lost. It takes 67 votes. We \nhad 66 votes. We had 98 percent of the Republicans vote with us on a \nbalanced budget amendment. Unfortunately, six of our Democrat \ncolleagues changed position from last year, and so we lost. Maybe we \nwill win later this year. Maybe we will win next year. Maybe we will \nwin 2 years from now. I expect that we will. No later than 2 years from \nnow, I think we will pass a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget.\n  What we can we do in the meantime? What are some other much-needed \nbudget reforms? I think the budget scholars say, first and foremost, \npass a line-item veto. I think it is vitally important to do so.\n  I might note that most people on the Appropriations Committee say \nthey do not agree with it. I have served on the Appropriations \nCommittee. That committee used to have 29 members, but I believe it was \nreduced to 27. They probably work as hard as any committee in the \nSenate, and they are responsible for spending a little over $500 \nbillion, about a third of what the Government spends right now. The \nmembers on that committee work long and hard hours.\n  By and large, they do a pretty good job, and we usually pass about 15 \nor 16 appropriations bills, including supplementals. Some of these \nbills are small, in the couple billion-dollar range, and some are quite \nlarge, in the $200 or $300 billion range.\n  But I will tell you from my experience, every single appropriations \nbill has had items in it that we need, and every single appropriations \nbill has had items we do not need and we cannot afford. If we give the \nPresident the line-item veto, we will allow him to be able to knock out \nor kill or strike those items that we cannot afford. We may or may not \nagree with him. If we disagree with him, we can try to override his \nveto. That is a process called checks and balances.\n  Right now, we do not have checks and balances. Congress is writing \nall the checks, and there are very few balances. A whole lot of those \nchecks are hot, or are paid for by borrowed money, and the President is \ngiven two options. We send the President 15 or 16 appropriations bills \nin the course of a year and he is given two options: One, he signs the \nentire package or, two, he vetoes the entire package.\n  Some of these appropriations bills are thick; hundreds of pages, and \nsome have thousands of lines in them. The President is not able to kill \na program if he does not like it. He has to sign the entire bill or \nveto the entire bill. There are no checks and balances.\n  He submits a budget and it is often ignored. Congress passes \nappropriations bills. Congress knows and the President knows, we have \nto pay the Secret Service, we have to pay the armed services, we have \nto pay for many vital Government functions, so he is reluctant to use \nthe veto pen.\n  This will allow the President to use the veto pen. Every President \nhas asked for it. Every Republican President I can think of has said, \n``Give me the line-item veto, I will use it to save billions of \ndollars.'' Now we have President Clinton saying, ``Give me the line-\nitem veto, I will save billions of dollars.'' And we have Republicans \nleading the effort saying, ``Give it to him, because we think the \nPresident should have it, whether Democrat or Republican.'' Most \nRepublicans say every President should have it, even a strong line-item \nveto, one that takes two-thirds to override. That means he may be able \nto kill a pet program of ours, something we feel very strongly about.\n  I will give one example. I happen to feel strongly that we should \nhave defenses against incoming theater-based missiles, intercontinental \nballistic missiles. I think we should have defenses to be able to stop \nthose before they hit our country. We do not right now. We should \ndevelop those systems. I am afraid this President does not share that \nbelief. If Republicans put in money in an appropriations bill for the \nstrategic defense initiative, the President may disagree with us. He \nmay veto us. We may not have the votes to override. I think it would be \nunfortunate, but I think the pluses outweigh the minuses, and we should \ngive him line-item veto.\n  The President should receive overwhelming support on this side of the \naisle. It may not be unanimous. The question is can he give a few \nvotes? We know there is going to be a filibuster. We know we have to \nhave 60 votes. I hope all Republicans will vote in favor of cloture, \nbut we are going to need at least six from the Democratic side to get \nto cloture to have a final vote.\n  The President stated repeatedly he is in favor of the line-item veto. \nHe needs to deliver 6 or 8 or 10 Democrats to make that happen. If he \ncannot deliver one-fifth of the number of Democrats, then we probably \nwill not have the line-item veto. Some will say, ``The Senate was not \nable to deliver.'' I will \n [[Page S4183]] say, ``It was President Clinton who was not able to \ndeliver.''\n  Maybe this is something we can work on in a bipartisan fashion. I \nwould like to see that happen. Some people say Congress is too \npartisan. This is an issue on which most people agree with Clinton. We \nwant to give him a line-item veto. We want his successor to have a \nline-item veto. We think we can save billions of dollars. Can we \nbalance the budget with it? No. Can we take giant steps to eliminate \nwasteful spending? The answer is yes.\n  Mr. President, again, I compliment my colleagues, particularly \nSenator McCain and Senator Coats, for their leadership. They have taken \nthis issue on year after year, many times at considerable economic and \npolitical pain. I compliment them for their courage. I hope that this \nyear they will be successful. I hope that this year we will make at \nleast one really significant budget reform, and that is to give the \nPresident a line-item veto.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his \nvery good remarks on this issue, and I appreciate his continued \ninvolvement and his leadership in our party.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be an additional 30 \nminutes allocated to the managers on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, with \nthe time being taken equally from both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nbetween now and 5 p.m. today be equally divided. This has been cleared \nwith the Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Tennessee such \ntime as he may consume.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the line-item \nveto legislation that the Senate will consider. No single measure will \ndo more to curb wasteful Government spending than the line-item veto. I \nwish to commend Senator McCain, Senator Coats, and Senator Domenici for \ntheir leadership on this issue.\n  Last November, the American people spoke loudly; they spoke clearly \nwhen they demanded a smaller, more accountable Government. They \ndemanded a radical departure from business as usual in Washington. They \ndemanded an end to wasteful, unnecessary Government spending. The line-\nitem veto will give the President the power to eliminate unnecessary \nand wasteful spending items that are often hidden and tucked away in \nimportant pieces of legislation.\n  As a heart surgeon, I have seen many cases where a new heart was the \nonly hope for saving a patient's life. However, I would not prescribe a \nnew heart, a heart transplantation, when a more specific operation \nwould do. Why remove an otherwise healthy heart if the problems could \nbe more easily corrected with a less drastic procedure?\n  As the health of our Federal economy worsens, our President must be \ngiven the tools that he needs to make precise corrections in \nappropriations legislation. We must give him the power to strike \ndiscrete budget items when it is clear that those items do not serve \nthe national interest. For too long, our system has allowed needless \nspending to go unchecked.\n  Mr. President, according to the General Accounting Office, if a \nPresidential line-item veto had been in place between 1984 and 1989, we \nwould have eliminated an estimated $70.7 billion in wasteful Government \nspending--$70.7 billion. Instead, our Nation is faced with exorbitant \ninterest payments today on our $4.7 trillion debt, the result of \nexcessive Federal spending on programs we could not afford.\n  Not only is this a debate about cutting spending, it is a debate \nabout the fundamental relationship between the Congress and the \nPresident. The 1974 Budget Act limited the discretion of the executive \nbranch with respect to Federal spending. When the Budget Act was \npassed, the President was granted the power to request rescissions from \nthe budget. In order for the rescissions to take effect, however, \nCongress must enact the recommended spending cuts within 45 days. \nCongress is not even required to vote on the recommendations. Needless \nto say, most Presidential rescission requests have been ignored.\n  Since 1974, Presidents have sent Congress 1,084 rescission requests. \nThese requests would have cut $72.8 billion. Congress has enacted only \n399 of these requests, for a total savings of $22.9 billion, ignoring \nnearly $50 billion in Presidential rescission requests.\n  It is important to point out, Mr. President, that the beginning of \nour chronic, exploding deficits coincides with this shift in spending \npower to Congress in 1974. The spending deficit for 1974 was $6.1 \nbillion. The very next year the deficit exploded to roughly nine times \nthat, or $54 billion. Though, indeed, there have been peaks and valleys \nsince that time, the deficit has continued to climb to the alarming \nlevels we are experiencing today.\n  It is clear to me that Congress shifted too much power to itself in \n1974. Congress clearly bit off more than it could chew. The unfortunate \nresult has been 20 years of increasingly unchecked, unnecessary pork-\nbarrel spending with virtually no restraint from the executive branch. \nFuture budget deficits will be even greater if this Congress fails to \nenact fundamental reform of the budget process, not to mention reform \nof programs themselves.\n  Mr. President, a line-item veto would restore the President's \nappropriate role in the budget process. As it is, all discretionary \nspending is governed by the passage of 13 major appropriations bills. \nWhen an appropriations bill lands on the President's desk, he has but \ntwo choices: sign it into law, or veto the bill altogether.\n  That is like telling me as a heart surgeon that I have but one choice \nwith any heart patients, totally transplant the heart or nothing at \nall.\n  Under the current system, Presidents must choose between retaining \npork in spending bills or disrupting major programs and shutting down \nentire departments. Enacting line-item veto legislation will restore \naccountability. Members of Congress will know at the outset, up front, \nthat spending bills will face greater scrutiny and exposure. They will \nbe forced to look more critically at spending proposals at the \nbeginning of the process. And, perhaps, some of the more egregious \nspending requests will never be made.\n  No longer will a Member of Congress be able to insert, late at night \nin the back of a bill, hidden, where no one will see it, a piece of \npork, recognizing at that time that nobody is likely to look. Perhaps \nconstituents will then be told that the Government simply cannot afford \ncertain projects any longer, and Members of Congress will then become \nbetter stewards of the American taxpayer dollars.\n  Mr. President, I am so convinced that this is the right thing to do \nthat I am willing to give this power to a President of the other \npolitical party. President Clinton, like his predecessors, President \nReagan and Bush, knows he can save taxpayers' money--if only we give \nhim the power to do so. As Governor of Arkansas, Clinton used the \nState's line-item veto 11 times. In fact, 43 of the Nation's Governors \nhave some form of line-item veto. Governor William Weld of \nMassachusetts testified \n [[Page S4184]] before Congress earlier this year that he has used the \nline-item veto in his State more than 1,000 times--mostly to cut pork-\nbarrel spending put into legislation to win someone's vote. \nRepresentative Mike Castle, former Governor of Delaware, wielded the \nline-item veto to stop the Delaware Legislature from increasing certain \nbudget items fivefold.\n  Most States are required to balance their budgets. Yet 43 of our \nNation's Governors have found it necessary to use the line-item veto to \ncut wasteful spending. Mr. President, Members of Congress are not \nconstrained by a balanced budget amendment--all the more reason why it \nis essential that we empower the President with a line-item veto \nprovision.\n  Mr. President, a review of past years' appropriations bills reveals \npage after page of extravagant spending items. Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste, a taxpayer watchdog group, estimates that more than \n$10 billion in pork is tucked away in last year's appropriations bills \nalone. This group defines pork as any project that: was requested by \nonly one Chamber of Congress; was not specifically authorized; was not \ncompetitively awarded; was not requested by the President; greatly \nexceeds the President's budget request or the previous year's funding; \nwas not the subject of congressional hearings; or serves only a local \nor special interest.\n  Let me name just a few examples from recent years' appropriations \nbills: $58 million to bail out New York Yankee owner George \nSteinbrenner's American Ship Building Co.; $300,000 in the District of \nColumbia for the bicycle improvement project; $110 million for \nconstruction of corridor H in West Virginia; $19 million for the \nInternational Fund for Ireland. In the past, this program has used \nAmerican taxpayer dollars for a golf video and pony trekking centers; \nand $34.7 million for screwworm research, even though the screwworm has \nbeen eradicated in the United States.\n  These examples represent only a small fraction of hundreds of such \npork-barrel projects approved by Congress each year. I strongly urge \nthis Congress to show the American people that we can turn our \nGovernment away from this crash course of out-of-control Federal \nspending.\n  This legislation is sure to be opposed by members of the Senate's old \nguard Democrats. But the 11 freshmen were elected to bring the message \nof the American people to the Senate. We must change, or America may be \nirreparably harmed. The nation is suffocating under debt, and this \nCongress must take every step it can to stop the flow of red ink. Mr. \nPresident, the line-item veto is a tool that will help do that, and I \nurge the Senate to enact this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield to the Senator from Minnesota as much time as he \nmay consume.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation that \nwill create a fundamental change in the way we do business in \nWashington. I want to lend my voice to the McCain line-item veto \nlegislation.\n  It is legislation Republicans are calling for. It is legislation \nDemocrats are calling for. It is legislation that Americans called \nfor--loudly--when they voted at the polls in November.\n  The Framers of the Constitution could never have imagined the need \nfor a line-item veto, but neither could they have imagined the garbage \nbills coming out of Congress that have made the line-item veto a \nPresidential necessity.\n  The garbage bill is Washington's version of packsack stew--a place to \ndump leftover bills that could never have been swallowed by themselves, \nbut become more palatable when they are stirred safely inside a massive \nspending bill.\n  Too often, these extra morsels are million-dollar pieces of pork, \ndumped into the stew pot by a Member of Congress eager to please a \nspecial interest group back home.\n  But that favor for a few comes at the expense of everyone else.\n  Last year's package of disaster assistance following the California \nearthquake quickly became a garbage bill of the very worst kind.\n  By the time the legislation passed, it included not only $10 billion \nin actual emergency relief, but an extra $10 million to design a new \nAmtrak station in New York City, $20 million to hire employees for the \nFBI's fingerprint laboratory in West Virginia, $1.4 million to fight a \npotato fungus in Maine, and $1 million for sugar cane growers in \nHawaii.\n  As stand-alone legislation, particularly when compared against the \nrest of the monstrous Federal budget, individual pork projects may not \nappear so ominous.\n  Collectively, however, they account for billions of dollars in \nFederal spending every year.\n  And by putting the legislative priorities of a few ahead of the \nfiscal priorities of an entire Nation, they set a dangerous precedent.\n  Passage of the line-item veto would help stop the fiscal recklessness \nthat has dragged this country $4.8 trillion into debt.\n  Wielding a line-item veto, and without having to reject the entire \nbill, the President could comb through spending legislation line by \nline and eliminate the wasteful, pork-barrel projects when Congress \ndoes not have the courage.\n  When Congress just can not say no, the line-item veto would let the \nPresident do it for them.\n  It would also have a powerful impact on keeping wasteful spending out \nof appropriations bills in the first place.\n  My colleagues might think twice about sponsoring some pork for back \nhome, knowing they could be forced to argue its merits individually on \nthe floor of the Senate if it were vetoed by the President.\n  The American people have asked Congress to pass the line-item veto--\n64 percent of them, in fact, consider it a high or top priority.\n  The House overwhelmingly passed its line-item veto legislation on \nFebruary 6 as a birthday tribute to Ronald Reagan, the President known \nas the bill's greatest champion.\n  Governors in 43 States have line-item veto authority, and why should \nthey not? It works.\n  In my home State of Minnesota, Gov. Arne Carlson used the line-item \nveto 29 times during his first term to cut the fat out of State \nlegislation--saving Minnesota taxpayers $164 million in wasteful \ngovernment spending.\n  In neighboring Wisconsin, Gov. Tommy Thompson has put his line-item \nveto to work 1,500 times during his 8 years in office.\n  If the line-item veto existed on the Federal level, the Government \nAccounting Office says the President could have cut more than $70 \nbillion in Federal spending between 1984 and 1989.\n  Last year, President Clinton could have saved the taxpayers millions \nby blue-penciling frivolous pork projects such as screwworm research, \n$35 million; honeybee research, $5 million; and chiropractic \ndemonstrations in Iowa, $1 million.\n  But unlike his counterparts on the State level, the President does \nnot have the power of the line-item veto, or the power to rein in \nFederal spending that comes with it.\n  Like every modern Chief Executive, however, President Clinton has \nsupported Congress' efforts to grant him that tool of the line-item \nveto. ``For years, Congress concealed in the budget scores of pet \nspending projects,'' said President Clinton in his most recent State of \nthe Union Address.\n\n       Last year was no different. There was a million dollars to \n     study stress in plants and $12 million for a tick removal \n     program that didn't work. If you'll give me the line-item \n     veto, I'll remove some of that unnecessary spending.\n\n  This year, Congress appears ready to deliver, and I, along with \nothers, encourage President Clinton to demonstrate his commitment to \nthis legislation by being an aggressive supporter.\n  This is no time to sit on the sidelines.\n  Even with the backing of President Clinton, however, the bill may \nface trouble here in the Senate. Opponents say it gives too much \nauthority to the President; that is shifts the constitutional balance \nof powers.\n  Others claim it could lead to influence trading, with Presidents \ntrying to sway legislators by threatening to veto their pet projects.\n  But those colleagues of mine who are the most outspoken opponents of \nthe \n [[Page S4185]] line-item veto are perhaps the most conspicuous example \nof why we need it.\n  Congress itself has not been able to stop the big spenders. But a \nline-item veto could.\n  If the Senate can pass the line-item veto, Democrat Bill Clinton will \nbe the first President to use it, and it will be thanks to a Republican \nCongress.\n  But this effort is not about politics, and the line-item veto is \ncertainly not Republican legislation. It is simply the right thing to \ndo.\n  We need a line-item veto.\n  If it can work in Minnesota, if it can work in Wisconsin where it has \nrepeatedly protected taxpayer dollars, it can work here in Washington \nfor the benefit of all taxpayers as well.\n  Again, Mr. President, I lend my voice today in strong support of \nlegislation for a line-item veto.\n  I yield the floor. Thank you.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield to the Senator from Wyoming such time as he may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I have risen over the past week several \ntimes to voice my support for a line-item veto. It seems to me it is \none of the things that we need to change procedurally. We need a change \nprocedurally to make a change in this country.\n  This morning, however, I listened with great interest to one of our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle who said these things that we \nare dealing with in the Senate over the last 2 months have been quick \nfixes, that we have been dealing with items that are simply short-term \ngimmicks. I simply cannot let that go by without some response.\n  It seems to me that very clearly over the past number of years the \nproduct from this Government, the product from this Congress, the \nproduct from this Senate, has not been what almost anyone would want. \nAnd in November the voters said we want some change. If you are going \nto have change in the outcome, if you are going to have change in the \nproduct, you have to change the way you do things. That is what these \npast several months have been about. That is what the election was \nabout, it seems to me, in November. It was about things like a balanced \nbudget amendment and putting some discipline into the process so that \nthe Congress could, in fact, balance income with outgo.\n  It was about term limits, so that there could be some end to the \namount of services that are carried on from one particular district \nwhen no one else in any other district can do anything about that. It \nwas about a line-item veto where we seek to get some of the unnecessary \npork-barrel kinds of things out of the huge budget that are presented \nto the President. These are not gimmicks. These are changes in process. \nThese are changes that cause things to happen that cause a different \nresult. The line-item veto is simply a reasonable response, it seems to \nme, to the idea that bills become so voluminous, so broad and so \nchanged that there needs to be some way to reach into them and take out \nthose things that are not relevant, that are not appropriate, that \nwould not stand at all on their own merit. And there are a great many \nof those, particularly here in the Senate where the rules allow for \namendments that are not necessarily consistent with the bill. In the \nHouse there are rules that are stricter, but here they are not. I \nunderstand that. I respect that. But it allows for things to be hidden \nin the highway bill that have nothing to do with highways, that would \nnot stand for 5 minutes on their own merit.\n  So we need a process to change that. That is what the line-item veto \nis all about. It is not a gimmick. It is not a short-term fix. In fact, \nit is a proven way of doing it. It is done in more than 40 States, and \nhas been done for years, and successfully, in my State of Wyoming.\n  Is the balanced budget amendment a short-term gimmick? Give me a \nbreak. It is not a short-term gimmick at all. What it is is a response \nto 25 years without a balanced budget; 50 years with something like \nfive balanced budgets. It is a response to performance. It is a \nresponse to the question of, Do you think it is financially and morally \nresponsible to balance the budget, to not spend more than you take in? \nThat is a pretty reasonable question. The answer is almost invariably \nyes, that is immoral; yes, that is irresponsible; yes, we do need to \nchange it. We have not changed it. There is no sign of changing it \nunless there is some discipline. Some discipline applies to the \nprocess. That is what the balanced budget is about.\n  Are term limits short-term gimmicks? I do not think so. This place is \nbuilt on seniority. It is built on how long you have been here. That is \nfine. The problem is, people say, ``Well, you have an election every 2 \nyears. You have an election every 4 years. You can change that.'' \nPeople in Wyoming cannot do anything about it, nor in Colorado or \nMassachusetts or somewhere else.\n  So you have an extraordinary amount of authority lying in someone who \nhappens to be there for 40 years and is not going to be exchanged by \nhis people at home because of that authority. Term limits make some \nsense. These are not short-term gimmicks. Unfortunately, we have seen \nover the last month the sort of rapid response team of those who are \nopposed to change. Every time there is an idea that we ought to change \nsomething, suddenly there is this great aroused response that, no, we \ncannot do that because it is a short-term gimmick.\n  Mr. President, the real test, it seems to me, of responsive \ngovernment, the real test of good government, is if there is indeed a \nresponse in Government from the requests and demands of voters. That is \nnot a new concept contrary to something that should happen in \ndemocracy. It is something that has happened in this country for years. \nIn the 1800's, even up to the 1930's, in every generation, there was a \nresponse from voters and a change in government--as there should be.\n  In the beginning, however, in the 1930's when Government became \nlarger and a greater part of our lives, the change becomes more \ndifficult. As I remember the numbers of President Roosevelt in the \n1930's, there was something like 75,000 people who worked for the \nFederal Government. Now there is something like 3 million. So there is \ngreat resistance to change in the bureaucracy. There is probably even a \nhigher percentage of resistance to change by the number of lawyers in \nWashington. That is great resistance to change.\n  In addition, of course, as Government gets larger, it develops a sort \nof a dependency on Government and voters become more resistant to \nreally take a look at the notion of what the Federal Government ought \nto be. What should we expect from the Federal Government? The message, \nI believe, was clearly we have too much Government and it costs too \nmuch. It is not easy to change that. It is a painful experience to \nchange that. It is much easier to continue to do what we have been \ndoing. Lots of good people come to Washington who are uneasy about the \nfuture, who really do not have strong feelings about change, but it is \neasier to go forward the way it is. Change is not easy. But that is \nwhat we are asked to do. That is what is necessary to do.\n  The White House liaison people were by this morning, and I was \ndelighted to meet with them. I asked them if the White House was for a \nline-item veto. ``Yes, sir. The President is very much for line-item \nveto. He has made that clear.'' That ought to have some impact. I hope \nthat is communicated wholly to our friends on the other side of the \naisle.\n  So, clearly, we need to change the way we do things if we are going \nto expect the change in the results.\n  Things we have been doing--the procedural things--are not nearly as \nmuch Republicans versus Democrats as those who are willing to make some \nchanges and those who are for the status quo. We simply cannot continue \nto do that.\n  This is a time when we need change. And for those who resist it, I \nsay, come on, get over it; we have to make changes, do some things \nright. We have to balance the budget, we have to have line-item veto to \ndo something about pork barrel. We can do it. We simply have to come to \nthe post and get after it. Now is the time.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have just received a statement by the \nPresident of the United States that has been \n [[Page S4186]] released today, March 20, 1995. I would like to quote \nthat statement by the President of the United States for the Record. I \nam very encouraged by it and also very appreciative.\n  It says:\n\n       The Senate is now debating the line-item veto legislation \n     which passed last month in the House. I urge the Senate to \n     pass the strongest possible line-item veto, and to make it \n     effective immediately. If the Members of Congress from both \n     parties are serious about cutting the deficit, give me this \n     line-item veto, and I will get started right away. This is \n     one area where both parties can, and should, come together.\n       I have advocated the line-item veto for a very long time. \n     When I was a governor, I had a line-item veto and I balanced \n     12 budgets in a row. I advocated the line-item veto when I \n     ran for President, and I have pushed for it since becoming \n     President because it is a very effective tool for cutting \n     wasteful government spending and bringing down the deficit.\n       We have made great headway in cutting wasteful spending. We \n     have already cut the federal bureaucracy by 102,000 \n     positions, on the way to cutting a quarter million. We are \n     bringing the deficit down by more than $600 billion. My new \n     budget calls for another $81 billion in deficit reduction.\n       But there is still too much waste in the Federal budget. \n     This year I have proposed eliminating 131 programs altogether \n     and consolidating 270 others. I proposed many of these \n     spending cuts last year and the year before, only to have \n     Congress tell me I couldn't cut their pet projects.\n       I tried to cut $16 million for the Small Business \n     Administration's tree planting program. But Congress put it \n     back in the budget.\n       Congress even spent $12 million for a Cattle Tick \n     Eradication Project.\n       Well, this year, if the Congress gives me the line-item \n     veto, I will cut each one of these programs, and a whole lot \n     more. I also think the line-item veto should be applied to \n     the revenue as well as the spending sides of the budget, so I \n     can curb wasteful tax and spending provisions.\n       This is really about closing the door on business as usual \n     in Washington. If Congress is serious about changing the way \n     Washington works and getting a handle on wasteful spending, \n     they will put politics aside, stand up to the special \n     interests, and pass this bill.\n       The President, no matter what party, needs the line-item \n     veto to bring discipline to the budget process. I urge the \n     Senate to pass it, and make it effective right now.\n\n  Mr. President, I applaud the statement of the President of the United \nStates. I appreciate it. I hope that now he can start some personal \nlobbying on that side of the aisle.\n  As I have said before, the crux of this issue will lie in whether we \nobtain 60 votes to cut off debate. We have 54 votes on this side of the \naisle. Now we need 6 votes on that side of the aisle--6 out of 46. I \nhope that the President of the United States can prevail upon six \nMembers on that side of the aisle to achieve that. As he says, ``I urge \nthe Senate to pass the strongest possible line-item veto.'' There can \nbe no mistake about what that means, Mr. President. It means a two-\nthirds majority to override a President's veto in both Houses, not the \nsham and fraud and deception being perpetrated by calling a veto a \nsimple majority vote in one House in order to override a President's \nveto. That is what this debate will be all about. It will be all about \nthe fact that, finally, after 8 years of being prevented from bringing \nup the line-item veto, we are now about to move to the bill for the \nfirst time. It has been blocked every time on a parliamentary \nprocedure, a budget point of order. Now we are about to reach it. Now \nthe President of the United States says he wants the strongest possible \nline-item veto enacted. Fifty-four Members on this side will at least \nvote for cloture. That is what this debate is about. I hope we can get \nsix votes on the other side.\n  I want to comment on the President's statement about, ``I think the \nline-item veto should be applied to the revenue as well as the spending \nsides of the budget so I can curb wasteful tax and spending \nprovisions.''\n  I agree with him there, also. Too many times, mammoth tax bills have \nbeen passed with so-called transition rules and little tax breaks for \nindividuals or groups tucked into massive tax bills. I am all for it, \nbut I am concerned about the language, Mr. President. We have to make \nsure the language does what it says. I am not interested in giving the \nPresident of the United States--either Republican or Democrat--the \nright to veto a capital gains tax cut. I am not interested in having \nthat kind of management of the tax reform or tax bills impacted by a \nveto. But I am interested and committed--and I believe we can shape the \nproper language that specifically targets individual or special tax \nbenefits so that we can do away with those abuses, as well.\n  In addition, I say to the President of the United States, not only \nthat, sir, but we are willing to give you the authority to veto new \nentitlements or expansion of entitlement programs. Often we will hear \nin this debate that the real budget problems--and they are right--exist \nas far as expansive growth of entitlement programs are concerned, and \nnew entitlement programs, which seem to come down quite often. We are \nwilling to shape a compromise that gives the President of the United \nStates the authority not to veto existing entitlement programs--Social \nSecurity will not be touched--but the authority to veto expanded or new \nentitlement programs.\n  I want to say again, Mr. President, that I have urged the President \nof the United States to get involved in this issue. I am glad he is \nengaged. I appreciate this very strong and, I think, important \nstatement where he even cites examples of the problems that any chief \nexecutive has with trying to balance the budget. He mentions, ``I tried \nto cut $16 million for the Small Business Administration's tree \nplanting program, but Congress put it back in the budget. Congress even \nspent $12 million for a cattle tick eradication project.''\n  Mr. President, I have a list that would stretch from here out to the \nsteps of the Capitol of programs like that which have been put into the \nappropriations bills over the past 10 or 15 years--actually, since \n1974. The problem is epidemic in proportion, and I am very encouraged \nby the President's statement. I look forward to working with him and \nthe White House personnel as we try to corral enough votes in order to \nget this done, get it behind us, and move on to the other important \nissues of the day, such as, for example, the rescission package which \nwill be pending before this body.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given \nup to 5 minutes to speak on the measure before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the adoption of \nthe line-item veto, and I would like to share with the Senate a \nperspective that comes from having spent 19 years in the State \nlegislature of Georgia as a member of the Senate.\n  Georgia, like 49 other States, had a line-item veto. While I debated \nback and forth various budgets and the fiscal condition of the State of \nGeorgia, I think it is safe to say that it is in a much better state \nthan the United States Government.\n  The line-item veto, along with a balanced budget amendment, are among \nthe reasons for that healthier condition. The fact that so many of our \nState executives have the authority to line item and, therefore, be \nanother force, if you would, to intervene and bring about fiscal \ndiscipline is a very healthy thing.\n  I think the American people know it, if the people in Washington do \nnot, that we need many new rules of the road in order to bring fiscal \norder to the affairs of the United States. This is but one of many. We \nshould have passed the balanced budget amendment.\n  We should probably have a spending reduction commission. We need a \nline-item veto. We need to redesign the process by which we manage our \nfiscal affairs, and we need but look at the $5 trillion of debt that we \nhave.\n  The United States has spent every dime it has and $5 trillion it does \nnot have, and it stays on a spending spree. Look at the President's \nbudget--$200 billion in deficits as far as the eye can \n [[Page S4187]] see. It is obvious we have to do things like the line-\nitem veto.\n  Some people on the other side of the aisle allege that the line-item \nveto destabilizes the balance between the executive and legislative \nbranches, but so many States have it. They are great laboratories to \nreview. I do not believe anybody in our country remembers waking up and \nreading about any State of the Union becoming unglued or destabilized \nor taken to the brink of ruin over the contest between an executive and \nlegislative branch over the authority to have a line-item veto.\n  This is a very sensible process that will help establish fiscal \norder.\n  I remember years ago when I was running for the U.S. Senate, in fact \non other occasions, people said, ``Well, you only want the line-item \nveto because over the recent generations, the Presidents have been \nRepublican.'' I said at the time, ``I am going to support the line-item \nveto no matter who the Chief Executive is because it is sensible and \nreasonable.''\n  I find a certain irony that I would be in this capital city watching \na new Republican majority fighting the Democrat minority to give a \nDemocrat President the line-item veto. What an irony. I would think \nboth sides of the aisle would be embracing this idea. It is their \nPresident. He is a Democrat, and I am just absolutely baffled that we \nfind the other side of the aisle throwing barriers and tacks in the \nroad as we try to put in place this very sensible rule that President \nClinton campaigned on and said he was going to fight for.\n  I think I just heard Senator McCain read a letter from the President \nindicating his support for the strongest version. You would think, Mr. \nPresident, we could end this debate in about a day given the fact that \na majority of the Congress supports it and the President supports it \nand the American people support it 70 to 80 percent. But not in this \ncity. No, sir, not in this city. In this city, the disconnect is so \ngreat, and in the light of the new majority going forth, the President \nof the United States asking for it, and the American people wanting it, \nwe still have to fight our way through, just as we did on the balanced \nbudget amendment, to try to bring this to fruition.\n  The Presiding Officer just came from the elections. I was there just \n24 months ago. I think the Presiding Officer, like myself, recognizes \nthat we are in the midst of a revolution, and the American people want \nto see some change in the capital city. They are tired of business \nbeing run as usual. Mr. President, they expect change to begin to \nhappen here, and one of the cornerstones of this change is the line-\nitem veto.\n  I hope that the other side of the aisle can somehow make a connection \nwith what is going on in the country and it will register on them that \nour President, the titular head of their party, the majority, and the \nAmerican people have said now is the time for there to be a line-item \nveto.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator be making the request that \nthe time of the quorum call be equally divided between the two sides?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I so request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/20/senate-section/article/S4165-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I think we ought to start with some facts. \nThe line-item veto is not about partisan politics, as the minority \nleader said on Friday, as I said on Friday, and as the President said \ntoday in a release. He said he wanted as strong as possible a bill and \nmake it effective immediately.\n  So it is not about politics. It is about our economic future. And it \nis not about pitting appropriations versus entitlements. It is about \nsubjecting all expenditures to the same scrutiny.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, at least 10 \nPresidents since the Civil War have stated support for the line-item \nveto. President Clinton will be the 11th. Governors of 43 States have \nsome form of line-item veto authority. It has the overwhelming support \nof the American people. It is time we came to closure on this issue \nhere in Washington, DC.\n  And make no mistake about it, there have been differences of opinion \nabout how to best design this authority. Some have backed a \nconstitutional amendment, some enhanced rescission authority, and some \nseparate enrollment legislation. And the substitute that I have offered \ntoday tries to build on the efforts of those on both sides of the aisle \nto reach a consensus after all these years of arguing.\n  I understand it has been suggested--I hope not--we are surprising \neveryone. I do not think there are many surprises left in this debate. \nI was reminded by the Senator from Arizona in a Republican conference \njust a few moments ago we have considered different forms of the line-\nitem veto seven times in the past 8 years. And so it is a matter that \nmost of us have a lot of familiarity with, some more than others who \nhave worked on it, such as the Senator from Arizona and the Senator \nfrom Indiana, the Senator from New Mexico, and others on the other side \nof the aisle.\n  I hope that we could respond quickly here and get this done this \nweek. There is no reason not to do it this week. It is only five pages \nlong. There is one sentence on the sixth page.\n  We do not have every vote on this side, I do not believe, for the \namendment itself, although I must say we have improved it a lot and we \nhave picked up a lot of support on this side. \n [[Page S4190]] I do think we have every vote for cloture on this side \nof the aisle. So it seems to me that with bipartisan support, which I \nexpect will come, particularly with the President's strong statement \ntoday, there is no reason why we cannot complete action on this, go to \nconference with the House and get a really good bill.\n  As I have indicated, since 1985 there have been no fewer than seven \nefforts to enact measures to provide for the separate enrollment of \nbills. That is separate enrollment of bills. And in the past there have \nbeen legitimate issues raised as to whether or not appropriations \nmeasures should be the only bills subject to this new procedure.\n  In the view of Senators Stevens, Bradley, and others, all spending \nshould be subject to review, whether it be the expansion of an \nentitlement or creation of a new entitlement or creation of a new tax \nbreak. This substitute covers all three. It is going to cover \neverything.\n  Some have suggested we could never define the term ``item'' when you \ntalk about line item. Our substitute tries to ensure that sufficient \ndetail is provided in each bill so these determinations can be fairly \nand clearly made.\n  Is this substitute perfect? Probably not. There may be some good \nideas on change, maybe here, maybe in the conference. But it moves us \nin the right direction. And in my view it does not change the balance \nbetween the legislative branch and the executive branch. Both sides \nhave the opportunity to lay out their priorities and subject them to \nthe review of the other branch. The President retains his authority to \nveto, and we retain our authority to override such a veto.\n  Will it put additional pressure on us to review and defend those \nspecial projects and new programs? You bet it will. That is what this \ndebate is all about. That is what the American people expect. And, \nagain, the American people are not Democrats and Republicans or \nIndependents. The American people support this measure. That is what it \nshould do, and that is what it should be about.\n  There has been strong bipartisan support for the line-item veto. It \npassed the House 294 to 134. It has been voted on in various forms in \nthe Senate in the past and received the support of many of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, including my colleague from \nDelaware, Senator Biden, Senator Exon from Nebraska, Senator Heflin \nfrom Alabama, Senator Hollings from South Carolina, Senator Kennedy \nfrom Massachusetts, Senator Leahy from Vermont, Senator Nunn from \nGeorgia, Senator Pell from Rhode Island, and others. In fact, I have \nnoted--I think the Senator from New Mexico will touch on it--a vote in \nthe Budget Committee where they had separate enrollments where I think \nat least five or six Democrats on the Budget Committee supported that \napproach.\n  So I just hope that we are not going to get into any political \ndebate, that this will be a debate on the line-item veto. Certainly \nthere are probably questions that should be raised. We have gone \nthrough one political debate in the balanced budget amendment. In my \nview, we do not need another one right now. There should be a vote on \nthis measure, and it should be soon.\n  I think whatever way the vote comes out, the people are going to know \nwhere we stand. We know where they stand. They think they know where we \nstand. They believe that on this measure there will be strong \nbipartisan support. I happen to believe they are right, unless there is \nsomething I have not factored into this entire equation.\n  It is an issue we are familiar with. We have debated it. We have \ndiscussed it. We have had hearings and hearings and hearings. It seems \nto me now it is time to act.\n  I would just speak for my colleagues on this side of the aisle. I \nthink it is safe to say 10 days ago we were sort of all over the lot. \nDifferent people had different views, and they were strongly held \nviews. But again, by sitting down and working together--and we give \ncredit to our staff for their help and their ideas--we have been able \nto come together. As I said, I think every Republican is now prepared \nto vote for cloture if cloture is necessary. And nearly every \nRepublican, I think, is prepared to vote for the bill--not every \nRepublican but nearly every one. So we have made a great deal of \nprogress, and we believe that, as I said, now is the time to act.\n  I would just conclude by again specially thanking the following \nSenators. Certainly Senator McCain has been out on this floor year \nafter year after year after year, and when you see him coming you know \nit is probably about the line-item veto because he feels that strongly \nabout it, and he is going to keep on coming. We hope this is his last \ntrip so he can go on to something else like Social Security. This time \nhe is going to succeed, in my view.\n  Senator Coats has been right there with him. They have stuck \ntogether, and they have worked and they have worked. They have had a \nlittle different view than some other of my colleagues like Senator \nDomenici from New Mexico and Senator Stevens from Alaska, but as I have \nindicated, because of their dedication, because of all their efforts \nand the outstanding assistance we have had from the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Senator Domenici, and Senator Stevens, who had a lot \nof reservations about this, worried about having it apply to a certain \namount of the appropriations --about what, 16 percent of the budget? He \ndid not think that was going to be very effective, and he convinced a \nnumber of our colleagues--in fact, all of our colleagues--it was not \nvery effective so we have made appropriate changes.\n  We believe it is a good proposal, and I hope that we would have as \nstrong a vote on this as we had on congressional coverage. It was 98 to \n1. Or if not that strong, maybe as strong as the unfunded mandates bill \nthat passed the Senate 86 to 10. This should be another one of those \nmeasures where we come together and we vote and the American people are \nthe beneficiaries.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have listened to the words of our \nmajority leader. The first thought that comes to mind is what a \ndifference a year makes. I do not recall how many times over the course \nof the last couple of years our Republican colleagues would come to the \nfloor and criticize, sometimes bitterly, the majority leader at the \ntime for laying a bill down that nobody on the other side had seen, a \nbill that in their view did not have hearings, or a bill that was not \nthe subject of any negotiations between Republicans and Democrats.\n  I can recall on health care being held for weeks and months, simply \nbecause there was a very complicated piece of legislation that they \nsaid ought to be examined, needed to be looked through, and needed to \nbe thoughtfully considered.\n  The times have changed and the situation is different than it was a \nyear ago. This is a different piece of legislation, but the issue is \nthe same. There ought to be overwhelming bipartisan support for a line-\nitem veto. I do not think there is any serious debate about that. \nDemocrats and Republicans want a line-item veto. I think there is \nbroad, bipartisan support for the concept of a line-item veto.\n  The majority leader says that he hopes we can get bipartisan support \nfor this proposal. But I guess I have to ask how badly they want \nbipartisan support when we have not been involved in these \nnegotiations; we have not had any opportunity to see this provision \nuntil it has now been laid down. There have been no discussions with \nDemocrats with regard to this particular proposal. So if, indeed, there \nis a true desire for bipartisan cooperation, that is an unfortunate way \nto make that fact known.\n  The majority leader also made the comment that this proposal will \nsubmit all expenditures to line-item veto--all expenditures. I hope \nthat is accurate. As I understand it, there is a question about ``all'' \nexpenditures. That is one reason I think it will be very helpful for us \nto have the opportunity to talk through, think through, and work \nthrough this legislation pertaining to an ``item.'' As I understand it, \nsome of the tax provisions that may be on the list of priorities for \nour colleagues on the Republican side include capital gains, but I am \ntold capital gains and a number of other tax provisions that will \nclearly be defined as expenditures--in this case, tax expenditures--\nwould not be included in this particular provision of the bill. So we \nwill have to take a good look at whether everything is on the table or \nnot.\n   [[Page S4191]] What we do know is this: Two pieces of legislation \npassed through the Budget Committee and the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. They were the subject of hearings. They were the subject of \na markup. We had a good debate, and they were presented to the floor in \na way that is the accepted practice here in the Senate. And we now know \nthose bills and all the work the committees have done apparently is for \nnaught. That is not going to be considered here. What is going to be \nconsidered is some compromise--that has generated a good deal of \nsupport on the other side--that we have not seen. There have been no \nhearings. There was no markup. There was no opportunity for committees \nto even consider this particular piece of legislation, at least this \nyear.\n  The majority leader indicates that this has been a proposal that has \nbeen around since 1985. Nearly half of the current membership of the \nSenate was not here in 1985 and have not had the opportunity to \nconsider a proposal which would involve the individual enrollment of \nevery single line item before it is sent to the President.\n  That, too, reminds me of the comments made last year about the \npaperwork involved with the 1,300-page health bill. They felt we ought \nto be able to reduce all that paperwork and send something simple to \nthe President. Now we have some colleagues who are saying we do not \nwant to send something simple, we want to send something complicated. \nWe do not want to send something short, we want to send something that \nmay involve 2,000 or 3,000 pages.\n  We will have a good debate about all of this, but I do urge all of my \ncolleagues to take great care before they make any decisions about \nwhether this legislation is what the Senate wants to sign into law; \nbefore we make any conclusions as to whether everything is on the \ntable; whether this is the most practical; whether, indeed, there is \nopportunity for bipartisan support for this particular version.\n  What I hope will not happen is that we will be told to accept this \nversion or no version at all; that we either take this or we are not \ngoing to have a line-item veto. I hope that does not happen because, as \nI said, I think there is very strong support for the concept of a line-\nitem veto. Simply to say it is this one or nothing certainly does not \nreflect what I hope will be the opportunities we have to work together \non a whole range of issues. We should not be told that it is this or \nnothing, that there is no other version that is acceptable when so many \nMembers on both sides of the aisle have supported other versions, have \nsupported other approaches, and might have ways in which to improve \neven this particular piece of legislation.\n  So I know that all of my colleagues on this side of the aisle will \nlook with great interest at the provisions of this bill and will have \nmore to say as the days this week unfold. Certainly it will be my hope \nas well that we could finish this week. There is no reason why, given \nthe broad amount of support, that we could not finish. But part of \nwhether or not we finish depends on the degree to which there is \ngenuine cooperation, genuine interest in bipartisanship, and whether we \nhave an ability to better understand what some of these concepts \nactually include.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me say the distribution of time and the \nmanagement of the bill on this side will be by the Senator from \nArizona, Senator McCain, or his designee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before the majority leader leaves the \nfloor I want to thank him for his leadership on this bill, without \nwhich we could not have come together with the differing views that \nwere strongly held by very respected members of the Republican \nconference. I would like to thank him, in his leadership, for making \nthe 54 Members on this side committed to voting for cloture, and I \nthink making what was a very difficult situation just a few days ago, \nthe enactment of line-item veto, very possible.\n  Also, I might add that the chief of staff of the majority leader, \nSheila Burke, did an enormous amount of work, many hours of meetings \nand writing specific language. I would like to thank her for all she \ndid in this effort. I would also like to thank Senator Domenici. I \nwould also like to thank Senator Stevens. I would also like to thank my \npartner, Senator Coats, who has labored with me for so long on this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I will not talk a long time because I know Senator \nCoats would like to make some remarks and also Senator Domenici, who \nreally knows the details of many of these issues. I know Senator \nDomenici will spend a little bit of time talking about the specific tax \nprovisions, since he has many years of experience on that aspect of the \nbill.\n  I would just like to say in response to the minority leader--and I \nappreciate his remarks, and I appreciate his willingness to look at \nthis legislation. I hope he and other Members on the other side of the \naisle will heed the President's message that he wants and he wants soon \na very strong line-item veto bill; the strongest, in the words of the \nPresident of the United States.\n  There will be a question about constitutionality. We will have \nopinions of respected constitutional scholars about the \nconstitutionality of an enrolled item and an enrolled bill. We will be \nable to, I think, satisfy the concerns of the Members of this body \nabout that.\n  I think there will be questions raised about the degree that the \ntargeted tax benefits--how much that encompasses. I think we will be \nable to respond to that.\n  I look forward to a debate on the merits of this issue. I look \nforward to a debate that clearly will clear the way for expressing the \nwill of the people. Some 83 percent of the American people, in the last \npoll that I saw, support giving the President the line-item veto.\n  I want to return to one fundamental fact before I turn to the Senator \nfrom Indiana for a few remarks. Mr. President, in 1974, the deficit was \nminuscule, the debt was very small. In 1974, the Budget Impoundment Act \nwas passed, which deprived the President of the United States of the \nauthority to impound funds. At that time, from that time on, the \ndeficit and the debt, the annual deficit and the debt, exploded.\n  In 1974, our deficit was $6.135 billion. In 1994, it was $203 \nbillion. In 1974, the accumulated debt of nearly 200 years of American \nhistory was $483 billion. It is now projected in 1996 to be $5.2 \ntrillion. That did not happen by accident. It is because we shifted the \nbalance of power away from the executive branch to the legislative \nbranch. Mr. President, none of us can in good conscience lay a $5.2 \ntrillion debt on our children and grandchildren. We cannot do it. It is \ntime we brought it to a halt.\n  I want to finally say that we cannot balance the budget with a line-\nitem veto alone. I have no doubt or question about that. But we also \ncannot balance the budget without a line-item veto authority in the \nhands of the President of the United States.\n  We will have a lot more to say in the next few days. I want to thank \nagain the majority leader. My friend from New Mexico, who has a great \ndeal of expertise, perhaps more than anyone in this body on these \nissues, I appreciate his assistance in bringing about this final \nconclusion.\n  Mr. President, I yield whatever time he may consume to the Senator \nfrom Indiana and then yield whatever time he may consume to the Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, it is probably a little premature to be \noffering congratulations since we are just taking up the bill. But let \nme say that there has been an extraordinary amount of hard work, \neffort, and negotiation that has gone into this product that the \nmajority leader, Senator Dole, just proposed.\n  Individuals have held strong feelings and strong convictions about \nwhat line-item veto means and how it ought to be defined. It is the \nproduct of many, many years of involvement of the various individuals \nin attempting to find ways to deal with a budget that almost seems \nintractable, to deal with a structural change in the way that the \nCongress does business, and in attempting to come up with a piece of \nlegislation which is bringing divergent interests--by the way all of \nthose interests trying to reach the same goal but just by different \nmeans. To bring \n [[Page S4192]] them together on one piece of legislation has not been \neasy. But because the individuals involved are committed to the final \ngoal, because they are committed to the principle that we have to be \nstewards of the taxpayer dollars, wise stewards, and that we have to \nmake every possible effort on behalf of the constituents we represent \nand the taxpayers who get up every Monday morning, who haul off to work \nand put in an honest day's work for an honest day's pay, because we \nhave a commitment to make sure that they do not have to send $1 more \nthan is necessary to Washington to perform the functions of the Federal \nGovernment as defined by the Constitution, as defined by what we \ndetermine are our vital national interests, we set aside some of our \nreservations and some of our concerns, and said, despite our ideas \nabout which path we should take, let us make sure we get to the goal \nline on this.\n  There are a lot of people that deserve a lot of credit, starting with \nthe majority leader, who has pulled us together on a number of \noccasions, keeps us in the same room around the same table, refuses to \ngive up, and keeps providing leadership that we need to function as a \nparty to bring legislation forward that has the support of our party.\n  Credit goes to Senator McCain who has been tireless. Anybody who \nknows Senator McCain knows that word ``tireless'' as defined in the \ndictionary has a new meaning. He has a dogged persistence, has had a \ndogged persistence and has one now, to pursue this effort, who will not \ntake no for an answer. He has been a great support and great help and \ninspiration to me as I have engaged in this process as I have been in \nthe Senate. It has been a pleasure to be a partner with him.\n  As I said, I believe, on Friday, sometimes you define character, and \nI use the foxhole test. If I am surrounded by the enemy and need \nsomebody with me in the foxhole, Senator McCain is someone I would like \nto go shoulder to shoulder with. So I appreciate his efforts.\n  Senator Domenici has been tireless in his efforts to work with us and \nto try to achieve a final solution to this question of whether or not \nwe can put a bill together that can enjoy broad Republican support. He \nhas done that. He has made available his expert staff, Bill Hoagland, \nand others. I hate to start giving staff too much credit because their \nwork is just starting and there is a long road to go. But Senator \nMcCain's staff and my staff, Senator Stevens', Senator Domenici's, and \nSenator Dole's staffs, and others who have worked on this have just put \nan extraordinary amount of time and effort into it.\n  Senator Domenici has worked with us in defining some of the ways in \nwhich this would impact the way we spend money, the way we apply taxes, \nnew programs, how new direct spending and entitlement spending takes \nplace. He has provided an expertise to us. It has been invaluable.\n  Senator Stevens was a catalyst for expanding this legislation to make \nsure that the line-item veto did not just apply to the narrow little \nslice of the budget, but applied to a broader part of the budget. It is \nfairer to do it that way, but it also accomplishes more of our purpose \nand our goal. We are able to apply the principle of the line-item veto \nto how we make decisions about spending the taxpayer dollars and what \nthe checks and balances will be as we move through the process. We will \napply that principle to a much broader range of spending, whether they \nbe tax expenditures or whether they be appropriations.\n  The Dole substitute adopts a structure for line-item veto which has \nbipartisan support. It requires that each item of spending and each \ntargeted tax be separately enrolled. The President may approve or veto \nthese items. But it utilizes two important principles:\n  First, the key principle, for which Senator McCain and I have fought \nso long, that is a real veto requiring two-thirds of the Congress to \noverride, to make it tough to pork-barrel spend, whether it is tax pork \nor spending pork, appropriations pork;\n  Second, it embodies principles which have been advocated by key \nleaders on the Democrat side of the aisle, individuals like Senator \nHollings, Senator Bradley, and Senator Biden, who have championed the \nvery idea and principle embodied in the concept and content of the bill \nwe are offering.\n  So we are not dropping something new, as the minority leader \nintimated. We are taking something that has been debated and discussed \nfor a considerable amount of time by key Democrat leaders, and we are \nembodying in that the principle of the bill we introduced. I think that \nis important because it provides for key bipartisanship and, hopefully, \nsupport.\n  This Dole substitute has the enthusiastic support of Republicans. \nThere are already 50 cosponsors of the bill, and we had a chance to \ntalk to the other four Republicans to have them look at the bill. But \nalready 50 of the 54 Republicans have signed up as cosponsors of this \nlegislation. We hope we will get even more support from the \nRepublicans, and we trust that we will get solid support from our \nfriends and colleagues across the aisle.\n  I am enthusiastic about the opportunity that we have to bring real \nfiscal discipline to the budget process. We are going to be able to go \nafter tax pork. We are going to be able to go after spending pork. We \nwill be able to go after and define those programs.\n  We are bringing accountability to the work that we do. We are going \nto have to come down here and do what the taxpayer expects us to do, \nstate right up front what we are doing, what it is going to cost, where \nthe money is going to be so we can make a judgment in terms of where we \nstand and in terms of spending dollars.\n  This will be the case until this is adopted. But previous to this, it \nhas been easy to hide items in the massive bills. I am not pointing \nfingers at anybody. We are all guilty. We all know we need to change \nthe way we do business.\n  So, Mr. President, I am pleased to join in this effort, to be a part \nof this effort. I look forward to debating this effort. Hopefully, \nbefore too long, we will be able to send a piece of legislation to the \nPresident after more than 130-some years which the Presidents have been \ncalling for, Members have been striving for, and something that I think \nwhose time has come. It is only five pages and one line long. As the \nmajority leader indicated, it is not going to take a whole lot of time \nto read and understand this bill. It is not like a 1,500-page health \nbill that the President dropped and then changed on a number of \noccasions. It is only five pages and one line long. It embodies the \nprinciples and ideas that have been debated on this floor over and over \nand over. They have been offered by Republicans and by Democrats. \nTruly, it is now supported by the President of the United States, who \nis calling for the toughest possible measure. I think, on that basis, \nwe can go forward and adopt something truly meaningful and make a real \nstructural change that will make a difference in the way this Congress \ndoes business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Republican \ncompromise on the line-item veto. The distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Dole, has put together an amendment that finds a middle ground \non this issue. I anticipate that we will need cloture to get this \nmeasure passed and I hope there is sufficient support from the other \nside of the aisle to bring this bill to a vote.\n  There are many variants of the so-called line-item veto. I think it \nis unfortunate that many have focused on the differences between the \ntwo approaches that Senator McCain and I have offered. Both the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona and I want to find a procedure to \nexpand the President's ability to extract low-priority spending from \nlegislation.\n  I want to spend just a moment and talk about Senator McCain's bill. I \nhave consistently voted in favor of procedural motions to give Senator \nMcCain a vote on his enhanced rescission proposal. I made line-item \nveto legislation a priority for my committee and moved quickly to hold \nhearings and report Senator McCain's bill, S. 4. Had the Budget \nCommittee not reported this bill, it would be subject to a point of \norder under the Budget Act. It would have taken 60 votes to waive this \npoint of order. By the Budget Committee's action, this point of order \ndoes not lie against this legislation. That has not been the case in \nthe past when \n [[Page S4193]] Senator McCain brought this legislation to the floor in \nthe form of an amendment to another piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I support the objectives of Senator McCain's bill, but \nI felt the McCain bill shifted too much power over the budget to the \nPresident and focused too much attention on just the appropriated \naccounts, which--excluding defense--represents less than 20 percent of \ntotal spending.\n  There will be a lot of discussion about the Dole amendment on this \nbill, but I want to focus on just three major advantages of this \namendment over the McCain enhanced rescission bill.\n\n\n   The Dole Amendment provides a less cumbersome process to overturn \n                        Presidential rescissions\n\n  The Dole amendment requires each spending item in legislation to be \nenrolled as a separate bill. If the President chose to veto one of \nthese items, each of these vetoes would be returned to Congress \nseparately for an override.\n  The McCain bill provided a much more cumbersome process for Congress \nto override a Presidential rescission. In order to overturn \nPresidential rescissions under the McCain bill, the Congress would have \nhad to overcome two hurdles.\n  First, each House of Congress would have had to pass a bill \ndisapproving all of the President's rescissions for an Appropriations \nAct within 20 days. Since the McCain bill prohibits amendments, the \nCongress would be stuck with an all-or-nothing proposition. Either vote \nto overturn all the President's rescissions for an Appropriations Act \nor let every one of the President's rescissions stand. More \nimportantly, the McCain bill's procedure did not guarantee a vote on \nthe disapproved bill.\n  Even if the Congress managed to pass the disapproval bill within the \nnarrow timeframe established by the bill, the President would veto this \ndisapproval resolution and Congress would have to overcome the second \nhurdle. Each House of Congress would have to override his veto with a \ntwo-thirds vote.\n  Under the McCain bill, this entire process, the passage of the \ndisapproval bill and the override of the President's veto, had to be \ncompleted in 30 days. I doubt Congress could complete all of this \naction within these timeframes. The result would be that Congress would \nnever even get a chance to vote on an override of a Presidential \nrescission. I believe this approach implicitly and in practical terms \ndelegated too much power to the President.\n  The distinguished minority leader has raised some legitimate concerns \nabout the enrolling process envisioned in the Dole amendment. Let me \nsay there need not be more trees cut down than are already cut down for \nexisting appropriations bills. The Dole amendment creates the same \namount of paper as now. It just is handed to the President in smaller \nstacks.\n               the dole amendment applies to all spending\n\n  The Dole amendment applies to all new spending in legislation, not \njust appropriations legislation. In addition, it applies to any new, \nvery narrow, targeted tax benefits in legislation.\n  A line-item veto on its own cannot balance the budget. None of the \nline-item veto bills apply to existing entitlement law, which is the \nclear culprit behind the deficit. Over the next 5 years, discretionary \nspending, that spending which is subject to the annual appropriations \nprocess, remains essentially unchanged. Entitlement spending explodes, \ngrowing by $334 billion, or 44 percent, over the next 5 years.\n  From a spending control perspective, the only portion of the budget \nthat is under control is discretionary spending--spending that is \nsubject to the annual appropriations process. A discretionary dollar \ncannot be spent unless it is approved by Congress. The Appropriations \nCommittee must comply with caps that are enforced by 60 vote Budget Act \npoints of order and MOB sequesters. Senator McCain's bill only applied \nto appropriations bills and did not apply to new entitlement spending.\n  Entitlement spending under existing law, on the other hand, is on \nautomatic pilot. There is no annual review required, no caps, and no \nenforcement mechanism to require a reduction in existing entitlement \nprograms. We do have a pay-as-you-go enforcement scheme that requires \nany new entitlement legislation to be paid for. The Dole amendment \nbuilds on that scheme by giving the President the opportunity to veto \nnew entitlement spending in legislation.\n  Congress has enacted major expansions in entitlement spending in \nrecent years. For example, President Clinton's 1993 reconciliation bill \nincluded $25.4 billion in new entitlement spending on everything from \nfood stamps to foreign language proficiency programs for customs \nofficers. Under the Dole bill, this type of new entitlement spending \nwould be enrolled separately and could be vetoed.\n  Mr. President, I have had trouble with the application of line-item \nvetoes to tax benefits. This concern stems primarily from how one \ndefines the term ``targeted tax benefits.'' On the other hand, I am \nvery much aware that sometimes these items referred to as pork-barrel \nspending in an appropriations bill can similarly be found as pork-\nbarrel tax benefits in a large tax bill.\n  The Dole amendment applies the separate enrollment discipline to \nthose cases in which special interest provisions are tucked away in a \ntax bill. Under the Dole amendment, only very narrow targeted tax \nbenefits, those provisions that benefit a defined group of taxpayers, \nwould be subject to the separate enrollment procedures.\n  If a Senator does not believe that new entitlement spending or \ntargeted tax benefits have been fully identified in a reported tax \nbill, the Dole amendment provides a means by which a Senator can \nchallenge the bill. If the Senator's point of order is sustained, the \nrelevant committee would have to fully flush out these provisions for \nseparate enrollment before the bill would be in order.\n\n\n          the dole amendment provides for congressional review\n\n  The Dole amendment sunsets this authority in 2000. We do not know how \nthese procedures will operate in practice. With this sunset date, after \n4 years of experience, Congress will have the opportunity to review \nthis new authority and its extension. If the President abuses the new \npowers we give him in this bill, Congress can address these abuses when \nthe bill comes up for reauthorization in 2000.\n  Mr. President, I think we should strengthen the President's ability \nto extract low-priority funding from legislation, but I think we need \nto be careful not to unduly disrupt the balance of powers among the \nbranches.\n  There is no greater power of a legislative body than the power over \nthe purse. We should be careful how much authority over the budget we \ndelegate to the President. James Madison said it best when he wrote in \nFederalist Paper No. 58:\n\n       This power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the \n     most complete and effectual weapon with which any \n     constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the \n     people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for \n     carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.\n\n  I congratulate Senator Dole. He has found an approach that \nsignificantly expands the President's authority over spending without \nunduly disrupting this delicate balance of power.\n  Mr. President, I believe when the Members of the U.S. Senate from the \nDemocratic side of the aisle have thoroughly examined this amendment, \nthey will be very hard pressed to oppose it. The minority leader \nsuggests this evening that this is some kind of a surprise because it \nis a full substitute for the previously reported bill or bills. That \nmay be the case technically, Mr. President and fellow Democrats. But \nthe truth of the matter is that every provision in this has either been \nvoted on by the U.S. Senate or discussed thoroughly in committee.\n  Let me just, as I tell you what is in the bill, make sure that \neverybody understands what happened with reference to those provisions \nheretofore.\n  First, this bill is built around conventional, ordinary vetoes that \nPresidents have had the authority to do forever. It is in the \nConstitution. They have authority to veto bills. All we are going to do \nherewith reference to appropriated accounts is say that we are going to \noffer appropriation bills in far more detail, with far more line items, \nso that the President can look at a very large bill, hundreds of pages, \nand find all of the items listed in the enrollment process and decide \nif he wants \n [[Page S4194]] to veto some, none, or many. Just like he would veto \nany bill that comes before him that he does not like.\n  Those vetoes would come to us and in an expedited manner, we would \nvote ``yes'' or ``no.''\n  From that side of the aisle, Senators Hollings, Exon, Simon, Conrad \nand Robb--that I am certain of--have voted for this approach to line-\nitem veto as members of the Budget Committee. When this approach came \nto the floor in the 1985 cycle, 58 Senators voted for it, which means \nat that point in the history of this Senate, there were more Democrats \nthan Republicans, so I am certain to get to 58, a number of Democrats \nvoted for it--the so-called Mattingly line-item veto.\n  Mr. President, there have been discussions from some Members on the \nother side who did not like the original versions of either the McCain \nbill or the Domenici bill, because essentially the President would \npackage his entire rescission list and send the whole thing up here and \nsay take it all or leave it all. Some Members on the other side of the \naisle, and some on our side, had said that is unfair. We should be \ngiven an up-or-down vote on our item. Is it not interesting that that \nis precisely what we have come up with.\n  For those who believe that an item that they were for, that gets \nvetoed by the President in this ordinary veto manner, deserved the \nattention of the Senate on that item alone, because some Senators \nfigured they might win it one item at a time, we have compromised and \nsaid, let us do it that way.\n  So for those Senators who think they may have some rather significant \npower for their project or their line item, they are going to get that \npresented freestanding. On the other hand, I might say, as a matter of \nprocess, that it is entirely possible that as we begin to work with \nthis, we might ourselves, in a voluntary manner, package some of these \nso we would eliminate a lot of votes. But that would be strictly up to \nthe U.S. Senate and the U.S. House.\n  Mr. President, that is one provision. I believe it is not new. I \nbelieve it has been thoroughly debated and voted on here, that it \nshould come as no surprise and should not cause Members on the other \nside of the aisle who have regularly said they are for line-item or \nitem veto; I do not think it should cause them too much difficulty in \nterms of comprehending it and making a decision rather quickly whether \nthey are for or against it.\n  Second, the idea that we were limiting the scope of what could be \nvetoed to just the appropriated accounts, which is less than 20 \npercent, perhaps as low as 16 percent of the expenditures of our \nGovernment, that idea and what follows naturally from it, that you \nshould try to expand it beyond that, is not new either. As a matter of \nfact, in the Budget Committee this year, the bill which I presented \nthere had both new entitlements or mandatory expenditures and expanded \nones, subject to a line-item veto. It did not pass there, but it was \nthoroughly debated and because there was not bipartisan support, it got \nleft out of the bill. But it was discussed and it is clearly \nunderstood. Any Senator that wants to broaden the scope of how we might \ncontrol unneeded expenditures will have no difficulty understanding it.\n  It has nothing to do with existing entitlements. Nobody should fear \nthat. It will do nothing to existing programs that are mandatory in \nnature. But it says during the existence of this new line-item veto \nlegislation, if you are going to put in new entitlements or expand \nexisting ones, the committee of jurisdiction must do it separately and \nput it in a separate part of the bill, enumerate it as such, and then \nwe are making it subject to a Presidential veto as a separate piece of \nlegislation.\n  I do not believe anybody ought to be worried about that. It is not \neasy today under the rules of the Senate and budget rules to pass new \nentitlements anyway. But if you choose to, they will get caught up in a \nthorough debate of being isolated from the rest of a big bill and \nlooked at separately and subject to veto separately. I might add, Mr. \nPresident, the way this bill is drafted, when a major piece of \nlegislation comes to the floor on entitlements, if the committee of \njurisdiction does not separate out into separate paragraphs new ones or \nexpanded ones, it is subject to a point of order here. A Senator can \nraise the issue and say let us send it back to the committee until they \nisolate it so it may be looked at under the fine microscope of a \npotential line-item veto. I do not see anything wrong with that.\n  I believe if we are really worried about deficits and unnecessary \nspending, we ought to do that. Mr. President, there will be some on the \nother side of the aisle and perhaps some on this side who would say we \nare not for including entitlements unless you include tax breaks that \nare targeted and of special interest. I am not now speaking about tax \nlaw changes of general application. I am not speaking of capital gains, \nof a rate decrease for everyone. I am not speaking of those that apply \nto a large group of people.\n  What we are talking about is tax breaks for a small group of people \nwhere they are being treated differently than the rest of the class \nthat they belong to. So that if you separated out a business, but did \nnot cover all businesses, or you separated out a company, but not \ncompanies, those kind of tax breaks are going to be subject to the \nexact same rules that I just defined for entitlements.\n  A tax bill will have to separate them out, put them in separate \nparagraphs, so they can also be looked at with a microscope, with the \nprospect of, are they really needed in the national interest or, if \nthey are special interests, are they of such significant special \ninterest that the President should not veto them? I believe that offers \nthe right kind of balance.\n  And I might suggest for those on the other side wondering what kind \nof bill have we wrought here tonight, we have voted on the floor of the \nSenate for tax expenditure inclusion within a line-item veto. In fact, \nSenator Bradley offered it. I do not know its scope, but it is not new. \nI do not remember precisely its scope, but my recollection is it \npassed. We voted on it.\n  And, yes, Mr. President, the Budget Committee deliberated and \ndiscussed it. Why do I know that? Because it, too, was in the \nalternative approach to the line-item veto that I had. So it is not new \neither.\n  If there are some who want to discuss the language and how we \ninterpret it and can we make it more precise, obviously that is what \nthe Senate floor and the amendment process is all about. And that \nprovision is subject to some discussion. But I might say, for everyone \nthat wants to broaden the scope of that, there are some who want to \nmake it more narrow. For there are some on this side of the aisle and \nsome on the other who do not think raising taxes is really the solution \nto fiscal responsibility and budget soundness.\n  So, this, too, is a compromise, trying to make it targeted, special \ninterest tax breaks. And when you add that together, you have a much \nmore powerful, much more powerful, approach to the effectiveness of a \nPresident's pen in vetoing, in an item manner, all of the things that \naffect the budget and the budget deficit that are of special interest \nor expansive in terms of increasing our deficit.\n  And then, last but not least, there have been some who question \nwhether this will all work out. Are we giving Presidents, whether it is \nthis version or other versions, too much power? We have something that \nought to be taken into consideration by that kind of Senator with that \nkind of concern also. Because there are many of us who are not sure \nprecisely how an item veto is going to work, even the one we have \noffered here on the floor. So what we have done is we have provided \nthat this law will sunset in the year 2000. That means we will try it. \nWe will look at it. We will observe it. And come the year 2000--that is \nnot too many years away--we will see whether it has worked. Has it been \nabused? Are there loopholes in it? Is it too inclusive?\n  And we can pass a new one or deny Presidents in the future this \nauthority based upon the fact that it has not worked, it has taken away \ntoo much, or it has given the President too much bargaining power, \nwhatever the case may be.\n  Now some may say, ``Why do you need to do that?'' Remember, if we do \nnot have that in here, then if we want to change it in the future, we \nhave to change it in accordance with the President's desire, because, \nobviously, he would veto changes that he did not \n [[Page S4195]] want and we would be stuck with two-thirds to pass \nchanges because we would have to override a veto.\n  So we have solved that problem. We will try it for a long enough \nperiod of time to make sure that it has really been given an \nopportunity to work and then we will trust the legislators and \nPresidents to decide precisely what they want to do about it after that \nperiod from now until the year 2000.\n  So, essentially, I say to those on the other side of the aisle, and I \nsay this with all sincerity, I hope they will look carefully at this \nbefore they decide to try to defeat it by filibuster. Obviously, it is \nsubject to amendment. And nobody on our side that has worked diligently \nto get this bill to this stage thinks that there is nothing that ought \nto be changed and there is nothing to talk about.\n  But I believe this is as close as we will ever get to a fair line-\nitem veto that has a chance of working and that is broader than we \noriginally conceived but fair in that respect. It is fair and will be \nused fairly, we hope.\n  So the ball is in the Democrats' court and in the President's court. \nClearly, I do not think the President's support today was as specific \nas I hoped. But maybe by tomorrow he will support this bill.\n  But I will suggest that if there are some who think that the old bill \nwhich I had introduced should be revisited and perhaps the President \nsupports it, let me set that one aside. At the National League of \nCities, the President answered very different than his staff did in our \nBudget Committee where he said he would take either one. The President \nanswered before the mayors and councilmen of America that he wanted the \nMcCain amendment. So it seems to me that he wants a real veto. And that \nis what we have here.\n  While not the McCain amendment in its original form, all the changes \nI have described to bring many Senators on board and make it fairer and \nthe 2000 sunset which makes it more palatable to others, but the basic \nphilosophy seems to me to be what the President said he wanted.\n  So I only hope that within the next 48 hours or 72 hours, we will get \na real answer. Are they for it or not? Do they want the line-item veto \nor not? Does the President want it or not? And I do not think it is \ngoing to take a long time for everybody to find out whether they do or \ndo not.\n  I wish to thank the Republicans on our side who helped put this \ntogether. I think it is a very good piece of legislative work and it \ndeserves to be passed. Let us hope in a few days we will give the \nAmerican people the benefit of this, go to the House and give the \nPresident a line-item veto as prescribed here. I think we will all be \nthe better for it, and the people will get what the overwhelming \nmajority think we really ought to do as far as fiscal responsibility \nand not passing things that are truly not needed by the people of this \ncountry.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding and I yield the floor\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank again the Senator from New Mexico \nwhose invaluable assistance made this possible. I look forward as he \nfights the battle of the budget, as he brings forth within a month or \ntwo a budget that will really implement many of the savings that are \nabsolutely necessary if we are able to achieve fiscal responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I intend to be relatively brief. I appreciate the \nremarks of the distinguished Democratic leader. I would say that this \nis not a new issue. This bill was introduced in the 99th Congress. \nHearings were held in the committee and, as we know, the motion to \nproceed was filibustered. Fifty-three Members of the Senate who are \nhere today, a majority of them were here then. This same legislation, \nas far as enrolled items is concerned, has been reintroduced every \nCongress since then. In 1990, on July 25, when the Senate was \ncontrolled by the other side, the Budget Committee favorably reported \nthis bill. And, finally, during the 103d Congress, the Senate voted on \na sense-of-the-Senate regarding this issue. So, it is not exactly a new \nissue.\n  On the subject of not being able to be consulted on bills that come \nup, I might remind my colleagues that this legislation--health care \nlegislation--was introduced without hearing and without consultation \nwith this side of the aisle just last year during the health care \ndebate. It was known as Mitchell 3, not to be confused with Mitchell 1 \nand Mitchell 2, which was somewhat smaller.\n  Mr. President, I would suggest that an argument could be made--this \nbeing Mitchell 3 and this being the bill considered before us, five \npages and one additional line--that there is a significant difference \nbetween Members trying to understand Mitchell 3, which I believe was \n1,400-some pages, versus this legislation, which is five pages and one \nsentence in its entirety.\n  So I hope that my colleagues will have plenty of time to read and \ndigest this particular five-page legislation.\n I hope we will be able to have a spirited but relatively brief debate \nso we can move on to other issues.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to point out one fact that is \ntrue, that is absolutely true: This is a shift in power. This is a \nfundamental change in the way that our Government does business.\n  Have no doubt as to the seriousness of this issue. This will allow \nthe President of the United States, fundamentally, to veto not only an \nappropriations bill but also a tax bill, increase entitlement or new \nentitlement. It does shift that power.\n  I believe that there is every opportunity for this power to be \nmisused from time to time. I also believe, Mr. President, that a $5.2 \ntrillion deficit debt which is projected for next year is something \nthat is unacceptable. We need to give back to the executive branch \nenough power so that we can exercise fiscal discipline, which we have \nbeen unable to do in the last 21 years since the Budget Impoundment Act \nwas passed in 1974.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I just want to speak in favor of this \nbill. I am very pleased that all of the parties have come together. I \nwant to compliment the Senator from Arizona who is on the floor now, \nalong with the Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats, and Senator Dole, \nthe majority leader, for bringing everyone together and talking about \nthis very important issue.\n  We failed to pass the balanced budget amendment a few weeks ago. It \nwas a great disappointment to many of us because we felt that the \nbalanced budget amendment would force Congress not only now but future \nCongresses that will meet to make sure they never spend our children's \nmoney and our grandchildren's money.\n  We did not pass that, but I do think there is a firm resolve among a \nmajority of Members that we should balance the budget. One of the key \ntools to balancing a budget, to bringing spending under control is the \nline-item veto. This is a bill that will affect Democrats and \nRepublicans alike. It is something that we ought to all come together \nto do, and that is to say that the President should have the right to \nlook in a bill and determine what the priorities might be. I think the \nPresident should have a right to veto a bill without shutting down \nthree agencies of Government, which is what the President would have to \ndo now.\n  If Congress disagrees with the President's judgment, we have the \nability to overturn the President, as we would overturn any veto. I \nthink that is the right approach. I think the Senators have done a \nsuperior job to give us the tools we need to balance this budget. Even \nthough we do not have a balanced budget amendment, we can balance the \nbudget if we have resolve. The way to do that is to pass the line-item \nveto.\n  So I hope that all of us will put our party aside and say, ``If we \nare going to be serious about balancing the budget of our country and \ndoing what is right, we have to have all the tools available in the \nparliamentary process to do that.'' One of the most important is the \nline-item veto.\n   [[Page S4196]] So I commend my colleagues who have worked on this. \nSenator McCain has worked on this for years, years and years. He has \nbeen very patient. He is not necessarily known for his patience but, in \nfact, his patience in this is going to prevail, I think, and we are \ngoing to back him up. We are going to back up the majority leader. We \nare going to make sure that nothing keeps the Senate from doing what is \nright.\n  They have come up with a bill that is the right approach, and I \ncommend them for it. I will be here supporting them in every way that I \ncan.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Texas, an \nold and dear friend who I had the privilege of campaigning with across \nthe State of Texas on several occasions.\n  The Senator from Texas promised the people of Texas that she would do \neverything in her power to get our financial house in order in \nWashington. She has been dedicated to that proposition. Her entire \ncareer in public service has been dedicated to that proposition. I am \nvery appreciative that she should lend her support or advice and \ncounsel on this very important issue.\n  So I want to extend my appreciation to the Senator from Texas, and \nalso I know she will be very active in the next few days as we debate \nthis issue. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/20/senate-section/article/S4187-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, President Clinton's decision to attend a \nsummit meeting in Moscow in May is the latest in a series of ill-\nadvised foreign policy actions that have been set-backs for U.S. \nleadership in world affairs. This one will be perceived as an implicit \nshow of support for the policies of the Russian Government. It will be \ninterpreted as an endorsement of: First, Russian aggression in \nChechnya; second, nuclear sales to Iran; and third, meddling by Russian \nagents in the affairs of former Soviet Republics.\n  Two months ago, I had the privilege of meeting with Elena Bonner, a \nlongtime acquaintance and courageous fighter against the tyranny of the \nSoviet Union during the darkest days of the cold war. Mrs. Bonner paid \na much higher price than most in battling the Soviet Government. As the \nwife and partner of the late Andrei Sakharov she was severely harassed \nfor years, and exiled under house arrest in a provincial Russian city. \nThis brave lady bore the grief of watching the stress and turmoil of \nSoviet oppression that inflicted an early end to the life of her \nhusband before what would have been his crowning moment--the collapse \nof the Soviet Union.\n  So why, Mr. President, was Mrs. Bonner in Washington? She came on \nshort notice because decency demanded it. She was here to criticize the \npolicy of the United States which has virtually ignored a degree of \nrepression and violation of human rights in Russia that is without \nprecedent since the time of Josef Stalin. As Mrs. Bonner recounted for \nme the violence and devastation in Chechnya I came to the conclusion \nthat not only are the internal policies of the Russian Government out \nof control, but that United States policy toward Russia has completely \nlost its bearings.\n  Recently President Yeltsin shook the Clinton administration with his \nthreat to renew the cold war under the guise of a cold peace. Any \nastute observer would have already heard this message in the many \nnegative actions of the Russian Government before and since that \nthreat.\n  Two weeks ago a spokesman for the Russian Government publicly warned \nPresident Clinton of the dire results if the President canceled the \nMoscow summit. The summit meeting is set to coincide with the 50th \nanniversary of the Russian victory over Germany in World War II. If the \nPresident canceled his visit--so goes the logic of the Russian \nGovernment--the Russians would be reminded that American forces refused \nto open a second front against Germany early in World War II.\n  Mr. President, this revisionist history comes directly from the \nStalin era. According to Stalin, the United States let Russia bear the \nbrunt of the German assault in World War II while dallying elsewhere. \nThis lie, perpetuated by Stalin to cover his own complicity for \ndevastating Russian casualties in World War II, and to deny his profane \nagreement with Adolf Hitler to conquer and divide Europe, has been \nrefuted by every post-war United States administration until now. \nUnbelievably, the Clinton administration has not only failed to condemn \nthis historical lie, they have agreed to commemorate it in Moscow.\n  If President Clinton wished to truly celebrate the 50th anniversary \nof victory over Germany perhaps he should go to Warsaw, where the Red \nArmy patiently waited to press its offensive until Nazi forces \nexterminated the Polish anti-Communist resistance fighters. The \nPresident could visit the Baltic Nations to remember the 50-year Soviet \noccupation put in place by the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.\n  A Russian politician recently visiting the Foreign Relations \nCommittee reminisced about the talent of past American Presidents in \nconveying a sense of warmth to the Russian people while simultaneously \nmaintaining a principled stand against the nondemocratic Soviet \nGovernment. Through diplomacy, communications such as Radio Free \nEurope, and public condemnation when necessary, the United States \nmaintained a constant pressure on the Soviet Government to respond to \nthe interests of its own people. This message was clearly understood by \nthe Russian people, and it won the United States the deserved \nreputation as a defender of their liberty. By agreeing to go to Moscow \nwhile the war rages on in Chechnya President Clinton has done great \ndamage to that hard earned reputation.\n  The muted response from the United States Government to the disaster \nin Chechnya is in direct conflict to numerous Russian politicians with \nunimpeachable and consistent pro-reform credentials who oppose \nPresident Yeltsin's policy. We have failed to support the reformers in \nRussia. I would even argue that we have failed to support the good \npeople of Russia--who stand 4 to 1 against this terrible civil war. \nUltimately, however, we have failed ourselves. How has the U.S. \nGovernment strayed so far the principles of its people?\n  Mr. President, President Clinton's decision to attend hold this \nsummit is a mistake. I regret that the President and his advisors \ndeclined to reconsider it when some of us pleaded that he not go.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/20/senate-section/article/S4196-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4196-S4197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MOYA OLSEN LEAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

She is a \nbright, determined, outgoing woman, for whom I have great admiration \nand respect. I wish her a very happy birthday.\n  Moya Lear is an inspiration to all who know her. She has taught \nthose \n [[Page S4197]] around her that perseverance and hard work are the most \neffective avenues to success. After the death of her husband Bill, Moya \ntook over as chairman of the LearAvia Corp. and led the company to \noutstanding prosperity.\n  One of her best known business accomplishments was the completion of \nthe Lear Fan aircraft, a longtime dream and project of her husband. She \nvowed to get the Lear Fan flying before 1981. Moya overcame significant \nfunding difficulties, and on December 3, 1980 she fulfilled her promise \nand christened the first flight of the Lear Fan aircraft.\n  Her energetic, honest approach to business is coveted by universities \nand corporations throughout the United States. Moya maintains a busy \nschedule speaking to future business people across the country.\n  Some of my fondest memories are the hours I spent with Bill at his \nStead office and with Bill and Moya at their beautiful home on the \nTruckee River. Moya has always been, of course, a most generous host. \nHer ability to make people comfortable and happy needs to be saluted.\n  Again, I wish Moya a very happy birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/20/senate-section/article/S4196-4", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, for about 3 years I have been making daily \nreports to the Senate regarding the exact Federal debt as of the \nprevious day.\n  We must pray that this year, Federal spending will finally begin to \nbe reduced. Indeed, if we care about America's future, Congress simply \nmust face up to its responsibility to balance the Federal budget.\n  As of the close of business Friday, March 17, the Federal debt \nstood--down to the penny--at $4,841,551,787,157.03, meaning that on a \nper capita basis, every man woman, and child in America owes $18,378.61 \nas his or her share of the Federal debt.\n  It's important to note, Mr. President, that the United States had an \nopportunity to begin controlling the Federal debt by implementing a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Unfortunately, the \nSenate did not seize their first opportunity to control this debt--but \nrest assured they will have another chance during the 104th Congress.\n  If the Senate does not concentrate on getting a handle on this \nenormous debt, their constituents are not likely to overlook it 2 years \nhence.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/20/senate-section/article/S4197-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    REPORT OF THE DESIGNATION OF THE WEST BANK AND GAZA STRIP AS A \nBENEFICIARY OF THE GENERALIZED SYSTEM OF PREFERENCES--MESSAGES FROM THE \n              PRESIDENT RECEIVED DURING THE RECESS--PM 34\n\n  Under the authority of the order of January 4, 1995, the Secretary of \nthe Senate, on March 17, 1995, during the recess of the Senate, \nreceived the following message from the President of the United States, \ntogether with accompanying papers; which were referred to the Committee \non Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am writing to inform you of my intent to designate the West Bank \nand Gaza Strip as a beneficiary of the Generalized System of \nPreferences (GSP).

A bill to limit assistance for Turkey under the Foreign \nAssistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act until that \ncountry complies with certain human rights standards; to the Committee \non Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                  turkish human rights compliance act\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich will help restore credibility to our foreign assistance program \nby ensuring that one of the largest recipients of United States aid, \nthe Republic of Turkey, adheres to internationally accepted standards \nfor human rights and humanitarian practices.\n  The time has come, after years of fruitless quiet diplomacy, for the \nCongress to take the lead in addressing a broad range of issues dealing \nwith Turkey, including its worsening human rights record, its continued \nblockade of humanitarian supplies to Armenia, its refusal to work \ntoward a lasting and equitable settlement in Cyprus, its denial of \nbasic rights to its Kurdish minority, and its continued persecution of \nChristian communities in Turkey. The hundreds of millions of dollars \nthat the United States sends to Turkey each year provides us with the \nnecessary leverage to bring about positive change in each of these five \nareas.\n  In each of these areas, Turkey has consistently violated \ninternational treaties and agreements to which it is a signatory. Among \nthese are the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the final act \nof the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the \nEuropean Convention on Human Rights.\n  The Congress, in the fiscal year 1995 foreign aid bill, withheld 10 \npercent of the principal amount of direct loans for Turkey based on its \nhuman rights record and the situation in Cyprus. The Turkish Government \nhas spoken clearly on this issue--they will reject any United States \naid tied to its human rights record. While the de-linking of United \nStates assistance and human rights may be in the interests of the \nTurkish Government, it is surely not in the interest of the United \nStates or the international community. It is clear, given the Turkish \nGovernment's response, that we must move beyond symbolism and \nfundamentally reassess our relationship with Turkey.\n  On the question of human rights, we need only to look at the State \nDepartment's recently released 1995 country reports on human rights, to \nsee that years and even decades of behind the scenes efforts by the \nState Department have not produced any improvement in the human rights \nsituation in Turkey. This report concludes, in fact, that ``the human \nrights situation in Turkey worsened significantly in 1994.''\n  Mr. President, the full spectrum of human rights monitoring \norganizations have condemned Turkey for its systematic and widespread \nabuse of human rights, including the use of torture. Amnesty \nInternational, Human Rights Watch, the U.N. Committee Against Torture, \nthe European Parliament, the International Human Rights Law Group, the \nLawyers Committee for Human Rights, Physicians Without Frontiers, \nFreedom House, the humanitarian law project, the Turkish Human Rights \nAssociation, and other organizations have documented the deteriorating \nhuman rights situation in Turkey.\n  My legislation would link the level of United States assistance to\n   Turkey's willingness to allow free and unfettered monitoring of the \nhuman rights environment within its territory by domestic and \ninternational human rights monitoring organizations. Among the groups \nwhich have been denied full access in the past are the Turkish Human \nRights Association, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \nEurope, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch.\n\n  I would like to address Kurdish rights, or lack thereof. Nowhere is \nthe case for cutting aid to Turkey more compelling than on the question \nof the Kurds. To this day, Turkey continues to deny the very existence \nof its 15 million Kurdish citizens. The Turkish military has \nsystematically emptied over 2,000 Kurdish villages and uprooted over a \nmillion Kurdish citizens from their homes. The Turkish Government's \nsystematic and deliberate eradication of the Kurdish identity within \nits borders is, in many ways, a high-technology version of the \nmassacres and deportations of the Armenian genocide earlier this \ncentury.\n  If Turkey is to continue benefiting from the generosity of the \nAmerican taxpayer, it must take demonstrable steps toward the full \nrecognition of the civil, cultural, and human rights of its Kurdish \ncivilians and demonstrate that it will resolve the Kurdish question \npeacefully.\n  Important too is the question of Cyprus which remains unresolved more \nthan 20 years after Turkey's illegal 1974 invasion of the island \nnation. Despite countless U.N. resolutions and international \nagreements, Turkey continues its illegal military occupation and has \nobstructed efforts toward a peaceful settlement. The division of the \nisland and the massive uprooting of Greek Cypriots caused by the 1974 \ninvasion remain a constant reminder of the failure of the international \ncommunity to enforce a lasting and equitable resolution to the \nconflict.\n  The Turkish Government must take demonstrable steps toward the total \nwithdrawal of its military forces from Cyprus. In addition, Turkey must \ndemonstrate its support for a settlement recognizing the sovereignty \nand territorial integrity of Cyprus with a constitutional democracy \nbased on majority rule, the rule of law and the protection of minority \nrights.\n  Mr. President, I must state that the failure of quiet diplomacy on \nthe part of the State Department is nowhere more apparent than in its \nfailure to lift the Turkish blockade of humanitarian aid to Armenia. In \nviolation of international law and in defiance of the United Nations, \nTurkey continues to blockade its border with Armenia. For close to 2 \nyears, the Turkish Government has refused to allow desperately needed \nUnited States and other international assistance reach the people of \n [[Page S4200]] Armenia. Unable to cross Turkish territory or transit \nits airspace, relief supplies have been re-rerouted through Georgia, \nwhere due to widespread instability, large portions of the aid has been \neither lost or stolen.\n  The United States simply can not tolerate the obstruction of its \nhumanitarian relief efforts by another recipient of its foreign aid. \nUntil the blockade is lifted, the provisions in this bill cutting the \nlevel of United States assistance to Turkey would be in force.\n  The Turkish Government continues to place prohibitive restrictions on \nthe Christian communities within Turkey. Among the communities which \nhave suffered from official persecution are the Armenians, Greeks, \nSyrian Orthodox, and the Assyrians. The religious leaderships of these \ncommunities, in particular, have been subject to official restrictions \nwhich significantly limit their ability to serve their people. In \naddition, the Turkish Government has failed to adequately protect them \nfrom acts of violence and vandalism.\n  The United States must ensure that Turkey lifts any official \nrestrictions on Christian churches and schools and offers sufficient \nprotection against acts of violence and harassment against the clergy \nand vandalism against church and school property.\n  The Turkish Government must understand that the United States will \nnot continue to subsidize its illegal and irresponsible conduct. By \nwithholding $500,000 a day in our assistance until they have taken \nsteps toward resolving each of the five issues I have just addressed, \nwe will send the Turkish leadership a clear signal that our foreign \nassistance programs will not extend aid to those nations which \nregularly violate human rights and international law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nan article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objections, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 578\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in \n     Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Turkish Human Rights \n     Compliance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of State, in its 1995 report entitled \n     ``Country Reports on Human Rights'', documented a systematic \n     and widespread pattern of human rights abuses by the \n     Government of Turkey. According to the portion of the report \n     relating to Turkey, ``the human rights situation in Turkey \n     worsened significantly in 1994''.\n       (2) Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the United \n     Nations Committee Against Torture, the European Parliament, \n     the International Human Rights Law Group, the Lawyers \n     Committee for Human Rights, Physicians Without Frontiers, \n     Freedom House, the Humanitarian Law Project, the Turkish \n     Human Rights Associations, and other human rights monitoring \n     organizations have documented extensive and continuing human \n     rights abuses by the Government of Turkey, including the \n     widespread use of torture.\n       (3) The actions of the Government of Turkey are in \n     violation of several international human rights agreements to \n     which Turkey is a party, including the United Nations \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Final Act of the \n     Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the \n     European Convention on Human Rights.\n       (4) The Government of Turkey continues to deny the \n     existence of its 15,000,000 Kurdish citizens and has used \n     military force to deny them an identity, destroying more than \n     2,000 Kurdish villages and uprooting more than 2,000,000 \n     Kurds.\n       (5) Turkey continues its illegal military occupation of \n     Cyprus and has obstructed efforts to reach a just and lasting \n     resolution to the division of Cyprus and the massive \n     uprooting of Greek Cypriots caused by the 1974 invasion by \n     Turkey of Cyprus.\n       (6) The Government of Turkey continues to blockade Armenia, \n     obstructing the delivery of American and international \n     humanitarian relief supplies.\n       (7) Turkey continues to place prohibitive restrictions on \n     the religious leadership of Christian communities within \n     Turkey and has failed to protect these communities adequately \n     from acts of violence and vandalism.\n       (8) The Congress, in the fiscal year 1995 budget for \n     foreign assistance, withheld 10 percent of the principal \n     amount of direct loans to Turkey because of that country's \n     human rights record and the situation in Cyprus. The \n     Government of Turkey has stated that it would reject any \n     United States assistance tied to its human rights record, \n     which, according to independent human rights monitoring \n     organizations, has continued to deteriorate.\n     SEC. 3. RESTRICTIONS ON ASSISTANCE FOR TURKEY.\n\n       (a) Restrictions.--Of the funds made available for fiscal \n     year 1996 for assistance for Turkey under the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act, the \n     President shall withhold, first from grant assistance, if \n     any, and then from loan assistance, $500,000 for each day \n     that Turkey does not meet the conditions of section 4.\n       (b) Waiver.--The President may waive the application of \n     subsection (a) if the President determines that it is in the \n     national security interest of the United States to do so.\n\n     SEC. 4. CONDITIONS.\n\n       The conditions of this section are met when the President \n     certifies to Congress that the Government of Turkey--\n       (1) allows free and unfettered monitoring of the human \n     rights situation within its territory by domestic and \n     international human rights monitoring organizations, \n     including but not limited to, the Turkish Human Rights \n     Association, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch;\n       (2) recognizes the civil, cultural, and human rights of its \n     Kurdish citizens, ceases its military operations against \n     Kurdish civilians, and takes demonstrable steps toward a \n     peaceful resolution of the Kurdish issue;\n       (3) takes demonstrable steps toward the total withdrawal of \n     its military forces from Cyprus and demonstrates its support \n     for a settlement recognizing the sovereignty, independence, \n     and territorial integrity of Cyprus, with a constitutional \n     democracy based on majority rule, the rule of law, and the \n     protection of minority rights;\n       (4) completely removes its blockade of United States and \n     international assistance to Armenia; and\n       (5) removes official restrictions on Christian churches and \n     schools and offers sufficient protection against acts of \n     violence and harassment directed at members of the clergy, \n     and offers sufficient protection against acts of vandalism \n     directed at church and school property.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 6, 1995]\n\n                Rights Violations in Turkey Said to Rise\n\n                           (By John Darnton)\n\n       Ankara, Turkey.--To the concern of Western allies and \n     international human rights organizations, reports of rights \n     violations in Turkey have increased markedly in recent \n     months, along with attempts by the Government to crush the \n     Kurdish separatist insurrection in the southeast.\n       The number of people who have been disappearing while in \n     the custody of the policy and security forces, the reports of \n     torture, killings by unknown assailants that appear to be \n     political and arrests and convictions of writers, \n     intellectuals and politicians under a law against separatist \n     propaganda are all on the rise, Turkish human rights groups \n     say.\n       ``The main reason is the war in the southeast,'' said Yavuz \n     Onen, a 56-year-old architect who is president of the Human \n     Rights Foundation, a Turkish group that was set up in 1989 to \n     aid victims and document abuses.\n       ``The state uses the argument that they are in a struggle \n     with terrorists and that they are defending the \n     indivisibility of the territory,'' he said. ``Of course the \n     state can defend its borders. But most of the violations are \n     against civilians.\n       ``Torture is now widespread and systematic, not only for \n     political crime but for common crime as well.''\n       Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, in an interview, denied that \n     there had been widespread violations.\n       Allegations of torture are not new in Turkey. The \n     foundation cited the cases of Yasar Kanbur, 35, an engineer, \n     and Yusuf Yukdirim, 35, a health union worker. The two men \n     said they had been picked up as leftist students after the \n     military takeover of 1980 and were held nine and a half years \n     in prison. During that time, they said, they were suspended \n     by their chained arms, kept without food and sleep, beaten \n     repeatedly and subjected to electric shock.\n       They scoffed at the idea that torture would ever be \n     eliminated from Turkey. ``Not by this regime,'' Mr. Kanbur \n     said. ``Torture is universal here.''\n       The war against the Kurds, who constitute about one-fifth \n     of Turkey's 60-million people, has been going on for a \n     decade. The Kurds were originally concentrated in the \n     southeast, but many are now scattered all over the country. \n     The fighting has claimed an estimated 14,000 lives.\n       The Kurdish Workers' Party, or P.K.K. has used terrorism in \n     its fight for an independent homeland. It does not shrink \n     from killing teachers who instruct in Turkish and so-called \n     ``village guards,'' who defend hamlets of Government \n     supporters, and their families. The party is believed to have \n     killed over 200 civilians in 1993, and it took responsibility \n     for at least 167 deaths in the first 10 months of 1994.\n       But attempts to eradicate the P.K.K., whose leader, \n     Abdullah Ocalan, is based in Syria, have taken even more \n     civilian lives. Western diplomats stationed here say security \n     forces have been granted a free hand by the Mrs. Ciller's \n     Government to deal with the insurrection.\n       The security forces have turned to brutal methods, \n     especially in the 10 southeastern provinces that have been \n     under a state of emergency since 1987 because of the \n     insurrection. The emergency grants quasimartial law powers to \n     a regional governor and suspends the few modest \n     constitutional safeguards in \n      [[Page S4201]] effect elsewhere. A suspect, for instance, \n     can be held for 30 days without access to relatives or a \n     lawyer.\n       Army and paramilitary groups sweep through whole areas of \n     the southeast, destroying villages that they suspect of \n     aiding the P.K.K. and burning many of them to the ground. The \n     province of Tunceli has been a battleground this winter, \n     where some 40,000 Turkish troops are pursuing guerrillas who \n     may number up to 3,000, by estimates of Western diplomats.\n       More than 60 villages there have been wiped out. The \n     estimates of the number of villages destroyed over the last \n     decade vary among the human rights groups, but usually run \n     between 1,500 and 2,500.\n       Reports by the United States Department, Amnesty \n     International, the United Nations Committee Against torture \n     and the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture have \n     all condemned Turkey for human rights violations.\n       A report by Amnesty International, ``A Policy of Denial,'' \n     said at least 50 ``disappearances'' in custody were reported \n     in the first 10 months of 1994, nearly double the number in \n     1993. It said the number of people shot down in the street by \n     unknown assassins had soared from more than 20 in 1991 to 362 \n     in 1992, more than 400 in 1993 and 380 for the first 10 \n     months of 1994.\n       Visitors to the southeastern region say four or five people \n     a day are now being killed on the streets. They include \n     journalists investigating human rights violations and members \n     of trade unions and political parties, including the People's \n     Democracy Party, which has a largely Kurdish membership and \n     is anathema to the Government.\n       Leaders of human rights organizations rebut the \n     Government's argument that the Kurdish insurrection is in any \n     way a valid reason for curtailing civil liberties. ``The \n     continuation of the armed struggle by someone else cannot be \n     accepted as the reason for delaying democracy,'' said Husnu \n     Ondul, secretary general of the Human Rights Association.\n       In 1991 and 1992, the number of what Amnesty calls \n     ``prisoners of conscience''--people jailed for expressing \n     nonviolent beliefs--fell to close to zero. But that number \n     has mounted again. Now 118 are in jail, according to the \n     Human Rights Association, a grass-roots organization, with \n     2,139 convicted but appealing their sentences and 5,600 more \n     awaiting trial.\n       In a four-month trial that ended in December, eight Kurdish \n     members of Parliament were tried on capital charges of \n     treason. They were stripped of their parliamentary immunity \n     so charges could be filed, and their party was banned. While \n     they were convicted, the charges were changed at the last \n     minute to such things as assisting the P.K.K. and spreading \n     separatist propaganda, and they got sentences ranging from 3 \n     years and 6 months to 15 years.\n       ``It wasn't a real trial,'' said Sirri Sakik, one of the \n     two of the eight who is out pending appeal. He said that the \n     prosecutor had built a case around various speeches he had \n     made and that some of his relatives had been tortured to try \n     to force them to give testimony against him. ``In court they \n     recanted, and now they are going on trial for murders they \n     didn't commit,'' he said.\n       Seven journalists from a Kurdish pro-separatist newspaper, \n     Ozgur Ulke, or Free Land, have been shot dead by unknown \n     assailants. In December the newspaper's offices in Istanbul \n     and Ankara were damaged by explosions. On Feb. 3 the paper \n     was closed by order of the Istanbul State Security Court.\n       The human rights organizations are especially concerned \n     that many human rights monitors themselves are now bearing \n     the brunt of prosecutions. ``We used to have 14 bureaus and \n     an additional seven representatives in the southeast and now \n     none of them can function,'' said Akin Birdal, president of \n     the Human Rights Association. ``Some are in jail, and the \n     others are on the run.''\n       Maryam Elahi, an Amnesty official who went to Diyarbakir \n     this week to attend a trial of four human rights workers, \n     said the persecution of the rights workers ``closes off the \n     last avenue.''\n       ``It's a definite pattern'' she said. ``Before, the \n     Government was instigating cases against people they thought \n     were P.K.K. or at least political in some way. Now the human \n     rights people themselves are getting it. Even health \n     professionals who treat victims are disappearing.''\n       Mrs. Ciller defended her Government's action and asserted \n     in the interview that the P.K.K. itself destroyed the \n     villages. ``A lot of it is theater, in the sense that we have \n     found--and I've seen official documentation--of the \n     terrorists wearing the clothes of the soldiers, attacking the \n     villages and burning them,'' she said.\n       ``This is not to say that there has been nothing wrong on \n     the side of this fight against terrorism,'' she added. ``It's \n     very hard sometimes to discriminate. There is a lot of \n     bombing or fire coming out of the houses and villages and for \n     the military approaching it's very hard to tell who the \n     terrorist is and who the villager is.''\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 579. A bill to amend the JOBS program in title IV of the Social \nSecurity Act to provide for a job placement voucher program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                           job placement act\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, in the last several months, the \ndebate over welfare reform has lost its focus. We should be talking \nabout how to move recipients from dependence on public assistance into \nwork in private sector jobs.\n  Instead, we are talking about a number of other issues--teenage \npregnancy, drug and alcohol abuse, breakup of the family, whether to \nblock grant welfare programs to the States, entitlement spending versus \ndiscretionary spending, and so on. These are all important issues, but \nthey miss the mark. They are distractions from what should be the \nprimary focus of the welfare reform debate--work and personal \nresponsibility. Ultimately, Mr. President, the \nbest social program we could ever come up with is a good job.\n  What the American people want is fundamental change in the welfare \nsystem. We won't get this fundamental change if Congress shucks \naccountability to the States.\n  Everyone certainly agrees that States should be given more \nflexibility to design their programs in a way that meets their unique \neconomic and social circumstances. But the Federal Government must be \naccountable for making sure that the tax money we raise is well spent \nand produces the results the American people are demanding--that is, \nself-sufficiency through work.\n  While few people would argue that welfare reform should be about \nwork, a vital piece of the puzzle has been missing from the beginning. \nThat is, how do we actually move people from welfare into an \nappropriate job. Last year's proposal from the Clinton administration \nsupplied an incentive for welfare recipients to work by placing a time \nlimit on cash assistance, but it maintained and even expanded an \nineffective education and training system that recipients have to pass \nthrough before they are sent to look for work. Past Republican \nproposals such as the one contained in the Contract With America also \nimposed a time limit and insisted on immediate work, but provided no \nmechanism for linking recipients with private jobs, implying that they \nwould rely on a vast public jobs program. The latest Republican \nproposals completely evade this and many other questions by boxing up \nthe problem and sending it back to the States.\n  The legislation that Senator Brown and I are introducing today would \nprovide a direct mechanism for moving individual welfare recipients \ninto suitable jobs. Our proposal is to enable and encourage States to \nuse vouchers for job placement services.\n  It would firmly commit the Federal Government to the principle that \nwork experience is the best training for private employment. It would \nalso transfer power from governments to individuals by putting control \nin the hands of individual welfare recipients in a competitive job \nplacement market, while giving each State flexibility to tailor the new \nsystem to its particular economic and social circumstances.\n  Mr. President, vouchers take the welfare debate beyond the arguments \nthat are being made over block grants. Instead of ending the Federal \nwelfare bureaucracy, only to replace it with a State bureaucracy, \nvouchers would do away with bureaucracy and put the power to choose in \nthe hands of individual welfare recipients.\n  Existing funds would be used to pay for the vouchers, and State and \nFederal Government costs might actually be reduced as bureaucratic \nsolutions are replaced with private sector solutions.\n  States would develop a list of approved service providers--placement \nagencies, private employers, employment-based JOBS programs, and so \nforth--available to welfare recipients once they have applied for \npublic assistance and started their job search. Recipients would use \nthe lists to make their service choices. Instead of being assigned to a \njob by a caseworker, the recipients would consult with their \ncaseworkers, review all the options that are available, and choose the \nprogram most suited to their needs.\n  Payment to public and private placement agencies, employers, and \nother approved employment programs would be based on performance only. \nVouchers would be redeemed in full only after an organization had \nsuccessfully placed the recipient in a full-time unsubsidized job for a \nset period of time.\n  [[Page S4202]] Mr. President, this is not meant to be the whole \nsolution to the welfare problem. But I am convinced that it is a \nnecessary part of any realistic attempt to get welfare recipients into \njobs in the private sector. I am also glad to be joined in offering \nthis bill by my friend and colleague from Colorado, Hank Brown. This is \njust about the only bipartisan welfare reform legislation that has been \nintroduced in this Congress and I am proud to have Senator Brown as a \ncosponsor.\n  I hope that more of our colleagues will join us in support of this \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill appear in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 579\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as the chairman of the Subcommittee \non East Asian and Pacific Affairs, I rise today to address a disturbing \narticle in last Thursday's Washington Post. According to the Post, last \nWednesday the mayor of Nagasaki, Motoshima Hitoshi, likened the two \n1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to the Holocaust. He said, and \nI quote, ``I think that the atomic bombings were one of the two \ngreatest crimes against humanity in the 20th century, along with the \nHolocaust.'' He was joined in these sentiments by Hiraoka Takashi, the \nmayor of Hiroshima.\n  Mr. President, I am incensed by this comparison, and by what appears \nto me to be a growing revisionist tendency among some circles in Japan \naimed at sanitizing its role as the aggressor and transforming it into \nthe innocent victim of the atomic bomb. History is replete with \ninstances which provide ample justification for the course the United \nStates took to end years of war. For the benefit of these two \ngentlemen, let me note some of those facts.\n  On December 7, 1941, without notice or declaration of war, the \nJapanese attacked Pearl Harbor, HI. I do not need to describe for my \ncolleagues the carnage and death that followed. From that point, Japan \nengaged us in a protracted and costly war that ranged over the Pacific \nrim for more than 4 years and cost thousands and thousands of lives.\n  Treatment of Allied prisoners of war was unconscionable. For \nAmericans fighting in the Pacific\n theater, the likehood of dying in combat was about 5 percent. For \nAmerican POW's in German prison camps, it was 4 percent. But for those \nin Japanese prison camps the number ran to 33 percent. Executions, \ntortures, the Bataan Death March, the record is replete with atrocities \nfor which the victims have yet--50 years later--to receive an apology. \nIt is somewhat ironic that also in the same edition of the Post is a \nlengthy article entitled, ``Still Waiting for an Apology: Historian \nGavan Daws, Calling on Japan on War Crimes.'' I would commend it to \nMessrs. Hiraoka and Motoshima; they might learn a thing or two from it.\n\n  A special unit of the Imperial Army, called Unit 731, conducted \nresearch in germ warfare with an aim at introducing plague, anthrax, \nand other fatal diseases into the United States. As the theater of war \nmoved closer to the home islands, the United States and its Allies were \nreduced to fighting their way toward Japan on an island-by-island \nbasis. The battles were costly--both in lives, time, and materiel. Just \nthis week we remembered the 50th anniversary of the taking of Iwo Jima. \nIn that battle, some 20,000 Japanese fought to the death--many \ncommitting seppuku rather than surrender.\n  [[Page S4205]] All the signs available to us at the time indicated \nthat this would be the course of the remainder of the war. Several \nAllied surrender ultimatums were rejected offhand by the Japanese. \nThus, as the war drew to a close in Europe, we were clearly faced with \na choice in Asia; do something to bring a quick end to our losses and \nsuffering, or continue a painfully long, drawn-out, costly conflict. \nPresident Truman chose the only alternative a nation's leader would, \nand the bombs fell.\n  Yet, some in Japan can overlook all that came before the bombs. Some \ncan reduce Japan from the vigorous aggressor to the passive victim. Mr. \nHiraoka seems to be of that ilk. For example, he emphasized that \nseveral early multinational conventions prohibited deliberate attacks \non civilians, then proceeded to list those nations which did not live \nup to that ideal during the war era: German attacks on London, the \nUnited States firebombing of Tokyo, the British-led firebombing of \nDresden.\n  Yet, conspicuously absent from his list is the country behind the \nfirst such indiscriminate bombing: Japan. On December 1, 1937, the \nImperial Army Headquarters in Tokyo ordered an attack on Nanjing, \nChina. The planes came and laid waste to the city and its population; \nestimates of the civilian losses range from 100,000 to 200,000. The \nattack lives on in the minds of many Chinese as one of the most \ninfamous events of the 20th century.\n  Mr. President, the present strong relationship between the United \nStates and Japan is of the utmost importance to us. I personally enjoy \nmy nascent relationship with Kuriyama Takakazu, Japan's Ambassador here \nin Washington. But statements like those made by these two mayors \ncannot go unanswered; for to fail to rebut such revisionism is simply \nto lend credence to it.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/20/senate-section/article/S4204-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CAROLYN SQUIRES\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, during the welfare reform debate \nthat we are bound to have in the months ahead of us, I would like the \nSenate to keep in mind the story of Carolyn Squires, representative of \nthe State of Montana's House District 68. Her example should be a \nreminder to all of us that public assistance programs can work.\n  Although she is a successful member of the Montana House of \nRepresentatives, I would like to tell you about a time when Carolyn was \nnot so lucky. She was once divorced, a single mother, and on welfare. \nBut like a majority of welfare mothers, she never gave up a little over \na year later she found a career.\n  For the past 27 years, Carolyn has worked at Missoula's community \nmedical center as a licensed practical nurse. She is active in the \nMissoula labor movement. Still a member of the licensed practical \nnurses union, Carolyn is president of the Central Labor Council in \nMissoula.\n  Although she was initially appointed to the Montana State House, \nCarolyn has worked hard for her constituents. And they have rewarded \nher with their votes. It is because she has a way with people. I \nremember hearing of a time during her recent campaign when she decided \nto go door-to-door. After about three or four blocks, several people \nstarted following her. They liked what she had to say. And although \nCarolyn did not get far on her walk, she was always connected with her \nconstituents.\n  Carolyn has exemplified this again and again. One of her \nconstituents, a single mom receiving AFDC, called for Carolyn's help. \nThe mother did not receive her check for 2 straight weeks. As many of \nyou know, this can be a crisis. But Carolyn did not waste any time. She \ncalled the Montana Social Rehabilitation Service directly and demanded \nto talk to the cabinet director.\n  ``The Director is in a meeting,'' she was told.\n  Then Carolyn got really mad. And, while Carolyn has a heart of gold, \nanybody who knows her also knows it is best to stay on her good side. \nClearly, the folks in the department did not know Carolyn Squires very \nwell. Yet they finally pulled the director out of the meeting. Carolyn \ndemanded that the check arrive tomorrow morning, and that she herself \nwould be there to receive it. Needless to say, the check arrived bright \nand early the next day.\n  Carolyn Squires has a lot to be proud of. She knows that politics is \nabout people, and she makes a difference. She is a shining example, one \nof many, whose life was improved because of our welfare system. Her \nhusband Harold, her sons Paul and Keith, her grandchildren and those \nMontanans in house district 68 are lucky to have someone so dedicated \ntaking care of them. They should all be proud of her legacy of service \nto the city of Missoula and the State of Montana. I am proud to honor \nher today before the Senate.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/20/senate-section/article/S4205-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO REAR ADM. RICHARD G. KIRKLAND\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the dedication, \npublic service, and patriotism of Rear Adm. Richard G. Kirkland, U.S. \nNavy, on the occasion of his retirement after 26 years of faithful \nservice to our Nation. Admiral Kirkland's strong commitment to \nexcellence will leave a lasting impact on the vitality of our modern \nwarfighters, commanding admiration and respect from his military \ncolleagues and Members of Congress.\n  Rear Admiral Kirkland was born August 17, 1947, in Coronado, CA. He \ngraduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1969 with a bachelor of \nscience degree and earned a master of science in aeronautical systems \nengineering from the University of West Florida.\n  Rear Admiral Kirkland's first duty assignment was Patrol Squadron 56 \n(VP-56) from June 1971 through May 1974. He then was attached to Air \nTest and Evaluation Squadron 1 (VX-1) as operations test director, \nHarpoon weapons system from June 1974 through May 1977. In August 1977, \nhe reported to U.S.S. Constellation (CV-64) for duty as assistant \nnavigator. During this tour, the ship deployed twice to the Western \nPacific and was the first carrier to deploy into the Indian Ocean. \nWhile on\n board, he qualified and was designated as surface warfare officer. He \nthen went to the Naval Military Personnel Command [NMPC] as VP sea duty \ndetailer and sea duty coordinator from May 1979 to January 1981. His \nnext assignment was with the Pelicans of Patrol Squadron 45 (VP-45) as \noperations officer from June 1981 until April 1983. He was then \nassigned to Patrol Wing 11 as operations officer between April 1983 and \nApril 1984. He was selected to serve with the Mad Foxes of VP-5 as \nexecutive officer from May 1984 until June 1985. Subsequently, he took \ncommand of Patrol Squadron 5 (VP-5) from July 1985 through September \n1986. He returned to serve a second tour at NMPC as the assistant \naviation commander detailer from September 1986 until March 1988. He \nthen was assigned command of Patrol Squadron 30 (VP-30) from April 1988 \nthrough July 1989. After completion of this command tour, he was \nselected as a CNO Fellow and served as a member of the Strategic \nStudies Group IX from August 1989 to July 1990 which marked his third \ntour outside the VP community. Upon completion of this tour, he was \nassigned as Commander, Patrol Wing 11 from July 1990 until April 1992. \nHe served as director, Navy/Marine Corps Senate liaison office from \nApril 1992 to December 1993 before assuming his present position.\n\n  Rear Admiral Kirkland's awards include the Legion of Merit, \nMeritorious Service Medal with three gold stars, and numerous other \nunit awards and personal decorations.\n  Our Nation, the U.S. Navy, his children Keith, Heather, and Ryan, can \ntruly be proud of the Admiral's many accomplishments. A man of his \nextraordinary talent and integrity is rare indeed. While his honorable \nservice will be genuinely missed in the Department of Defense, it gives \nme great pleasure to recognize Rear Admiral Kirkland before my \ncolleagues and wish him all of our best wishes in his new and exciting \ncareer.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/20/senate-section/article/S4205-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4205-S4206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      SALUTE TO ROSIE THE RIVETER\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, on March 15, 1995, Dundalk \nCommunity College in Dundalk, MD, in honor of Women's History Month, \nhosted ``A Salute to Rosie the Riveter,'' honoring the women who worked \nin America's wartime factories to do their part in America's war \neffort.\n  Between 1942 and 1945, the ranks of American working women swelled \nfrom 12 to 18 million. Responding to the call that ``We can do it,'' \nthousands of women entered the wartime work force \n [[Page S4206]] to build the ships, planes, and tanks for our men and \nwomen overseas.\n  Joining the celebration on March 15 were 236 ``Rosies.'' These women \nworked in the industrial hub of Baltimore's wartime economy--they \nmelted the ore, welded the ships, and riveted the wings. Fifty years \nlater their employers--Bethlehem Steel, Lockheed-Martin--formerly Glen \nL. Martin Aircraft--and General Motors--Eastern Aircraft--thanked the \n236 Rosies present at the celebration and the thousands of Rosies these \nwomen represented.\n  In recognition of the efforts of Dundalk Community College and in \nhonor of the lives of all of the ``Rosies'' who built the arsenal of \ndemocracy and helped to save the Western World, today we extend to them \nour gratitude. They have earned an honored place in our memory and \nrespected place in our history.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/20/senate-section/article/S4205-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   THE LEGACY OF STANLEY O. IKENBERRY\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, Stanley O. Ikenberry, a giant on the \nnational stage of higher education policy, will retire this year after \nan exceptional tenure of 16 years as president of the University of \nIllinois.\n  President Ikenberry announced his decision last year to give the \nuniversity's board of trustees ample time to carefully select a \nsuccessor, and the board now has chosen James J. Stukel, chancellor of \nthe University of Illinois at Chicago, to become the 15th president of \nthe university.\n  Few posts are as stressful and delicate--and as public and \ninfluential--as the presidency of a major university. Stan and Judy \nIkenberry have handled the pressures superbly, with grace and warmth \nand character.\n  Stan Ikenberry has kept a firm hand on the tiller and a clear eye on \nthe horizon in charting the university's progress during his \nstewardship. The Ikenberry era has been an intense period of growth and \nvigor that has seen improvements across the breadth of the university's \nactivities and has solidified the campus' stature as a world-class \nuniversity and center of research. During his tenure institutions such \nas the university's National Center for Supercomputing Applications \nhave been established, and the university activities in Chicago have \nbeen strengthened with the chartering of the University of Illinois at \nChicago.\n  Under Stan Ikenberry's leadership, the University of Illinois last \nfall became one of the first campuses in the Nation to offer the new \ndirect student loan program to its students. Stan Ikenberry and the \nUniversity of Illinois are helping to prove the merits of this bold new \nprogram that is benefiting not only students but also taxpayers and \nschools.\n  I well recall that when another major university in our State became \nindecisive about the chance to establish and offer a permanent home to \nan annual Paul Douglas Ethics In Government Award, Stan Ikenberry \nseized the opportunity, and the award program is now underway, based in \nUrbana-Champaign.\n  Stan Ikenberry is a statesman who has enriched American higher \neducation. Governors, lawmakers of both political parties in the State \nlegislature and in Congress, and his colleagues in the higher education \ncommunity all have relied heavily on Stan Ikenberry's insight, wisdom, \nand leadership skills. I have had the pleasure and the opportunity of \nworking with Stan Ikenberry on a wide range of issues of importance to \nthe university and to national education policy. Among many, many \nothers who have worked in this field, I am grateful for Stan \nIkenberry's wisdom, for his constancy, and for his leadership.\n  President Ikenberry has much more to contribute to the Nation when he \nmoves later this year into other pursuits. To his great credit, he \nplans on resuming college-level teaching in the field of higher \neducation administration.\n  We extend to Stan and Judy Ikenberry our deep appreciation and our \nvery best wishes for their future endeavors.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/20/senate-section/article/S4206-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEE TO REPORT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.
