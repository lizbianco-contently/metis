No further rollcall votes are anticipated after this \nseries.

We will, as I indicated, be returning \nto the unfunded mandates bill at 10 a.m. this morning. There will not \nbe any recorded votes until 4 o'clock. I hope the Senate will now \nreally move forward in dispensing with amendments and getting to the \npoint where we can pass this legislation this week, hopefully by \nThursday night.\n  I think there is an outstanding bipartisan support for it.

Mr. President, I simply rise to express my concern about \nthe lack of progress that we have made \n[[Page S1394]] in the last several days on a bill that I think is \ngenerally supported in this body, certainly is supported by me and I \nknow is supported by almost all of the leaders in local governments \nthroughout the country.\n  I have watched the progress or, indeed, the lack of it on S. 1 for 7 \nor 8 days now. I have listened with a good deal of interest and watched \nthe process, and I must tell you that it is an exasperating process. We \nhave had, I think, more than 100 amendments, many of which were not \ngermane to the issue that is before us. They certainly have to be \nconsidered as stalling tactics. I have heard Senators review endlessly \nthe same kinds of issues on the floor which leads one to conclude that \nnothing more than stalling is happening.\n  We have heard discussions about previous years and the things that \nhave happened in previous bills that have little, if any, relevance to \nwhat we are doing here.\n  I support the unfunded mandates bill. I think most people in the \nSenate support this bill, and I think the American people generally \nsupport this bill. I have come, as others have, from the House. I \nserved in the Wyoming Legislature, and I have not seen a process which \nhas no apparent purpose or goal be executed as has this one over the \nlast several days.\n  I do not fully understand yet all of the intricacies, of course, of \nthe U.S. Senate, but I do understand that there is a need to have a \nprocess by which people can insist upon more detail, can insist upon \nmore time being taken so that everyone does understand, so that \neveryone has an opportunity.\n  But I must tell you that I have not been able to detect that there is \nany particular goal, that there is any particular purpose being served \nby the time we have taken here.\n  I think it is very important that we come to this place after having \nbeen through an election recently in which people in this country \nexpressed themselves, I think, very clearly, expressed themselves in \nterms of wanting this Government to proceed, wanting this Government to \nmove forward, wanting this Government to deal with the issues that are \nthere, that are so apparent.\n  I think people are tired of unproductive maneuvers throughout the \nCongress, stalling tactics, and I think this is an example of that.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that this delay over unfunded mandates \nis ultimately useless. The bill will ultimately pass. This will not \nchange the outcome.\n  The bill is a flexible bill. It does not simply impose unfunded \nmandates on issues or on people, but it simply says there will be an \naccounting for what the impact of these proposals will be. It simply \nsays that when there is an accounting that demonstrates an expenditure \nof over $50 million, that there will be cause for a point of order and \na vote so that this Senate will take a look at it. Processwise, if the \nSenate continues to lag, action will be criticized.\n  Again, make no mistake, the bill will eventually pass. Changing \nWashington and changing the way we do business has been called for. It \nis a long process, but it is happening and it is happening now. Indeed, \nit should happen. Procedural changes such as a balanced budget \namendment, such as limiting unfunded mandates, such as line-item veto, \nand, indeed, term limits are the kinds of procedural changes that will \nhave an impact over time on the way we govern.\n  So we are witnessing the first protests of a huge change, and I \nunderstand that. Unfunded mandates will be banned. Washington will \nchange. Some will not like it but the people in the country will. I \nurge us to move forward. I urge us to move forward and do the business \nof the people of this country.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/24/senate-section/article/S1393-6", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          DEATH OF THOMAS YAGI\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I want the people of this Nation to know \nabout the passing of Thomas Yagi, a caring and passionate man who \nsparked Maui's labor movement nearly a half century ago. He was a good \nfriend and one of Hawaii's great native sons. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the following editorial from the Maui News, dated January 12, \n1995, entitled ``Tom Yagi: A True Giant of His Times,'' be submitted \nfor inclusion in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n                     [The Maui News, Jan. 12, 1995]\n\n                  Tom Yagi: A True Giant of His Times\n\n       In the past decade alone Maui County's population has grown \n     by more than 40 percent, which means a good many people \n     living here now don't know just how big a figure Tom Yagi was \n     in Hawaii's labor movement. Without question, he was as big \n     as they come.\n       Mr. Yagi, who died Monday at the age of 72, remains \n     unchallenged as Maui's most esteemed labor leader. Through \n     sweat, persistence and undying commitment to his cause in the \n     face of powerful opposition, he rightfully earned that \n     status. No part of his struggle came easy.\n       Back in the 1940's the word ``union'' was a dirty word to \n     the owners of the giant plantations and their pawns in state \n     government. Tom Yagi was a plantation warehouseman with a \n     young family determined to make a better life for himself and \n     those workers like him. He knew that wasn't going to happen \n     on paychecks of a dollar a day.\n       He linked up with the International Longshoremen's and \n     Warehousemen's Union and began to organize meetings, although \n     most had to be held in secret, shielded from the vengeful \n     plantation supervisors. The enemies of labor tried to equate \n     the word ``union'' with the word ``communist,'' and \n     congressional committees attempted to summon Hawaii's ILWU \n     leaders to testify about their ``subversive'' activities. Tom \n     Yagi, like his union colleagues, refused.\n       The success of the labor movement in Hawaii stands among \n     the most significant social revolutions in this country's \n     history, and it's not possible to overstate the role Tom Yagi \n     played in it. For 30 years he led the Maui division of the \n     ILWU, and never during that time did he change the focus of \n     his mission--better wages, better health care, better \n     education and a better life for the working class.\n       And he did it all in a rather mysterious fashion, \n     commanding respect even from those on the opposite side of \n     the table from him. While many union activists embraced \n     militancy, Mr. Yagi somehow managed to achieve his objectives \n     more so with diplomacy. He never shied from confrontation, \n     no. But most often his keen ability to see more than one side \n     to every dilemma led to solutions that averted conflict. For \n     this he was as revered by those he fought against as by those \n     he fought for.\n       Despite all his many accomplishments in the labor movement, \n     the greatest source of pride for Tom Yagi was his family. In \n     addition to his wife Miye, he also leaves behind two sons, \n     six daughters, 22 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. \n     That the Yagi family has long been synonymous with community \n     service on Maui is yet another testimony to the greatness of \n     the man, Thomas Seikichi Yagi.\n       Maui has truly lost one of its most favorite sons.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/24/senate-section/article/S1394-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1394-S1396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SPEECH OF JACK VALENTI\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I recently read a speech that I believe \ndeserves the attention of all Senators. Jack Valenti, the president and \nchief executive officer of the Motion Picture Association of America, a \nformer aide to President Lyndon B. Johnson, and one of the most \narticulate and thoughtful people I know, delivered the speech in New \nYork City, as the first in the Louis Nizer lecture series.\n  Jack Valenti's words that evening carry a special resonance for me \nand I think they will for others. They are words of optimism about our \nfuture, in a time when too many in our country do not feel optimistic. \nBut they are also words of caution, directed toward all of us in this \nbody and all of us in this city, who create the policies under which \nAmericans live. They stress the importance of the family, of education, \nof appropriate moral conduct, of individual--not governmental--\nresponsibility.\n  They are words to which we should all give careful consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that, following my remarks, the full text of \nJack Valenti's speech be included in the Congressional Record.\n   [[Page S1395]] There being no objection, the speech was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n    William Faulkner's Old Verities: It's Planting Time in America!\n\n                           (By Jack Valenti)\n\n       The issues of liberty and the replenishment of community \n     values stirred restlessly within Louis Nizer. He and I talked \n     often about the compass course of the society. We both had \n     read the purifying speech of William Faulkner when he \n     received the Nobel Prize for Literature, on December 10, \n     1950. Like me, Louis found in Faulkner's words a dark \n     punishing wisdom, a plain, spare design for civic conduct. It \n     is from Faulkner's vision that what I say tonight has taken \n     wings. I think Louis would approve. Let me begin, then, by \n     admiring this man, Louis Nizer, who has drawn so many of you \n     here tonight.\n       In the muscular and musical English language which Louis \n     knew so well, loved so much and illuminated so elegantly, \n     there exits two words which perfectly describe him.\n       They are ``polymath'' and ``fidelity.''\n       Polymath means an artisan of immense learning in many \n     fields.\n       Francis Bacon once said he had taken all knowledge to be \n     his province. For Bacon it was not an immodest objective. But \n     such were Louis Nizer's vast and diverse talents, he is the \n     only man I know or knew who could come close to matching \n     Francis Bacon. Lawyer, courtroom genius, public speaker, best \n     selling author, painter, composer, lyricist, historian, \n     counselor to presidents and public officials, he was all of \n     these and more. And in each he performed with excelling \n     intellect and ascending success.\n       Fidelity means faithfulness to obligations and observances.\n       Louis Nizer gave special meaning to the word ``fidelity.'' \n     In his binding to the law, fidelity took on a richer meaning. \n     The law in all its glory was the core of his life. It was the \n     reservoir from which his daily tasks drew nourishment.\n       I first met Louis Nizer almost twenty-nine years ago when \n     he came to visit with me in my office in the White House. I \n     was about to resign as Special Assistant to the President, to \n     become the President of the Motion Picture Association of \n     America. He was to become the MPAA general counsel. Our paths \n     that day not only crossed, but became intimately interwoven \n     and forever sealed in friendship and trust.\n       His long, fruitful life is now over. Death, as it does to \n     every mortal, has finally came to Louis Nizer. I can say that \n     I am so grateful to a beneficent God that I was given to know \n     Louis so intimately, so gloriously, so lovingly. He was a \n     noble man. There are so few of his kind.\n       Any enterprise that bears Louis' name is valuable to me. \n     This evening then, to me, has great worth. May the Louis \n     Nizer Lecture series flourish in the decades ahead. May I do \n     it as little damage as possible tonight.\n       I have been fortunate to spend my entire working career in \n     two of life's fascinations, politics and movies. I have \n     worked the precincts of my native Texas, within City Hall and \n     county courthouses and the state capitol. I have been privy \n     to decision making in the White House, at the side of a \n     brave, extraordinary President. And I have for a long time \n     been among and within the creative and executive communities \n     of Hollywood and the world cinema.\n       Both arenas, movies and politics, and sprung from the same \n     DNA. Their aims are the same: to entice voters and audiences \n     to yield to their persuasions. What is the value of those \n     persuasions? What is real? What is right? What is truth? Who \n     determines it? Who furnishes the boundaries for the daily \n     moral grind of a functioning society? How is that society to \n     be\n      governed? How do you shape a foundation for a nation's prime \n     objective to endure, always striving to reach for the \n     ascending curve?\n       These are ancient queries. Answers are available but often \n     they are porous, not readily translated into specific \n     behavior. Sometimes they are cast in different shapes to \n     different people. Which answer is true? ``What is truth,'' \n     said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer.\n       I have thought a lot about this, though thinking about \n     these matters is like trying to pick up mercury with a fork. \n     It is maddeningly elusive. But we have to keep trying.\n       Herodotus tells the story of Athenians so emotionally \n     affected by the drama, ``The Capture of Miletus'', by the \n     poet Phrynichus, that the whole theater wept openly. When \n     their passions had cooled, Athenian officials passed a law \n     forbidding Phrynichus ever again to offer this play to the \n     public. He was fined a thousand drachmas for reminding his \n     fellows citizens of their own sorrows. It is an apt metaphor \n     for our current scene. Nothing so much describes the \n     perversity of political and social conduct, and calls to \n     judgment the resorting to morality by public officials as an \n     instrument of domestic and foreign policy.\n       It's a dicey political game to play. Like the Athenians we \n     are deeply involved in that which tugs at both our practical \n     minds and our moral conscience. Also like the Athenians we \n     find the real world, the morning after, not so desirable as \n     we had previously thought.\n       If morality is a rostrum from which we survey our lives, \n     then it is also a principle on which we stand. Principles, \n     unless one rises above them, are cruelly steadfast. If a \n     principle is ignored, for whatever practical reasons, or \n     bent, for whatever\n      seemingly rational decision, then it is no longer a \n     principle. It becomes a weak reed on which we lean at our \n     own peril.\n       So it is that Presidents and Members of Congress, as well \n     as officials of state and local governments, find themselves \n     dealing with morality on a ``yes, but'' logic. If you tried \n     to draw up a catalogue of the good guys and the bad guys, you \n     wind up with public officials from the President down being \n     judged on the same basis as that well known medieval monarch, \n     Philip the Good, renowned in his time for both the number of \n     his bastards and the piety of his fasts. Too often our \n     officials, in both political parties, see issues through \n     their own personal prism. To that end, the historian \n     Procopius wrote about the Emperor Justinian: ``He didn't \n     think that the slaying of men was murder unless they happened \n     to share his own religious view.''\n       We are poised for a great debate in this land. It has to do \n     with the reach of government, how wide, how narrow. But I \n     daresay the debate will be waged on the wrong platform. \n     Emerson may have gotten it right when he wrote: ``God offers \n     to everyone his choice between truth and repose. Take what \n     you please, you can never have both.'' Emerson is also \n     speaking to this generation as well.\n       I am not a pessimist. Never have been. Don't intend to \n     start now. This country did not survive more than 200 years \n     of cruel disjointings to be undone at this particular moment \n     by discomforts cataloged at length, mainly by TV commentators \n     and political consultants. These are the new political Druids \n     who convince their viewers and their clients that they alone \n     are capable of inspecting the entrails of a pig and thereby \n     are solely in possession of the bewitchery which will lead \n     voters to a proper decision.\n       But this scrambling, unquiet, violent time is one of the \n     rare moments in our history when those who govern us and \n     those\n      who are governed are in concert. Fear is the scarlet thread \n     which runs like a twanging wire through the nation. Fear \n     of tomorrow; fear of losing one's job; fear that children \n     will find their future less attractive than did their \n     parents; fear of crime, in the neighborhoods and in the \n     home; fear that the old bindings which held the nation \n     together are snapping: in too many cities there are too \n     many broken homes, too much loss of the affection which \n     thickens family ties, too much crazy drug use and users, \n     too many guns in the hands of too many children, too many \n     babies having babies, abandonment of the church, schools \n     without discipline, life without hope, anger fed by \n     imagined slights and bigoted blights.\n       No wonder there is fear. The first thing we have to do to \n     combat fear is understand that no matter how well intentioned \n     we are, unless we are guided by a basic moral compass, we \n     will neither begin nor finish the journey. Make no mistake, \n     the politicians are listening. There is nothing so compelling \n     to a public official as the angry buzz of the local \n     multitudes.\n       Therefore (ah, `Therefore' is a wondrous word. It says \n     enough of the rhetoric, what do you do tomorrow morning?), \n     Therefore:\n       We ought to start with William Faulkner. In his speech in \n     1950, he cited what he called ``the old universal verities \n     and truth of the heart, the old universal truth lacking which \n     any story is ephemeral and doomed--love and honor and pity \n     and pride and compassion and sacrifice. He might have added \n     ``and duty and loyalty and service to one's family and \n     friends and country.''\n       Faulkner's old verities have weight because they are what \n     an enduring nation is all about. Old fashioned words? Yes, \n     they are. Long-living words? Yes, they are. All the more \n     reason why words which have sustained themselves in myth and \n     reality are\n      never out of date. These words describe neither religion nor \n     ideology nor political affiliation. No group or faction or \n     political party has a monopoly on interpreting their \n     meaning.\n       What Faulkner's verities represent is a code of conduct \n     between human beings, between the citizen and the state, \n     between neighbors, friends, associates. They are better \n     guides than a political poll, or the blatherings demagogues, \n     or those earnest folks who insist they alone possess God's \n     wisdom. We have an old prayer in Texas when we encounter \n     these human repositories of divine Truth: ``Dear Lord, let me \n     seek the truth, but spare me the company of those who have \n     found it.'' Nice prayer. I say it often.\n       So, we begin with Faulkner's proposition that there are \n     basics deep rooted in those crevices where each of us stores \n     our beliefs and our passions. Without them we are barren of \n     aim or cause or reason. Or as Faulkner said, without them we \n     ``labor under a curse.''\n       Government cannot, ought not, be a national nanny, nor the \n     custodian of our faith nor the divine arbiter of our lives. \n     Each citizen must be responsible for his or her actions, \n     fathers, mothers, sons, daughters. Parents must be \n     responsible for their children. Adults responsible for there \n     decisions. Young people responsible for what they do. Playing \n     ``victim'', copping a plea that ``the Devil made me do it,'' \n     these are mocking charades in which the foolish listen to the \n     dunces and the dimwits lead the mob.\n       Taking responsibility for one's life, for one's action, \n     does not mean turning away from the helpless and the \n     hopeless. What it does mean is that if there is not a civic \n     commitment to be individually responsible, the \n     [[Page S1396]] future is pockmarked with detours and \n     disappointment. But we must be wary in the months ahead. \n     Strenuous efforts will be made to amputate the national\n      government's intervention in the lives of those pressed \n     against the wall because of circumstances over which they \n     have no control. It would be tragic to do that. It would \n     be worse than a crime. It would be a blunder. It cannot be \n     allowed to happen.\n       To give Faulkner's old verities a communal reality, we have \n     to begin within the family, for parents to care enough, \n     believe enough, do enough to begin the process. Parents, \n     sufficiently armed with passion, can do the most.\n       Alongside this familial commitment has to be a zealous \n     attention to teachers and schools. We have to be willing to \n     pay for first class public education or it continues to be \n     lousy education. We can't build enough prisons, or wield \n     enough judicial sabers, or legislate enough tough death \n     penalty laws to compensate for the collapse of discipline in \n     the classroom, or the graduation from high school of too many \n     who can't read or write or the total loss of Faulkner's \n     verities. In a time when our national obligations are larger \n     than our capacity to fulfill them all at the same time, our \n     leaders must make it clear--painful, discomforting, \n     frustrating as it may be--that we have to reinstall the \n     family and the school and the church as the central teaching \n     centers for young people. We have to begin the journey back \n     into ourselves before we can go forward into our future. Too \n     idealistic? Too namby-pamby? too impossible? `Yes,' to all of \n     those descriptions if you think a society can just amble \n     along and keep its liberties alive when so much of its core \n     convictions are in a state of decay. I don't. Every day \n     liberty must be guarded, because like virtue it is every day \n     besieged.\n       Then, why am I optimistic? Because all things are always in \n     flux. Nothing lasts forever, neither triumph nor tragedy, nor \n     the omissions of the human spirit. So long as we understand \n     who we are, why we are what we are, and how we became so, \n     then we will always be able to know where it is that we ought \n     to turn and where we must go. Of course, this requires a \n     national conviction. Without conviction, said Lord Macaulay, \n     a man or woman will be right only by accident.\n       President Kennedy supposedly told the story of a French \n     general in Algeria who wanted to plant a special kind of tree \n     to line the road to his chateau. ``But,'' protested his \n     gardener, ``that tree takes a 100 years to bloom.'' The \n     general smiled and said: ``Then we have no time to lose. \n     Start planting today.''\n       It's planting time in America. Faulkner's old verities will \n     take root again much sooner than the General's trees.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/24/senate-section/article/S1394-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO FRED MUDGE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the career \naccomplishments and community leadership of Mr. Fred N. Mudge upon his \nretirement as president and CEO of Logan Aluminum, Inc., in Lewisburg, \nKY.\n  Mr. Mudge began his career 32 years ago as a plant manager with \nAnaconda Aluminum. Later, his aptitude for innovation and demand for \nquality guided him in his progress from site manager for Anaconda's \nAlpart facility in Jamaica to the position of vice president of \ntechnology for Anaconda and ARCO Metals of Chicago. In 1985, Fred Mudge \ninvested his tenacity and experience in the position of president and \nchief executive officer for a new Kentucky company, Logan Aluminum, \nInc. Through his foresight and hard work, Logan Aluminum today is a \nworld leader in aluminum can sheet stock production.\n  Mr. Mudge's personal quest for excellence is not limited to the \nworksite. As a member of the Lewisburg community, he contributed to the \nrevitalization of the local chamber of commerce and the establishment \nof an economic development commission. In addition, he assisted in the \nfounding of Lewisburg's junior achievement program. Today, Mr. Mudge \ncontinues to work on behalf of his community as a member of the Logan \nMemorial Hospital board and the Western Kentucky University board of \nregents.\n  Mr. President, Fred Mudge's work as an industry leader and dedicated \ncommunity volunteer demonstrates the essential skills and determination \nour Nation needs to successfully meet the future challenges of job \ncreation and community development. While his daily leadership at Logan \nAluminum will be missed, I am confident that the Logan County community \nwill continue to enjoy the benefits of his energy and insight well into \nthe future.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/24/senate-section/article/S1396-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DOROTHY A.

Mr. President, today we begin the seventh day of \ndebate on S. 1, the bill to curb unfunded Federal mandates. I believe \nwe are beginning to see progress. We have had good discussion on this. \nI think Senators from both sides of the aisle feel that we have an \natmosphere where they can make their statements, offer their \namendments. Yesterday, 27 Democratic amendments were filed; 4 \nRepublican amendments were filed. Today after 4 o'clock there will be \nvotes on four amendments that had been presented.\n  I know that we have a number of Senators today who will be filing \ntheir amendments and I encourage them to do so, so we can get to those \nwho have amendments, ensure that they are properly before us so we can \ndeal with them and have the discussion.\n  I would like to read, Mr. President, one paragraph from the 1995 \nNational League of Cities' opinion survey report.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire report be made part of the \nRecord, and I will only read the first paragraph which says:\n\n       Assuring public safety, curbing unfunded federal mandates, \n     and building strong local economies are the most important \n     priorities for America's cities and towns, according to the \n     National League of Cities' annual opinion survey of municipal \n     officials.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  1995 NLC Opinion Survey News Release\n\n       Assuring public safety, curbing unfunded federal mandates, \n     and building strong local economies are the most important \n     priorities for America's cites and towns, according to the \n     National League of Cities' annual opinion survey of municipal \n     officials.\n       ``This agenda--safety, governmental accountability and a \n     sound economy--reflects what is most important now and for \n     the future well-being of our nation's cities and towns. It \n     represents a ``Contract for Americans'' that unites local \n     government leaders throughout the country,'' said NLC \n     President Carolyn Long Banks, councilwoman-at-large of \n     Atlanta.\n       The NLC survey, conducted in October and November, found \n     that public safety dominated the assessment of current \n     problems and future concerns. The findings, are based on \n     responses by 382 elected municipal officials drawn from a \n     random sample in cities with populations or 10,000 or more.\n       Five of the top six most deteriorated conditions reported \n     by local officials involved crime and violence: youth crime, \n     gangs, violent crime, drugs, and school violence. Three of \n     the ten ``most important conditions to address'' in the next \n     two years relate to public safety: violent crime, youth crime \n     and gangs.\n       Unfunded mandates--laws or regulations imposed on cities, \n     but without funding by federal or state governments--\n     continued as the top single issue adversely affecting local \n     governments. Mandates led the list of conditions which \n     worsened in 1994, which deteriorated the most over the past \n     five years, and which were most important to address in the \n     next two years.\n       Nearly half of the survey respondents reported improving \n     local economic conditions for the second year in a row. At \n     the same time, attention to economic matters remained a major \n     concern for the future, appearing in four of most important \n     issues to address in the next two years.\n       ``These are the big, pervasive issues that affect the \n     quality of life and the ability to govern responsibly and \n     responsively in our hometown communities,'' said Banks.\n       ``Making progress with them will make the most difference, \n     for the most good, for the most people, more than anything \n     else, including tax cuts. That's because these are the \n     essential ingredients for a real and lasting empowerment of \n     our citizens and our communities, and that's where the future \n     strength and prosperity of our nation begins,'' she said.\n                                                                    ____\n\n   The State of America's Cities: Eleventh Annual Opinion Survey of \n                      Municipal Elected Officials\n\n                       (By Herbert L. Green, Jr.)\n\n\n                               highlights\n\n       NLC's 1994 survey results are dominated by concerns about \n     public safety and unfunded mandates. Local economies also \n     remained an important concern. Three hundred and eighty two \n     (382) of the nation's municipal officials responded to the \n     survey, which was mailed out before the November elections.\n\n                             Public safety\n\n       Nearly two out of three (63.4 percent) of city officials \n     say that your crime worsened in their locality in 1994.\n       Crime and violence dominate the ``most deteriorated \n     conditions'' over the last five years. Five out of the top 6 \n     most deteriorated conditions reported by local officials \n     focused on public safety concerns.\n       Three out of 10 of the ``most important conditions to \n     address'' in the next two years relate to public safety.\n       More municipal elected officials (63.6 percent) selected \n     ``strengthening and supporting family stability'' as one of \n     the top five measures most likely to reduce crime than any \n     other. The next four items on the list are: jobs and targeted \n     economic development (48.4 percent, more police officers \n     (39.8 percent), after-school programs (33.0 percent), and \n     neighborhood watch programs (33.0 percent).\n       Fifty five percent of elected officials reported that \n     police/community relations improved in 1994. Thirty seven \n     percent of local officials reported that police/community \n     relations was one of the ``most improved conditions'' over \n     the last five years.\n\n                           Unfunded mandates\n\n       Seventy-five percent (74.6 percent) of municipal elected \n     officials indicated that the impact of unfunded mandates \n     worsened in 1994.\n       Mandates topped city officials' list of the ten ``most \n     deteriorated conditions'' over the last 5 years. Thirty-five \n     percent (35.1 percent) of officials indicated that unfunded \n     mandates were the most deteriorated condition over the last 5 \n     years.\n       Forty-two percent (41.9 percent) of local officials \n     reported that citizens understand well or somewhat the issue \n     of unfunded mandates in 1994. This was a 15 percentage point \n     increase from the 27.5 percent reported by local officials in \n     1993.\n\n                            Local economies\n\n       Four of the top 10 ``most important conditions to address'' \n     in the next two years are related to local economies. More \n     than one-fifth of local officials reported that city fiscal \n     conditions (25.2 percent) and economic conditions (21.1 \n     percent) were most important to address during the next two \n     years.\n       Forty-eight percent (48.3 percent) of local officials \n     reported improved local economic \n     [[Page S1398]] conditions in 1994, and 46.4 percent of local \n     officials reported that local unemployment conditions \n     improved in 1994.\n       At the same time, about one-fifth of other municipal \n     officials reported that the economic conditions and \n     unemployment had worsened in their locality (21.7 percent, \n     and 18.8 percent respectively).\n\n                            Local governance\n\n       Fifty three percent (53.3 percent) of local elected \n     officials indicated that municipal service levels were \n     maintained in 1994. Two-thirds (64.4 percent) of these \n     officials reported that even if city tax rates and fees are \n     not increased in 1995, they will be able to maintain service \n     levels.\n       Seventy-one percent of mayors, city council members and \n     other elected officials indicate that their cities and towns \n     are involved in local education reform/improvements efforts.\n       Ten percent (9.5 percent) of responding officials indicated \n     that their cities and towns have a formal telecommunications \n     policy for participation on the ``information superhighway.'' \n     Seventy-eight percent of officials indicated that they are \n     either working on or thinking about putting a \n     telecommunication policy in place.\n       More than four-fifths (85.6 percent) of local elected \n     officials believe that regional cooperation is important in \n     helping local government achieve its goals.\n\n\n                                Mandates\n\n       ``So we must keep saying over and over again until the \n     members of the 104th congress heed our cry. `No check, no \n     mandate . . .'

Twenty seven \n     percent of local officials reported that citizens in their \n     communities understood the issue of unfunded mandates either \n     well or somewhat in 1993. Fifty eight percent of officials \n     reported that citizens in their community either understand \n     little about the issue or they do not understand the issue.\n\n\n                    Overall Conditions and Mandates\n\n       Municipal elected officials (see Chapter 2) reported that \n     overall conditions related to mandates worsened in 1994. \n     Seventy four percent of local officials indicated that \n     unfunded mandates worsened in 1994.\n       Unfunded mandates also topped city officials list of ``most \n     deteriorated conditions,'' over the last 5 years. When local \n     officials were asked about the most deteriorated conditions \n     in the last five years, 35.1 percent of them indicated that \n     unfunded mandates was one of the most deteriorated \n     conditions. From a list 26 ``conditions'' unfunded mandates \n     was most often mentioned by city officials.\n       When local officials were asked about the most important \n     conditions to address during the next two years, 28.7 percent \n     picked unfunded mandates. Unfunded mandates and (violent \n     crime at 28.4 percent) topped city officials list of the \n     ``most important conditions'' to address in next two years.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE.

Mr. President, I was very pleased that last week the \nSenate took a little time out to pass a very important amendment \nregarding violence at health care clinics around this country. I know \nit was difficult for some of my Republican friends to stop other \nbusiness and pending matters. They have a contract they want to get \nthrough. But as I pointed out, the world goes on, contract or no \ncontract, and we need to respond.\n  I think the fact that we did respond before the anniversary of Roe \nversus Wade was very important in terms of timing. I went to a clinic \nin California in Riverside County. I want to tell my friends in the \nSenate on both sides of \n[[Page S1399]] the aisle that those doctors, those nurses, those \npatients that came out to commemorate Roe versus Wade were very \ngrateful to the U.S. Senate, and very grateful to the Attorney General \nbecause marshals were sent there to ensure their safety.\n  As I said to those who came to the commemoration of Roe versus Wade, \nthis is the greatest country on Earth because we settle our problems \npeacefully and we are not like Bosnia and other countries where we \ndecide issues through the barrel of a gun. There are going to be very \nmany issues that we face in our Nation that are going to divide us. The \nbeauty of America is that we are tolerant, or should be tolerant, of \neach other's views, and we will decide these issues with the rule of \nlaw.\n  Unfortunately, yesterday we heard from some of the organizations that \nwant to make abortion illegal in this country. We heard that they put \nout a hit list of a dozen physicians. They handed out the names of \nthese physicians, their addresses, their photos, and the stalking \ncontinues. The stalking goes beyond the physicians, to their families, \ntheir children, their loved ones at their churches, synagogues, at \ntheir homes, places where one should be at peace.\n  So I will call on all sides in this very difficult debate to condemn \nviolence. When we speak to each other, speak in terms that do not \ninsight violence. We cannot on the one hand say this is murder and then \ntake no responsibility when someone takes those words literally.\n  I again want to thank my colleagues in the U.S. Senate on both sides \nfor that overwhelming vote on that resolution, which I understand has \nbeen extricated from this bill and stands on its own as a sense of the \nSenate. I think it is very meaningful. I think we have to keep our eye \non that issue.\n  Mr. President, violence seems to be so common in the world today. The \ntragedy that took place in Israel must be condemned as we have \ncondemned such terrorism before. If peace talks are abandoned in the \nMiddle East because of violence, then the terrorists will have won. \nThat is another area where I hope we can perhaps take off our green \neyeshades for a few minutes and let the world know that the U.S. Senate \ncondemns that kind of international terrorism.\n  Mr. President, I have been waiting a long time to speak about S. 1. I \nam a member of one of the committees of jurisdiction, the Budget \nCommittee. At the time that the Budget Committee took up S. 1, my \nchairman, Senator Domenici, and my ranking member, Senator Exon, asked \nif I would delay my amendments until we got to the Senate floor. I feel \nvery strongly about these amendments, but I agreed to that because I \nlike the thrust of S. 1. I was in local government myself. This is a \ngood bill. I want to see this bill passed. I think it is a good bill. I \nbelieve the amendments that I offered will make this bill a better \nbill. I believe many of the amendments offered by Senator Levin will \nalso improve the bill, and I must praise him for his incredible work on \nthis bill. I watched until the last moment last night as Senator Levin \nasked both managers for their views on certain important issues \nsurrounding S. 1.\n  I think it is fair to say both managers were very articulate but in \nsome cases did not exactly agree with each other on some provisions in \nS. 1. These are the things that we need to work out so that we have a \ngood bill, so that we do not have a bill that is going to paralyze this \nU.S. Senate and hurt the people of this country. That is not anyone's \nintent.\n But I think we have to examine this bill and see what it does. I am \ngoing to go over these charts that explain exactly what happens under \nS. 1 and whether we feel it has not crossed the line and become \nparalysis by analysis.\n\n  Again, I want to say that I am in agreement with the thrust of this \nbill. I was a local government official for 6 very proud years, a \nmember of the board of supervisors of Marin County, CA. I won my first \nseat in 1976, and I saw many laws that were passed down from the State, \nand Federal Governments that we had to deal with. By the way, some of \nthem were excellent laws. Some of them were paid for. Some of them \ncalled for partnerships between Federal, State and local government. I, \nfrankly, grew up in politics with the understanding that there should \nbe a partnership here.\n  When someone comes to the U.S. Senate, it does not make them a bad \nperson. I am the same person I was when I was a local elected official. \nI am just a little bit older and a little bit grayer and perhaps, \nhopefully, a little bit wiser.\n  But the bottom line is that I am that same person that wants to make \nlife better for my constituency. I think it is important that we \ndiscuss who our constituency is. Every day I hear letters from \nGovernors and so on, that they love this bill. I understand that. I was \nnot sent here by the Governors, I was sent here by the people of my \nState. As much as I want to work with Governors and local officials--\nand I have an excellent relationship with them--I have to make sure \nthat what we do is not to make life better for Governors, but rather to \nmake life better for all Californians.\n  As I was on the local board of supervisors, we got a mandate that \ncame down from the Federal Government that, in case of nuclear war, we \nhad to have a plan to evacuate our citizens because we were very close \nto a targeted area; namely, San Francisco, and all of the ported ships \nthere. San Francisco was on the Soviet Union's target list for a \nnuclear bomb. So, sitting as a member of the board of supervisors--and \nat the time, there were three Republicans and two Democrats on that \nboard--we got a mandate down from FEMA saying we had to figure out a \nway to get our people out of town in case there was a nuclear war. By \nthe way, they were counting on a 24-hour notice for the bomb to drop. \nWe were told that we had to evacuate to the county to the north of us, \nand they named that county, Sonoma County, the host county. We were the \nevacuees. We were supposed to go to the host county. FEMA said, ``You \nbetter make sure your people bring cash because they are going to have \nto fill up their cars with gasoline, and the attendants at the gasoline \nstations are going to be too busy to take credit cards.\n  That was the most incredible mandate I had ever seen. That board of \nsupervisors, on a 5-0 vote, said: We do not want this mandate and this \nmoney; this makes no sense at all. We never took the money and we never \nplanned it, because we know the only way to survive a nuclear war is \nnot to have one. That ought to be where the efforts went, not trying to \nfigure out ways to get people out of town because you could not escape \nthe range of the kind of nuclear bomb that we were talking about.\n  So, yes, I understand the problem with these mandates. I hear stories \nlike that wherever I go. So there is no question about it that we must \naddress the problem of unfunded mandates. We should step back and look \nat what we are proposing, make sure it serves the national purpose, and \nif it is appropriate for State and local government to be involved in \nthis. And certainly if it is an expensive mandate, we should figure out \nhow to pay for it.\n  I am disturbed by some aspects of this bill. This bill is not the \nsame bill that was before us last year--a bill that I supported, a bill \nthat was not bureaucratic, a bill that was simpler to understand. But I \nthink we can fix this bill. I am extremely hopeful that my amendments \nwill pass, and I am going to explain what they are and that many other \namendments will pass with this bill, so that it is a good bill.\n  We have to be careful not to prescribe a cure that is going to hurt \nour people unintentionally. I want to make a point about what the \nAmerican people want. There is always talk after an election about what \nthey want. I think it is fair to discuss the ramifications of this \nelection. But there is a Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll that shows \nin many areas, including protecting the environment, protecting civil \nrights, strengthening the economy, improving the health care system, \nand reforming welfare, the public believes the Federal Government \nshould play a larger role than State or local governments. And those \npercentages in this poll were rather dramatic. So the people are not \nsaying to us, ``Do nothing''; the people are saying to us, ``Get it \nright.'' They are saying, ``We send you back there to care about the \nenvironment, to care about our jobs, to care about the economy, to care \nabout crime, to care about welfare, but get it right.'' I do \n[[Page S1400]] not think they sent us here to create a bureaucracy and \na system here that could well paralyze us as we try to meet those needs \nof the environment, health care, welfare reform, and all of the things \npeople think we ought to address.\n  I also want to make a comment about the Democrats voting against the \ncloture motion so that we can continue debating this bill. I have \nlistened very carefully to the debate, and having witnessed 2 years of \nRepublican filibusters--and as Bob Dole says, you are the experts, my \nRepublican friends; the Republicans taught the Democrats how to do it. \nI know a filibuster when I see one and when I am in one, and we are not \nin one, and this is not a filibuster.\n  This bill needs amending. This Senator said in a very bipartisan \nspirit in the Budget Committee that I would withhold my amendments. I \noffered one amendment to sunset the bill, and it was voted down three \ntimes on party line votes. But as far as my amendments of substance, \nthis Senator said she would put off her amendments until we got to the \nfloor. And I voted for the bill, to move the bill forward, because I \nlike the thrust of it and I want to fix it, and I hope I can vote for \nit.\n  The distinguished majority whip called me, and he said, ``Senator can \nyou drop some of your amendments.'' Mr. President, I did not want to \ndrop any of my four amendments, but I agreed to drop one of the four \namendments in a bipartisan spirit. I said, ``All right, I think Senator \nWellstone has a similar amendment to mine on the benefits of some of \nthese mandates, and so I will work with him and I will drop my \namendment.'' We have done that, and I will talk more about that later.\n  I agreed to drop one of my amendments in good spirit, because I knew \nthat we want to move this process forward. So we are not seeking delay, \nwe are seeking answers to questions--unanswered questions. I thank \nSenator Byrd, once again, for insisting on committee reports. It was \nvery important that all views be known on this bill. I was rather \nstunned when on another party line vote the Budget Committee and the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee voted not to issue committee reports. I \ndo not ever remember that happening when the Democrats were in the \nmajority. I could be wrong, but I have certainly no personal memory of \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I would like to show the Senators and the public the \nkind of process that we are now dealing with currently under S. 1, a \nprocess that is quite different from where the bill was last year. I am \ngoing to go over this chart, not read everything on it, but try to make \nit clear as to why I have some concerns.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wonder if I could ask the Senator \nwhether I could, in less than 20 seconds just offer two amendments, en \nbloc. That is all I need to do, given the unanimous consent agreement. \nWill the Senator consent to that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may yield \nfor the Senator to put forward his amendments without losing my right \nto the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendments Nos. 204 and 205\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send two amendments to the desk, en \nbloc, and ask for their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes \n     amendments numbered 204 and 205.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n                           amendment no. 204\n\n       Insert at the appropriate place the following:\n       ``(  ) The term ``direct savings''--\n       ``(  ) in the case of a federal intergovernmental mandate, \n     means the aggregate estimated reduction in costs or burdens \n     to any State, local government, or tribal government as a \n     result of compliance with the federal intergovernmental \n     mandate.\n       ``(  ) in the case of a Federal private sector mandate, \n     means the aggregate estimated reduction in costs or burdens \n     to the private sector as a result of compliance with the \n     Federal private sector mandate.\n       ``(  ) shall be interpreted no less broadly than the terms \n     `Federal mandate direct costs' and `direct costs.'''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 205\n\n       Insert at the appropriate place, the following:\n       ``(  ) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no \n     point of order under paragraph (1)(A) of Section 408(c) shall \n     be raised where the appropriation of funds to the \n     Congressional Budget Office, in the estimation of the Senate \n     Committee on the Budget, is insufficient to allow the \n     Director reasonably to carry out the Director's \n     responsibilities under this Act.''\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it was my pleasure to yield time to \nexpedite the business of the U.S. Senate.\n  I want to now start explaining this chart, or I should say, these two \ncharts. We could not fit all of these procedures onto one chart, so we \nactually had to make up two charts to show what goes on here with S. 1.\n  And, again, I am not going to go through every step, but I am going \nto try to take you through a little bit of it because here we are about \nto pass this bill, and I venture to say not too many people in the U.S. \nSenate are aware of what we are about to do here unless there are some \nchanges.\n  The legislative committee proposes the bill that will likely impact \nState and local governments or the private sector. It then goes to the \ncommittee which, if it approves the bill, now has to take two tracks. \nThe committee sends the bill to the Congressional Budget Office with \nidentification of any Federal mandate, and CBO, the Congressional \nBudget Office, sets its whole process in motion. That is the red. The \ncommittee is the yellow. This is the red for CBO, and I will get back \nto that in a minute.\n  While the CBO is making its analysis of the costs, the committee \nprepares its report. It has to wait, really, until CBO gives them the \nnumber but, hopefully, if all works right--and around here, in my \nmemory, I do not know that all works right most of the time--but \nassuming we will give it every break, everything works right, and the \nCBO, after talking to, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of folks, \nbecause they do talk to and interview people all over to make their \nanalysis, now comes in with the cost.\n  So the committee report comes in with the expected direct cost to \nState and local governments and the private sector, a qualitative and \nquantitative assessment of benefits expected, and how you get to the \nbenefits is a whole other issue.\n  How will CBO quantify the benefit of immunizing a child? The benefit \nof cleaning up the air? What is the benefit if people do not get asthma \nand they can come to work more? That is a whole other question that \nthis bill does not really answer. What is the benefit of cleaning up \nthe water, taking the lead out, the mercury out, the bacteria out? Just \nask the people in Milwaukee, where 400,000 of them got sick and 120 \ndied because of cryptosporidium, a parasite which got into the water \nsupply.\n  But those benefits, frankly, are not going to be calculated as part \nof the net costs under the bill currently before us.\n  CBO will also analyze the impact on the private and public sectors \nand report on the extent of change to competitive relationships between \nState and local government and private business, and add a statement of \nwhether the bill preempts State and local law.\n  Now this could take a year. But it is going to be pushed through.\n  Under the best of circumstances, and if the mandate is less than $50 \nmillion, the bill moves to the floor and it gets to the \nParliamentarian. So that is where I am up to.\n  Now, first, if the bill is more than $50 million, there are \nadditional committee statements on an increase or decrease in Federal \nassistance or of authorization of appropriations; second, whether \nmandates are fully or partially funded and the rationale; and third, \nwhether the bill preempts State, local, or tribal law.\n   [[Page S1401]] And then those additional committee statements come \nhere to the floor.\n  Now, this is where the Parliamentarian gets into it. Now, Mr. \nPresident, I think the Parliamentarians are terrific. I had the joy of \nsitting where you sit for 2 years when we were in the majority. These \nParliamentarians are brilliant. There is not one question you ask them \nthat they will not come up with the right answer. I never had an \nexperience like that.\n  But these Parliamentarians are not elected by the people and they are \nnot accountants. For all of their standing and the fact that their \nfaces are on CNN and C-SPAN, people do not know these Parliamentarians. \nThey do not, in California, vote for these Parliamentarians. And yet, \nthe Parliamentarians have the life-or-death power over not only every \nbill that may impact State and local government, but every amendment \nthat any Senator sends up.\n  So here is where we are. We now have the Parliamentarian having about \nas much power as the committee. If you look at the green, the \nParliamentarian determines whether the point of order under S. 1 \napplies to the bill. The Governmental Affairs and the Budget Committee \nmight be consulted at this point. But they do not have to be, and it \ngoes and it moves. A point of order cannot be raised if the bill \ncontains costs that are less than $50 million; or if the bill contains \ncosts that are greater than $50 million to State and local governments \nbut increases direct spending.\n  So, in other words, if we raised the taxes, a point of order cannot \nlie against it. A point of order cannot lie if the bill increases \nreceipts to meet the full costs of the mandate. A point of order cannot \nbe raised if the bill contains costs that are greater than $50 million \nto State and local governments and increases appropriations to meet the \ndirect costs of the mandate. The bill must, one, state the yearly total \namount, state the source of the funds, and state the minimum amount \nnecessary in each appropriation, and provided that the appropriations \nare not made available in the future, the mandate would expire or the \nmandate would be reduced by the corresponding drop in funding.\n  So there would be no point of order in that scenario. If there is no \npoint of order, the bill continues on the floor, Mr. President. But \nthen, the bill is open to amendment.\n  Now, the amendment process around here is greatly valued by every \nsingle Senator. It is our opportunity to bring our priorities for our \npeople to the floor of the Senate.\n  So here we go. The bill manages to make it through all this, if it is \nstill alive and on its feet. If it is amended, the whole process starts \nall over again.\n  Can you imagine that? Every floor amendment is subjected to this \nentire process, and you start all over again. Every single amendment.\n  I daresay, if you look at the amendments that have been offered to \nbills over the last year, Republican and Democratic amendments alike, \nthey probably number into the thousands. Imagine this bureaucratic \nnightmare being repeated for every single amendment?\n  Now, when the bill was first written last year, it provided for a CBO \ncost estimate and if it did not have it, a point of order could be \nraised on the floor. That was sensible, because we wanted to make sure \nthat our people were aware, if we were proposing laws, that there was \ngoing to be a cost.\n  But all these new layers were added. And, by the way, I hasten to \nadd, Mr. President, this is all repeated on the House side. And if you \nhave a House bill and a Senate bill that are not the same, guess what \nhappens? It starts all over again with the conference report. We are \nback to square one. With the conference report, it starts all over \nagain, and I have not even gone into all the steps CBO has to take.\n  They have to talk to everyone you can imagine to come up with their \nestimate because, after all, this is a great responsibility on \nunelected bureaucrats. We are putting so much power in this bill on \nunelected bureaucrats, CBO, Parliamentarians, these may be the best \npeople in America, for all I know. But they were not elected by the \npeople of California. And if we pass a bill that says we found out from \nthe Kobe earthquake that we need to seismically upgrade our bridges and \nour highways, and we decide that it makes sense to make sure that the \nplanners keep this in mind, and we want to pass such a law, but we \ncannot get the votes to waive the point of order, the bill dies. Yes, \nit may be a cost on State and local government. But do you know what \nthe savings would be?\n  Know what the savings would be? Mr. President, when I was on that \nboard of supervisors we were in a beautiful Frank Lloyd Wright \nbuilding. It was his last building that was constructed before his \ndeath, the last public building. Unfortunately, it was very unsafe from \nearthquakes. When I found out about it, I went to my colleagues and \nsaid, ``We sit in a beautiful, magnificent building that houses 1,200 \npeople; in case of an earthquake they will be history.''\n  Some of my colleagues said, ``Do not talk about it, Barbara. Do not \ntalk about it. We do not have the $5 million to do this.''\n  I said, ``We have to do it because $5 or $10 million of investment to \nsave 1,200 lives is a very important investment, and in the end if we \nsave 1,200 lives we have saved countless millions of dollars, and we \nhave saved heartbreak and distress.''\n  And we did it. So, yes, certain things have an up-front cost but they \nhave a payoff, by the way, not adequately reflected in S. 1.\n  Mr. President, I hope I have shown what this bill would do. Now, that \ndoes not even get into what Federal agencies have to do if this bill \npasses.\n  The orange shows all the things that agencies are required to do. \nAssessment of the effects on regulations, State and local governments \nand the private sector, minimizing the burden on governmental entities, \ncontinued regulatory functions, a pilot program to reduce compliance \nand reporting requirements on small government. All these things are \ngood. I support them all. But all these are burdens on agencies, and \nseems to me, while we are doing this, now we are laying over this whole \nstructure a legislative process which does not even wait for the \noutcome of these other, very expensive, analyses. Agency consideration \nof a proposed rule, agency determination of cost, cost to local, \ntribal, State governments of less than $100 million aggregate cost. It \nmoves on and on, all the things they have to do before they can go \nforward with a rule.\n  Then there is this Advisory Committee on Intergovernmental Relations, \nACIR. They are reviewing existing mandates. This is all the work they \nhave to do. Well, I am glad that they are looking at this. I think this \nis very useful.\n  But it seems to me when we put this all together into one bill, we \nare placing additional layers of complication on top of Government \nprocesses which are already unwieldy. We complain about it. At least \nmany Senators do. We are laying on hundreds of steps, if not thousands \nof steps--hundreds of millions of dollars of work. Reports, paper, \nshuffling, unelected people having power. Therefore, I think since this \nbill has changed so dramatically from the very straightforward bill of \nlast year, which I supported, I think we have to be very careful and \nconsider these amendments which are going to make this bill better.\n  I would ask the Senator from Kentucky, is he interested in sending \nany amendments to the desk at this time? I would be happy to pause \nwhile he does that.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may I answer that question from the \ndistinguished Senator from California without her losing the right to \nthe floor. I have an amendment, I say to my friend from California, we \nare now attempting to work it out. It may be acceptable. So I thank the \nSenator for her courtesy, as always, but we may have to ask at some \npoint, but not now.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator, and this Senator \nstands ready to yield at any point without losing her right to the \nfloor so we can expedite the bill. It is not my purpose to slow down, \nbut to get on the record my feelings about where we are and why I think \nthese amendments are entitled to be heard and why they are so \nimportant.\n  There are so many unanswered questions and so many ambiguities. \nAgain, I want to mention that Senator Levin \n[[Page S1402]] has really done this U.S. Senate a service. If Members \nwatched his questioning of the managers, some of the questions he \nasked. How does the bill cover floor amendments? I have just explained \nto Members the way I believe it covers floor amendments, that when an \namendment is presented to the bill, we have to go over the same ground \nagain.\n  By the way, I think that Senator Levin raised a very good point, does \na Member have a right to get a CBO estimate if a Member of the Senate \nbelieves that he or she wants to offer an amendment, is that Member \nentitled to get an estimate and not have to go through an authorizing \ncommittee? How can that Member come to the floor? There will be \nprejudice against that amendment if these things are not costed out. I \nwas heartened to see that both managers, I believe I am correct, and I \nask the Senator from Ohio, both managers agree this is a problem. The \nSenator is indicating yes. These are ways we can improve this bill.\n  We also have to make sure that we know if a reauthorization lapses \nand it is later taken up by Congress, would that reauthorization be \nconsidered a new mandate. How would the less money/less mandate \ndrawdown provision work in the real world? How will the bill's \nexclusions work?\n  Let me bring one out. Would the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances \nAct that Congress passed last year have been exempted under the civil \nrights exclusion? No one has been able to answer that question. If it \nwould not meet the exclusion, would we have to then have a vote on \nwhether or not to provide the States with all the funds they might \nneed?\n  Will the CBO analysis be an obstacle to efforts to protect the health \nand safety of our people? For example, will it put a dead stop to the \nSafe Drinking Water Act? To worker safety, earthquake safety? Will it \nput a dead stop to things that people need? The Governors may like it, \nbut what abut the people we represent?\n  The bill says direct savings to a State or local government from a \nmandate will offset the mandate cost amount. I applaud that. But the \nbill does not define ``direct savings.'' What about the costs of not \nenacting health and safety protections? Do the savings that accrue to \nthe American people from such protections offset direct costs from the \nbill? For example, if a child's lung capacity is lower because of air \npollution and that child is chronically ill, what are the savings \nassociated with cleaning up the air? I want Senators to know, my \nfriends here in the Senate, that a child living in Los Angeles has a \nsignificantly lower lung capacity than a child born in a clean air \narea. That is wrong. We cannot put ourselves in a bureaucratic \nnightmare when we want to protect kids' health. Or retrofit bridges so \nthey do not collapse in the next earthquake.\n  Now, I plan to offer an amendment to prevent the bill from weakening \nour ability to protect the most vulnerable members of our society. \nThere are many who say the measure of a society is the way it treats \nits most vulnerable. Not its powerful. Not the healthy. Not the \nvigorous. That is easy. Because those of us who are healthy, we do not \nneed much help. We will make it through. But the most vulnerable, the \nchildren, pregnant women and the frail elderly--this amendment would \nadd bills that protect children and others to the list of mandates not \nsubjected to the procedural hurdles that are created by S. 1 right \nhere. It would be a statement.\n  It would say when we say we are for the children, and we are for the \nelderly, and we want healthy pregnant women so they have healthy \nbabies, that we mean it. And the Boxer amendment will give a chance to \neveryone, Republicans and Democrats, to go on the record in that \nregard.\n  Look, there are exceptions in this bill. And they are very important. \nI submit that if there were no exceptions put into this bill then I \nwould take that as a signal that the bill really is easy to administer.\n  But the bill is difficult to administer. By the way, I think that is \npart of the idea, you make it tough, make it tough to spend money in \nthe future. But it is so tough, this new version of this bill--very \ndifferent from last year's version--that there is an exception section, \nand I am suggesting we add some things to it, among them the protection \nof our most vulnerable populations.\n  All it says is:\n\n       Any bill which provides for the protection of the health of \n     children under the age of 5, pregnant women or the frail \n     elderly would not be subject to S. 1's point of order and \n     other requirements.\n\n  As I said, there are exceptions to S. 1, and I support them. S. 1 \ncurrently shields bills that help secure our constitutional rights, \nthat prevent discrimination, that ensure national security and \nimplement international agreements, such as NAFTA, from its \nrequirements.\n  The bill makes exemptions, and let me quote:\n\n       To ensure Congress' and the executive branch's hands are \n     not tied with procedural requirements in times of national \n     emergencies.\n\n  That is a direct quote from the Governmental Affairs Committee \nchairman's report on S. 1. So there are exceptions ``to ensure that \nCongress' and the executive branch's hands are not tied with procedural \nrequirements in times of national emergencies.''\n  I submit to my colleagues that there are other things that are worthy \nof not tying the hands of this U.S. Senate with this kind of procedural \nnightmare, and that ought to be protecting our most vulnerable \ncitizens.\n  Why should we deny our children, pregnant women and the elderly \nprotections? Our most vulnerable people should not be treated like \nguinea pigs. We must ensure they will not be put at risk, and they \nshould be exempted from S. 1.\n  Environmental science shows us that children, pregnant women and the \nelderly are uniquely vulnerable to environmental hazards. And by the \nway, one of the things that people are saying since this election, \n``environment'' is a bad word, it is no longer in vogue, people do not \ncare. I do not believe that. People continue to want clean water and \nclean air. People continue to want a clean and safe working environment \nand living environment for themselves and their families.\n  The overall incidence of childhood cancer has increased, and I want \nto say to my colleagues--listen to this--the overall incidence of \nchildhood cancer increased 10.8 percent between 1973 and 1990. That is \na huge increase. Cancer is now the No. 1 disease killer of children \nfrom late infancy through early adulthood.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia allow me to make a unanimous-consent request, that I might \nbe recognized without the Senator losing her right to the floor?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I fully support that as long as I retain the right to the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 206\n\n       (Purpose: To strike a provision relating to the House of \n                            Representatives)\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 206.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 26, strike beginning with line 11 through line 8 on \n     page 27.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, S. 1 contains an entire section, section \n102, on enforcement of this legislation under the House rules which \ncreate specific points of order under the House rules. This section \ndirectly amends also rule XXIII of House rules. Therefore, my amendment \nstrikes the balance of section 102, and that relieves the Senate of the \nresponsibility of directing the House as to what they should or should \nnot do.\n  It is my understanding that the distinguished manager and ranking \nmember have agreed to this amendment. I hope that it can be accepted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, we are more than willing to accept \nthis \n[[Page S1403]] amendment as offered by the Senator from Kentucky. Also, \nI have discussed this with the leaders in the House of Representatives. \nThey understand the rationale for this. Again, we are ready to accept \nthis.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I accept it on our side, also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 206) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair, I thank the Senator from California. I \nam very pleased to have this amendment accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from California.\n\n\n                        Amendments Nos . 201-203\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to congratulate my colleague from \nKentucky on getting his amendment adopted. I hope that my amendments \nwill have the same fate; that they would, in fact, be adopted because I \nbelieve that every Member in this Senate, at one point or another, has \nsaid they believe that our children must be protected, our pregnant \nwomen, our frail elderly, and we are giving our Senators a chance to \nsay, yes, that is an important priority and should not have to go \nthrough this kind of procedural hassle should there be an important law \nthat affects their health.\n  I was saying, and I will repeat it, that the overall incidence of \nchildhood cancer has increased 10.8 percent between 1973 and 1990, \nalmost an 11-percent increase in America of childhood cancers. Cancer \nis the No. 1 disease killer of children from late infancy through early \nadulthood. In 1993, a National Academy of Sciences report found that \nchildren are uniquely vulnerable to the harmful effects, for example, \nof pesticides. Young children are more susceptible to environmental \nhealth threats because of their behavior. They often play at ground \nlevel where pollutants can concentrate. Their biology makes them more \nsusceptible because young children drink more water, breathe more air \nand eat more food as a percentage of their body weight than do adults.\n  It is common sense. It is common sense. And a lot of the standards \nthat today we have for water and for food are based on a healthy male \nadult, a 170-pound healthy male adult. Mr. President, you probably fit \nthat category. I do not know for sure, but a 170-pound healthy male \nadult is where we set the standard. A little baby is not considered \nsometimes, and it is not that we have been purposely trying to harm our \nchildren. Of course not. We are trying to be intelligent about how we \nset standards. But we are now learning more that we did not know \nbefore; that children are different, just as children who get AIDS \nreact differently than adults.\n  We have to look at children, the frail elderly and pregnant women in \na different category than 170-pound healthy male adults. And if we find \nout that they are being harmed--and we have had colleagues on the other \nside, right now I know of two, whose children have cancer, one a little \nbaby, one a young adult. I bet all of us can think in our own lives of \npeople we know who are young who are getting cancers.\n  Pregnant women and the frail elderly are particularly vulnerable. A \nrecent American Lung Association study cited their increased \nsusceptibility to air pollution. Again, I will raise the issue of \nMilwaukee, WI, a 1993 drinking water disaster. Cryptosporidium found \nits way past the Milwaukee water treatment plant and went into the \ncity's drinking water. The parasite wreaked havoc with the people of \nMilwaukee causing over 400,000 serious illnesses, over 100 deaths and \n$54 million in damages.\n  So here we are talking about getting a bill to clean up the water \nfrom these parasites as having to go through this hurdle when, in fact, \nif we would just clean it up, we would save probably more than it costs \nto fix the problem. But it is unclear how those benefits would be \naccounted for under S. 1. Many benefits may not be counted at all.\n  I want to make a point about those deaths in Milwaukee, over 100 \ndeaths. As I understand it, most of those deaths occurred in the most \nvulnerable populations: the children and the frail elderly.\n  Will the provisions of S. 1 give Congress the freedom to act with all \nneeded speed to shield our most vulnerable populations? Obviously not, \nunless we add them to the exceptions, and I hope my Republican friends \nwill agree to this amendment because there is new information that the \nstandards that are set for drinking water, for air, for other safety \nissues have not been set for these populations.\n  My amendment will ensure that S. 1 does not hobble the ability of \nCongress to protect these populations.\n  Let me talk a little more about children because it gets to my second \namendment, and I have three, so, Mr. President, mercifully, I am \nwinding down.\n  The second amendment is one I think should have broad support. \nSenator Dodd is my leading cosponsor, and I am very proud of that \nbecause he has been, in the Senate, a protector of children.\n  I plan to offer a second amendment that excludes this law from laws \nthat protect our children from pornography, sexual assault and \nexploitative labor practices. My amendment says that any bill which is \nintended to study, control, deter, prevent, prohibit, or otherwise \nmitigate child pornography, child abuse and illegal child labor would \nbe exempt from S. 1's point of order and other requirements.\n  As I said before, S. 1 currently shields bills that help secure \nconstitutional rights, prevent discrimination, ensure national \nsecurity, and implement international agreements from its requirements. \nI support that section, but it is not enough because if there is a bill \nthat deals with child pornography, child abuse, and child labor which \nis intended to protect our children, it will have to go through these \nunbelievable hurdles as will every amendment. Even if the bill goes \nthrough all the way to here, if there is an amendment, the amendment \nhas to go back to square one. And I think it is time this Senate stood \nup--we have before--and said we think child pornography is a problem, \nwe think child sexual abuse is a problem, and we intend to protect our \nchildren from sexual assault and from child labor policies that may \nharm them.\n  Now, let me put some facts on the table. People might say, well, is \nthis really a problem in America? The answer is yes. In 1992, 2.9 \nmillion children were reported abused or neglected, about triple the \nnumber reported in 1980. That same year there were over 300,000 reports \nof abuse or neglect in California. Let me repeat, in my home State \n300,000 reports of abuse or neglect, nationwide 2.9 million.\n  Now, of those children, of that universe of 2.9 million children in \nAmerica, 49 percent suffered neglect, 23 percent physical abuse, 14 \npercent sexual abuse, 5 percent emotional abuse, and 3 percent medical \nneglect.\n  Under the National Child Protection Act signed into law by the \nPresident in 1993, States are required to place child abuse crime \ninformation in the FBI's criminal records system so that others can do \nbackground checks. This, my friends, is a mandate to protect our \nchildren, and I daresay every single Senator supports it. The crime \nbill passed last year requires States to register the current addresses \nof sexually violent offenders with a State law enforcement agency upon \ntheir release from prison or risk loss of Federal funding. I support \nthat. I daresay everyone I know in this Senate and many over in the \nHouse do. As I remember, Congresswoman Molinari, who was very active in \nthis issue, supported this.\n  This, too, is a mandate to protect our children. There are mandates \nthat also protect our children from exploitation in the workplace. Now, \nlet me tell you about that. We thought that fight was over. But in \n1994, the Department of Labor found over 8,000 illegally employed \nminors and assessed over $6 million in civil penalties to employers. By \nlaw, State and local government as well as private businesses are \nprohibited from hiring children younger than 14 years of age, and teens \nbetween 14 and 16 may work after school only in \n[[Page S1404]] nonhazardous jobs. This, too, is a mandate to protect \nour children, a mandate that I do not want to see taken away.\n  Now, will the provisions of S. 1 allow Congress to act quickly in the \nfuture to strengthen these mandates for the sake of our children? Let \nus look at some examples. According to studies conducted by the \nInstitute of Occupational Safety and Health, over 64,000 teenagers \nsought treatment in hospital emergency rooms for job-related injuries \nin 1992.\n  Let me repeat that: In 1992, over 64,000 teenagers sought treatment \nin hospital emergency rooms for job-related injuries; 670 16- and 17-\nyear-olds died from workplace injuries between 1980 to 1989. Let me \nrepeat that to the mothers and fathers of this country and to the \nmothers and fathers in this Senate, of which I am one, soon to be a \ngrandmother: 670 16- and 17-year-olds died from workplace injuries from \n1980 to 1989.\n  Now, in response to these trends, Congress could decide to improve \nour child labor laws so that kids are not working in dangerous or life-\nthreatening jobs. If so, we should be able to enact legislation quickly \nwithout going through this nightmare process that we have in this bill \nwhich we did not have in last year's bill.\n  Child labor violations are escalating. In 1990, the Department of \nLabor detected over 42,000 child labor violations, an increase of 340 \npercent since 1983. My friends, if we do not act, we are derelict. \nThere is a 340-percent increase in child labor violations--38,000 \nillegally employed children. Congress could decide there needs to be \nmore vigorous enforcement of this law, and we could not act fast unless \nwe were in the exceptions clause.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment, to protect our children. We \nshould not have to jump these hurdles. The crime bill passed last year \ncontained a sense-of-the-Congress resolution suggesting that States \nwhich have not done so enact legislation ``prohibiting the production, \ndistribution, receipt, or possession'' of child pornography. According \nto the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Kansas, \nFlorida, and Georgia have no laws against child pornography. \nMississippi and Michigan have no laws making it a crime to possess \nchild pornography. Congress could well find that not enough States have \nenacted antichild pornography laws and require States to do so. If so, \nwe should be able to act fast.\n  To make matters worse, those who traffic in child pornography have \nfound a new method--the computer bulletin board. Pornographic images \nare transmitted by computer and some adults have used online \ncommunications to lure young children and abuse them. Let me explain. \nThe following incident was reported in the April 18, 1994, issue of \nNewsweek.\n  A 27-year-old computer engineer in California used his computer to \nprey upon a 14-year-old boy. After many online conversations, he \npersuaded the boy to meet him in person. The boy was handcuffed, \nshackled, blindfolded, and taken to the man's apartment.\n  I do not want to go into everything that happened to this child \nbecause of the sensitivity of those things, but they were despicable. \nThey were despicable. And then that 27-year-old forced the 14-year-old \nto write about the abuse. The man was arrested when the boy's father \ndiscovered this.\n  In response to stories like this one, Congress could require State \nand local law enforcement agencies to spend more on tracking and \npreventing such abuse. Could we act fast on such a bill under S. 1? No, \nwe could not. No, we could not unless we exempt laws that deal with \nchild abuse, child pornography, and child labor laws from these hurdles \nand put them into the exceptions along with the one on vulnerable \npopulations.\n Otherwise, they are going to be caught up in a bureaucratic nightmare \nwhich, I add, was not part of last year's bill.\n\n  So I want to put my colleagues on record. Do they think the fight \nagainst child pornography ought to be bogged down in the bureaucracy of \nS. 1? Do they think the fight against child sex abuse should be bogged \ndown in this? Or the fight to make sure that our kids are healthy, that \nour newborns are healthy, that our frail elderly are not killed because \nwe have not acted quickly enough--for example, to clean up a water \nsupply. We have documentation of what happened in Milwaukee. These are \nnot horror stories or scare tactics. Mr. President, 120 people died in \nMilwaukee--120 people died in Milwaukee because cryptosporidium got \ninto the water supply.\n  There are other dangers lurking out there. We should not be bogged \ndown in S. 1, a bill that has the right thrust. As a former county \nlocal official, I do not want people telling me what to do on an ad hoc \nbasis whenever they get the urge. But let us not walk away from our \nresponsibility to protect people and realize that what we do has \nbenefits and that S. 1 fails to adequately account for those benefits.\n  We must vote on these amendments. Let us see where my colleagues come \ndown on these issues. I think it is going to be very interesting, \nbecause I have listened to many great speeches by politicians who are \nDemocrats and Republicans and independents. I do not think I ever heard \none politician who was loved, or elected, who did not talk about the \nimportance of our children and protecting their health and their safety \nand making sure they can grow up and get a shot at the American dream. \nWe may differ on how to get there, but I do not know of anyone who \nwants to expose our kids to abuse of any sort.\n  So my amendments are very straightforward in this. I think this cost \nissue is important. Senator Wellstone has the amendment I am supporting \nthat will deal with that. How could you ever find out the benefits of \nmaking buildings and freeways and highways earthquake proof? Just ask \nthe people of Los Angeles. The buildings that were strong withstood \nthat earthquake. The freeways that were strong withstood that \nearthquake. Benefits? How can you put a number to the fact that we lost \na law enforcement official because he was answering the call of the \nearthquake and he did not see that the freeway had collapsed, and he \ndied? Can you measure what it would have been worth to his family, to \nsociety, if he had lived and provided guidance for his family, and paid \ntaxes to the Government and all the things we do as good citizens?\n  This bill is deficient in that it fails to define direct savings. So \nthere is an amendment offered by Senator Wellstone that will deal with \nthat. The amendment would require CBO to take all such savings into \naccount.\n  The last issue, and then I will yield the floor, that I deal with in \nmy amendments which will be brought up at a later time is the issue of \nillegal immigration. I say to my friend in the chair, his State is \nbeginning to feel a little of the problem. The border States right now \nare feeling a tremendous amount of the problem. I asked the GAO to do a \nstudy. It took Governor Wilson's numbers on the cost of serving illegal \nimmigrants in our State, it looked at other cost estimates, and it \nsubtracted the revenues that the illegal immigrants do in fact provide. \nWe came up with a net cost of $1.4 billion a year to the State of \nCalifornia.\n  I know it is awfully difficult for people from other States to \nunderstand this, but half the illegal immigrants in the country wind up \nin my State; $1.4 billion is a conservative number of what it will \ncost. The Governor will tell you it is over $2 billion. I tried to be \nas fair as I could and subtracted some of the revenues. It is at least \n$1.4 billion.\n  We say this is the unfunded mandates bill. What could be a greater \nunfunded mandate than illegal immigration, where we in our State have \nto provide certain services because the Constitution says we must \nprovide them. Of course we are going to provide health care to people \nif they are bleeding on the street or if they have a disease that could \ncause an epidemic.\n  Prop. 187 expressed the people's views on this subject. They are very \nupset. We have to control our border. I hope we will use this Mexico \nagreement to take steps in that regard. I have put it out there very \nstrongly, that if Mexico is going to have us underwrite a $40 billion \nline of credit, that Mexico has to take steps to equal our effort at \nthe border. I have worked in a bipartisan fashion with Congressman \nStephen Horn in the House and with the administration. I am hopeful we \nwill make progress.\n  Be that as it may, we have a problem and it is costing my State and \nother \n[[Page S1405]] States. This is an unfunded mandates bill. If we ignore \nrepaying States for this biggest unfunded mandate of them all, then I \nthink this bill has lost its meaning. We have 300,000 illegal \nimmigrants enter and take up residence in the United States every year. \nOur illegal immigrant population is about 1.7 million. We are getting \nhalf of the illegal immigrants.\n  So my amendment is very simple. It basically says we are powerless to \nreduce these costs and we want to make sure there is a section of the \nbill which sets up a mechanism whereby States can be reimbursed for \nthese costs. By the way, we do not leave it open. We do not say: \nWhatever Governor Wilson says; or other Governors. We say there is a \ncommission set up under the bill called the Advisory Committee on \nIntergovernment Relations. That is in the bill--here it is. We are \nsaying they should find out a way to reimburse the States and come in \nwith the plan. I think it is a very reasonable amendment, and I am very \nhopeful it will pass.\n  So, in closing, I want to restate that I think this bill can be made \ninto a good bill. But it cannot tie us in knots and still be a good \nbill. People do not want us to be tied up in knots. There are some who \nthink they do. They want to make this United States irrelevant.\n  I read the Constitution, perhaps not as often as the Senator from \nWest Virginia, who carries it in his breast pocket. I do carry it in my \nbriefcase and I do read it. I know what our job is. We are supposed to \nprovide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, ensure \ndomestic tranquility, establish a system of justice. It does not say we \nare supposed to do one thing, provide for the common defense, and \nnothing else. Or one thing, establish a system of justice, and nothing \nelse. It says we have to do it all, and we have to work with other \nlevels of government.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal poll, a vast majority of \ncitizens want us to act when it comes to the environment; they want us \nto act when it comes to crime; they want us to act when it comes to \nthis economy. They do not want us to be tied up in knots. They want us \nto act, act wisely, act sensibly; do not waste money; do not put \nunfunded mandates on the States that really make no sense, that have no \nbenefit. But they do not want to tie us in knots.\n  Last year's bill would not have tied us in knots. The reasons I am \nadding exceptions, and other Members are adding exceptions, is we want \nto make sure when this bill becomes law, there are enough exceptions so \nthings that are really crucial to our people do not get tied up in \nknots. If we do not even need them and perhaps we will change our mind \non them--that is fine. But if it is so important that the life and \ndeath of our children depends on it, or if our frail elderly depends on \nit, we ought to be able to move.\n  We ought to be able to reimburse States that have these terrible \ncosts associated with the failure of Federal Government to enforce the \nlaws at the border.\n  By the way, I have to say I have worked with the Bush administration \nand the Clinton administration on this. We are making some progress. We \nfinally have some reimbursement for incarcerated illegals. I believe \nthat President Clinton is going to announce, from what we see in the \nnewspaper, a good initiative to get more Border Patrol. But we are so \nfar from where we have to be to control the border and it is costing us \nso much money that we need to stop the promises and deliver to these \nStates on that unfunded mandate.\n  So I like S. 993, which was authored by the Senator from Idaho last \nyear. I think it was a better bill. With that bill we would not have \nhad to amend so much. We would have just taken that bill. This bill \ncreates a lot of hurdles, and, therefore, I think we need to get more \nexceptions. I do not think S. 993 went too far. This bill may go too \nfar. If these amendments do not pass, we will just have another layer \nof gridlock on top of the gridlock we already face. There are \nlegislative hurdles here that are worse than unnecessary. But we can \nfix them if we add some exceptions, if we move in these areas, if we \nlisten to Senator Levin and to Senator Glenn and to others who have \nbeen, I think, so informed on this.\n  I do not want Congress paralyzed. I do not think that was the message \nof this election. It was to get on with our work and to do it right and \nto get it right.\n  If I am convinced, after we vote on these amendments, that this bill \nwill be good for California and its people, I will be very proud to \nvote for it. I want to be able to vote for it. But if it really is not \nimproved and it becomes a mask for another agenda, which is the \ndismantling of the protection and laws that help the people of my State \nor leads to paralysis in the U.S. Senate that already suffers from \nenough paralysis, I will not vote for it.\n  Again, I know the Governors love this. We do not work for the \nGovernors. We work for the people. The Governors always hand down \nunfunded mandates to local government. As a matter of fact, it is one \nof the biggest complaints I get from boards of supervisors, that they \nare constantly being handed mandates from the State. So it is not as if \nthe Governors have not done this themselves.\n  We all have to shape up. We all have to stop passing laws that cost \nso much money that do not have a benefit. But if they do have a \nbenefit, we had better calculate that into our formula. We represent \nthe people here, and I think, if we support some of these amendments, \nthis is going to become a great bill, not just a good bill but a great \nbill. But if we vote lockstep against these amendments, I think history \nwill show--and history will unfold as soon as this bill takes over--\nthat this was just a mask for stopping the protections that our people \ndeserve, hurting environmental laws that protect our citizens, and \ntying us up in knots.\n  So I want to thank both managers. They have been extremely patient. I \nwithheld all my debate and all my amendments until I got to the floor \nat the request of the Budget Committee. I feel very pleased that I had \na chance to lay out these issues. When my amendments are called up, I \nwill not need an hour to go into all of them because I will have laid \nthis out on the record and I will be able to summarize my charts and my \nfeelings on my amendments.\n  I again thank the managers. I wish them well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from \nCalifornia, who, as always, has a thoughtful discussion as to her \npoints. I know that she indicated that it may be her view that this \nbill goes too far. I must note that I have a number of Senators who \nthink this bill does not go far enough.\n  So I think maybe we have found something here which is a bill that \ncan accomplish what we need to have done. That is why both the public \nand private sectors are so supportive. I think everyone would say, yes, \nwe can make some changes, what have you, but also what we think about \nall of the concerns of what these unfunded mandates have done for years \nto our cities, to our counties, to our States, and many times I think \nthey have exacerbated the very problems that you have pointed out this \nmorning. I appreciate that.\n  I appreciate, too, that the Senator from California stated she felt \nshe had the opportunity now to lay out her case. When we call her \namendments up for debate--there are some Senators who would like to \ndiscuss them, and I have comments I would like to make specific to \nthem--at that point would she be willing to enter into a time \nagreement?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I reserve my right to agree or disagree depending on how \nmany people on this side wish to speak on my amendments. I assure the \nmanager that I will attempt to find that out and be very reasonable. I \nthink the Senator has been most reasonable. I greatly appreciate it.\n  I am not here to slow down this bill. I am here to make it a better \nbill. I have to say to my friend that this is a different bill from \nlast year's bill. The Senator knows that. I would say that is why the \nexceptions are so crucial because we have made it much more difficult \nto get legislation through. As I pointed out on the charts, the red, \nthe yellow, and the green, if someone has an amendment, it has to go \nback through the process and this all happens. There is a difference.\n  In the original bill it stopped right here with CBO. The exceptions \npart of \n[[Page S1406]] the bill, which I commend the Senator for, really has to \nbe looked at because we do not represent the Governors, we do not \nrepresent local government or the private sector. We represent all the \npeople, people of all walks of life and people in local government, \npeople in the private sector. To me what is crucial is that we look at \nhow this is going to affect the average citizen of our Nation.\n  I have to tell you, I say to the managers, if you ask one of the \nfamilies that lost its member because of cryptosporidium in the water--\nand the Senator and I are working on safe drinking water, we are on the \nEnvironment Committee together--if you ask one of those people, should \nthe Government have acted to prevent cryptosporidium from getting into \nthe water supply that their grandma, grandpa, a child died from, they \nwould have said it would have been a real benefit.\n  I want to make sure, as a Senator from California, that we do not get \nsome of these laws bogged down in such a way that we have more of those \ntragedies. I know the Senator from Idaho has no interest in having that \noutcome; absolutely none. He and I have been working hand in hand to \nmake sure it does not happen. I am just pointing out that when we do \nthis legislation in the name of preventing unfunded mandates, let us \nget to the real issues of the people, which is, are they going to live \nor die by this. In some cases there may be some legislation that gets \ncaught up in this, such as child pornography, sexual abuse, clean water \nstandards, that we may not want to have to get caught up in this. That \nis why I offered my amendments today.\n  I assure you I took a long time just zeroing in on those two areas. I \ncould have had 10 amendments for other issues. I just picked the issues \nthat I feel are so crucial to the health and safety of our people that \nwe do not want to get tied up in this process if we can avoid it.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, as we talk about this process, it was \nat the urging of the mayors and Governors that we took S. 993, which \nwas last year's bill and is the core of this introduced bill. It was a \ngreat first step. But we have taken it another step, again at the \nurging of the mayors, the county commissioners, the school boards, the \nGovernors, and the private sector. So I think as we take these steps \nforward, they are all forward.\n  I would also note that when we look at the legislative process--and \nSenate bill 1 is a process--that at any point, if you feel you have a \ncompelling argument--and the Senator from California has a good knack \nfor making compelling arguments--you can come to the floor and just \nseek a waiver at that point or at any point during the process. If a \nmajority of the Senators agree with you, then you have waived that \npoint of order.\n  Yesterday, I read a letter from Inge Stickney, who is the mayor of \nKooskia, ID--she is 68 years young--a community of just a few hundred \npeople. In addition to being the mayor, she and her husband have a \nsmall trailer court where they have, as I recall, about 15 spaces. They \nrent them for $50 per space. They are continually having problems with \nrequirements of Government for further studies of the water which has \nserved them for generations there. The water does not pose a health \nrisk. They continue to have this escalating cost to the point that some \nbureaucrat has now suggested to them, ``Well, you should just sell the \ntrailer court.'' That is what Government is saying: ``You ought to just \nsell.'' Well, if Inge and her husband sell, then new owners would have \nto increase the costs of the rental for those trailer spaces all \nbecause of the requirement to spend more on testing water that does not \nhave a problem.\n  As she pointed out, a $5 increase to many of these people, who are \nretired farmers and retired loggers who have lived there for their \nentire lives, would pose a real hardship to the point that if she were \njust to sell, wash her hands of it, it could really put in peril many \nof those people who live in that trailer court because the costs would \ngo up. They will not have the funds to cover it.\n  They then might have to look to government to provide for their \nlivelihood, for their well-being. Thank goodness we have people like \nInge Stickney and her husband, who, while being good business people, \nalso have a heart and determined that, while they can make a profit, \nthey would just as soon retain that trailer court because that is good \nfor those people who are relying on them.\n  But that is part of what the Senator from California is talking \nabout, the elderly. And Inge Stickney is a strong supporter of S. 1, as \nis virtually every mayor in the country.\n  I appreciate the arguments of the Senator from California.\n  I see the Senator from Texas is here, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak on the amendment that Senator \nBoxer from California has put forward.\n  I, like the main sponsor of this bill, am a former State official. He \nwas a former mayor. I know what it is like to have to make those \ndecisions on a State budget when you are getting mandates from the \nFederal Government and you have to say, ``Do I increase the elderly's \nlight bill or the water bill of an elderly person because I have this \nmandate from the Federal Government?'' It is very difficult for elderly \npeople to make ends meet.\n  So when we are talking about eliminating a category of the elderly or \nchildren and their effects, I wonder if we have considered the effects \nof raising a water bill because of an environmental mandate that \nperhaps does not meet a cost-benefit analysis. All of these things that \nwe are trying to prevent the Federal Government from passing to the \nStates are going to have an impact for the good on children and the \nelderly. In fact, I think we have to say what this amendment really is. \nIt is an amendment that will gut the bill.\n  Now, I know that the Senator from California is sincerely interested \nin the elderly and the welfare of children. She has expressed that many \ntimes, and I have no doubt of her sincerity. But I do think this \namendment is going to have the opposite effect from what she wants.\n  The purpose of this bill is to set up a process. The process has \nreally two results. One is to give us the information that we need so \nthat we can judge how much a bill we are going to pass will cost. If it \nis going to be passed to State and local governments, that will then be \npassed on to their constituents in the form of new taxes or increased \nfees. That is one part of the bill.\n  And then the second part of the bill is to determine what is that \nimpact and to say, this Congress has a policy we are not going to pass \nthese bills without sending the money. If it is over $50 million, we \nare just not going to do it because the State and local governments \ncannot absorb it. So it is finding out what the costs are and then \nsaying we are not going to do this unless we pay for it.\n  Now, we have the option of paying for it. If we decide that something \nis very important and it fits within the budget priorities, I think the \nFederal Government should pay for it. I may vote against a point of \norder or vote to uphold a point of order and override the point of \norder later because it is important to me that we do what the bill \nbefore us would do that would be beneficial to the elderly or to \nchildren or to the working people of this country.\n  So we have the option of overriding the veto. We have the option of \nsaying we think this is important and we are going to put a mandate on \nthe States.\n  But the purpose of this bill is to say we are going to decide what \nthe Federal priorities are within a budget and we are going to have the \nintegrity to say, if we think something is important, that we will pay \nfor it. Or we will not tell the States they have to do it; we will say \nto the States we suggest you do it but we will not mandate they do it. \nSo we have a choice. If it is a good program, we can tell the States we \nare going to override all of the things we have said and require you to \npay for it, or we can step up to the line, which is what we should do, \nand pay for it ourselves.\n  So I think it is very important that we not pass an amendment that \nwill, in \n[[Page S1407]] effect, gut the bill. Because everything we do is going \nto affect the elderly and the children. And if we say anything that \neffects them is not going to be eligible for this bill, it means we can \npass everything we have already passed which causes--let us take the \nclean drinking water bill. Let us just take that for an example.\n  We are talking about testing for certain carcinogens or certain \nelements that might be in water. Now, what we are saying in this bill \nis, we want to make sure that if we require the city of Plano to test \nfor elements in their water, that it is something that is relevant to \nthe water supply of the city of Plano. That is not the case today. The \ncase today is that the city of Plano and the city of Columbus, OH, may \nbe having to test for a solvent or something used to eradicate bugs in \npineapples, and they do not have pineapple plants in Plano or Columbus, \nOH. So the people of Columbus, OH, and Plano, TX, are having to pay for \na test that is not relevant to them.\n  Well, what happens? What happens when that occurs? It increases the \nwater bill for that elderly person who is having a hard time making \nends meet. That is what we are trying to prevent with this bill. That \nis what we are trying to change. The impact on the elderly is every bit \nas much, with a mandate on clean drinking water that does not make \nsense, as it is for a social program that would be a welfare check.\n  The bottom line is, we all want to make sure that we do the best for \nthe people who cannot help themselves in this country; in many \ninstances the elderly, in many instances the children. But I think we \ndiffer on the way to best come to the end of the line.\n  This amendment by the Senator from California will gut this bill, and \nit will allow the continuing increases of water bills and electricity \nbills, utility bills, rent, property taxes that hurt the elderly and \nhurt the children of this country, when what we are trying to do is \nsay, ``No, we are not going to tell the local governments that they \nhave to raise property taxes and water bills and electricity bills. We \nare going to have the integrity of the process.''\n If my colleagues agree that we must keep the integrity of the process \nand the integrity of this bill, it is very important that we defeat \nthis amendment. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I certainly thank the Senator from \nTexas for her statements and for her strong support. She was one of the \noriginal cosponsors, both of Senate bill 1 and the effort last year. \nFrom her experiences as the former State treasurer of the State of \nTexas she has just demonstrated time and again her total understanding \nof this issue and the fact that we need to curb these unfunded \nmandates. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 207\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Congress that Federal agencies \n should evaluate planned regulations, to provide for the consideration \nof the costs of regulations implementing unfunded Federal mandates, and \n to direct the Director to conduct a study of the 5-year estimates of \n            the costs of existing unfunded Federal mandates)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 207.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 32, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . COST OF REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that Federal agencies should review and evaluate planned \n     regulations to ensure that the costs of Federal regulations \n     are within the cost estimates provided by the Congressional \n     Budget Office.\n       (b) Statement of Cost.--Not later than January 1, 1998, the \n     Director shall submit a report to the Congress including--\n       (1) an estimate of the costs of regulations implementing \n     each Act containing a Federal mandate covered by section 408 \n     of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of \n     1974, as added by section 101(a) of this Act; and\n       (2) a comparison of the costs of such regulations with the \n     cost estimate provided for such Act by the Congressional \n     Budget Office.\n       (c) Cooperation of Office of Management and Budget.--The \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall provide \n     to the Director of the Congressional Budget Office data and \n     cost estimates for regulations implementing each Act \n     containing a Federal mandate covered by section 408 of the \n     Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, as \n     added by section 101(a) of this Act.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my amendment just read expresses the \nsense of Congress that Federal agencies should issue regulations with \ncosts that are in keeping with the Congressional Budget Office's \nestimated cost.\n  In addition, my amendment just read will require that the CBO submit \na report 2 years after this bill by Senator Kempthorne, S. 1, goes into \neffect. That report should detail whether agency regulations are in \nline with the CBO's original estimates when the legislation is passed.\n  If I could engage in discussion with the Senator from Idaho, Mr. \nPresident, I would like to at this time also present another amendment \nthat I would like to have before this body. It is my understanding that \nboth of these amendments will be discussed after the midafternoon \ndeadline.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would yield, but that is correct.\n                           Amendment No. 208\n\n(Purpose: To require an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members \n to waive the requirement of a published statement on the direct costs \n                          of Federal mandates)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment that I just presented be set aside so that I can offer \nanother amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 208.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 26, line 6, redesignate subsection (b) as \n     subsection (c), and insert the following:\n       (b) Waiver.--Subsection (c) and (d) of section 904 of the \n     Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 are \n     amended by inserting ``408(c)(1)(A),'' after ``313,''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this amendment will require 60 votes to \nwaive the requirement in S. 1 of a published statement on the direct \ncosts of the Federal mandates.\n  I want to make something clear to my amendment so that it does not \nget confused with a much stronger amendment, what is my understanding \nwill be offered by Senator Gramm. Because my amendment does not require \n60 votes to waive the requirement in S. 1 to pay for unfunded Federal \nmandates, that is the goal of other amendments, I am sure, we will be \ndiscussing. My amendment might be confused because it does have a 60-\nvote requirement in it. That requirement is to the simple waiving of \nthe requirements in S. 1 to obligate what is a much more simple \napproach, the original estimate from the Congressional Budget Office of \nthe costs of the Federal mandates.\n  In other words, let me make clear: it is one thing to have an \namendment before this body that we would have to have majority to waive \nthe requirement of a mandate; but it is quite another thing to have a \n60-vote requirement just to waive the CBO doing the estimate of what \nmight be the cost of a mandate.\n   [[Page S1408]] My amendment does the latter, not the former. I do \nnot oppose the former. I understand that there is lots of opposition to \ngoing to the 60 votes. I presume that there is even opposition to have \na have majority to even waive having CBO even do some estimating.\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, that it is one thing to have a \nsupermajority that we are going to go ahead even though we do not fund \nthe mandate. But it seems to me that we cannot intellectually and \nhonestly approach the subject of public policy without knowing what \nthat cost is.\n  My amendment would simply make it more difficult for this body to \navoid even finding out what a particular mandate is going to cost. I \nwould like to have that be a supermajority because it seems to me that \nthere is no way we can defend passing mandates or maybe even any other \npublic policy without knowing what that cost is.\n  I will have, Mr. President, further to say on each of these \namendments at a future time this afternoon and particularly on the \nfirst amendment that I have sent to the desk. Senator Snowe, the new \nSenator from the State of Maine, has been very helpful to me on this \namendment and she would like to speak a few minutes on that amendment. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if there is no other Senator on the \nfloor to offer an amendment, I ask unanimous consent to speak no more \nthan 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Minnesota?

Mr. President, sometimes we speak \non the floor of the Senate--Democrats and Republicans--not because we \nhave an amendment to offer, not because it is our legislative agenda, \nbut because we just cannot be silent and we feel that it is important \nas Senators, given the honor of being Senators, to speak about those \nissues and those peoples that we feel very strongly about.\n  In today's New York Times, there is a picture that tells more than a \nthousand words:\n\n       A friend of Sgt. Maya Kopstein, a 19-year-old victim of a \n     suicide bombing, mourned at her grave yesterday and held the \n     flag from her coffin.\n\n  Mr. President, 19 Israelis were murdered in a Palestinian suicide \nbombing. All but one of these soldiers were barely old enough to vote.\n  This one young woman over here in this picture, as I talked with a \nvery close friend of mine--we become close with the staff we work \nwith--my legislative director, Mike Epstein, said: ``Just look at her \nface, this young woman, young girl. It looks as if she's saying, `What \nkind of a world do I live in?'''\n  Israelis murdered, ``* * * all but one of them soldiers barely old \nenough to vote.''\n  I have three children, and my youngest is now 22. These were children \nwho were murdered. I do not know when all this violence will stop, but \nI want to speak on the floor of the Senate today--and I did have a \nchance to also talk to the Israeli Ambassador--to convey not only my \nsadness and sympathy but also my outrage. I believe that this is a \nsentiment that I express for all Senators, and I send this to the \npeople of Israel. I want them to know that all of us care fiercely \nabout what has happened, that all of us, on both sides of the aisle, \ncondemn murder.\n  And, Mr. President, I today hope and pray--I use those words \ncarefully but I think those words apply--I hope and pray that the \nIsraelis, Palestinians, all of the peoples in the Middle East, find a \nway, first of all for security and protection, to stop this, and, \nsecond of all, a way to move forward--to move forward--with the peace \nprocess. There has to come a day when children are not murdering \nchildren. There has to come a day when this violence ends. There has to \ncome a day of reconciliation.\n  The sad thing is that the extremists have figured out the most \neffective way of trying to destroy this process. The extremists have \nfigured out perhaps the most effective way of trying to make sure that \nthere never will be peace. But my hope and my prayer today is for all \nof the families of all of these young people that have been murdered. \nMy hope and prayer today is for the Israelis and the Palestinians, and \nfor all the people in the Middle East--that there will be \nreconciliation. And as an American Senator and as an American Jewish \nSenator, I want to speak on the floor to express these sentiments. I \nwant my country to be as helpful as possible, our Government to be as \nhelpful as possible at this time. I want us to extend our friendship \nand our support to Israel. I never want any of us to turn our gaze away \nfrom this kind of outrageous slaughter of young people, of children.\n  Murder, Mr. President, is never legitimate. Murder by anyone is never \nlegitimate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE.

Notwithstanding \n     the provisions of subparagraphs (C)(i)(II) and (C)(ii)(III), \n     the amounts that would be needed to comply with or carry out \n     the terms and requirements established by Federal legislation \n     introduced on or after January 1, 1996, or by Federal \n     regulations adopted on or after such date shall be calculated \n     with regard to any sunset, expiration, or need for \n     reauthorization applicable to such terms and requirements.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, this amendment clarifies how the provisions \nof S. 1 will treat reauthorizations of existing laws that contain \nmandates. Our understanding all along, with both myself and Senator \nKempthorne, is that S. 1, as did S. 993 last year, shall apply only to \nfuture mandates that add new costs, and this amendment clarifies that \nintent. There has been some confusion about that. Basically, the \namendment does the following. It ensures that reauthorizations which do \nnot change existing laws but merely extend them are not covered under \nS. 1. So if a law is simply extended for several years without any \nsubstantive change, it is not covered under the mandate legislation.\n  Second, if a reauthorization amends the mandate and imposes new costs \non State and local governments and the private sector but in another \npart of that reauthorization bill the costs of existing requirements \nare reduced, then those savings are credited against the new costs \nimposed.\n  Third, this language makes clear that in reauthorization bills, it is \nnew costs that will be scored and that the baseline of existing costs \nare not part of the CBO or Budget Committee calculations. So direct \ncosts are net costs.\n  Finally, this amendment covers situations that may occur when an \nexisting law expires and there may be a short gap in time before it is \nextended. I believe this amendment is noncontroversial and clarifies \nwhat has been our intent all along, that S. 1 apply to the new mandates \nimposing costs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent to speak on amendment No. 201 \noffered by the Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 201\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I make this statement on behalf of the \nSenator from Wyoming, the chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee of \nthe Judiciary Committee, relating to the Boxer amendment which would \nrequire an advisory commission report on immigration-related unfunded \nFederal mandates.\n  Mr. President, I have discussed this amendment No. 201 with Senator \nSimpson, who as I said is chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee. As \nhe noted, the issue of the cost of illegal or legal immigrants to State \nand local governments is very complex. As a matter of fact, it is not \nthe result of a mandate by the Federal Government but, rather, because \nthe Federal Government has failed to carry out its obligations to \nsecure our international borders.\n  The congressionally established Commission on Immigration Reform is \nexamining this issue at the present time. The Subcommittee on \nImmigration will be looking at this issue in its oversight capacity. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to table amendment No. 201, and, if \nnecessary, the Congress can deal with it later when some of these \ncomplexities are resolved.\n  Senator Simpson has assured me that the Subcommittee on Immigration \nwill hold hearings on various immigration reform proposals, and it is \nclear that this issue will be raised and considered in these hearings.\n  I might add, Mr. President, that as a Senator from a border State, \nthis is an issue of vital concern to me and to my State.\n  Senator Simpson has noted that the Congress has not ignored the costs \nto State and local governments resulting from immigration legislation. \nIn the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, Congress included $4 \nbillion for assistance to States that were impacted by the legalization \nprogram in that \n[[Page S1410]] legislation. The Congress was responsive and provided \nassistance where immigration legislation was likely to create new costs \nfor State and local governments then, and Senator Simpson assures me he \nwould support similar assistance in the future.\n  To require the advisory commission to provide a report and a plan at \nthe same time the Commission on Immigration Reform is examining and \npreparing to report on the same issue would be duplicative and \nunnecessary. So I suggest, Mr. President, that we wait for the findings \nand report of the Commission on Immigration Reform this spring and not \nrequire this advisory commission to go over the same ground as would be \ncalled for in amendment No. 201. I urge my colleagues when this \namendment is considered by the Senate to table it. I would again \nindicate that this is a reflection of the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. \nSimpson].\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 213\n\n(Purpose: To provide a reporting and review procedure for agencies that \n      receive insufficient funding to carry out a Federal mandate)\n\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I offer an amendment which I send to the desk. I ask \nunanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with \nand that it merely remain at the desk to be called up at a later time, \nthus qualifying the amendment under the agreement previously entered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send the modification to the desk.\n  The amendment (No. 186), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after ``(  ) It'' and insert the following: ``is \n     the sense of the Congress that the Congress should continue \n     its progress at reducing the annual federal deficit and, if \n     the Congress proposes to the States a balanced-budget \n     amendment, should accompany it with financial information on \n     its impact on the budget of each of the States.''\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Amendments Nos. 201-203\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would just like to comment on the \namendments that have been sent to the desk by the Senator from \nCalifornia and the schematic she offered to the rest of the body to \nillustrate what would happen if this piece of legislation were to pass \nwithout her amendments.\n  I have often said, before we can attain success in what we are trying \nto do in bringing down the size of Government, in trying to make it \nmore efficient, there are probably three areas of reform: Regulatory \nreform, budget reform, and spending reform.\n  There is a very simple bottom line to that. Regulatory reform--\nregulations have to be reviewed, as S. 1 does review those, for impact \non not only the economy but upon the way we do our business with our \nState and local governments.\n  Budget reform--inasmuch as we have to get away from, I think, \nbaseline budgeting. We have to go back to the old situation of starting \nat ground zero and building a budget, or at least based on previous \nyears' expenditures, to bring some kind of honesty and integrity and \naccountability to the American people.\n  And in spending reform--I have a feeling inside me that maybe we \nshould only spend money on those programs that have been authorized and \nnot delve into some things that have not been authorized.\n  But let me talk about specifically S. 1. If you look real closely at \nthat schematic, it is kind of scary because it has legislation going in \nmany directions. To some it would seem very confusing. But basically we \ndo all of those things that are on that schematic now--a vast amount of \nit. The problem is in our hearings we take testimony from Governors and \nfrom mayors and from county commissioners and people who have to \nadminister local government, and we only choose that information that \nwe agree with. So we vote sometimes not exactly taking into account \nsome of the testimony. We only accept that which we agree with and what \nwe do not agree with we cast aside when making a decision on unfunded \nmandates.\n  I am a former county commissioner. There were three of us. It is \nwonderful to be a county commissioner because there were three of us. \nYou are the budgeteers, you are also the appropriators, and you are \nalso the spenders. And you also have to make some pretty tough \ndecisions because we have to operate in a balanced budget. In fact, we \nhave to maintain reserves. Whether it is the bridge fund or the road \nfund or the county welfare or whatever--but we have to make some \ndecisions every day when we appropriate and spend and develop programs, \nwhether we can afford them and where the money is going to come from. \nAnd, yes, maintain the reserves for the carryover months that are in \nfront of us.\n  Montana had an initiative called 105 that froze everything because \ntaxpayers got a little cranky up there in 1986 and we could not raise \nthe mill levy. We could not deal with it. So basically we go through \neverything that is on that schematic. The problem is we only accept \nthat testimony from those Governors, those mayors, those county \ncommissioners that we choose to accept.\n  Unfunded mandates: Of course, right now the news is the motor voter \nlaw that has been levied against some States. In Montana we have had a \nmotor voter law for a long time. It is not as extensive as the one \npassed by this body. But nonetheless, that is a perfect example of an \nunfunded mandate.\n  So do not be scared of this schematic that shows where the whole \nworks gets all balled up and nothing happens in Government. If I had my \nway, I would say that after we passed legislation, if you want to look \nat regulatory reform, getting way over here on this side of the world, \nmaybe, before a final rule is issued on any law that is passed by \nCongress and signed by the President, that rule should come back to the \ncommittee of jurisdiction to make sure that rule does what the intent \nof the legislation was. We see a lot of legislation that is passed and \nthen once it hits the street it looks nothing like the intent of the \nlegislation.\n  So, yes. It is slower. There is nothing wrong with that. I would \nagree with \n[[Page S1411]] the Senator from California. If we are going to do it, \nlet us do it right. I agree with that. If it takes a little longer, \nthen so be it because I think this is a piece of landmark legislation \nthat is going to maybe bond the relationship between the Federal \nGovernment and its duties, its requirements, and the actions that we \ntake with those of local governments which have to administer most \ntimes that legislation that is passed by this Federal Government.\n  If it takes a little longer, do not let the schematic scare you. We \nunderstand that. If it slows the process down, then so be it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 214\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk in \nbehalf of Mr. D'Amato and myself, and I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes], for Mr. D'Amato, \n     for himself and Mr. Sarbanes, proposes an amendment numbered \n     214.\n\n       On page 12, line 3, strike the period after ``Code'' and \n     insert ``, or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \n     or the Office of Thrift Supervision.''.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment on behalf \nof Senator D'Amato and myself. The amendment makes what we consider to \nbe a technical but important change to S. 1.\n  Section 3 of S. 1 exempts independent regulatory agencies as defined \nin the United States Code from the regulatory impact analysis and \nreporting requirements of title II of the bill. The effect of this \nprovision already in the bill is to exempt from title II three of the \nfive Federal agencies which regulate federally insured deposit \ninstitutions, in effect the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the National \nCredit Union Administration. However, the provision does not, as \ncurrently written, exempt two of the other Federal agencies which \nregulate Federal deposit insurance institutions, the Comptroller of the \nCurrency, the OCC, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, the OTS. The \nOCC regulates nationally chartered banks and the OTC regulates savings \nand loan institutions.\n  The concern is that imposing requirements of title II of section I on \nFederal financial institution regulatory agencies could delay the \nprompt issuance of safety and soundness rules that affect federally \ninsured financial institutions.\n  It is my understanding it was not the intent of the sponsors of the \nlegislation to draw a distinction among the Federal agencies which \nsupervise federally insured deposit institutions. In fact, it is not \nlogical since these agencies carry out essentially similar functions \nand should be treated similarly for the purposes of this legislation.\n  Furthermore, distinguishing amongst the agencies could create \nproblems for their operations. For example, the agencies issue many \nregulations jointly in order to assure consistent regulatory standards \nfor federally insured institutions.\n  The bill, as now written, would interfere and possibly delay the \nissuance of these rulemakings for two of the agencies, while the other \nthree are exempt.\n  This amendment will simply provide that all five of the regulatory \nagencies which have supervisory responsibilities for federally insured \ndepository institutions be treated in the same way by this legislation. \nIt would therefore ensure, this amendment would ensure that the \nagencies can act jointly and expeditiously in the public interests to \nensure the safety and soundness of the federally insured institutions.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a Banking \nCommittee amendment to S. 1, the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995. \nThis amendment is supported by both myself, the chairman, and the \ndistinguished ranking minority member, Senator Paul Sarbanes.\n  This amendment, Mr. President, would protect the safety and soundness \nof insured depository institutions. Specifically, the amendment would \namend section 4 of the bill to provide that this bill does not apply to \nany proposed or final Federal regulation that ensures the safe and \nsound operation of an insured bank or thrift or that protects the \ndeposit insurance funds.\n  S. 1, as introduced, would have an anomalous effect of exempting \nthree of the five Federal financial institution regulatory agencies--\nthe Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the \nNational Credit Union Administration. Two others, the Comptroller of \nthe Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision, are not exempted. \nThere is no justification for this different treatment. Because the \nFDIC, Federal Reserve, and NCUA are not covered by this legislation, \nthis exemption would apply only to regulations issued by the OCC and \nOTS.\n  All of these agencies have the same supervisory responsibilities and \nneed the same ability to act expeditiously in the public interest. The \nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift \nSupervision, the two agencies that are subject to the bill, supervise \nthe institutions that hold most of the assets of the U.S. financial \nsystem. These two agencies exceed the assets held by the other three \ncombined. Treating two of the agencies differently from the others will \nhinder congressional intent to reduce regulatory burden.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that imposing the requirements of S. 1 \non these Federal financial institution regulatory agencies could delay \nthe prompt issuance of safety and soundness rules that effect federally \ninsured financial institutions and credit unions and their deposit \ninsurance funds.\n  I strongly urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of the \nSenator from Maryland to clarify that this legislation is not intended \nto address the role of our banking regulatory agencies. I do so because \nthe major purpose of S. 1 is to focus on Federal unfunded \nintergovernmental mandates and to establish a process for treating \nthem. In contrast, the banking regulators regulate banks, not \ngovernments. They impose no direct costs--a defined term under S. 1--on \nState, local, or tribal governments.\n  The problem the banking regulators have brought to our attention \narises from the somewhat indefinite scope of title II of S. 1. \nOriginally intended to focus only on agency regulations involving the \npublic sector, the title has been extended in certain respects to the \nprivate sector as well. The result might very well leave banking \nregulators in a situation where they are required to perform analyses \nproducing little benefit to either the public or the private sector. In \nfact, the provisions of title II may need to be revisited in the near \nfuture as a general matter to make sure that its provisions are cost \neffective.\n  The banking regulators have requested exemptions from the legislation \narguing that the Treasury regulators should be accorded the same status \nas independent regulators that are exempt. In my analysis I never need \nreach the question of equal treatment since it appears to me that there \nis little, if any, overlap between the scope of this legislation and \nthe domain of any of the banking regulators.\n  It is my intention, as chairman of the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs, to move regulatory reform legislation later in this Congress. \nIt may be that such legislation, even though general in its scope, \nwould more directly address the responsibilities of banking regulators \nto the American people and the institutions they regulate. It seems to \nme entirely appropriate to wait until such legislation is fashioned and \nunderstood in order to resolve questions how regulatory reform might \nimpact banking regulators.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask that the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 214) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n   [[Page S1412]] Mr. GLENN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/24/senate-section/article/S1408-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECESS UNTIL 2:15 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President and Members of the Senate, I was \nconcerned this morning to see in the Washington Post a story that was \ncritical, essentially, of companies that might be interested in \npurchasing, acquiring, or partnering with the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting and other public broadcasting entities. In fact, the story \nhighlighted or used as a headline, referring to these companies as \n``vultures moving in,'' and quoting one public broadcasting executive \nas referring to them in that way.\n  I think it is most unfortunate that fine, honest, telecommunications \ncompanies or other companies who might be interested in purchasing or \nrunning or managing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other \npublic broadcasting entities or contributing the same amount of money \nthe Federal Government now contributes in exchange for certain program \nand commercial rights with conditions of children's programming and \nconditions of rural radio and rural TV, to refer to them as \n``vultures'' indicates the mentality of the insider group at the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting and the so-called public \nbroadcasting family.\n  This family consists of inside-the-beltway crowd at the Corporation \nfor Public Broadcasting, the Public Broadcasting Service, National \nPublic Radio, the Association of Public Television Stations, et cetera. \nIt includes groups and certain foundations that surround the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting such as the Children's Television \nWorkshop. It includes some of the stations that get the lion's share of \nthe funds such as WNET, which gets at least 20 times as much Federal \nmoney as my huge geographic State gets. This group is very defensive to \nany change.\n  Madam President, I am chairman of the committee that has oversight \nover the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and related agencies. We \nare supposed to think of some new ideas. There has been a \ntelecommunications revolution since 1967. I think it was good that \npublic radio and TV were created. It is now up and running.\n  There are several other privately funded areas that are producing the \nsame kind of programming at a great profit, including Nickelodeon in \nchildren's television, including the Learning Channel, including the \nHistory Channel, and so forth. Granted these are on cable. Some say \nthat they do not reach everybody.\n  We are also in an age when we have the computer Internet and many \nother exciting telecommunications and information technologies which \ndid not exist in 1967.\n  We have VCR's, we have a number of additional new telecommunications \nand information technologies that will be coming if my \nTelecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 is enacted. \nWe will have an explosion of new telecommunications and information \ntechnologies. It is time that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting \nand other public broadcasting entities in this country be reformed and \nreinvented.\n  So I put these suggestions forward in the most sincere of fashions, \nbut every time I make a suggestion, somebody in the public broadcasting \nfamily comes back with a very critical comment, discrediting it without \nany discussion of the facts.\n  The facts are that the American taxpayer is now providing a free \npublic platform for many performers who make great profits, and I have \nnothing against profits, but the taxpayer is left out.\n  So I want the quality programming. It could be sold with conditions. \nTelecommunications in this country is privately owned, but they have \nconditions for universal service and certain rules on telephones and \ntelecommunications devices. Railroads in this country are sometimes \nsold with public conditions, such as the Conrail sale a few years ago. \nAirlines have public conditions under which they operate.\n  We have reached a time when the Corporation for Public Broadcasting \nmust rethink its role, it must rethink its relationship to some of the \nother communications technologies. It can profit from them. It can get \nalong without a Federal subsidy, and it would be operated much better \nif it were privatized.\n  I have spoken to several privatization experts in the last week. I \nfind the only people opposed to this are those inside the beltway, the \npeople in that public broadcasting family who get salaries of between \n$200,000 and $600,000 a year, in some cases, whose salaries exceed the \nMembers of this body. But these people cloak themselves in the public \nrobe, saying that they are public servants. Well, if they want to be \npublic servants then they should be paid like public servants, I \nsuppose, in the opinion of some, if they do not want to be private.\n  They want to have their cake and eat it, too. They now have \nadvertising on public radio and television. They get all sorts of \ngrants. They have private-sector salaries, but yet they want the \ntaxpayers' money.\n  So I say decide what you are or who you are, but get caught up with \nthe telecommunications revolution, in any event. And the fact that \nseveral telecommunications companies are interested in buying, \nacquiring, or partnering with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting \nand other public broadcasting entities indicates a synergistic \nrelationship in this day and age. How wonderful it would be if public \nbroadcasting would synergistically interact with the other new \ntelecommunications, with computer Internet, with VCR's, cable TV, and \nwith lots of other technologies. For example, Nickelodeon, which \nproduces so much good children's programming that it is being sold in \nFrance.\n                    PRIVATIZING PUBLIC BROADCASTING\n\n  If one message is clear from November's elections, it is that \nAmericans want deep cuts in Federal spending, without gimmicks or \nspecial pleading. As chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation, I expect to propose cuts of tens of billions of \ndollars from current levels of spending--and to privatize wherever \npossible. The Clinton administration as well is calling increasingly \nfor spending cuts and for privatizing government agencies and \nsubsidized enterprises.\n  A prime candidate for privatizing is the America's public \nbroadcasting system. I want to wean public broadcasting from the $300 \nmillion annual subsidy it gets from Federal taxpayers. I am convinced \nthat the service public broadcasting is intended to provide could be \nbetter offered without costly Federal spending on posh Washington \nheadquarters and legions of high-salaried bureaucratic personnel.\n  As the Senate is well aware, we in America continue to face a severe \nfiscal crisis. With an annual budget deficit projected at $175 billion \nand a national debt of over $4.6 trillion--with a ``T''--we simply \ncannot afford to pay for all the good and worthy sounding projects \nwhich vie for American's tax dollars.\n  [[Page S1413]] This past Sunday on the CBS news program ``Face The \nNation,'' I announced that several telecommunications companies, \nincluding Regional Bell Operating Company Bell Atlantic, had expressed \nan interest in helping to fund public broadcasting in a partnership or \nacquisition of assets arrangement. Under such an arrangement, the \nprivate company would step into the role now played by the Federal \nGovernment. As I have indicated a number of other telecommunications \ncompanies have expressed interest. In particular, since that time Glen \nJones of Jones Intercable and Brian Roberts of Comcast have publicly \nexpressed interest.\n  As in past efforts to privatize, such as the privatization of \nConrail, such a deal could be approved with public service conditions. \nFor instance legislation to privatize public broadcasting could include \nconditions that children's programming and rural broadcasting would be \ncontinued. As Bell Atlantic's President James Cullen stated in the Wall \nStreet Journal yesterday, Bell Atlantic, under such an arrangement, \nwould be ``looking for ways to keep public broadcasting whole, and \nmaybe even enhance the quality'' by crafting better licensing \narrangements.\n  As the Wall Street Journal also pointed out, public broadcasting is \nnot unfamiliar with making deals with big business. On the contrary, it \nis a regular occurrence. Last month, Liberty Media Corp., a subsidiary \nof TCI, the Nation's largest cable operator, agreed to purchase a two-\nthirds stake in MacNeil-Lehrer Productions, the producer of PBS' \nnightly news program, MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour.\n  Yet to hear the smug and sanctimonious executives of public \nbroadcasting tell it, a privatization proposal is ``not necessarily in \ntouch with reality.'' Another of the pious managers of the current \nsystem declared that the system would be ``sold off for scrap to the \nhighest commercial bidder.'' Alarmists who profit from the current \nscheme under which America's hard working taxpayers provide a \nsubsidized platform for commercial entities hysterically point to the \n``vultures * * * circling over the endangered species of public \ntelevision.'' Still another suggests an even more horrifying and \ndevious explanation: a desire by these unworthy and dirty commercial \nentities to curry favor with me so as to influence the \ntelecommunications legislation. As one of the profiteers stated: ``It \nwould seem to me that the commercial interests would be looking at the \ntelecom legislation and want to be cooperative.''\n  Such flashes of rhetorical excess are quite extreme even by the \nstandards set by the always pompous beltway operatives and high-priced \nproducers of public broadcasting. No one should be surprised to see \nthose who profit the most from the current taxpayer supported system \nwhining and wailing the loudest.\n  Given these trying budgetary times I am wondering what CPB and \nleaders of public broadcasting propose for the future. I am anxious to \nhear CPB's, PBS', NPR's, Pacifica's, and APTS' plans for dealing with \nthis problem. I want to see public broadcasting devise a privatization \nplan of its own. Technologies, markets, and Federal budgetary realities \nhave changed drastically since CPB was created in 1967. In today's \nbudget climate, the $300 million annual subsidy simply cannot be \njustified. CPB officials must face this reality and reinvent their \nsystem. Let's see a serious restructuring plan from CPB and the leaders \nof public broadcasting.\n  Federal Government funding represents only 14 percent of the total \npublic broadcasting budget. The other 86 percent comes from private \ncontributions, grants, sponsorship, and State government funding.\n  Public broadcasting subsidies are frills we can longer afford. It is \nimpossible to argue that America does not have enough TV or radio or \nthat it is a basic function of Government to satisfy every programming \ntaste underserved by commercial stations. It is also hard to imagine \nthat public broadcasting's most popular programs, ``MacNeil/Lehrer,'' \n``Wall Street Week,'' ``Sesame Street,'' or ``All Things Considered,'' \nwould disappear without taxpayer subsidies. Indeed, these programs \ntoday already feature advertising--also known by the code word \n``underwriting'' by the public broadcasting crowd. The audiences for \nthis advertising are among the wealthiest in America, and much of this \nadvertising is highly sophisticated.\n  The very size of the deficit and national debt has now become an \nexcuse for irresponsibility, because no single step is sufficient to \nmake a major difference. If every single program is sacrosanct, then \nthe cause is hopeless. Typically, public broadcasting officials claim \nthat the taxpayer subsidy for public broadcasting is so small that it \ndoes not matter. We can simply no longer tolerate this casual cynicism.\n  Public broadcasting can best be described as one of Government's \nornamental activities--pleasant but not essential. It clearly does not \nhave as strong a claim on some of Government's and taxpayer's scarce \nresources as the National Institutes of Health, child immunization, \nnational defense, and a thousand other competing causes.\n  Public broadcasting is mired in waste and duplication. A Twentieth \nCentury Fund study found that 75 cents out of every dollar spent on \npublic television is spent on overhead. In 1983 an FCC staff study \nestimated that 40 percent of all public TV stations had signals that \noverlapped with another public TV station. CPB itself estimates that \nover one quarter of the PBS stations are duplicative.\n  Another very troubling development is the illegal use of taxpayer \nfunds to lobby for yet more taxpayer funds. Since the 1870's there has \nbeen a prohibition against any federally appropriated funds being \nutilized for lobbying for more taxpayer dollars. Yet there are numerous \nreports of on-air ``call your Congressman'' lobbying. Additionally, how \ndo we segregate taxpayer funds from private donations or advertising \ndollars when it all goes into the same pot of money?\n  When CPB was created during the heyday of the Great Society over 25 \nyears ago, market failure was the fundamental, underlying premise for \nFederal funding of the public broadcasting system.\n  Most Americans in 1967 had access to only a handful of broadcast \nstations. Since that time there has been an absolute explosion in the \nnumber of media outlets and sources of information for the American \npeople. For instance:\n  Broadcast TV stations increased from 769 to 1,688.\n  Broadcast radio more than doubled from 5,249 to 11,725.\n  The percentage of TV homes subscribing to cable TV grew from 3 \npercent to 65 percent--cable is available to 96 percent of TV homes.\n  CNN, C-SPAN, Arts & Entertainment, Discovery, The Learning Channel, \nBravo, The History Channel, and many other cable channels have \nprogramming that's a substitute for public broadcasting without \nGovernment subsidy.\n  Direct Broadcast Satellite is now available everywhere in the 48 \ncontiguous States with over 150 channels of digital video and audio \nprogramming.\n  Wireless Cable has several million subscribers.\n  Over 85 percent of American homes have a VCR--VCR's were not \navailable in 1967.\n  Close to 40 percent of American homes have a PC--a product which was \nnot available until the early 1980s.\n  Multimedia CD-ROM sales are flourishing with educational titles \nparticularly popular.\n  The Internet and computer on-line services such as Prodigy, American \nOn-Line, Compuserve are reaching over 6 million homes.\n  Most important, this is just the beginning of a new era of \ninformation plenty. With the passage of the new Telecommunications \nCompetition and De-Regulation Act of 1995 which we will introduce and \npass early in the 104th Congress, an explosion of still more media and \ninformation outlets will be unleashed.\n  Telephone companies, electric utilities and other new players will \nenter the media programming field. And with digital compression \ntechnology, broadcasters, cable companies, satellite, and other \ntraditional media outlets will significantly expand their channel and \nprogram offerings.\n  As a result, the days when Americans watched the same TV shows day in \nand day out, as they did in 1967, is history. As a result, the original \njustification \n[[Page S1414]] for taxpayer funding of public broadcasting due to \nmarket failure no longer holds water.\n  At a minimum there should be a rational discussion as to the \nappropriate role, if any, for public broadcasting in the digital, \nmultimedia age--to determine how best to reinvent and liberate public \nbroadcasting given the age of information plenty.\n  Equally troubling is the fact that public broadcasting provides a \nfree, publicly subsidized platform for the promotion of related \nproducts and paraphernalia. Yet the American taxpayer who makes it all \npossible does not participate in this windfall.\n  Forbes magazine recently listed Barney, the loveable purple dinosaur, \nas the third richest entertainer in America after Stephen Spielberg and \nOprah Winfrey. Barney is estimated to gross almost $1 billion a year. \nSesame Street is close behind with $800 million.\n  How much of those hundreds of millions of dollars are paid as \ndividends to America's taxpayers? The answer is: scarcely a penny.\n  There is in many respects a shopping channel mentality for public \nbroadcasting including Bill Moyer's books, Ken Burns' ``Civil War'' and \n``Baseball'' videos, Louis Rukeyser newsletters, and Frugal Gourmet \ncookbooks.\n  Millions of dollars which could be returned to the taxpayer are \ndiverted to private parties, with nonprofit entities fronting for \nprofit making enterprises.\n  Since 1968, actual appropriations to the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting have totaled almost $3 billion. This Federal support has \nproduced a system of 340 public TV stations and more than 1,000 \nnoncommercial radio stations--about two-thirds of which are CPB-\nqualified and get Federal money.\n  But Federal appropriations, large as they have been, are only a \nfraction of the total Federal support package. Under the FCC's channel \nset aside program, adopted in 1952, many extremely valuable TV channels \nwere allocated to public broadcasting. Included are VHF--channels 2 to \n13--stations in several major markets like WNET-Channel 13 in New York, \nWTTW-Channel 11 to Chicago, KETC-Channel 9 in St. Louis, and WYES-\nChannel 12 in New Orleans.\n  These stations and many others are worth literally hundreds of \nmillions of dollars. There is a similar set aside allocation scheme for \npublic broadcasting in the FM radio spectrum band as well.\n  Non-Federal support of public broadcasting totals about $15.5 billion \nto date. A good portion of that total comes from State college and \nuniversity funds which, in turn, derives it money from Federal sources \nin some cases. Much of it is also tax deductible gifts and grants. \nUnder current budget accounting, these would be counted as tax \nexpenditures.\n  The Commerce Department's NTIA administers the Public \nTelecommunications Facilities Program [PTFP]. Over the decades, PTFP \nhas distributed more than $\\1/2\\ billion in equipment and facilities \ngrants. That is an enormous amount of money for a business like \nbroadcasting which is not considered very capitial intensive.\n  In addition, Congress has largely funded the development of a \nnationwide satellite interconnection system for public broadcasting. \nMore recently, NTIA has been given funds to help stimulate the \ndevelopment of children's programming.\n  The question is this: How much seed money is enough. Tens of billions \nof dollars have been spent to date to help get public broadcasting \nstarted. But are we now locked into a long run Federal dependency \nsituation?\n  Alternatives are available. Let us not forget that from 1981 to 1984 \nthere was a congressionally authorized Temporary Commission on \nAlternative Financing for Public Telecommunications [TCAF]. It included \nthe Republican and Democratic members of the House and Senate \nCommunications Subcommittees, the FCC, the Reagan administration, and \nthe industry. TCAF authorized a test of advertising on public TV \nstations. Public radio was also authorized to participate but they \nboycotted the experiment.\n  As part of the 18-month experiment with advertising on public \nbroadcasting, TCAF was required to conduct viewer polls--10,000 \ninterviews were conducted. There was virtually no negative viewer \nresponse to advertising. The majority of the respondents were of the \nopinion that public broadcasting should have advertising and the \nmajority disagreed that advertising would hurt the programs or that \npeople would stop watching public broadcasting that ran advertising.\n  One of the viewers in Chicago, for example, when asked before and \nafter the experiment, replied, ``Well, I am not sure I liked the \ncommercials--but I sure liked them more than the old kind.'' She was, \nof course, referring to ``Pledge Week'', also known as Beg-A-Thons.\n  The public broadcasting audience and contributor lists are an \nextremely attractive group for many, many advertisers. According to the \nviewer magazine of WETA in Washington, its viewers have an average \nhousehold net worth of $627,000 plus an average investment portfolio of \n$249,000. One out of eight contributors is a millionaire, one out of \nseven has a wine cellar, and one out of three spent time in Europe in \nthe past 3 years. This is the target audience for PBS' prime time \nprogramming.\n  As a WETA fundraiser told Washingtonian magazine, the corporate \ngiants that underwrite the most popular shows ``know that during prime \ntime, public television can deliver the demographic they want: \naffluent, highly educated, the movers and shakers, the socially \nconscious and well informed.''\n  Moreoever, the wealthy donors to public broadcasting could rather \neasily make up the 14-percent funding. For instance, if the 5.2 million \nPBS members were to contribute only $55 more a year it would equal the \nFederal share for CPB. It is clear that those donors are the very \npeople who can afford to contribute an additional $55 a year.\n  Today, the American public clearly agrees that something should be \ndone. A Louis Harris poll conducted for Business Week this month put \nCPB third on the list of Federal agencies Americans want abolished. \nOnly the National Endowment for the Arts and the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development ranked higher among the public's priorities for \nelimination. Meanwhile the PBS taxpayer funded poll has been completely \ndiscredited by the leading polling firm in America--Times Mirror. \nMoreover, the CNN/Gallop poll found support for funding only at some\n level. What none of these polls has asked yet is ``do you favor \ncontinuation of public broadcasting as a privatized enterprise''? The \noverwhelming majority of Americans would answer with a resounding yes.\n\n  Faced with this sort of sentiment, defenders of taxpayer spending for \nCPB have put up two heat shields they hope will preserve the subsidy--\nrural service and children's programming.\n  As a Senator from South Dakota, a State with smaller cities and many \nfarms, I have heard all the scare tactics about rural and smaller city \nbroadcasting service before. But rural service can be sustained--even \nimproved--through measures that actually save money to the taxpayers.\n  The key is leaner management. As I mentioned earlier, in Washington \nand throughout the system, reports the Twentieth Century Fund, 75 \npercent of public broadcasting funds go to overhead. CPB requires rural \nstations to hire full-time paid staff in many instances where students \nand volunteers are willing and available. This needlessly drives up the \ncost of rural community broadcasting.\n  Let us not also forget for a moment that current funding formulas \nfavor the large urban, elite stations which get the lion's share of the \nfunds because CPB matches private donations. In addition, as of 1992, \nof the 340 local TV stations in the public broadcasting network, only 7 \nget part of the $100 million programming fund to produce programs for \nthe PBS network. Of those seven, only two stations, New York and \nBoston, produce by far the lion's share.\n  One TV station in New York, WNET, for example, gets eight times as \nmuch from CPB as the entire State of South Dakota for all TV and \nradio--South Dakota: $1.7 million; WNET: $9.3 million. This does not \ninclude the additional millions received by WNET and other elite \nstations through the $100 million programming fund.\n  In addition, private sector-like salaries are paid to personnel in \npublic broadcasting. While I have no problem \n[[Page S1415]] with people in the private sector making large salaries, \nI do have a problem with private sector salaries being paid to those \nwho cloak themselves in public service, especially when my State gets \nso little of the Federal money. While CPB and PBS salaries do generally \nfollow congressional caps, the highest salaries in the system are \nrouted through stations, producers, and performers.\n  For instance, as Senator Dole pointed out in 1992, WNET of New York \nreported paying Executive Director Lester Crystal $309,375 in \ncompensation plus a package of $92,000 plus in benefits; George Page a \ndirector gets $184,000 plus $55,000 in benefits; Robert Lipsyte a host \ngets $184,000 plus $54,000 in benefits. KCET of Los Angeles had a \nsalary package of over $250,000 per year in 1992. According to the Wall \nStreet Journal, the president of Pittsburgh's WQED resigned in disgrace \nin 1993\n when it was revealed he was receiving a second salary of $300,000 from \na station contractor. Other stations still permit other sources of \nincome. Station perks often include cars, travel, service on other \nboards etc.\n\n  Children's Television Workshop, the producer of Sesame Street, \nreported a top salary plus benefits package totalling some $625,000 in \n1992.\n  The biggest unknown is payments to PBS stars--since stations contract \nwith private companies to pay the talent. As a result, we do not \ncurrently know what MacNeil, Lehrer, Ken Burns, Bill Moyers, or the \nFrugal Gourmet make. It has been reported that Norm Abrams, the \ncarpenter on ``This Old House'', makes over $250,000 a year.\n  CPB's campaign on children's television is even more alarmist. At a \npublic relations event this month in Washington, CPB trotted out the \npresident of the local PBS station from New Orleans, who gave his dire \nprediction of what would happen at his station without Federal \ntaxpayers' funds.\n  ``Early morning broadcasts of Barney and Lamb Chop's Play-Along would \ngo away,'' the station president said emotionally. ``It would be a huge \nstep backward for America.''\n  That's what I call a ``close the Washington Monument'' strategy: \nThreaten to shut down the most popular and visible attraction when \nthreatened with a marginal loss of tax dollars. And for public \nbroadcasting, the end of Federal subsidies would be but a marginal \nloss. To reiterate a point made earlier, only 14 percent of public \nbroadcasting's revenues comes from Federal taxpayers. The other 86 \npercent comes from private contributions, corporate underwriting and \nState government grants.\n  Any decently managed organization should be able to sustain a loss of \none source accounting for 14 percent of revenues--especially when its \nhorizons are wide open for revenues from other sources.\n  High quality children's programming is available now through free \nmarket media that did not even exist when CPB was chartered and its \ntaxpayer spending began to grow. The Learning Channel, the Discovery \nChannel, the Disney Channel are but a few. Another, Nickelodeon, has \nfared so well both critically and commercially that it has sold \nprogramming to television in France--an exceedingly hard market for \nU.S. cultural offerings to penetrate.\n  Profit and commercialization are treated as obscenities by \nsanctimonious public broadcasting executives. These prim people remind \nme of the ``sportin' house'' piano player who swore he had no idea what \nwas going on upstairs.\n  As I mentioned before, profit certainly isn't a dirty word to the \ncreators and licensees of such successful shows as Barney and Sesame \nStreet. While hundreds of millions of dollars were being made, thanks \nto the contracts negotiated by CPB's pious managers, CPB failed to reap \na penny in return.\n  Restructured and truly privatized, CPB could be a clearinghouse for \nquality programming from our highly creative competitive marketplace. \nAnd it would have the right incentives to prevent squandering \nopportunities and resources.\n  The American people are right on target in making it a priority to \nhalt taxpayer spending for the CPB bureaucracy, to privatize the public \nbroadcasting industry and bring it up to date with today's markets and \ntechnologies.

Madam President, Washington bureaucrats are at it again. \nOn February 9, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, \notherwise known as OSHA, will impose rules governing logging operations \nout in the woods. Now, logging can be hazardous and there are certain \nrules that do make sense and should be enforced to ensure that folks \nare not subjected to unnecessary risks. But people who work in the \nwoods are not dummies. They know they do dangerous work, and they know \nwhich rules make sense and which ones do not.\n  Unfortunately, the OSHA folks back here in Washington, DC, got \ncarried away with their rulemaking because they issued a host of \nlogging regulations that, I must tell you, simply defy common sense and \nthey hurt the people who are trying to make a living rather than \nhelping them. You can tell whoever wrote them works at a desk, probably \nin Washington, DC, and not with a chain saw.\n  For example, these new regulations require loggers to wear foot \nprotection that prevents penetration by chain saws. That means steel-\ntoed kevlar boots. While requiring loggers to wear these boots sounds \nlike a good, sensible rule, the fact is, it is not. As Montana loggers \nwill tell you, steel-toed boots are impractical when it comes to steep \nterrain--and I can tell you, we have a lot of that--and in cold \nweather. We have some of that, too. Since they reduce comfort and \nsignificantly reduce flexibility, they make it easier to slip and to \nfall, not a good thing when you are carrying a chain saw. Uncomfortable \nand inflexible boots might make the job more dangerous, not less \ndangerous. We have to, I think, let the logger make that call.\n  Furthermore, chain-saw resistant work boots would have to be made out \nof exotic material like kevlar. These boots are not readily available \nfrom manufacturers. It seems impractical to me then to ask loggers to \ntake a vacation while their new up-to-standard boots are on back order.\n  Another provision requires loggers to wear both eyeglasses and face \nprotection. Eye protection does make common sense. It is a regulation \nthat loggers have strictly followed for many years. The additional \nrequirement of face shields, however, will only cut down on loggers' \nperipheral vision; here, again, a regulation that creates more of a \nhazard than it alleviates.\n  A third provision requires health care providers to review and \napprove logger first aid kits on a yearly basis; a doctor's appointment \nfor a first aid kit. OSHA has to be kidding. I would think that OSHA \ncould perhaps list the required contents for an aid kit and just leave \nit at that.\n  These, Madam President, are but three examples that demonstrate just \nhow bad these regulations are going. They are tough and violators are \nsubjected to stiff penalties. They also make no sense and will \nneedlessly put hardworking men and women out of business come February \n9 when they go into effect.\n  Sometimes it seems to me the Feds have it in for people who work in \nthe woods, or just like to go camping. For example, last year, I \npersuaded the Forest Service to withdraw a set of regulations that told \nfolks what they could and could not do in the woods. These were the \nrules that outlawed people from carrying firearms, picking up rocks, or \nshouting out loud in our national forests.\n  The Forest Service finally came to their senses and withdrew those \nregulations, and I hope that the Department of Labor will do the same \nhere. I have asked the Secretary of Labor to suspend implementation of \nthese regulations for 180 days.\n   [[Page S1416]] Madam President, during this time, OSHA should go \nback to the drawing board and talk to the people with actual logging \nexperience. These folks can help OSHA create rules that are \nspecifically tailored to the region, compatible to the nature of the \nwork and help, rather than hinder, the logger.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my call for a halt to the \nimplementation of these regulations as they are currently written.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I applaud the Senator from Montana, and I \nhope that OSHA will pay attention to his letter. I own a small tree \nfarm in Vermont. In fact, I live on it. We harvest mixed types of \ntrees, mostly hard wood, some soft woods, doing probably 25 to 35 acres \na year. The man who does the harvesting was named a couple years in a \nrow as the best forester in Vermont.\n  He did not get that way by taking unnecessary risks. He has a very \ngood logging business, hires a number of people, logs primarily in the \nwintertime when the ground is frozen, and moves things out.\n  Frankly, I would trust him to make some of these judgments, some of \nthe things the Senator is describing. They make no sense in our State, \neither.\n  I remember one day walking down the road last winter. It was between \n30 and 35 degrees below zero. He was standing with his truck. He really \nloved it because the roads were frozen and he could move.\n And he had the roads to himself. But I can see him trying to walk with \nthe type of boots the Senator is talking about. I can see him just \nbreathing into any kind of face mask the Senator is talking about, \nwhere it is 30 to 35 degrees below zero. You are going to have nothing \nbut sheer ice on the inside of that face mask. I wonder what kind of \nsafety factor that is going to be.\n\n  So, Madam President, I would ask the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Montana, one who has paid more attention to these issues than just \nabout anybody I know in this body, if he would share with me the \nresponse to his letter because I think he raises a valid point.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I very much would like to and will share \nthe response I get.\n  I am curious whether they are going to apply windshield wipers on the \nface shield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Defrosters.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Defrosters. I wonder whether, if they are battery \npowered, the logger will have to carry a battery pack for the \nwindshield wiper on the face mask or the defroster on the face mask \nbecause, as the Senator said, and as you know, Madam President, in your \nState of Maine--our States are northern States--snow falls in the \nwinter. It gets a little cold when we are out in the woods. They could \neasily fog up. So I am not sure whether the OSHA people are thinking \nonly about dead of summer logging or whether they are also thinking \nabout logging operations the time of the year when it sometimes gets a \nlittle cooler.\n  But I thank the Senator for his observations and I will give him a \ncopy of the letter I get.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/24/senate-section/article/S1415-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1416-S1417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HOLDING THE COURSE TOWARD MIDDLE EAST PEACE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we all know that making peace has never \nbeen easy. It is hard to forget the pain of having lost loved ones. It \nis hard to abandon the image of an enemy as fundamentally evil and \nbegin to recognize that same enemy as a fellow human being. It is hard \nall of a sudden to forget the vocabulary of hatred and recrimination \nand start using words like ``goodwill'' and ``trust'' and \n``cooperation.''\n  It is even harder to lead others to do these things. The risks are \nenormous. The enemy leader may doublecross you, or his followers may \ntry to do that. You may be branded as weak and gullible. In fact, \nextremists on each side may try to undermine the process. And then, if \nyou are the peacemaker, extremists on your side may prevent you from \nkeeping your promises or, worse yet, attack you. The chances are great \nthat you will end up being blamed for any bloodshed rather than being \npraised for the bloodshed you prevented.\n  Madam President, I wish to take a moment today to recognize one who, \ndespite all the risks, embarked on the road to peace and who, despite \nall the efforts to derail him, remains on it. I am speaking of the \nPrime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin.\n  Sunday, Israel was shaken by yet another bomb attack: 19 Israelis \nwere killed and dozens injured. And once more, understandably, families \nare grieving. Once more, they are wondering what peace with the \nPalestinians means. And once more, the voices of those who oppose peace \nare raised high, many calling for Prime Minister Rabin's resignation.\n  I hope he does not resign. Israel needs him. The Palestinians need \nhim. We Americans need him. In fact, we all need leaders who are \nwilling to take risks for peace wherever that might be in the world.\n  We grieve, obviously, for the most recent victims of terrorism. A \nvictim of terrorism is a victim of terrorism no matter who initiated \nit. How tragic that even now, a year after President Clinton brought \nPrime Minister Rabin and Chairman Arafat to the White House to shake \nhands, there are still people who cannot put the pain of past losses \nbehind them, people who still fail to see that continuation of \nconfrontation only brings more pain, people who are still not ready to \nwork together for a better future for their children.\n  Madam President, as we here in America grieve, I hope we do not lose \nour bearings. I hope we keep sharply focused on what is the goal, which \nis peace in the Middle East.\n  Madam President, I say this because over the past several months, we \nhave seen some interesting activity here on Capitol Hill. I know in my \ncase, and in others, we have had a group of Israelis coming to our \noffices informing us what American national interests are. Not Israeli \ninterests they would like us to support--in fact, no reference to \nIsrael or the interests of the Israeli Government. They say they are \ndoing us the service of helping us figure out what American interests \nare.\n  Frankly, Madam President, I think that is what I was elected for; \nthat is what I am paid for. And I will try to make that determination \nwithout someone from another country coming in and telling me what our \ninterests are. I am referring here to those Israelis who are waging a \ncampaign to have Congress in advance forbid American participation in \nany eventual peace monitoring force in the Golan Heights between Israel \nand Syria. Why are they doing this? Is there a peace agreement between \nIsrael and Syria? No. Has the Israeli Government asked us to commit \nourselves to participate? No. In fact, on the contrary, Madam \nPresident, Prime Minister Rabin and Israeli Ambassador to the United \nStates Itaman Rabinovich have made clear that their Government is very \nanxious to have United States participation in a Golan Heights peace-\nmonitoring force, assuming that at some point possibly one is created, \njust as the United States has participated and continues to participate \neffectively in the Sinai force monitoring the peace between Israel and \nEgypt, something that we have done for years, since the time of the \nCamp David Accords.\n  So, why, Madam President, would anyone want the U.S. Government to \nforbid American participation in a venture even before we know what the \nventure is? There will be time enough to make that determination once \nand if there is a peace agreement and we are asked to help. In fact, I \nask why would Israelis be working in Washington to persuade the United \nStates Government to act against the wishes of their own Government?\n  I assume they are here to oppose their own Government, and they would \nlike Americans to help bring down their Government. I am opposed to \nthat. And I am opposed to those who come here who really want to stop \nthe peace process.\n  Madam President, I do not envy Prime Minister Rabin having to \nnegotiate with Syrian President Assad. He is not a person to whom I \ntake very kindly, President Assad, the same President Assad who has \nbeen responsible for terrorist attacks against the Israeli people for \ndecades. This is the \n[[Page S1417]] same President Assad who aided the attack on the \nbarracks in Beirut almost 15 years ago, when dozens and dozens and \ndozens and dozens of brave U.S. marines died needlessly. I am a father \nof a former marine myself. When I remember that, I have great \ndifficulty in contemplating reaching engagement with such a person. I \nam sure, because of his own personal experiences, Prime Minister Rabin \nhas even more difficulty.\n  But Prime Minister Rabin has gone forward. He knows that continued \nconfrontation with Syria will just bring more attacks, more deaths, \nmore suffering. He knows that. In order to create a world in which \nIsraeli children can grow up without guns all around them, without the \nprospect of new attacks, he swallows his anger.\n  Madam President, as angry as I feel towards President Assad, I know \nthat my anger is mild compared to that of Prime Minister Rabin. But in \norder to have peace, you do not negotiate with your friends, you \nnegotiate with your enemies. It has always been that way. We Americans \nhave always yearned for peace in the Middle East. Prime Minister Rabin \nis working for peace, and I for one applaud him.\n  Madam President, I see others in the Chamber seeking recognition, so \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, let me just make a couple of points. \nFirst of all, one of these amendments is technical, one is substantive. \nOne is trying to strengthen the mandate bill. Under the mandate bill we \nare now considering, if someone wanted to impose an unfunded mandate on \nlocal government, county government, or State government, there would \nhave to be an estimate of the amount of cost. And if that cost exceeds \n$50 million, the unfunded mandate would be subject to a point of order \nand a 50-vote margin--50 votes plus 1, a majority, would have to be \nachieved in order to waive that point of order.\n  I have gone back and looked at what 50-vote points of order have done \nunder the Budget Act. In fact, you have to go back to 1988 to actually \nfind 50-vote points of order that anyone raises. In 1987-88 we had five \n50-vote points of order raised. This was under the Budget Act, for \nbusting the budget.\n  Four of them were waived, and no one has raised one since that time, \nthe reason being if you only have to get 50 votes to waive the point of \norder, since it takes 50 votes to pass the bill, almost anything that \nis going to pass will get the votes to waive the Budget Act. That is \nwhy we went to a 60-vote point of order, to make the point of order \nhave some meaning and substance.\n  I have offered an amendment that would change the bill in one \nfundamental respect, and that is it would require 60 votes to waive the \npoint of order in the Senate to allow us to impose an unfunded mandate \non local government.\n  Madam President, I want to make one observation about this bill. I \nunderstand obstruction. I have engaged in it myself. It is an important \npart of the American system and, while those who are being obstructed \nare unhappy about it, in fact it is the guaranteed right of those who \nserve in the Senate to obstruct.\n  I would like to note one observation that I think is relevant to this \nprocess. I engaged in obstructing the passage of the President's health \ncare bill. For 7 months I was engaged, with other Members of the \nSenate, in relentlessly trying to prevent the President's health care \nbill from being passed. I would say, however, that I had no qualms \nabout standing up and saying I oppose the President's health care bill \nand it is going to pass over my cold, dead political body, which \nfortunately, such as it is, is alive today. The President's health care \nbill is deader than Elvis. And unlike Elvis, it would not be welcomed \nif it came back.\n  But I would note it is very strange to me that, though we are in our \nsecond week of deliberation on this bill, we have been unable to get \ncloture to go on and pass the bill when we have 63 cosponsors. My \nquestion is this: If so many people are for this bill, why do we have \nso much trouble in passing it?\n  So I think obstructing is an important part of the process. I think \nit allows us to analyze, to discuss, to reason. And I think ultimately \nif you have a determined minority that is opposed to a bill, that you \nought to be able to show voter strength in the Senate in order to \noverride that minority. But I do continue to be puzzled by the fact \nthat so many people say they are for this bill, and yet we cannot seem \nto get on with the job of passing it.\n  I think that is an important point to make and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

REVIEW OF IMPLEMENTATION.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that before the adjournment \n     of the 106th Congress, the appropriate committees of the \n     Senate should review the implementation of the provisions of \n     this Act with respect to the conduct of the business of the \n     Senate and report thereon to the Senate.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 221\n\n         (Purpose: To limit the restriction on judicial review)\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I send a second amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown], for himself and Mr. \n     Hatch, proposes an amendment numbered 221.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike title IV of the bill and insert the following:\n\n                       TITLE IV--JUDICIAL REVIEW\n\n     SEC. 401. JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\n       (a) In General.--Any statement or report prepared under \n     title I or III of this Act, and any compliance or \n     noncompliance with the provisions of title I or III of this \n     Act, and any determination concerning the applicability of \n     the provisions of title I or III of this Act shall not be \n     subject to judicial review.\n       (b) Rule of Construction.--No provision of title I or III \n     of this Act or amendment made by title I or III of this Act \n     shall be construed to create any right or benefit, \n     substantive or procedural, enforceable by any person in any \n     administrative or judicial action. No ruling or determination \n     made under the provisions of title I or III of this Act or \n     amendments made by title I or III of this Act shall be \n     considered by any court in determining the intent of \n     Congress.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, the first amendment deals with a sense-\nof-the-Senate, suggesting that by the 106th Congress, this legislation \nbe reviewed. I think it is important that, while we are not able to \nbind future Congresses, and while I think it would be a mistake to set \nan automatic sunset on this legislation, it is important that future \nCongresses review that. My hope is that the body will want to go on \nrecord as urging future Congresses to provide the right kind of \noverview that will enable us to perfect the legislation.\n  The second amendment is an important one. I recognize, as I think \nmost Senators do, it is important not to have a judicial review of \nthings that are internal within the Congress. But it is also important, \nI think, to provide that outside regulatory agencies that are assigned \nresponsibilities under this act be subject to judicial review just as \nthey are in all the other things they do.\n  So what my amendment does is make it clear that title I and title III \nare not subject to judicial review, in that the regulatory agencies \nunder title II are treated, in this act, the same way as they are in \nall other acts that apply.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, before we start five rollcall votes I \nthought I would just review for those who have been involved in this, \nand others who may have an interest, just sort of what has happened.\n  First of all, we started on this bill on Thursday, January 12, at \n10:30 a.m.. We have had 10 full days of debate on this one. I do not \nwant anybody suggesting this bill has been rushed. It should have been \npassed probably in a couple of days. We have had 21 rollcall votes \ntaken on this bill. Of those, 5 were unanimous. Of those 21 votes, 9 \nwere taken on committee amendments that had been adopted unanimously in \ncommittee.\n  We have had just about 41 hours and 48 minutes on the bill. \nColleagues on the other side have used 26 hours and 41 minutes. On this \nside, we have used 15 hours and 7 minutes. We reached an agreement last \nThursday to limit the number of first-degree amendments to 62 \namendments. But then 50 amendments have been offered. I am not certain \nwe gained anything. We probably could have disposed of 12 on Friday. So \nwe really did not gain anything with the consent agreement.\n  So, of the 50 amendments which are pending, 37 amendments were \noffered by our colleagues on the other side and 13 were offered by my \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle. We have accepted three by a voice \nvote, which means that after 10 days of debate and entering into these \nunanimous consent agreements, we still have 47 amendments left.\n  I just say to my colleagues that we hope to finish action on this \nbill this week. So I can say definitely tomorrow night will be a late, \nlate night. Thursday night will be a late, late night, and I assume \nFriday night will be a late, late night because at the rate we are \ngoing we have only disposed of--I do not know how many amendments in \nthe last 10 days--not very many. We have had 21 rollcall votes. So that \nis an average of two rollcall votes a day.\n  We obviously have the right to file cloture, in effect, because there \nis no time agreement on any of these amendments. Even though there are \n47 amendments left, there is no time agreement on any of the \namendments. They could take 1 hour apiece or 1 day apiece. So it may be \nnecessary to file cloture. If not, it may be necessary to start tabling \nthe amendments because we need to complete action on this bill.\n  I do not believe anybody can say that this bill has been rushed. I \nhave read statements where people say it has been rushed, that they are \nnot going to be rushed and we are going to take our time. And I do not \nquarrel with that, except it would be a stretch by anyone to suggest we \nhave not taken enough time on this bill. The bill has broad support on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  I hope that the President tonight in his State of the Union Message \nwill just urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to speed up \naction on this bill. He is for it and indicates he is for it. There \nwill be no action on Mexico until this bill is disposed of, and maybe--\nwe have wasted so much time--maybe not until a balanced budget \namendment is disposed of. We will have to make that decision later. \nThis has been a priority, and we would like to dispose of it as quickly \nas possible. That would mean no later than the end of this week.\n  I want to thank both managers of the bill. I know that they have been \nworking diligently. But it seems to me we have about reached the place \nwhere we should agree on some of the key amendments, offer the \namendments, have the debate, and then have the vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all the votes except the first vote be \nlimited to 10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. So the first vote will be a 20-minute rollcall vote, 15 \nplus 5; the remaining votes will be 10 minutes, plus 5. We hope we can \ncomplete many amendments in 10 minutes. But the first will be 20 \nminutes, then the others will be 15-minute rollcall votes.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 178\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question recurs \non the motion to table amendment No. 178, offered by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota [Mr. Dorgan]. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] is \nabsent due to a death in the family.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nWyoming [Mr. Simpson] would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Alabama [Mr. Heflin] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] is \nabsent because of a death in the family.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber who desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 63, nays 34, as follows:\n               [[Page S1420]] [Rollcall Vote No. 37 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--63\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Bradley\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--34\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Heflin\n     Kennedy\n     Simpson\n  So the motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 178) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 179\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment and \ncommend my colleague from North Dakota for his work on this issue.\n  We are still in the first weeks of the 104th Congress, and already it \nappears that some Members of the Republican leadership are going back \non their promises to our seniors and our middle-class taxpayers. They \npromised not to touch Social Security and they promised to cut taxes. \nNow they are strongarming bureaucrats to approve a technical change \nthat would reduce Social Security benefits to millions of seniors and \nraise taxes to millions of others.\n  Mr. President, may I suggest that this is no way to fulfill the \nmeaning of the words that formed the backdrop at the Republican \nNational Committee meeting this weekend? The banner read: \n``Republicans: Keeping Our Promises: Building Your Trust.''\n  I support this sense-of-the-Senate resolution because I believe fine \ntuning our calculation of inflation is too important an issue to be \nexploited or politicized. Any adjustments to the consumer price index \nmust be left--not to the whims of political leaders--but to the \nthoughtful analysis of our Nation's leading economists.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and others have raised a \nconcern that the consumer price index may overestimate inflation by \ninaccurately measuring consumer spending habits. No consensus has \nemerged, however, on how to remedy this problem. None.\n  The calculation of the CPI has significant policy ramifications, \nprincipally for senior citizens who rely on Social Security cost-of-\nliving adjustments.\n  Before we cut their benefits, we owe our Nation's seniors the benefit \nof consulting with the experts.\n  Speaker Gingrich disagrees. He has threatened to cut off funding for \nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics if the agency ``can't get it right'' \nwithin 30 days. What does ``getting it right'' mean? If the agency does \nnot adjust the CPI calculations to fit the Speaker's political ends, \nare economists going to lose their jobs?\n  One thing is for sure--browbeating bureaucrats will not create a more \nreasoned analysis of this issue.\n  There is simply too much at stake for Congress to rush to judgment on \nthis matter without the thoughtful review and recommendations of our \neconomic experts.\n\n\n                         a pattern of gimmicks\n\n  I am concerned that this latest flap over the CPI is part of a \ndisturbing pattern. Some of my Republican colleagues are seizing upon \nany gimmick they can to justify their tax cuts for the wealthy. It does \nnot seem to matter who they run over in the process.\n  Dynamic scoring--otherwise known as dynamic dreaming--was the last \nflavor of the week. CPI changes are the newest flavor.\n  A balanced budget amendment will be the next. The Republicans' \nattempt to politicize the CPI shows that even with a constitutional \namendment, Congress will use gimmicks to pass a budget that balances on \npaper, but bounces in the real world.\n  We have seen this before.\n  For 12 years, Ronald Reagan and George Bush advocated a balanced \nbudget amendment while submitting budgets with rosy economic scenarios, \ninaccurate assumptions, and magic asterisks in the place of specified \nspending cuts.\n  These actions have left a legacy of large deficits and a quadrupling \nof the national debt. Today every American man, women, and child owes \nalmost $13,500 on the publicly held debt. In inflation-adjusted terms, \nthat's about 2\\1/2\\ times what they owed in 1980.\n  Time after time we have seen gimmicks used to support economic \ntheories for political reasons. We are in serious jeopardy of returning \nto these dangerous tricks.\n  We all know--and experience has taught--who bears the greatest cost \nof this gimmickry--the middle-class. At the end of the day, it's \nmiddle-class Americans who are called upon to clean up the effects of \nmistaken economic theories.\n  If we misjudge this theory, and err in recalculating the CPI--it's \nmiddle-class Americans and vulnerable seniors who will lose the most.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject these quick fixes and gimmicks and act \ncautiously and conservatively. The American public deserves no less.\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 179\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to table the Dorgan amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table amendment No. 179 of the Senator from North Dakota. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. BRADLEY (after having voted in the negative). On this vote, I \nhave a pair with Senator Simpson, of Wyoming. I have voted ``no.'' \nSenator Simpson would have voted ``aye.'' I withdraw my vote.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, what is the next order of business before \nthe Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 182, offered by the Senator from \nSouth Carolina [Mr. Hollings] with 30 minutes, equally divided.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President it is my hope that in this amendment we \ncan sort of burst the bubble of false hope that permeates the \nGovernment in Washington with so-called contracts. All around town we \nseem to hear ``The Government is the problem; let's get rid of the \nGovernment.''\n Unfortunately, both sides participate in this charade. We will be \nfighting all year to bring reality into the picture. Specifically, let \nme refer, to an amendment that I introduced on the Senate floor in \n1990, an amendment that is now the solemn law of the land. It says:\n\n       ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law receipts, \n     disbursements and Federal aid, survivors' insurance trust \n     fund, and the Federal disability insurance trust fund shall \n     not be counted as new budget authority outlays, receipts, \n     deficit, surplus, for the purpose of the budget of the U.S. \n     Government as submitted by the President or the congressional \n     budget or the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \n     Act.\n\n  In reality, the administration and the other side continue to use \nsurplus funds when they refer to the size of the deficit. When Vaclav \nHavel was inaugurated as President of Czechoslovakia, he said:\n\n       For 40 years we have been lied to, and for 40 years we have \n     grown sicker because we have been saying one thing and \n     believing another. I assume that you did not elect me \n     President to continue this 40 years of lying. We have to deal \n     with our problems. Nobody else can solve our problems but us.\n\n  That goes double for the problems that confront this Government at \nthis hour.\n  We have, as the President speaks tonight, some 10 million Americans \nlaying on the streets homeless, 12 million children hungry, and 40 \nmillion in poverty.\n  Mr. President, we need to be candid with the American people. All \nthis resolution asks Congress to do, is to tell the American people up \nfront the truth about our fiscal situation. Specifically, the deficit \nright now is not $176 billion; \n[[Page S1422]] it is $283 billion. We can look at the $253 billion that \nwe spend on domestic discretionary programs against the $283 billion \nprojected deficit and readily see that we could eliminate Government \nand still be in the red. My point is that in addition to spending cuts \nwe will need to increase revenues.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this point to include in the Record a \nchart outlining one possible path to balancing the budget along with a \nlist of approximately $37 billion in nondefense discretionary spending \ncuts.\n  There being no objection, the table is ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n           Hollings Releases Realities on Truth in Budgeting\n\n       Reality No. 1: $1.2 trillion in spending cuts is necessary.\n       Reality No. 2: There aren't enough savings in entitlements. \n     Have welfare reform, but a jobs program will cost; savings \n     are questionable; health reform can and should save some, but \n     slowing growth from 10 to 5 percent doesn't offer enough \n     savings; social security won't be cut and will be off-budget \n     again.\n       Reality No. 3: We should hold the line on the budget on \n     Defense; that would be no savings.\n       Reality No. 4: Savings must come from freezes and cuts in \n     domestic discretionary spending but that's not enough to stop \n     hemorrhaging interest costs.\n       Reality No. 5: Taxes are necessary to stop hemorrhage in \n     interest costs.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     1996     1997     1998     1999     2000     2001     2002 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeficit CBO Jan. 1995 (using trust funds)........      207      224      225      253      284      297      322\nFreeze discretionary outlays after 1998..........        0        0        0      -19      -38      -58      -78\nSpending cuts....................................      -37      -74     -111     -128     -146     -163     -180\nInterest savings.................................       -1       -5      -11      -20      -32      -46      -64\nTotal savings ($1.2 trillion)....................      -38      -79     -122     -167     -216     -267     -322\nRemaining deficit using trust funds..............      169      145      103       86       68       30        0\nRemaining deficit excluding trust funds..........      287      264      222      202      185      149      121\n5 percent VAT....................................       96      155      172      184      190      196      200\nNet deficit excluding trust funds................      187       97       27     (17)     (54)    (111)    (159)\nGross debt.......................................    5,142    5,257    5,300    5,305    5,272    5,200    5,091\nAverage interest rate on debt (percent)..........      7.0      7.1      6.9      6.8      6.7      6.7      6.7\nInterest cost on the debt........................      367      370      368      368      366      360      354\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote--Figures are in billions.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the path that I have outlined would \ninclude $406 billion in spending cuts over a 4-year period. In reality, \nI doubt that the Congress could cut $406 billion. I doubt that you \ncould cut $37 billion in the first year to put us on schedule. But as \nmy list of cuts shows, even if that were done, we would have to make \nadditional cuts in the second year, and the third year, and so on. \nMoreover, after all these cuts we will still need a 5 percent value-\nadded tax to bring us into the black by 1999. But wait, there's more. \nHaving gotten into the black, we will still be spending $368 billion in \ninterest costs on the gross debt. In short, we will be on automatic \npilot for increased spending of $1 billion a day. The only way I know \nto get off of this binge is to start talking honestly about the budget.\n  Some of the elected officials in this town act like they are not part \nof the Government. It is like going to the Super Bowl and watching the \nForty-Niners and the Chargers run into the stands hollering, ``We want \na touchdown. We want a touchdown.'' But to do that, they've got to get \nout of the bleachers and onto the field. Let us get down on the field \nand balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, David Stockman, the Republican Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget, said 10 years ago:\n\n       The root problem goes back to the July 1981 frenzy of \n     excessive and imprudent tax cutting that shattered the \n     Nation's fiscal stability. A noisy faction of Republicans \n     have willfully denied this giant mistake of fiscal \n     governance, and their own culpability in it ever since. \n     Instead they have incessantly poisoned the political debate \n     with a mindless stream of anti-tax venom while pretending \n     that economic growth and spending cuts alone could cure the \n     deficit. That ought to be obvious now that we cannot grow our \n     way out of it.\n\n  That is what we are getting here, 1995. It is time to stop this \ncharade today. I retain the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time does Senator Hollings have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes and 18 seconds remaining. The \nSenator from New Mexico has a full 15.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do you want to proceed with some of that, Senator? Do \nyou want him to go now?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Go right ahead and then I will yield to Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have 15 minutes and would like to yield up to 5 \nminutes for Senator Simon from Illinois. I would use the balance.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank you.\n  I am going to oppose this amendment. I have great respect for \nSenator \n[[Page S1423]] Hollings. Frankly, if we had more Fritz Hollings in the \nU.S. Senate we would not need a balanced budget amendment. Fritz \nHollings has shown more courage in the Budget Committee--and I have \nserved there along with Senator Dodd and others--in talking about \nrevenue, talking about cuts, talking about the needs of our country and \nthat is essential.\n  I think there will be a lot of votes on this side supporting it in \npart because there is some resentment to the Contract With America and \nit is pie-in-the-sky we can cut taxes and spend more on defense, and it \nis just unrealistic.\n  I, however, oppose it for this reason, and that is, if it were \npopular to balance the budget, we would have done it a long time ago, \nthe Fritz Hollings votes in the Budget Committee would have passed. The \nreality is we need a straitjacket to force us to do the right thing, \nand that is why it is essential for the country that we have a balanced \nbudget.\n  The principle has to be established, and once we establish the \nprinciple, then we can argue among ourselves how to go about it. But we \nhave not established the principle. I will just give you one quick \nillustration.\n  Back about 3 years ago, I introduced a bill for long-term care with a \n\\1/2\\ percent increase in Social Security to pay for it. Two of my \ncolleagues in the Senate, one of whom is still serving here now, came \nto me and said they thought it was a great bill, they would like to \ncosponsor it if I would just drop the \\1/2\\ percent tax to pay for it. \nWe can do that now. We can spend money, not pay any attention to \nwhether it balances or not.\n  The reality is, if we want long-term care, we have to have the \nrevenue. Senator Hollings is correct--and I know I differ with some of \nmy colleagues on the other side on this--he is absolutely correct when \nhe says this is going to have to be a combination of spending cuts and \nrevenue increases. I do not think there is any way to do it without \nthat. And I do not favor just putting this thing off. If this passes, \nand I believe it will, if this passes in a few weeks, then I want to \nmove on that glidepath right away, and I will join Senator Hollings and \nany other Senator. We cannot wait until the States act; we have to move \nimmediately.\n  But, frankly, we do not need to spell out how many toes we are going \nto step on when we have a balanced budget amendment. It is not going to \nbe easy. It is going to be tough, but not to do it is going to be \ninfinitely tougher on the future of this country.\n  So I, with great respect for the sponsor, am going to be voting on \nthe other side on this particular motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois for his statement, but I also thank him for his strong \nsupport for a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. It is \nobvious some Democrats support this. It is obvious the President of the \nUnited States does not. Very few Republicans do not support it.\n  Having said that, the issue tonight is not whether we favor a \nconstitutional amendment for a balanced budget, but rather after all \nthese years of saying in order to balance the budget you need a \nconstitutional amendment to force a total change of attitude on the \npart of the American people, the Congress, Democrats, Republicans and, \nyes, Presidents, that is why we need the amendment, so nobody in the \nposition of leadership can any longer be for an unbalanced budget. The \nPresidents in the future are going to have to tell us how they get \nthere.\n  I can guarantee you that when this constitutional amendment passes \nthe U.S. Senate and House, the implementing legislation that will be \npart of it will not permit the executive branch of Government to say, \n``I don't want to do it, I don't like it.''\n  Do you not think the first sentence in that implementing language \nwill say: ``The next budget that the President of the United States \nsends to us, be he Democrat or Republican, will be in balance?'' We do \nnot have that luxury today.\n  We have my very good friend and distinguished budgeteer and one who \nhas proposed many healthy things to get the deficit under control, \nSenator Hollings--and I thank him for his complimentary statements this \nmorning--we have him suggesting that somebody, presumably the \nRepublicans, ought to produce the details of a balanced budget before \nthe sovereign States tell us we have to have it. Or it is some kind of \ngimmick, somebody says, if we do not.\n  Why is that? We are all suggesting and the American people have \nfinally agreed that until the substantive, relevant, basic, underlying \nlaw of the land is changed, we will not get to a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, let me tell you, I am not one who 14, 15 years ago was \nfor a constitutional amendment. In fact, you might find something in \nthe Record of this institution where I was not. But I have come full \ncircle, and the very reason that I have is the reason we cannot do what \nSenator Hollings is recommending in this amendment, because we have \nnever been able to produce a balanced budget, and until we have a \nconstitutional amendment, we will not. When we do, I say to Senator \nSimon, everything will change.\n  Now, you say to me, ``What are you going to tax? What are you going \nto cut?'' Everything will be changed because the entire attitude of \nCongressmen will constantly be saying, ``How do we get a balanced \nbudget?'' The entire demeanor of the fiscal policy and U.S. Congress is \nto solve every problem with a $20 million, $30 million or $50 million \nprogram, or a new entitlement.\n  I say to the Senator from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, we pass \nin reconciliation bills--not the Senator, not me--but in reconciliation \nbills in which we are supposed to save money, we spent $150 billion \nbecause somebody found a loophole. They cut in the first year and then \nthey pass 12 new programs in the second, third, fourth, and fifth. That \nhappens to be how social services block grants, for those who are \nwondering, how the price went up. We never passed a free-standing bill. \nBelieve it or not, we increased that spending by putting it in a \nbudget-cutting bill.\n  We cannot stop all of that, but we will stop it all when we have a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Incidentally, we will not have a President of the United States \ngiving a speech tonight on the State of the Union without including in \nit how we are going to get to a balanced budget, or I have sent you a \nbalanced budget, or saying to the people of the United States, ``I sent \nit last year and they did not follow it because they still think they \nhave 5 more years to play games.''\n  We are not going to have that now, I say to my friend from \nConnecticut, the new chairman of the Democratic Party, because this \nPresident is not obligated to. As a matter of fact, I believe sooner or \nlater we ought to vote here and we probably ought to vote that the \nPresident should submit a balanced budget next year. That might be a \ngood way to handle this. Maybe he ought to. He is the primary developer \nof budgets--the executive branch, not Congress, not Republicans because \nthey are in the majority by a few votes.\n  So I want to close tonight by saying we do not need anybody telling \nus we have to produce a balanced budget in advance of a constitutional \namendment. I say to the Senator from South Carolina, he is going to be \nthere. He is the second ranking on the Budget Committee. I am the \nchairman. He is free to offer any amendments he wants in that \ntimeframe, and he knows that.\n  I am going to offer plenty, and I am going to offer a budget that \ndramatically reduces the deficit. I welcome every Democrat who is \npushing this issue. I welcome them to vote for all the cuts we are \ngoing to propose. That is the first start. That is the downpayment. If \nyou are looking for an analogy in a football game, what we are going to \nhave in 3 or 4 weeks is the game that just precedes the playoff. The \nSenator from South Carolina referred to the Chargers and San Francisco \n49'ers. We are not at that game yet in the budget resolution this year. \nWe are two games before the playoff because we still have to build the \nfoundation for getting the deficit down with a big downpayment.\n  I say to the American people, just wait, in 4 or 5 weeks we will give \nyou that downpayment and we will start that trend line down so that in \nthe \n[[Page S1424]] fifth year, the budget will not be going up, it will be \ncoming down.\n  Now, is this the way to do business? Let me close. I want to quote \nfrom Laurence Tribe, a liberal constitutional lawyer, on what kind of \ngames we are playing with our children when we do not tie our own hands \nwith a constitutional amendment. Listen carefully:\n\n       Given the centrality in our revolutionary origins of the \n     precept that there should be no taxation without \n     representation, it seems especially fitting in principle that \n     we seek somehow to tie our own hands so we cannot spend our \n     children's legacy.\n\n  That is why we need the constitutional amendment. It will tie our \nhands. Until then, we can only say to the American people for the first \ntime in 40 years, there is a Republican House and a Republican Senate, \nand I do not believe you are going to have to be worried about whether \nwe will cut enough. What we have to be worried about is how many \nDemocrats will help us as we propose very significant cuts in \nentitlements, in every discretionary program, in all kinds of \nexpenditures of the Federal Government and privatization. We welcome \nyour help.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I understand I have 6 minutes left. I \nwant to divide it between the distinguished Senator from North Dakota \nand the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, unless they can yield \nsome time to our distinguished friend from Wisconsin.\n  Let me just make a few brief points. One, we are on the unfunded \nmandates bill which argues that the Federal Government should consider \nthe costs imposed on State and local governments up front. The Senator \nfrom New Mexico in his opposition seems to say, ``Do not consider the \ncost up front on the biggest unfunded mandate,'' namely the Federal \nbudget.\n  Two, I am not so sanguine about the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. I remember the 18th amendment was passed and people kept \non drinking. I think this crowd in Washington could delay and cook up \nplenty of ways to avoid the discipline of a balanced budget amendment.\n  Three, President Bill Clinton has already given us the downpayment by \noffering a plan that will reduce the deficit over $500 billion in 5 \nyears. It's time now to finish the job.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota and 3 minutes to \nthe Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from South \nCarolina as well.\n  Let me just say that talk is cheap in this body. We have heard a lot \nof examples of this as we talk about a balanced budget. I think perhaps \nthe American people deserve to know the gap between Republican rhetoric \nand Republican reality with respect to a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, I brought this chart to show what is required to \nbalance the budget over the next 7 years. The blue line shows what is \nneeded if we do not do anything to make the problem worse before we \nstart solving it--1 trillion 35 billion. That is not million, that is \nnot billion. That is 1 trillion--1,000 billion --in cuts that are \nnecessary if we do not do anything to make it worse.\n  But the Republican Contract With America says the first thing to do \nis cut taxes $364 billion. That makes it a $1.4 trillion problem. And \nthen they say spend another $82 billion on defense. That makes it a \n$1.48 trillion hole to fill.\n  Mr. President, the Republican credibility gap, as I calculate it, is \nshown by the difference between what is necessary to balance the budget \nover 7 years--nearly $1.5 trillion--and the paltry $277 billion of \nspending cuts they have come up with in their Contract With America. \nThey are $1.2 trillion short.\n  Mr. President, let me just end with this chart that talks about \nfamous gaps. Famous gaps. We have the Grand Canyon. That is a mile \ndeep. That is a big gap. But the biggest gap we have in America today \nis the Republican credibility gap. It is $1.2 trillion, the difference \nbetween what is needed to balance the budget and what they have \nidentified by way of cuts. That is one of the most famous gaps in \nAmerica today, the Republican credibility gap. They need to fill it in.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I yield myself 30 seconds?\n  I forgot in my remarks to indicate to the Senator from South \nCarolina, he would agree that the famous Stockman quote that he read \ninto the Record----\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That in that book he excludes Senator Domenici from \nthat definition, is that not right?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am sure he did.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, indeed, he did. By definition he did. He said, ``I \nexclude,'' and he gave about three people. I was one of them.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Well, he said Republicans.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am a Republican.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator is not leaving the party, is he? Is he \ngoing to join me?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No. We have been wondering when the Senator is coming \nover here.\n  I wish to make one last point and save my time and yield a minute or \nso to the new Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  First, Mr. President, let me say to the Senator from North Dakota, \nlet us wait around for a couple months and see what the gap is. Let us \nsee how many of the Senators on the other side vote to help with that \ngap. That really is not the Republican gap. That is the spending gap. \nAnd we are going to try to fix it. Instead of it being the Grand \nCanyon, it is going to be some little gap in New Mexico that in a \ncouple years we can pole-vault over.\n  I also want to tell you, with the big cuts we are talking about, the \nbudget this year will spend $1.5 trillion, and the budget when we are \nthrough making all the cuts will spend $1.950 trillion. So we are \nreally not cutting very much. I mean if you look at these trend lines, \nwe are still going to be at a $1.950 trillion, which is about $400 \nbillion more than now, even after all the cuts.\n  Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania in just \na moment. Let us let them finish so the Senator can kind of wrap up.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 3 minutes \n5 seconds.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin and the remaining 2 minutes and 5 seconds to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will see if I can do 22 years in 1 minute.\n  First, there were 12 years of Republican Presidents who said they \nwere going to provide a balanced budget. Instead, they brought us up to \nthe biggest deficit and debt in the history of this country. Then there \nwas a 4-year period which we are in the middle of now where a \nDemocratic President provided the kind of glidepath and direction that \nthe Senator from South Carolina is talking about.\n  What happened? The deficit, for the first time since Harry Truman, \nwent down for 3 years in a row. Those are the facts. Not a single \nRepublican in either House of this institution voted to help us on \nthese specifics.\n  Now we go to the third stage, a 7-year period when the States will \nget to decide whether or not they want to have a balanced budget \namendment, as the majority party in both Houses here increases taxes \nfor everybody in the country to the tune of hundreds of billions of \ndollars and increases the defense budget and tries to tell you that is \ngoing to balance the Federal budget.\n  The fact is that the President is going to give his speech tonight. \nHe is the only President who has provided a true, specific path and \ntrue progress in the direction of deficit reduction, and no matter how \nmuch the Republicans say that is not the case, it is a fact.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Wisconsin has \nexpired. Who yields time?\n   [[Page S1425]] Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I just want to commend again the Senator \nfrom South Carolina for this proposal. Again, I will emphasize what I \nsaid the other day. This is a radical idea that the Senator from South \nCarolina is suggesting, the radical idea that we might try to lay out \nfor our constituents and taxpayers how we are going to achieve this \n``straitjacket'' as it has been called.\n  Frankly, I never thought of the Constitution of the United States as \nbecoming a straitjacket, particularly when it comes to the economy of \nthe country. But to suggest somehow that this is a dreadful notion to \ntry to spell out, not in the details the Senator from New Mexico has \ndescribed, but at least in some broad picture--I will take any numbers \nyou can give me. Give me some general idea here so that my elderly, my \nyoung people, my defense contractors, my businesses will have some \nnotion of how we are going to achieve the Holy Grail of a balanced \nbudget when they look at the bridges that have to be crossed, the gaps \nthat have to be breached. How do you get there? And the fact that we \nare just saying lay that out for us in some detail here for us, and \nagain not for us so much as it is for the people we represent, I do not \nthink is asking too much.\n  Frankly, until we do that, I think this amendment proposal is going \nto be in serious question. I say to my friend from Illinois, the \nConstitution should never be a straitjacket. That is not what the \nFounding Fathers had in mind. They specifically left out economic \npolicy because they knew that future generations would have to confront \nproblems that they could not imagine.\n  And so I hope that before we decide to get to this balanced budget \ndebate, our friends on the other side will lay out at least in some \ndetail for us where we are going to go with that, and again not to fall \nprey to the idea suggested by the distinguished majority leader of the \nother body that we cannot do this because, if we do, the ``knees will \nbuckle'' of Members of Congress.\n  Well, as I said the other day, it is not the Members of Congress \nwhose knees I worry about buckling; it is those out there who look to \nus to see to it that we do a job that makes sense, is rational and \nthoughtful. Asking for some details on this proposal I do not think is \nradical, and it certainly ought to be done if we are going to succeed \nwith this proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Connecticut has \nexpired. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the junior \nSenator from Pennsylvania and 30 seconds for wrap-up to Senator Gorton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I wanted to pick up on the analysis of this amendment by my \ndistinguished colleague from South Carolina, relating it to a football \ngame, a Super Bowl, because I thought it was a keen analogy. I am not \ntoo sure he got it quite right.\n  What he suggested is that members of the football team be up in the \nstands rooting for different ideas instead of being on the field \nfighting it out and putting those cuts into place.\n  Let me tell you what the constitutional amendment is to balance the \nbudget. It is the clock. You see, the game will not start unless the \nclock starts, and that makes the teams get on the field. It makes them \nget on the field and start fighting it out. Otherwise, they would spend \nall their time sitting in the stands enjoying life, running around with \nthe cheerleaders. They are going to be on the field now because the \nclock starts; the game has begun.\n  Now, the Senator from Connecticut said, well, we need the game plan. \nI know George Seifert would love to have Bobby Ross's game plan, and I \nknow Bobby Ross would like to have Mr. Seifert's, but they are not \ngoing to give it to each other.\n  You see, that is what the game is all about and it has to be played. \nBut you have to start the clock. That is what the balanced budget \namendment does, it starts the clock. It gets us on the field and makes \nus perform before the people of the United States of America. That is \nwhat this game is all about. And all this other stuff is just hype. All \nthese gaps and canyons and where is it coming from, where do you tax \nit--it is all hype. Just pick up a paper and look at the hype.\n  When the clock starts the game begins. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, one fact is crystal clear as a result of \nthis debate. Our friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nwith a few notable and courageous exceptions, do not want a balanced \nbudget. They want an outline which will make it more difficult to get a \nbalanced budget. Their President has never proposed one. They have not \nproposed one. They do not plan to propose one. They fear the \nconstitutional amendment because it will require them to be in that \ngame as well.\n  The difference is this side may not know every detail of how it is \ngoing to get to a balanced budget, but it wants to get there and will \ntry to do so. The other side does not even want to start the journey.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  The Chair reminds the Senator all time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move the Hollings amendment be tabled. \nMr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on the \npending motion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, following this vote, there will be a \nresolution condemning terrorist attacks in Israel. I will have that \nresolution read after this vote so we can accommodate the Members.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on that resolution. It has been agreed to \nby leaders on both sides, and many others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. That will be the last vote. There will be one more vote. \nThe vote on the resolution will be the last vote.\n  I remind my colleagues that we have a little dinner over here in S-\n211, if they would like to partake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the motion to lay on the table the amendment numbered 182 \noffered by the Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings]. On this \nquestion, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nto consider the Kohl amendment No. 193.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment to address an \nunintended consequence in the bill before us.\n  I am concerned that in the process of trying to end the practice of \nplacing onerous unfunded mandates on States and countries, we are \nactually discouraging States and counties from passing necessary laws. \nSome States may decide to delay action in the hope that Congress passes \na Federal law to do the same thing and then provides the money to do \nit.\n  Health care reform is a good example. How many States put off health \ncar reforms last year anticipating action here in Washington? We do not \nwant States saying, ``Why should we take action today, when the \nFederal \n[[Page S1427]] Government may be taking action tomorrow and paying us \nin the process?''\n  If we do not address this problem, we may actually be creating a new \nkind of gridlock at the State and local level, with State and local \nofficials trying to second guess where Congress is going on a whole \nvariety of issues, so as not to miss out on their share of Federal \nfunds.\n  Although I am confident that State and local leaders will take the \nnecessary steps to address crime, health, poverty, environmental, or \nother problems within their own borders, I do not want them to fear \nthat they are doing their constituents a disservice by missing out on \nFederal dollars to address these same problems. We must ensure that \ntheir proactive efforts are not necessarily held against them in the \nfuture when the Federal Government catches up.\n  What of States that decide to begin the implementation of Federal \nmandates before they are passed into law, sensibly trying to spread the \ncosts out over several years because they are unsure as to whether \nCongress will decide to waive the funding requirement under this bill? \nDo we want to penalize them for trying to ease the burden on the \ntaxpayers?\n  No, and this amendment sends them an important signal to proceed.\n  Furthermore, this legislation should not discourage innovation at the \nState and local level. Many interesting ideas and creative solutions to \npublic problems emerge from the State and local level. We must be \ncareful not to put a damper on these true laboratories for public \npolicy innovation.\n  An example is the issue of welfare reform. There have been proposals \noffered here in Congress suggesting that States should be required to \ntrack the paternity of children on the welfare rolls so that the \nfathers can be forced to pay child support. If States are contemplating \nsimilar actions, they ought to be encouraged, rather than discouraged, \nfrom taking these actions prior to Federal action.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I appreciate so much the sensitivity \nof the Senator from Wisconsin to the issue of the amendment which he \nhas offered. It was a pleasure to work with the Senator on the language \nof that amendment.\n  With regard to this side of the aisle, we are happy to accept the \namendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I, too, would like to congratulate the \nSenator from Wisconsin. I think he has done an excellent job on this. \nWe talked about this earlier. We worked back and forth across the \naisle. He was willing to compromise and put in the language. I think it \nis excellent. I compliment him on what he has done. We are glad to \naccept it on our side of the aisle and urge we move to a vote.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank Senator Kempthorne and Senator Glenn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 193) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GLENN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/24/senate-section/article/S1426-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, on Sunday, we lost an American Treasure, \nwith the death of Rose Kennedy. This morning, we have lost another, \nwith the passing of Lorna Simpson, the mother of our colleague from \nWyoming.\n  Married to Milward Simpson in Sheridan, WY in 1929, Mrs. Simpson \ndevoted the next 65 years of her life to her family, her community, and \nthe entire State of Wyoming.\n  Even before her husband's election as Governor of Wyoming in 1954, \nLorna Simpson was always reaching out to help others. She volunteered \nat the local hospital, served as president of the Cody Red Cross, and \nwas appointed to the local planning commission.\n  During this time, she also was raising two sons, and serving as a \nfull partner in her husband's many business ventures, which included a \nnewspaper, a radio station, and a dairy.\n  Mrs. Simpson served as the first lady of Wyoming from 1954-58, where \nshe was personally responsible for remodeling and restoring some of the \nbeauty and historical value of the old governor's mansion. Thanks to \nher leadership, a building that was once closed to the public, now \nstands as a monument to Wyoming's history.\n  When her husband was elected to the U.S.\n   Senate in 1962, Lorna continued her tireless devotion to others by \nserving as the Representative of the Women of the United States to the \nOrganization of American States, and as a delegate to the \ninterparliamentarian union in Australia.\n\n  When Milward retired from the Senate in 1966, he and Lorna returned \nto Cody, where they dedicated themselves to their community and to each \nother. They had been married 64 years when Milward passed away in 1993.\n  Senator Simpson has told me of a Wyoming chapel that was remodeled \nunder the leadership of Milward and Lorna. For the inscription on the \nstained glass window in the chapel, they chose the words ``I am with \nyou always.''\n  Milward and Lorna Simpson will now be ``together always'' in the \nhearts of their family, and the many others who loved them.\n  I know the Senate joins with me in extending our sympathies to \nSenator Simpson, to Ann, and to their entire family.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a biography--``On the \nPassing of Lorna Kooi Simpson''--be made a part of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  On the Passing of Lorna Kooi Simpson\n\n       Lorna Kooi Simpson was born on August 19, 1900 in Chicago, \n     IL to Mary Helen Kooi and Peter Kooi. Mr. Kooi was a Dutch \n     immigrant who came to the United States from Holland. He was \n     orphaned at an early age and went to work as an employee of \n     the Burlington Northern Railroad. After working for many \n     years as a railroad clerk in Chicago, he then ``went West'' \n     with the railroad, and later became a very successful \n     businessman and eventually the founder of the town of Kooi, \n     Wyoming--a coal mining community near Sheridan.\n       After attending schools in the Chicago area and the Lewis \n     Academy, Lorna was a student at Miss Mason's Castle School in \n     Tarrytown, NY for 2 years. At the school, Lorna was a \n     classmate of Clare Boothe Luce and Better Greene Bond, the \n     mother of former governor and now U.S. Senator Kit Bond. At \n     the Castle School, Lorna studied art, music, history and \n     sculpture. Lorna went on to attend the University of \n     Illinois.\n       As a young girl, Lorna traveled extensively with her \n     parents. In 1919 and the early 1920's she visited Egypt, \n     France, England, the British Isles, Europe, Turkey, Greece, \n     Algiers, South America, the Andes, Brazil, Chile, Argentina \n     and Peru. She even flew in a single-engine aircraft over \n     Sugar Loaf Mountain in Rio de Janeiro in those early days--\n     such extensive travels were rather uncommon in those years \n     for either an adult or a child! She loved to travel and \n     visited many historical and archaeological sites over the \n     years.\n       On June 29, 1929, in Sheridan, Wyoming, Lorna married a \n     young lawyer from Cody, Wyoming, Milward L. Simpson. Milward \n     had been a member of the Wyoming Legislature from Hot Springs \n     County in 1927. They began their life together in Cody, \n     Wyoming, where Milward went into private practice with his \n     father, William L. Simpson. In Sheridan, on July 31, 1930, a \n     son, Peter Kooi, was born and on September 2, 1931, a son, \n     Alan Kooi was born.\n       Kooi was a marvelous homemaker, a creative and \n     inspirational mother who was strong and talented, fair and \n     firm. In her home she had a Hammond organ and a piano--and \n     she played both beautifully. Early in her marriage, there was \n     a contest conducted throughout the state to determine an \n     original University of Wyoming ``pep song.'' Lorna's sister, \n     Doris Kooi Reynolds, urged her to enter, but Lorna was \n     reluctant to do so. Finally at Doris' urging, she went \n     forward to finish the work and sent it on to the contest \n     officials. As she said later, to her \n     [[Page S1428]] absolute astonishment, she won! The winning \n     song was called ``Come on Wyoming.'' The band director of the \n     University of Wyoming at the time, urged her to play the song \n     and he set it to a band arrangement. The cover of the sheet \n     music of the piece was illustrated by the great western \n     artist Bill Gollings, at the request of Lorna's father, who \n     was a personal friend of Mr. Gollings.\n       Lorna instructed her son, Peter, on the violin. She had a \n     beautiful singing voice and she conducted the choir at the \n     Christ Episcopal Church in Cody. She also served as the \n     assistant organist for a very dear lady, Mrs. Henry Pool, who \n     served for\n      many years as organist in that church. Among her many \n     talents, Lorna was also a talented amateur artist and \n     sculptor, and a member of the Cody Country Art League.\n       With her great humanitarian spirit, Lorna served as a Gray \n     Lady at the W.R. Coe Hospital, which later became the West \n     Park Hospital. Lorna was a charter member of that \n     organization. During the war, she was one of the Presidents \n     of the Red Cross Chapter in Cody, in charge of Civil Defense. \n     Lorna was the chairman of the ``Blackout Committee'' which \n     ensured that all lights within the city were properly out of \n     view during ``air raid alert'' activities during World War \n     II. She was also the chairman of the scrap metal drive and \n     always met every quota set. Lorna was asked to hold a \n     position on the National Board of the Red Cross, but rejected \n     that to travel with her husband to Israel on behalf of the \n     Husky Oil Company, while Milward served as a member of the \n     Board of Directors of that company.\n       In Israel, Lorna assisted her husband, Milward, in his \n     official capacity as a representative for the Board of Husky \n     during the creation of ISRAM, a joint venture oil company \n     between the United States and Israel. She was instrumental in \n     assisting Milward in negotiations with the new state of \n     Israel in establishing new laws and regulations on oil and \n     gas development.\n       In 1940, Mrs. Simpson campaigned vigorously with her \n     husband in an unsuccessful race against a very popular \n     Senator Joseph C. O'Mahoney for the United States Senate. \n     Senator O'Mahoney served 26 years for Wyoming.\n       Lorna was active in all aspects of community life. In 1940, \n     she was appointed by Mayor Hugh Smith to the Cody Planning \n     and Zoning Commission. The commission originally submitted to \n     the city council and mayor the final bond issue for all of \n     the streets, curbs and gutters of Cody. The city then \n     presented that to the citizens on a ballot. The people of \n     Cody twice rejected the bond issue, until Lorna, along with \n     others, immediately activated a ``person-to-person'' campaign \n     in order to raise community awareness on the bond issue. \n     Under her urging, leadership and participation, instead of \n     just simply ``paving the streets of Cody,'' it was determined \n     to proceed with curbs, sidewalks and gutters. She was \n     instrumental in seeing the bond issue pass in 1950. Even \n     today, Cody remains one of the most beautiful cities in \n     Wyoming.\n       Lorna helped obtain the first national network association \n     (ABC) while she and Milward were co-owners of the local radio \n     station, KODI. She often did some of the programming and \n     radio work. She was also the acting editor for a time during \n     the war, of the local paper, the Cody Enterprise. Milward and \n     Lorna were also co-owners of the Cody Inn--the old Burlington \n     Inn--with Les Carter of Billings and Joe Fitzstephens of \n     Cody. Together they helped to restore the Inn to its former \n     grandeur.\n       Lorna was also involved in other business activities. She \n     encouraged the first pasteurization of milk in Cody through \n     investment in the Sani-dairy (a local dairy). Later, she \n     became involved in the support of a local cheese making \n     industry.\n       In 1954, Lorna once again vigorously campaigned with her \n     husband in a successful race for the governorship of Wyoming.\n      She graciously served as the First Lady of Wyoming from 1954 \n     to 1958. She was known for her many projects and \n     assistance to various youth groups and organizations in \n     Cheyenne and through the entire State of Wyoming.\n       Mrs. Simpson was personally responsible for remodeling and \n     restoring some of the beauty and historical value of the old \n     Governor's Mansion. The Mansion had been closed to the public \n     for many years--the heating system, the carpets and the \n     furniture had seriously deteriorated and portions of the \n     ceilings and the floors had fallen. It stands today as a \n     State and National historical site and also as a tribute to \n     her creativity. The State Legislature responded generously to \n     the request to ensure that the residence would serve as a \n     remarkable showcase of Wyoming's history.\n       While serving as First Lady, Lorna worked extensively to \n     assist and entertain various Wyoming groups and \n     organizations, such as Girls' State and Boys' State. She \n     hosted many state functions, teas and receptions for the \n     citizens of the State of Wyoming. After returning to Cody in \n     1959, Milward continued his law practice with his son, Alan, \n     and later with partner, Charles G. Kepler.\n       Milward was one of the founding fathers and trustees of the \n     Gottsche Foundation Board in Thermopolis. With Board \n     approval, she asked permission to remodel an old abandoned \n     storeroom on the Foundations' property and constructed a \n     Chapel for the patients. It is a functional non-\n     denominational chapel with a beautiful stained glass window. \n     Milward and Lorna selected the quotation for the window--``I \n     am with you always''--a most appropriate biblical reference \n     with reference to the sorrows and joys of illness and \n     healing.\n       Milward and Lorna also began a small endowment fund which \n     they used to restore the old Episcopal Church in Cody and its \n     original pipe organ in the old ``Poker Church.'' The citizens \n     of Cody, in the early years of the city, felt there were far \n     too many gambling establishments and bars and not enough \n     churches! The citizens spread the word to the ``city \n     fathers'' of that day. At this time, a rather remarkable \n     poker game took place, and the pot increased to a rather \n     staggering sum. Those gathering around the table that night \n     stated that the one who ``wins that pot`' (about $2,200) \n     would agree to start a new church of the denomination of \n     their choice in Cody. A remarkable pioneer of the community, \n     a man known as ``Governor'' George T. Beck won it all and saw \n     to the building of the ``Poker Church''--Christ Episcopal \n     Church.\n       Through the years, the marvelous pipe organ suffered \n     vandalism and decay and eventually became inoperable. Milward \n     and Lorna restored the organ to its original luster. They \n     later donated 27 town lots to the Episcopal Church, which \n     erected a new church upon the site. The old ``Poker Church'' \n     was also moved to this site. The two churches are gloriously \n     compatible on the beautifully landscaped property.\n       In the small chapel of the ``Poker Church''--or the \n     ``little Church''--many of the windows were donated by \n     Milward and Lorna. The original window, ``the Dr. Francis \n     Lane window,''--the ``Lady Doc''--is over the altar. It was \n     donated by many loving friends at the urging of Margery Ross, \n     who came from the East with Dr. Lane. It replaced the oldest \n     window, now behind the choir--bearing the inscription ``God \n     is love.'' The third window to the far right portrays the \n     healing of the blind. It was given by a Denver attorney and \n     his wife, George and Sally Hopper. Arch Hopper, George's \n     father, was the rector of the church at one time.\n       In 1962, it was back on the campaign trail as Milward ran a \n     successful United States Senate race for the unexpired term \n     of Keith Thomson, who tragically died in late 1960 after his \n     election to the U.S. Senate in November of that year.\n       Lorna and Milward lived in Washington, D.C. from 1962 to \n     1966 and greatly enjoyed entertaining Wyoming people who were \n     in the capital city. In 1962, Milward was diagnosed as being \n     afflicted with Parkinson's Disease. Lorna's care, nurturing \n     and support encouraged him through the Senate experience. He \n     retired from the Senate in 1966. He died June 13, 1993.\n       Lorna was designated by the Senate to be the Representative \n     of the Women of the United States to the Organization of \n     American States, which met at the former Pan American \n     Building. President Lyndon Baines Johnson appointed Lorna as \n     a delegate to represent the U.S. women participating in the \n     Interparliamentarian Union in Australia. Mrs. Simpson was \n     also instrumental in the\n      refurbishment and extended use of the Senate Chapel in the \n     United States Capitol.\n       Throughout this remarkable career of service, love and the \n     nurturing of others, Lorna always emphasized the importance \n     of home. It was here there was a haven of support, love and \n     nurturing for her two sons, Peter and Alan.\n       During the time the two were in high school, four different \n     boys from the Cody community often lived with the Simpson \n     family in their home. Those boys were practically ``raised \n     up'' by them, all having gone on to great things in their own \n     lives--all receiving a college education, having families, \n     children and grandchildren and being very productive \n     citizens. They all think of Milward and Lorna as their \n     ``Second Mom and Pop.''\n       Pete married Lynne Livingston of Cody on June 18, 1960. \n     They have three children, Milward Allen and his wife Amy, \n     Margaret Ann and her husband Chris Pinto, and Peter Kooi. Al \n     Married the former Ann Schroll of Greybull on June 21, 1954. \n     They also have three children: William Lloyd and his wife \n     Debbie, Colin Mackenzie and Susan Lorna and her husband John \n     Gallagher Lorna is also survived by five great-grandchildren, \n     Sara, Elizabeth, Alexander, Daniel, and Eric.\n       Peter Presently serves as the University of Wyoming's Vice \n     President for Development and Alumni and University \n     Relations. Al is in his third term as a United States Senator \n     from Wyoming.\n       Upon Milward's voluntary retirement from the Senate because \n     of ill health in 1966, they retired to Cody. Lorna remained \n     active in Gray Lady community work and above all else, the \n     nurturing and care of Milward. For many years, when the \n     winter winds were kicking up in Wyoming, Milward and Lorna \n     joined many Wyoming citizens--the ``Snow Birds''--in Sun \n     City, Arizona. The last few years they spent between Cody and \n     the South Fork of the Shoshone River at their beloved Bobcat \n     Ranch. Milward and Lorna lived in a seamless bond of \n     affection, love and support sewn with strong sinews of faith \n     and belief in God. they were truly an extraordinary pair. \n     They are now joined anew.\n       These were the things that brought great pride and \n     inspiration to Lorna Simpson. She was a very special woman \n     who did not seek the limelight and did not wish to boast of \n     her activities. On once being nominated for ``Wyoming Woman \n     of the Year'' she said, ``When I received notification they \n     had nominated me for `Woman of the Year', I felt so \n     completely inadequate and unworthy of ever being mentioned as \n     a possibility for the \n     [[Page S1429]] award, that I did not reply. But I must say \n     when I saw the rather sparse account of my accomplishments in \n     a booklet sent to me explaining the qualifications of \n     candidates, I felt I owed it to those who organizing the \n     entire project to detail some of the these activities that \n     they might have it for their records. ``I was always taught \n     one should never `boast' of any charitable activities, but on \n     the other hand,'' she smiled, ``the Bible does say, `Let your \n     light so shine before men that they may see your good works, \n     and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.' So, as a small \n     justification for the honor bestowed upon me, I shall then \n     ``boast'' a bit about some of the fine things that have \n     touched my life.'' That life ended peacefully at 7:45 a.m. on \n     January 24, 1995.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/24/senate-section/article/S1427-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO GREGORY CARDOTT AND TOMMY DAVIS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, a few moments ago the Senate unanimously \npassed a resolution by a vote of 96 to nothing, condemning the \nterrorist attacks 2 days ago which killed 19 Israeli soldiers and \nwounded dozens more.\n  There was not time prior to that vote to speak about that subject, \nwhich I would like to do briefly at this moment. I believe that it is \nvery important the PLO, the Palestinian Liberation Organization, and \nits chairman, Yasser Arafat, act, and act promptly, to fulfill the \nobligations of the PLO under the Declaration of Principles, to see to \nit that the perpetrators of those terrorist acts are brought to justice \nand to immediately condemn those terrorist acts.\n  It is obviously not easy to find terrorists and to punish them. But \nin no uncertain terms, Yasser Arafat and the PLO ought to condemn those \natrocious acts of terrorism, promptly and in the strongest terms. This \nresolution says in paragraph 3:\n\n       Chairman Arafat should, consistent with the obligations of \n     the Declaration of Principles, publicly and forcefully \n     condemn acts of terror against Israelis.\n\n  There is absolutely no excuse for that not to happen. Senator Shelby \nand I introduced an amendment last year which became law, which \nrequires the PLO to change its charter which up to the present time \ncalls for the destruction of the State of Israel, and to take all steps \nto stop acts of terrorism as a condition for United States aid.\n  The United States has agreed to support the efforts of the PLO to \ngovern certain territories, pursuant to the Declaration of Principles, \nand that was an historic meeting, back on September 13 of 1993, when \nPresident Clinton, in the Rose Garden, put his left arm around Arafat's \nshoulder and his right arm around Prime Minister Rabin's shoulder to \nbring those two men to shake hands. I found it a difficult moment, to \nsee an international terrorist like Chairman Arafat honored at the \nWhite House, considering the fact he was personally implicated in the \nmurder of the charge, the second of command in the United States \nEmbassy in the Sudan in 1974, and considering his involvement in the \nmurder of Leon Klinghoffer on the Achille Lauro.\n  But in those Declarations of Principles, and in the aid which the \nUnited States is giving to the PLO, there is that obligation for that \nfirm condemnation. And Yasser Arafat and the PLO have an obligation to \ndo that and they have not done it. There is no excuse for that. The \nsecond clause of paragraph 3 calls for taking ``immediate steps to \nbring to justice those responsible'' for those acts. That is more \ndifficult. But that ought to be done as well. Then the third clause is \nto ``implement steps to prevent future acts of terrorism in all \nterritory under * * *'' the control of Chairman Arafat and the PLO.\n  Mr. President, there is obviously a pattern of terrorism at work. On \nDecember 25th, not a month ago, a Hamas terrorist attack in Jerusalem \nwounded 13 civilians, including an American citizen. On the October \n19th of last year a Hamas terrorist attack in Tel Aviv killed 22 \nIsraelis and wounded 10 more. Mr. President, 110 Israeli citizens have \nbeen killed and hundreds more wounded in the last few months. It is \njust indispensable that Arafat and PLO live up to their obligations.\n  The resolution additionally calls for President Assad to immediately \nend all support for terrorist groups, including safe haven and material \nand financial support in all territory under his control.\n  As there have been efforts to try to improve relationships between \nthe United States and Syria, that is an obligation which, or action \nwhich the Syrian government and its President, Hafez Assad, ought to \nundertake.\n  But at an absolute minimum, at an absolute minimum, Arafat and the \nPLO have an absolute obligation to condemn this act of terrorism 2 days \nago in the killing of 19 Israeli soldiers, 18 of whom were barely old \nenough to vote.\n  The U.S. Senate has spoken unanimously in this resolution, and the \nPLO and Chairman Arafat ought to be on notice that when the foreign aid \nbill comes up this year--and this Senator sits on the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee--that there will be a move to cancel U.S. aid \nunless the PLO lives up to its obligations and the mandates of U.S. \nlaw: To change their charter, which calls for the destruction of \nIsrael, and their obligation to seek out the terrorists and at a \nminimum to make a forceful condemnation of this atrocious conduct.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, just 2 weeks ago--on January 9--a \nFederal judge issued a decision which threatens all approved and \nongoing activities within six of Idaho's national forests. Working men \nand women in Idaho face losing their jobs in mines, lumber mills, and \nthroughout the service industry by direct order of the U.S. Forest \nService. Within a few days, many of these families may not be able to \nfeed themselves or their children, or \n[[Page S1430]] even heat their homes in the middle of winter.\n  Mr. President, 18 of Idaho's 44 counties lie within the scope of this \norder. Twenty-eight million acres--more than half of the State of \nIdaho--are in danger of being shut down along with the natural resource \njobs which provide the economic base of my State.\n  Do you know what this means to Idaho, Mr. President? This single \ncourt action was the equivalent of telling Detroit that they could no \nlonger make cars. It was like telling Hollywood that they could no \nlonger make movies. It was as if Iowa were no longer allowed to grow \ncorn.\n  Absent a 1-week stay by the judge, issued late last Friday, the \njudge's order would have, and still may, immediately lay off hundreds \nof Idahoans from their jobs in mines and lumber mills. It will savage \nthe economy of the State by removing any hope for thousands of Idahoans \nin the service industries that depend on the loggers, miners, and \nranchers for their livelihood.\n  What could possibly bring on a disaster of this nature, Mr. \nPresident? Was it an earthquake? Was it a famine? Was it a flood? No, \nit was the Federal Government issuing pink slips to its citizens.\n  It was a disagreement between two agencies of the Federal Government \non how to proceed in a timely manner on consultation issues under the \nEndangered Species Act. Consultation is sometimes referred to as the \n``Interagency Cooperation'' provisions of the Endangered Species Act. \nWhat is wrong here is that the agencies have failed to cooperate, and \nthe people of Idaho are the ones who suffer because of it.\n  The irony of all of this is that one agency of tax supported \nbureaucrats is locked in disagreements with another agency of tax \nsupported bureaucrats while the very people who pay the taxes are being \nput out of work. The residents of these counties should not be getting \npink slips from their Government.\n  The Idaho delegation and the Governor continue to work with the \nFederal agencies involved to reach a resolution that will not threaten \nthe working men and women of Idaho. All of this points to the fact that \nwe need to bring some balance into the Endangered Species Act. I am \ncommitted to that, Mr. President, because the one species the ESA \nignores is the human species. And the people of my State are seeing and \nfeeling that in a very real way.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/24/senate-section/article/S1429-4", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nELECTING DR.

Mr. Speaker. Members of the 104th Congress. My fellow \nAmericans:\n  Again we are here in the sanctuary of democracy, and once again our \ndemocracy has spoken. To all of you in the 104th Congress, to you, Mr. \nSpeaker: Congratulations.\n  If we agree on nothing else, we must agree that the American people \nvoted for change in 1992 and 1994. We didn't hear America singing--we \nheard America shouting. Now, we must say: We hear you. We will work \ntogether to earn your trust.\n  For we are the keepers of a sacred trust, and we must be faithful to \nit in this new era. Over two hundred years ago, our Founders changed \nthe course of history by joining together to create a new country based \non a powerful idea Declaration of Independence: We hold these truths to \nbe self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed \nby their creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are \nLife, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. It has fallen to every \ngeneration since to preserve that idea--the American idea--and to \nexpand its meaning in new and different times. To Lincoln and his \nCongress: To preserve the Union and end slavery. To Theodore Roosevelt \nand Woodrow Wilson: To restrain the abuses and excesses of the \nIndustrial Revolution, and to assert America's leadership in the world. \nTo Franklin Roosevelt: To fight the failure of the Great Depression and \nour century's great struggle against fascism. To all our Presidents \nsince: To fight the Cold War. Especially to two, who struggled in \npartnership with Congresses of the opposite party. To Harry Truman, who \nsummoned us to unparalleled prosperity at home and constructed the \narchitecture of the Cold War world. And to Ronald Reagan, who exhorted \nus to carry on until the twilight struggle against Communism was won.\n  In another time of change and challenge, I became the first President \nto be elected in the post-Cold War era, an era marked by the global \neconomy, the information revolution, unparalleled change and \nopportunity and insecurity for ordinary Americans.\n  I came to this hallowed chamber two years ago on a mission: To \nrestore the American Dream for all our people and to ensure that we \nmove into the 21st Century still the world's strongest force for \nfreedom and democracy.\n  [[Page S1431]] I was determined to tackle tough problems, too long \nignored. In these efforts I have made my mistakes and learned again the \nimportance of humility in all human endeavor. But I am proud to say \nthat, tonight, our country is stronger than it was two years ago.\n  Record numbers of Americans are succeeding in the new global economy. \nWe are at peace and a force for peace and freedom throughout the world. \nWe have almost six million new jobs since I became President.\n  We have the lowest combined rate of unemployment and inflation in \nover 25 years. We have expanded trade, put more police on our streets, \ngiven our citizens more tools to get an education and rebuild their \ncommunities. But the rising tide is not lifting all boats.\n  While our nation is enjoying peace and prosperity, too many of our \npeople are still working harder and harder for less and less. While our \nbusinesses are restructuring and growing more competitive, too many of \nour people can't be sure of even having a job next year or even next \nmonth. And far more than our material riches are threatened: Things far \nmore precious--our children, our families, our values.\n  Our civil life is suffering. Citizens are working together less, \nshouting at each other more. The common bonds of community which have \nbeen the great strength of this country from its beginning are badly \nfrayed.\n  What are we to do about it? More than 60 years ago, at the dawn of \nanother new era, Franklin Roosevelt told the nation: ``New conditions \nimpose new requirements on government and those who conduct \ngovernment.'' From that simple proposition, he shaped the New Deal, \nwhich helped restore our nation to prosperity and defined the \nrelationship between Americans and their government for half a century.\n  That approach worked in its time. But we today, we face a new time \nand different conditions.\n  We are moving from an Industrial Age built on gears and sweat, to an \nInformation Age that will demand more skills and learning. Our \ngovernment, once a champion of national purpose, is now seen as a \ncaptive of narrow interests, putting more burdens on our citizens, \ninstead of equipping them to get ahead. The values that used to hold us \ntogether are coming apart.\n  So, tonight, we must forge a new social compact, to meet the \nchallenges of our time. As we enter a new era, we need a new set of \nunderstandings, not just with our government, but more important, with \none another.\n  That is what I want to talk to you about tonight. I call it a New \nCovenant, but it is grounded in a very old idea: That all Americans \nhave not just a right, but a responsibility to rise as far as their \nGod-given talents and determination can take them, and to give \nsomething back to their communities and their country in return.\n  Opportunity and responsibility go hand-in-hand. We can't have one \nwithout the other. And our national community can't hold together \nwithout both.\n  Our New Covenant is a new set of understandings for how we can equip \nour people to meet the challenges of the new economy, how we can change \nthe way our government works to fit a different time and, above all, \nhow we can repair the damaged bonds in our society and come together \nbehind our common purpose. We must have dramatic change in our economy, \nin our government and in ourselves.\n  Let us rise to the occasion. Let us put aside partisanship, \npettiness, and pride. As we embark on a new course, let us put our \ncountry first, remembering that regardless of our party labels, we are \nall Americans. Let the final test of any action we take be a simple \none: is it good for the American people?\n  We cannot ask Americans to be better citizens if we are not better \nservants. We've made a start this week by enacting a law applying to \nCongress the laws you apply to the private sector. But we have a lot \nmore to do.\n  Three times as many lobbyists roam the streets and corridors of \nWashington as did 20 years ago. The American people look at their \nnation's capital, and they see a city where the well-connected and the \nwell-protected milk the system, and the interests of ordinary citizens \nare too often left out.\n  As this new Congress opened its doors, lobbyists were still at work. \nFree travel, expensive gifts . . . business as usual. Twice this month, \nyou have voted not to stop these gifts. Well, there doesn't have to be \na law for everything.\n  Tonight, I challenge you to just stop taking them--now, without \nwaiting for legislation to pass. Then, send me the strongest possible \nlobby reform bill, and I'll sign it.\n  Require the lobbyists to tell the people who they work for, what \nthey're spending and what they want. And let's curb the role of big \nmoney in our elections, by capping the cost of campaigns and limiting \nthe influence of PACs, and opening the people's airwaves to be an \ninstrument of democracy, by giving free TV time to candidates.\n  When Congress killed political reform last year, the lobbyists \nactually stood in the halls of this sacred building and cheered. This \nyear, let's give the folks at home something to cheer about.\n  More important, let's change the government--let's make it smaller, \nless costly and smarter--leaner, not meaner.\n  The New Covenant is an approach to governing that is as different \nfrom the old bureaucratic way as the computer is from the manual \ntypewriter. The old way protected the organized interests. The New \nCovenant looks out for the interests of ordinary people. The old way \ndivided us by interests, constituency or class. The New Covenant unites \nus behind a common vision of what's best for our country.\n  The old way dispensed services through large, hierarchical, \ninflexible bureaucracies. The New Covenant shifts resources and \ndecision-making from bureaucrats to citizens, injecting choice, \ncompetition and individual responsibility into national policy.\n  The old way seemed to reward failure. The New Covenant has built-in \nincentives to reward success. The old way was centralized in \nWashington. The New Covenant must take hold in communities across the \ncountry.\n  Our job here is to expand opportunity, not bureaucracy: To empower \npeople to make the most of their own lives; to enhance our security at \nhome and abroad.\n  We should not ask government to do for us what we should only do for \nourselves. But we should use government to do those things that we can \nonly do together.\n  We must go beyond the sterile debate between the illusion that there \nis a program for every problem and the illusion that government is the \nsource of all our problems.\n  Our job is to get rid of yesterday's government so our people can \nmeet today's and tomorrow's needs.\n  For years before I became President, others had been saying they \nwould cut government, but not much happened. We did it. We cut over a \nquarter of a trillion dollars in spending, more than 300 domestic \nprograms, more than 100,000 positions from the federal bureaucracy in \nthe last two years alone. Based on decisions we have already made, we \nwill have cut a total of more than a quarter million positions, making \nthe federal government the smallest it has been since John Kennedy was \nPresident.\n  Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, our initiatives have \nalready saved taxpayers $63 billion. The age of the $500 hammer is \ngone.\n  Deadwood programs like mohair subsidies are gone. We have streamlined \nthe Agriculture Department by more than 1,200 offices. Slashed the \nSmall Business loan form from an inch-think to a single page and thrown \naway the government's 10,000 page personnel manual. FEMA--the federal \ndisaster agency--has gone from being a disaster to helping people. \nGovernment workers--hand-in-hand with private business--rebuilt \nsouthern California's fractured freeways in record time and under \nbudget. And because the federal government moved fast, all but one of \nthe 650 schools damaged in the earthquake are back in business \neducating our children.\n  University administrators tell me that they are saving weeks of time \non college loan applications because of our new college loan program \nthat cut costs to the taxpayers, cuts costs to students, and gives \npeople a better way to pay back their college loans, and cut out \nbureaucracy.\n  Previous government reform reports gathered dust. We are getting \nresults. And we're not through. There is going \n[[Page S1432]] to be a second round of reinventing government. We \npropose to cut $130 billion in spending by shrinking departments, \nextending our freeze on domestic spending, cutting 60 public housing \nprograms down to three. Getting rid of over 100 programs we don't \nneed--like the Interstate Commerce Commission and the helium reserve \nprogram.\n  These programs have outlived their usefulness. We have to cut \nyesterday's government to help solve tomorrow's problems.\n  And we need to get government closer to the people it's meant to \nserve. Where states and communities, private citizens and the private \nsector can do a better job, we should get out of the way. We're taking \npower away from federal bureaucracies and giving it back to communities \nand individuals. And it's time for Congress to stop passing on to the \nstates the cost of the decisions we make here in Washington.\n  For years, Congress has concealed in the budget scores of pet \nspending projects--and last year was no different: A million dollars to \nstudy stress in plants, $12 million for a tick-removal program that \ndidn't even work. Give me the line item veto and I'll save the \ntaxpayers money.\n  But when we cut, let's remember that government still has important \nresponsibilities: Our young people hold our future in their hands; we \nowe a debt to our veterans who were willing to risk their lives for us; \nthe elderly have made us what we are. My budget cuts a lot, but it \nprotects education, veterans, Social Security, and Medicare and so \nshould you.\n  And when we give more flexibility to the states, let's remember \ncertain fundamental national needs that should be addressed in every \nstate.\n  Immunization against childhood disease; school lunches; Head Start; \nmedical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants--they're in \nthe national interest.\n  I applaud your desire to get rid of costly, unnecessary regulations. \nBut when we deregulate, let's remember what national action in the \nnational interest has given us: Safer food for our families; safer toys \nfor our kids; safer nursing homes for our parents. Safer cars and \nhighways. And safer workplaces. Clean water and clean air.\n  Do we need more common sense and fairness in our regulations? You bet \nwe do. But we can have common sense and still provide for safe drinking \nwater. We can have fairness and still clean up toxic waste dumps. And \nwe ought to do it. Should we cut the deficit more? Of course, we \nshould. We must bring down spending in a way that protects the economic \nrecovery and does not punish the middle class or seniors.\n  I know many of you in this chamber support the balanced budget \namendment. We all want to balance the budget. Our administration has \ndone more to bring the budget closer to balance than any one in a long \ntime. But if you're going to pass this amendment, you have to be \nstraight with the American people. They have a right to know what you \nare going to cut and how it would affect them. And you should tell them \nbefore you change the Constitution. Everyone should know, for example, \nwhether this proposal will endanger Social Security, which I would \noppose.\n  In the New Covenant there are problems we have the responsibility to \nfact.\n  Nothing has done more to undermine our sense of responsibility than \nour failed welfare system. It rewards welfare over work. It undermines \nfamily values. It lets millions of parents get away without paying \nchild support.\n  That is why I have worked so long to reform welfare. We have made a \ngood start. In the last two years, my administration has given more \nstates the chance to find their own ways to reform welfare than the \npast two administrations combined. Last year, I introduced the most \nsweeping welfare reform plan ever presented by an administration.\n  We have to make welfare what it was meant to be: a second chance, not \na way of life. We'll help those on welfare move to work as quickly as \npossible, provide child care and teach skills if they need them for up \nto two years.\n  But after that, the rule will be simple: Anyone who can work must go \nto work.\n  If a parent isn't paying child support, we'll make them pay. We'll \nsuspend their driver's licenses, track them across state lines and make \nthem work off what they owe. Governments don't raise children. Parents \ndo.\n  I want to work with you to pass welfare reform. But our goal must be \nto liberate people and lift them up--from dependence to independence, \nwelfare to work, mere childbearing to responsible parenting--not punish \nthem because they happen to be poor. We should require work and mutual \nresponsibility, but we shouldn't cut people off because they are poor, \nyoung, unmarried.\n  We should promote responsibility by requiring young mothers to live \nat home with their parents or in other supervised settings and finish \nschool, not by putting them and their children out on the street. We \nshouldn't punish poor children for the mistakes of their parents.\n  Let this be the year we end welfare as we know it. But let this also \nbe the year we stop using this issue to divide America. No one is more \neager to end welfare than the people that are trapped on it. Let's \npromote education, work, good parenting. Let's punish bad behavior and \nthe refusal to be a student, a worker, a responsible parent. Let's not \npunish poverty and past mistakes. All of us have made mistakes. None of \nus can change our yesterday's, but all of us can change tomorrow's.\n  Just ask Lynn Woolsey, who worked her way off welfare and is now a \ncongresswoman from California.\n  I know it has become fashionable to embrace Franklin D. Roosevelt. So \nlet's remember exactly what he said: ``Human kindness has never \nweakened the stamina or softened the fiber of a free people. A nation \ndoes not have to be cruel in order to be tough.''\n  I know members of this Congress are concerned about crime. But I \nwould remind you that last year we passed a very tough crime bill--\nlonger sentences, three strikes and you're out, more prevention, more \nprisons, and 100,000 more police. And we paid for it all by reducing \nthe size of the federal bureaucracy and giving money back to local \ncommunities to lower the crime rate.\n  There may be other things we can do to be tougher on crime and to \nhelp lower the crime rate, and let's do them. But let's not create a \nraucous political debate in an effort to take back the good things \nwe've already done. That's what local community leaders think. And \nthat's what the police who put their lives on the line every day think.\n  Secondly, the last Congress passed the Brady Bill and the ban on \nnineteen assault weapons. I think everybody in this room knows that \nseveral members of the last Congress who voted for the assault weapons \nban and the Brady Bill lost their seats because of it. Neither the bill \nsupporters or I believe anything should be done to infringe upon the \nlegitimate right of our citizens to bear arms for hunting and sporting \npurposes.\n  Those people laid down their seats in Congress to try to keep more \npolice and children from laying down their lives in our streets under a \nhail of assault weapons' bullets. And I will not see that ban repealed.\n\n\n                            National Service\n\n  We shouldn't cut government programs that help to prepare us for the \nnew economy, promote responsibility, and are organized from the grass \nroots up, not by federal bureaucracies. The best example of that is the \nnational service program--Americorps--which today has 20,000 Americans, \nmore than ever served in one year in the Peace Corps, working all over \nAmerica, helping people--person to person--in local volunteer groups, \nsolving problems and earning some money for their education. This is \ncitizenship at its best.\n  It's good for the Americorps members and good for the rest of us. \nIt's the essence of the New Covenant. And we shouldn't stop it.\n\n\n                          illegal immigration\n\n  All Americans are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal \nimmigrants entering this country. The jobs they hold might otherwise be \nheld by our citizens or legal immigrants, and the public services they \nuse impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has \nmoved aggressively to secure our borders by hiring a record number of \nnew border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever \nbefore, by cracking down on illegal aliens who try to take American \njobs, and by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.\n  [[Page S1433]] In the budget I will present to you, we will do more \nto try to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for \ncrimes, and to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace, as \nrecommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara \nJordan.\n  This is a nation of immigrants. But it is also a nation of law. And \nit is wrong, and ultimately self-defeating, for a nation of immigrants \nto permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in \nrecent years.\n\n\n                            the new economy\n\n  The most important job of government is to empower people to succeed \nin the new global economy. America has always been the land of \nopportunity, a land where if you work hard you can get ahead. We are a \nmiddle class country.\n  Middle class values sustain us. We must expand the middle class and \nshrink the underclass, while supporting the millions who are already \nsuccessful in the new economy.\n  America is once again the world's strongest economy. Almost six \nmillion jobs in two years. Exports booming. Inflation down. High wage \njobs coming back. A record number of American entrepreneurs living the \nAmerican dream. If we want it to stay that way, those who work and lift \nour nation must have more of its benefits.\n  Today too many of those people are being left out. They are working \nharder for less security, less income, less certainty they can even \nafford a vacation, much less college for their children or retirement \nfor themselves. We cannot let this continue.\n  If we don't act, our economy will probably do what it's done since \n1978: Provide high income growth to those at the top, give very little \nto everyone in the middle, and leave the people at the bottom to fall \neven farther behind, no matter how hard they work.\n  We must have a government that can be a partner in making this new \neconomy work for all Americans--a government that helps each and every \none of us get an education and have the opportunity to renew our \nskills.\n  That's why we worked so hard to increase educational opportunity from \nHeard Start, to public schools, to apprenticeships, to job training, to \nmaking college loans available and more affordable for 20 million \npeople. That's the first thing we have to do.\n  The second thing we can do to raise incomes is to lower taxes. In \n1993, we took the first step with a working family tax cut for 15 \nmillion families with incomes of under $27,000 and a tax cut to most \nsmall and new businesses. Before we could do more than that, we first \nhad to bring down the deficit we inherited. And we had to get economic \ngrowth up. We have done both.\n  Now we can cut taxes in a more comprehensive way. Tax cuts must \npromote and reinforce our first obligation, empowering citizens with \neducation and training to make the most of their lives. The tax relief \nspotlight must shine on those who make the right choices for their \nfamilies and communities.\n  I have proposed the Middle Class Bill of Rights--which should be \ncalled a Bill of Rights and Responsibilities, because its provisions \nonly benefit those who are working to educate and raise their children \nor to improve their own lives. It will, therefore, give needed tax \nrelief and raise incomes in the short and long runs in a way that \nbenefits all of us.\n  There are four provisions: First, a tax deduction for all education \nand training after high school. Education is even more important now \nthan ever to the economic well-being of America, and we should do \neverything we can to encourage it. If businesses can get a deduction \nfor investing in factories, why shouldn't families for investment in \ntheir future?\n  Second, a $500 tax credit for all children under thirteen in middle \nclass households.\n  Third, an individual retirement account with penalty-free withdrawal \nrights for the cost of education, health care, first time home buying, \nand care of a parent.\n  And fourth, a G.I. Bill for American workers. We propose to collapse \nnearly 70 Federal programs and offer vouchers directly to eligible \nAmerican workers. If you are laid off, or make a low wage, you will get \na voucher worth $2,600 a year for up to two years to go to your local \ncommunity college or get private or public job training to raise your \njob skills.\n  Anyone can call for a tax cut, but I will not accept one that \nexplodes the deficit and puts our economic recovery at risk. We must \npay for any tax cuts, fully and honestly. Two years ago, it was an open \nquestion whether we would find the strength to cut the deficit.\n  Thanks to the courage of many people here, and many who did not \nreturn to take their seats in this House, we began to do what others \nsaid they would do for years.\n  We Democrats cut the deficit by over $600 billion--that's nearly \n$10,000 for every family of four in this country. The deficit is coming \ndown three years in a row for the first time since president Truman was \nin office.\n  In the budget, I will send you, the Middle Class Bill of Rights is \nfully paid for by budget cuts, cuts in bureaucracy, cuts in programs, \ncuts in special interest subsidies. And the spending cuts will more \nthan double the tax cuts. My budget pays for the Middle Class Bill of \nRights without any cuts in Medicare. And I will oppose any attempt to \npay for tax cuts with Medicare cuts.\n  I know a lot of you have your own ideas about tax relief. I want to \nwork with you. My test for any proposal is: Will it create jobs and \nraise incomes? Will it strengthen families and support children? Will \nit build the middle class and shrink the underclass? Is it paid for? If \nit does, I will support it. If it doesn't, I will oppose it.\n  That's why I will ask you to support raising the minimum wage. It \nrewards work. Two and a half million Americans, often women with \nchildren, work for $4.25 an hour. In terms of real buying power, by \nnext year, that minimum wage will be at a 40 year low.\n  I have studied the arguments and evidence for and against a minimum \nwage increase.\n  The weight of evidence is that a modest increase does not cost jobs, \nand may even lure people into the job market. But the plain fact is you \ncan't make a living on $4.25 an hour, especially if you have kids to \nsupport.\n  In the past, the minimum wage has been a bipartisan issue. It should \nbe again. I challenge you to get together and find a way to make the \nminimum wage a living wage.\n  Members of Congress have been on the job less than a month. But by \nthe end of the week, 28 days into the new year, each Congressman has \nalready earned as much in Congressional salary as people who work under \nminimum wage made in an entire year.\n  And everyone in this chamber has something else that too many \nAmericans go without: health care. Last year, we almost came to blows \nover health care, but nothing was done. But the hard, cold fact is \nthat, since we stared this debate, we know that more than 1.1 million \nAmericans in working families have lost their coverage. The hard, cold \nfact is that millions more, mostly workers who are farmers, self-\nemployed, and in small businesses, have seen their coverage erode with \nhigher premium costs, higher deductibles, and higher co-payments.\n  I still believe we must move our nation towards providing health \nsecurity for every American family. Last year, we bit off more than we \ncould chew. This year, let's work together, step by step, and get \nsomething done.\n  Let's at least pass meaningful insurance reform so that no American \nrisks losing coverage or facing skyrocketing prices when they change \njobs, or lose a job, or a family member falls ill. We could start with \nthe proposals Senator Dole made last year. Let's make sure that self-\nemployed people and small businesses can buy insurance at more \naffordable rates through voluntary purchasing pools. Let's help \nfamilies provide long-term care for a sick parent or a disabled child. \nLet's help workers who lose their jobs keep health insurance coverage \nfor a year while they look for work. And let's find a way to make sure \nour children have health care. Let's work together. This is too \nimportant for politics as usual.\n\n\n                           national security\n\n  Much of what is on the American people's mind is devoted to internal \nsecurity concerns--the security of our jobs and incomes, our children, \nour streets, our health, our borders. Now that the Cold War is past, it \nis tempting to believe that all security issues, \n[[Page S1434]] with the possible exception of trade, reside within our \nborders. That is not so\n  Our security depends upon our continued world leadership for peace, \nfreedom, and democracy. We cannot be strong at home without being \nstrong abroad.\n  The financial crisis in Mexico is a powerful case in point. We have \nto act--for the sake of millions of Americans whose livelihoods are \ntied to Mexico's well-being.\n  If we want to secure America jobs, preserve American exports and \nsafeguard America's borders, we must pass our stabilization program and \nhelp put Mexico back on track. And let me repeat--this is not a loan, \nthis is not foreign aid, this is not a bail-out. We'll be giving a \nguarantee, like co-signing a note with good collateral that will cover \nour risk. This legislation is right for America, and together with the \nbipartisan leadership, I call on Congress to pass it quickly\n  Tonight, not a single Russian missile is aimed at our homes or our \nchildren. And we, with them, are on the way to destroying missiles and \nbombers that carry 9,000 nuclear warheads.\n  We've come so far so fast in the post-Cold War world that it is easy \nto take the decline of the nuclear threat for granted. But it is still \nthere, and we are not finished yet.\n  This year, I am asking the Senate to approve START II--and eliminate \nweapons that carry 5,000 more warheads. The United States will lead the \ncharge to extend indefinitely the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to \nenact a comprehensive nuclear test ban, and to eliminate chemical \nweapons. To stop, and roll back, North Korea's potentially deadly \nnuclear program, we will continue to implement the agreement we have \nreached with that nation. It's a smart, tough deal based on continuing \ninspection, with safeguards for our allies and ourselves.\n  This year I will submit to Congress comprehensive legislation to \nstrengthen our hand in combating terrorists, whether they strike at \nhome or abroad.\n  As the cowards who bombed the World Trade Center can testify, the \nUnited States will hunt down terrorists and bring them to justice.\n  Just this week, another horrendous terrorist act in Israel killed 19 \nand injured scores more. On behalf of the American people I extend our \ndeepest sympathy to the families of the victims. I know that in the \nface of such evil, it is hard to go forward. But the terrorists are the \npast, not the future. We must--and we will--persist in our pursuit of a \ncomprehensive peace between Israel and all her neighbors in the Middle \nEast. Accordingly, last night I signed an Executive Order that will \nblock the assets in the United States of terrorist organizations that \nthreaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process and prohibits \nfinancial transactions with these groups.\n  Tonight, I call on our allies, and peace-loving nations around the \nworld, to join us with renewed fervor in the global effort to combat \nterrorism.\n  From my first day in office I have pledged that our nation would \nmaintain the best equipped, best trained and best prepared fighting \nforce on Earth. We have--and they are. They have managed the dramatic \ndownsizing of our forces since the Cold War with remarkable skill and \nspirit. To make sure our military is ready for action--and to provide \nthe pay and quality of life that the military and their families \ndeserve--I am asking this Congress to add $25 billion more in defense \nspending over the next six years. Tonight I repeat that request. We ask \nmuch of our armed forces. They are called to service in many ways--and \nwe must give them and their families what the times demand and they \ndeserve.\n  Time after time, in the last year, our troops showed America at its \nbest: helping to save hundreds of thousands of lives in Rwanda. Moving \nwith lightning speed to head off another Iraqi threat to Kuwait. And \ngiving freedom and democracy back to the people of Haiti.\n  The United States has proudly supported peace, prosperity, freedom \nand democracy, from South Africa to Northern Ireland, from Central and \nEastern Europe to Asia, from Latin America to the Middle East. All \nthese endeavors make America's future more confident and more secure.\n  This, then, my fellow Americans, is our agenda--expanding \nopportunity, not bureaucracy, enhancing security at home and abroad, \nempowering people to make the most of their own lives.\n  It is ambitious and achievable, but it is not enough. We need more \nthan new ideas changing the world, or equipping all Americans to \ncompete in the new economy. More than a government that is smaller, \nsmarter and wiser. More than all the changes we can make from the \noutside in. Our fortunes and our posterity also depend upon our ability \nto answer questions from within, from the values and the voices that \nspeak to our hearts, voices that tell us we must accept responsibility \nfor ourselves, for our families, for our communities and, yes, for our \nfellow citizens.\n  We see our families and our communities coming apart. Our common \nground is shifting out from under us.\n  The PTA, the town hall meeting, the ball park--it's hard for many \noverworked Americans to find the time and space for the things that \nstrengthen the bonds of trust and cooperation among citizens. And too \nmany of our children don't have the parents and grandparents who can \ngive them the experiences they need to build character and strengthen \nidentity.\n  We all know that while we here in this chamber can make a difference, \nthe real differences in America must be made by our fellow citizens \nwhere they work and where they live. More than ever before, as we move \nto the twenty-first century, everyone matters and we don't have a \nperson to waste.\n  That means the new covenant is for everybody. For our corporate and \nbusiness leaders: We are working to bring down the deficit and expand \nmarkets and to support your success in every way. But you have an \nobligation when you are doing well to keep jobs in our communities and \ngive American workers a fair share of the prosperity they generate.\n  For those in the entertainment industry: We applaud your creativity \nand your worldwide success, and we support your freedom of expression. \nBut you have a responsibility to assess the impact of your work and to \nunderstand the damage that comes from the incessant, repetitive and \nmindless violence, and irresponsible conduct that permeates our media. \nNot because we will make you, but because you should.\n  For our community leaders: We've got to stop the epidemic of teen \npregnancies and births where there is no marriage. I have sent Congress \na plan to target schools all over the country with anti-pregnancy \nprograms that work. But government can only do so much. Tonight, I am \ncalling on parents and leaders across the country to join together in a \nNational Campaign Against Teen Pregnancy--to make a difference.\n  For our religious leaders: You can ignite your congregations to carry \ntheir faith into action, reaching out to all our children, to those in \ndistress, to those who have been savaged by the breakdown of all we \nhold dear. Because so much of what has to be done must come from the \ninside out. You can make all the difference.\n  Responsibility is for all our citizens. It takes a lot of people to \nhelp all the kids in trouble to stay off the streets and in school, to \nbuild the Habitat for Humanity houses, to provide the people power for \nall the civic organizations that make our communities grow. It takes \nevery parent to teach their children the difference between right and \nwrong, and to encourage them to learn and grow, to say no to the wrong \nthings in life and to believe they can become whatever they want to be.\n  I know it is hard when you are working harder for less money and you \nare under great stress to do these things.\n  I also know it's hard to do the work of citizenship when for years, \npoliticians in both parties have treated you like consumers and \nspectators, promising you something for nothing and playing on your \nfears and frustrations. And more and more of the information you get \ncomes in very negative ways, not conducive to real conversation. But \nthe truth is, we have got to stop seeing each other as enemies, even \nwhen we have different views. If you go back to the very beginning of \nthis country, the great strength of America has always been our ability \nto associate with people who were different from ourselves and to work \ntogether to find common ground. And in the present day, everybody has a \nresponsibility to do more of that.\n\n[[Page S1435]]\n\n  That is the first law of democracy, the oldest lesson of most of our \nfaiths: That we are stronger together than alone. That we all gain when \nwe give. That is why we must make citizenship matter again. Here are \nfive shining examples of citizenship:\n  Cindy Perry teaches second graders to read in AmeriCorps, in rural \nKentucky. She gains when she gives: She is a mother of four, and she \nsays that her service ``inspired'' her to get her high-school \nequivalency last year. Now, like thousands of other members, she will \nuse her scholarship from AmeriCorps to go to college to equip herself \nto compete and win in the new economy.\n  With so many forces pulling us apart, we cannot stop a force like \nAmeriCorps that's pulling us together.\n  Chief Stephen Bishop gains when he gives: He has worked with \nAmeriCorps to build community policing in Kansas City--and has seen \ncrime go down because of it. He stood up for our Crime Bill and the \nAssault Weapons ban, and knows that the people he serves and the people \nhe leads are all safer because of it.\n  Corporal Gregory Depestre gains when he gives: He went to Haiti as \npart of his adopted country's force to help secure democracy. And he \nsaw the people of his native land--Haiti--are restoring democracy for \nthemselves.\n  Reverend John Cherry * * *\n  And Jack Lucas gained when he gave. Fifty crowded years ago, in the \nsands of Iwo Jima, he taught and he learned the lessons of citizenship. \nFebruary 20, 1945 was no ordinary day for a small-town boy. As he and \nhis three buddies moved along a slope, they encountered the enemy--and \ntwo grenades at their feet. Jack Lucas threw himself on them both, and, \nin that moment, saved the lives of his companions. And what did he \ngain? In the next instant, a medic saved his life. He gained a foothold \nfor freedom. And he gained this: Jack Lucas--at 17 years old, just a \nyear older than his grandson is today--became the youngest Marine in \nour history, the youngest man in this century, to be awarded the \nCongressional Medal of Honor.\n  All these years later, here's what he says about that day: ``It \ndidn't matter where you were from, who you were. You relied on one \nanother. You did it for your country.''\n  We all gain when we give. We reap whatever we sow. That's at the \nheart of the New Covenant: Responsibility. Citizenship. Opportunity. \nThey are more than stale chapter headings in some remote civics book. \nThey are the virtues by which we can fulfill ourselves and our God-\ngiven potential--the virtues by which we can live out, the eternal \npromise of America, the enduring dream of that first and most sacred \ncovenant: That we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men \nare created equal. That they are endowed by their Creator with certain \ninalienable rights. And that among these are Life, Liberty and the \nPursuit of Happiness.\n  This is a very great country. And our best days are yet to come. God \nbless you, and God bless the United States of America.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/24/senate-section/article/S1430-4", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/24/senate-section/article/S1435-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/24/senate-section/article/S1435-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1435-S1436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT OF EXECUTIVE ORDER RELATIVE TO THE MIDDLE EAST--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 3\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to section 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b) and section 301 of the National \nEmergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1631, I hereby report that I have exercised \nmy statutory authority to declare a national emergency with respect to \nthe grave acts of violence committed by foreign terrorists that \nthreaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process and to issue an \nExecutive order that:\n  --Blocks all property, including bank deposits, of foreign persons or \n    organizations designated in the Executive order or pursuant \n    thereto, which is in United States or in the control of United \n    States persons, including their overseas branches; and\n  --Prohibits any transaction or dealing by United States persons in \n    such property, including the making or receiving of any \n    contribution of funds, goods, or services to or for the benefit of \n    such designated persons.\n  I have designated in the Executive order 12 foreign organizations \nthat threaten to use violence to disrupt the Middle East peace process. \nI have authorized the Secretary of State to designate additional \nforeign persons who have committed, or pose a significant risk of \ncommitting, acts of violence that have the purpose or effect of \ndisrupting the Middle East peace process, or who assist in, sponsor, or \nprovide financial, material or technological support for, or services \nin support of, such acts of violence. Such designations are to be made \nin coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney \nGeneral.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury is further authorized to designate \npersons or entities that he determines, in coordination with the \nSecretary of State and the Attorney General, are owned or controlled \nby, or acting for or on behalf of, any of the foreign persons \ndesignated under this order. The Secretary of the Treasury is also \nauthorized to issue regulations in exercise of my authorities under the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act to implement these measures \nin consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General \nand to coordinate such implementation with the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation. All Federal agencies are directed to take actions within \ntheir authority to carry out the provisions of the Executive order.\n  I am enclosing a copy of the Executive order that I have issued. The \norder was effective at 12:01 a.m., eastern standard time on January 24, \n1995.\n  I have authorized these measures in response to recurrent acts of \ninternational terrorism that threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace \nprocess. They include such acts as the bomb attacks in Israel this past \nweekend and other recent attacks in Israel, attacks on government \nauthorities in Egypt, threats against Palestinian authorities in the \nautonomous regions, and the bombing of the Jewish Mutual Association \nbuilding in Buenos Aires, as well as the car bomb at the Israeli \nEmbassy in London.\n  Achieving peace between Israel and its neighbors has long been a \nprincipal goal of American foreign policy. Resolving this conflict \nwould eliminate a major source of instability in a part of the world in \nwhich we have critical interests, contribute to the security and well-\nbeing of Israel, and strengthen important bilateral relationships in \nthe Arab world.\n  Attempts to disrupt the Middle East peace process through terrorism \nby groups opposed to peace have threatened and continue to threaten \nvital interests of the United States, thus constituting an unusual and \nextraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and \neconomy of the United States.\n  Terrorist groups engaging in such terrorist acts receive financial \nand material support for their efforts from persons in the Middle East \nand elsewhere who oppose that process. Individuals and groups in the \nUnited States, too, have been targets of fundraising efforts on behalf \nof terrorist organizations.\n  Fundraising for terrorism and use of the U.S. banking system for \ntransfers on behalf of such organizations are inimical to American \ninterests. Further, failure to take effective action against similar \nfundraising and transfers in foreign countries indicate the need for \n[[Page S1436]] leadership by the United States on this subject. Thus, \nit is necessary to provide the tools to combat any financial support \nfrom the United States for such terrorist activities. The United States \nwill use these actions on our part to impress on our allies in Europe \nand elsewhere the seriousness of the danger of terrorist funding \nthreatening the Middle East peace process, and to encourage them to \nadopt appropriate and effective measures to cut off terrorist \nfundraising and the harboring of terrorist assets in their territories \nand by their nationals.\n  The measures we are taking demonstrate our determination to thwart \nacts of terrorism that threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace \nprocess by attacking any material or financial support for such acts \nthat may emanate from the United States.\n                                                    William J.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nand make permanent the deduction for health insurance costs of self-\nemployed individuals; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           the self-employed healthcare deduction act of 1995\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, along with Senators Roth, Dole, \nand Pryor, I am introducing a bill to restore and increase the health \ncare deduction for the self-employed.\n  Most of the major health care bills introduced in the last Congress \ncalled for an increased extension of the 25-percent health insurance \ndeduction for the self-employed. There's a broad consensus that an \nincreased health insurance deduction would contribute to tax fairness \nand would also lead to a significant reduction in the number of \nuninsured Americans.\n  Unfortunately, as we all know, the self-employed health insurance \ndeduction expired on December 31, 1993, with the understanding that an \nextension, and possible expansion, would be part of health care reform \nin 1994. However, we all know what happened to President Clinton's \ndisastrous health care reform effort. And, unfortunately, the self-\nemployed deduction went down with it.\n  Mr. President, if the 25-percent deduction is not retroactively \nreinstated, the self-employed will be hit with a sizeable tax increase. \nMoreover, it would be a tax increase on predominantly middle-income \npersons, since about 73 percent of those persons who pay self-\nemployment tax earn under $50,000 in adjusted gross income.\n  Mr. President, our bill will reinstate the 25-percent deduction for \nthe 1994 tax year, and then increase the deduction to 50 percent this \nyear, 75 percent next year, and 100 percent the year after.\n  Organizations as diverse as the Farm Bureau, the National Federation \nof \n[[Page S1443]] Independent Businesses, the Association for the Self-\nEmployed, and the National Restaurant Association support this \nlegislation.\n  I understand the House Ways and Means Committee will be holding a \nhearing this Friday on restoring this deduction, at least for 1994. I \nlook forward to the Congress dealing with this problem in the near \nfuture for 1994, and then expanding the deduction up to 100 percent for \nfuture years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 262\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Mineral Leasing Act to provide for \nleasing of certain lands for oil and gas purposes; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n\n\n             the mineral leasing act amendment act of 1995\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, trapped beneath the naval oil shale \nreserves, two of which are located in Garfield County, CO, are billions \nof cubic feet of natural gas. I am sending legislation to the desk that \nwill:\n  Allow the Department of the Interior and the Department of Energy to \nwork cooperatively to establish a program to competitively lease or \nsell this resource;\n  Allow the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of \nLand Management, to manage the surface of these lands pursuant to the \nFederal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976; and to require that a \nroyalty be paid to the Federal treasury.\n  Two Executive orders, in 1916 and 1924, withdrew public lands for the \npurpose of establishing three naval oil shale reserves. The purpose of \nthe reserves was to ensure the military sufficient oil from the oil \nshale in the event of a cutoff of oil supplies during a war.\n  Naval Oil Shale Reserve Nos. 1, 40,760 acres, and 3, 14,130 acres, \nare located in northwest Colorado near Rifle, and Naval Oil Shale \nReserve No. 2, 90,400 acres, is in eastern Utah. Profitable development \nof shale oil currently is considered to be decades away.\n  The reserves are owned by the Federal Government and are operated by \nthe Department of Energy [DOE]. Management of the reserves was \ntransferred from the Department of the Navy to the Department of Energy \nby the Department of Energy Organization Act in 1977. The Department of \nEnergy has a cooperative agreement with the Bureau of Land Management \nto manage the surface resources of the reserves.\n  Under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976, the \nSecretary of Energy has discretionary authority to undertake certain \nactivities, such as oil and gas development in the reserves, but only \nas necessary to protect, conserve, maintain, or test the reserves. \nProduction for other purposes may take place only with the approval of \nthe President and Congress.\n  The reserves located in Colorado are situated on portions of three \nlarge natural gas producing fields, the Parachute, Rulison, and Grand \nValley, and are estimated to contain substantial natural gas \nhydrocarbons. There has been significant private natural gas drilling \nand extraction activity on the southern border of the third reserve \nsince 1978. Since 1980, 277 private wells have been drilled contiguous \nto the boundaries of reserve Nos. 1 and 2; and through fiscal year \n1992, 89 commercial producing gas wells were drilled by private \nindustry within 1 mile of the boundary of the reserves.\n  The Department of Energy determined in 1983 that the potential \nexisted for drainage of natural gas from the reserves due to the \nprivate development outside of the reserves. To prevent drainage of \npublic resources, the Department of Energy began a protection program, \ndrilling 35 offset and communitization wells. According to the \nDepartment of Energy's Annual Report of Operations for Fiscal Year \n1992, natural gas production between fiscal years 1977 and 1992 totaled \n5.4 billion cubic feet. Revenues from the reserves totaled $5 million \nbetween fiscal years 1977 and 1992; expenditures for the same period \ntotaled $24.8 million.\n  This legislation does not specify what royalty should be collected. \nThe royalty could be anywhere between 12.5 and 25 percent. The \nSecretary will have the discretion to decide what that royalty should \nbe. There is no evidence, however, supporting a royalty rate at higher \nthan 20 percent. Leases outside the reserve that mandate a royalty \nabove this rate have not been executed. The royalty rate that is \neventually chosen should reflect fair market value. It should not be \nset too high, discouraging development, nor too low, depriving the \nGovernment of needed revenues.\n  It has clearly been Congress' intent to make oil and gas leasing a \nprofitable enterprise. It is time for the DOE to get out of the gas \nproducing business. The Vice President's Performance Review is seeking \nto avoid duplication and save money. Requiring the DOE and the \nDepartment of the Interior to cooperatively lease the resources of the \nnaval oil shale reserves will generate revenue, save money, help \nprivate industry, enrich local governments, and protect the \nenvironment.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 264. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to adjust \nfor inflation the dollar limitations on the dependent care credit; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              THE WORKING FAMILIES TAX RELIEF ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto provide a measure of tax relief to working families throughout \nAmerica. My bill would restore value to the child and dependent care \ncredit by allowing an annual adjustment of the credit for inflation.\n  Mr. President, economic security is the paramount concern for \nmillions of American families. For the first time in our Nation's \nhistory, living standards are not keeping pace with economic growth and \nnew job creation. Median family income, after almost two decades of \nstagnation, is now declining. Many Americans are working harder and \nlonger to make ends meet for their families.\n  The availability and affordability of adequate child care is an \nincreasingly important consideration for many middle-income working \nparents. Many families are forced to patch together a network of child \ncare providers to secure care for their children. My legislation \nresponds to the critical need for affordable, quality child-care \nservices without creating costly new Government programs or agencies. \nIt is a simple, flexible solution that will reestablish the full \nbenefit of the child and dependent care credit for millions of working \nfamilies.\n  The evidence in support of improving the child and dependent care \ncredit is clear. The number of single mothers working outside the home \nhas dramatically increased in recent years. More than 56 percent of all \nmothers with children under 6 years work outside the home, and over 70 \npercent of women with children over age 6 are in the labor market.\n  The percentage of Hawaii households in which both parents work \noutside the home is even higher than the national average. According to \nprojections developed by the Bank of Hawaii based on the 1990 census, \n61.8 percent of all Hawaii families have both parents employed, and \n71.3 percent of all households have at least two individuals in the \nwork force.\n  [[Page S1444]] The increased participation of single mothers in the \nlabor market and the large number of two-parent families in which both \nparents work outside the home have made the dependent care credit one \nof the most popular and productive tax incentives ever enacted by \nCongress. Unfortunately, the value of the credit has declined \nsignificantly over the years as inflation has slowly eroded the value \nof this benefit. Measured in constant dollars, the maximum credit of \n$2,400 has decreased in value by more than 45 percent since it was \nenacted in 1981.\n  The maximum amount of employment-related child care expenses allowed \nunder current law--$2,400 for a single child, and $4,800 for two or \nmore children--has simply failed to keep pace with escalating care \ncosts. Unlike the earned income tax credit [EITC], the standard \ndeduction, the low-income housing credit, and a number of other \nsections of our Tax Code, the dependent care credit is not adjusted for \ninflation.\n  The purpose of this credit is to partially offset the expense of \ndependent and child care services incurred by parents working outside \nthe home. While the cost of quality child care has increased as demand \nexceeds supply, the dependent care credit has failed to keep up with \nthe spiraling costs. The bill I introduce today corrects this problem \nby automatically adjusting the dependent and child care credit for \ninflation. Under this legislation, both the dollar limit on the amount \ncreditable and the limitation on earned income would be adjusted \nannually.\n  Mr. President, in the past 12 years, the average middle-class family \nwith children has seen its income fall 5 percent, almost $1,600 after \ninflation. A family of four earning $35,000 a year has seen its tax \nburden increase since 1981. In part, this is due to the diminished \nvalue of the child and dependent care credit. In 1981, the flat credit \nfor dependent care was replaced with a scale to give the greatest \nbenefit of the credit to lower income working families. Since that \ntime, neither the adjusted gross income figures employed in the scale, \nnor the limit on the amount of employment-related expenses used to \ncalculate the credit, has been adjusted for inflation. Our bill \nprovides a measure of much needed relief to working American families. \nIt would index the child and dependent care credit and restore the full \nbenefit of the credit.\n  The average cost for out of home child care exceeds $3,500 per child, \nper year. Child care or dependent care expenses can seriously strain a \nfamily's budget. This burden can become unbearable for single parents, \nalmost invariably single mothers, who must balance the need to work \nwith their parental responsibilities.\n  Numerous economic studies have shown that the economic policies of \nthe 1980's had a disastrous impact upon the incomes of middle-income \nfamilies. Inflation adjusted wages for the median worker fell 7.3 \npercent from 1979 to 1991. Working Americans have been losing ground in \ntheir struggle to preserve their standard of living. To compensate, \nAmerican families have been forced to work longer hours, deplete their \nlife savings, and go deeper into debt. There is an urgent need to enact \nchanges in our Tax Code that are pro-family and pro-children. The \nWorking Families Tax Relief Act meets both of these goals.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 264\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Working Families Tax Relief \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INFLATION ADJUSTMENT OF DEPENDENT CARE CREDIT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (e) of section 21 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to expenses for \n     household and dependent care services necessary for gainful \n     employment) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(10) Inflation adjustment.--In the case of any taxable \n     year beginning in a calendar year after 1995, each dollar \n     amount contained in subsections (c) and (d)(2) shall be \n     increased by an amount equal to--\n       ``(A) such dollar amount, multiplied by\n       ``(B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under \n     section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable \n     year begins, by substituting `calendar year 1994' for \n     `calendar year 1992' in subparagraph (B) thereof.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1995.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 265. A bill to amend the San Juan Basin Wilderness Protection Act \nof 1984 to designate additional lands as wilderness and to establish \nthe Fossil Research Natural Area, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n    the bisti and de-na-zin wilderness expansion and fossil forest \n                             protection act\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that will \namend the San Juan Wilderness Protection Act of 1984. This legislation \nwill combine two existing wilderness areas in New Mexico, designate \nadditional lands as wilderness, and establish the Fossil Forest \nResearch Natural Area.\n  In December 1991, approximately 10,750 acres between the Bisti and \nthe De-Na-Zin Wilderness Areas were transferred by exchange to the \nBureau of Land Management, with the Bureau of Indian Affairs acting in \ntrust for the Navajo Nation. These newly acquired lands are immediately \nadjacent to the existing boundaries of the Bisti and De-Na-Zin \nWilderness areas and are of high wilderness quality. The area appears \nto have been affected primarily by the forces of nature with the \nimprint of human activity substantially unnoticeable.\n  The acquired lands are included in the approximately 16,674 acres \nthat will be designated by this legislation as wilderness, and join the \nBisti and De-Na-Zin into one wilderness area. This bill includes \nadditional lands that will require further exchanges with the State of \nNew Mexico and the Navajo Tribe. Both parties indicate that they are \nwilling to enter into agreements to consummate the exchange of lands.\n  The joining of the Bisti and De-Na-Zin Wilderness Areas will enhance \nthe wilderness experience for visitors and help ensure continued \nprotection of this resource for future generations of Americans. The \ntwo wilderness areas previously designated and the expansion area will \nbe combined into one wilderness area with more manageable boundaries. \nThe joint wilderness area will include a large, striking, and open \nnatural landscape.\n  The scenic badlands that dominate this area provide an outstanding \nopportunity for solitude as well as activities such as hiking, \nbackpacking, photography and geological sightseeing in an unconfined \nand primitive environment. The badlands topography of the expanded area \nnaturally bridge the two wilderness areas into one picturesque expanse \nwith a variety of rich colors and landform.\n  The establishment of the Fossil Forest Research Natural Area, named \nfor the abundant petrified tree stumps and logs which lie exposed on \nits surface, provide a wealth of data and fossil material that are \nfound within the Fossil Forest. Many of these stumps are preserved in \nplace with root systems still intact. Four major dinosaur bone quarries \nand several microvertebrate and invertebrate localities have been \nexcavated over the past decade, including a critically important \nCretaceous Age--75 million years ago--mammal quarry. The occurrence of \nthis diverse assemblage of fossil fauna and flora provides a unique \nopportunity to peek through a small window of time, 70 to 80 million \nyears ago, to examine an important episode of geological and biological \nchange.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to move rapidly on this important \nlegislation in an effort to enhance the National Wilderness \nPreservation System and to conserve a unique paleontological area that \nrepresents an important period of time and space in our country's \nnatural history.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 266. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 with respect to the preemption of the Hawaii Prepaid Health \nCare Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n              THE HAWAII PREPAID HEALTH CARE EXEMPTION ACT\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I reintroduce legislation to exclude \nthe Hawaii \n[[Page S1445]] Prepaid Health Care Act from the Employee Retirement \nIncome Security Act of 1974, known as ERISA.\n  As we have witnessed during the opening weeks of the session, \nreinventing Government will be a major legislative theme for the 104th \nCongress. In the months ahead, Congress will examine unnecessary \nrestrictions that the Federal Government imposes on States.\n  Hawaii's experience with ERISA is an excellent example of a Federal \nrestriction that should be curtailed so the State can improve access to \naffordable health care. ERISA is the major constraint on Hawaii's \nability to improve health care coverage. My bill would give the State \nthe flexibility it needs to find creative and cost-effective ways of \ndelivering high-quality health care.\n  Ensuring that all Americans will have access to affordable health \ncare is the most profound challenge facing our country. As the cost of \nproviding care is growing at an alarming rate, the number of uninsured \nor underinsured individuals continues to rise.\n  State governments have a major stake in financing and providing \nhealth care. A growing portion of State budgets are devoted to health \ncare. But budgetary problems are not the only constraints facing the \nStates. Federal laws and regulations often conspire to make health care \nmore expensive or less universal. A case in point is the State of \nHawaii's experience with the Hawaii Prepaid Health Care Act and ERISA.\n  In 1974, Hawaii became the first State to require employers and \nemployees to share responsibility for the cost of health insurance when \nit enacted the Prepaid Health Care Act [PPHCA]. By dramatically \nreducing the number of uninsured, this measure allowed Hawaii to \nimplement a system of near-universal health care coverage.\n  In a 1980 decision, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that \nERISA preempts the State from enacting minimum health care requirements \nfor employers governed by ERISA. The court determined that in the \nabsence of an expressed exemption for the Hawaii statute, Federal law \ngoverns. The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the lower court ruling, and \nconcluded that relief could come only from Congress.\n  Soon thereafter, I sponsored legislation to grant an exemption for \nthe Hawaii statute. After considerable congressional debate, a limited \nERISA exemption was signed into law on January 14, 1983. However, the \nexemption was not prospective, and only permitted Hawaii to require the \nspecific benefits set forth in the State's 1974 statute.\n  An unfortunate consequence of these events is that the Hawaii Prepaid \nHealth Care Act has been frozen in time, and the State is prevented \nfrom making changes other than those that would enhance effective \nadministration.\n  In recognition of Hawaii's determined effort to provide universal \nhealth care, my bill would exempt the State's prepaid health care act \nfrom restrictions contained in ERISA. Such an exemption would give \nHawaii greater flexibility to improve both the quality and scope of \nhealth coverage for working men and women and their families. Among \nother things, the State could reevaluate the employer-employee cost \nsharing levels, examine the feasibility of requiring dependent \ncoverage, and explore measures to assist businesses in providing health \nbenefits.\n  Since 1974, Hawaii has had a mandated employer health benefits \nprogram, the first and only one of its kind in the United States. \nNearly all of Hawaii's employers are required to provide employee \nhealth insurance, with the employee paying up to half the premium cost, \nbut no more than 1.5 percent of monthly wages, and the employer \nproviding the balance. Eligible employees must work at least 20 hours a \nweek. Employers may offer one or two basic plans--a fee-for-service \nplan or a designated health maintenance organization plan.\n  The results of Hawaii's innovative approach are impressive. Hawaii \nhas led the Nation in ensuring that basic health care is available to \nall its people. This system delivers high-quality care at relatively \nlow cost, despite a cost of living that is 30 to 40 percent higher than \nthe rest of the country.\n  Of all the States, Hawaii is the closest to achieving universal \nhealth care coverage. The Hawaii State Department of Health estimates \nthat between 2 and 4 percent of Hawaii's residents lack health \ninsurance. This compares with national estimates that between 14 and 17 \npercent of U.S. residents are not covered.\n  Today, Hawaii has one of the lowest infant mortality rates and one of \nthe highest life expectancy rates in the Nation. Although the incidence \nof chronic diseases, such as cancer and heart disease, is similar to \nthat of other States, the death rates from these diseases are lower. \nThe substantial investment Hawaii has made in the prepaid health care \nlaw has clearly paid off.\n  Yet, there is an urgent need to bring the State statute up to date. \nWe need to allow a State that has been at the forefront of innovative \napproaches to health care to make changes which better reflect the \nneeds of today's population and their employers. Hawaii should not have \nto resort to back-door approaches in order to ensure basic health care \nto its citizens. My legislation will permit the State to address these \nissues and upgrade its successful health care programs for the 1990's \nand beyond.\n  Although we must continue the quest for national health care reform, \nwe should not allow a dynamic State like Hawaii to remain hobbled by \nFederal limitations on a truly innovative program with a proven record \nof success.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 266\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a system of licensing, reporting, and \nregulation for vessels of the United States fishing on the high seas, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                       THE FISHERIES ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill \nwhich contains a number of provisions important to the conservation of \nfishery resources on the high seas.\n  Senators Kerry, Gorton, Murray, and Murkowski join me in introducing \nthis package today, which is titled, the ``Fisheries Act of 1995.''\n  The High Seas Fisheries Licensing Act of 1995, title I of the bill, \nwould provide for the domestic implementation of the agreement to \npromote compliance with international conservation and management \nmeasures by fishing vessels on the high seas.\n  This agreement was adopted by the U.N. Food and Agriculture \nOrganization in 1993.\n  The implementing legislation would establish a system of licensing, \nreporting, and regulation for all U.S. vessels fishing on the high \nseas.\n  It will set an example for other nations to the agreement to follow, \nand will begin to allow the United States to obtain information from \nother countries about their fishing vessels on the high seas.\n   [[Page S1446]] The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Convention Act, \ntitle II of the bill, would implement the Convention on Future \nMultilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries.\n  This convention calls for establishment of the Northwest Atlantic \nFisheries Organization [NAFO] to assess and conserve high seas fishery \nresources off the coasts of Canada and New England.\n  Among other provisions, this title of the bill would provide for: \nFirst, U.S. representation in NAFO; second, coordination between NAFO \nand appropriate regional fishery management councils; and third, \nauthorization for the Secretaries of Commerce and State to carry out \nU.S. responsibilities under the convention.\n  Title III of the bill would extend the authorization of \nappropriations for the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act through fiscal \nyear 1998.\n  It would also: First, provide for the development of a research and \nmonitoring program for bluefin tuna and other wideranging Atlantic fish \nstocks; second, establish operating procedures for the International \nCommission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas [ICCAT] Advisory \nCommittee; and third, clarify procedures for dealing with nations that \nfail to comply with ICCAT recommendations.\n  Title IV of the bill would reauthorize and amend the Fishermen's \nProtective Act of 1967 to allow the Secretary of State to reimburse \nU.S. fishermen forced to pay transit passage fees required by a foreign \ncountry that are regarded by the United States as inconsistent with \ninternational law.\n  Similar legislation was passed in both the Senate and House last year \nin response to the $1,500, in Canadian dollars, transit fee charged to \nUnited States fishermen last year for passage off British Columbia.\n  Title V of the bill would prohibit United States fishermen from \nfishing in the Central Sea of Okhotsk, known as the ``Peanut Hole'', \nexcept where such fishing is conducted in accordance with a fishery \nagreement to which both the United States and Russia are parties.\n  This provision is intended to provide assistance to Russia in \nconserving the fish stocks in the Sea of Okhotsk, which is bordered by \nRussian waters.\n  Title VI would prohibit the United States from entering into any \ninternational agreement with respect to the conservation and management \nof living marine resources or the use of the high seas by fishing \nvessels that would prevent full implementation of the U.N. global \nmoratorium on large-scale driftnet fishing.\n  The intent is to ensure that the United States takes every \nopportunity to assist in the full implementation--and to strengthen \nwhere possible--the U.N. moratorium on driftnet fishing.\n  The final section of the bill, title VII, authorizes the entry into \nforce of a Governing International Fishery Agreement [GIFA] between the \nUnited States and the Republic of Estonia.\n  I would like to thank Senator Kerry for his help in putting this \npackage together.\n  This is a noncontroversial bill with bipartisan support, and I hope \nmy colleagues on the Commerce Committee and in the full Senate will \nsupport its speedy passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n                                 S. 267\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Secretary shall \n     coordinate such regulations with any other entities \n     regulating high seas fishing vessels, in order to minimize \n     duplication of license application and reporting \n     requirements. To the extent practicable, such regulations \n     shall also be consistent with regulations implementing \n     fishery management plans under the Magnuson Fishery \n     Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.).\n       (e) Notice of International Conservation and Management \n     Measures.--The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary \n     of State, shall publish in the Federal Register, from time to \n     time, a notice listing international conservation and \n     management measures recognized by the United States.\n\n     SEC. 106.

CIVIL PENALTIES AND LICENSE SANCTIONS.\n\n       (a) Civil Penalties.--\n       (1) Any person who is found by the Secretary, after notice \n     and opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 \n     of title 5, United States Code, to have committed an act \n     prohibited by section 106 shall be liable to the United \n     States for a civil penalty. The amount of the civil penalty \n     shall not exceed $100,000 for each violation. Each day of a \n     continuing violation shall constitute a separate offense. The \n     amount of such civil penalty shall be assessed by the \n     Secretary by written notice.

The \n     Secretary may waive or compromise a sanction in the case of a \n     transfer pursuant to court order.\n       (4) In the case of any license that is suspended under this \n     subsection for nonpayment of a civil penalty or criminal \n     fine, the Secretary shall reinstate the license upon payment \n     of the penalty or fine and interest thereon at the prevailing \n     rate.\n       (5) No sanctions shall be imposed under this subsection \n     unless there has been prior opportunity for a hearing on the \n     facts underlying the violation for which the sanction is \n     imposed, either in conjunction with a civil penalty \n     proceeding under this section or otherwise.\n       (c) Hearing.--For the purposes of conducting any hearing \n     under this section, the Secretary may issue subpoenas for the \n     attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of \n     relevant papers, books, and documents, and may administer \n     oaths. Witnesses summoned shall be paid the same fees and \n     mileage that are paid to witnesses in the courts of the \n     United States.

The Secretary shall \n     promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record \n     upon which such penalty or sanction was imposed, as provided \n     in section 2112 of title 28, United States Code. The findings \n     and order of the Secretary shall be set aside by such court \n     if they are not found to be supported by substantial \n     evidence, as provided in section 706(2) of title 5, United \n     States Code.\n       (e) Collection.--\n       (1) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil \n     penalty after it has become a final and unappealable order, \n     or after the appropriate court has entered final judgment in \n     favor of the Secretary, the matter shall be referred to the \n     Attorney General, who shall recover the amount assessed in \n     any appropriate district court of the United States. In such \n     action the validity and appropriateness of the final order \n     imposing the civil penalty shall not be subject to review.\n       (2) A high seas fishing vessel (including its fishing gear, \n     furniture, appurtenances, stores, and cargo) used in the \n     commission of an act prohibited by section 106 shall be \n     liable in rem for any civil penalty assessed for such \n     violation under subsection (a) and may be proceeded against \n     in any district court of the United States having \n     jurisdiction thereof. Such penalty shall constitute a \n     maritime lien on such vessel that may be recovered in an \n     action in rem in the district court of the United States \n     having jurisdiction over the vessel.\n      [[Page S1449]] SEC. 109.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) customary international law and the United Nations \n     Convention on the Law of the Sea guarantee the right of \n     passage, including innocent passage, to vessels through the \n     waters commonly referred to as the ``Inside Passage'' off the \n     Pacific Coast of Canada;\n       (2) Canada recently required all commercial fishing vessels \n     of the United States to pay 1,500 Canadian dollars to obtain \n     a ``license which authorizes transit'' through the Inside \n     Passage;\n       (3) this action was inconsistent with international law, \n     including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \n     Sea, and, in particular, Article 26 of that Convention, which \n     specifically prohibits such fees, and threatened the safety \n     of United States commercial fishermen who sought to avoid the \n     fee by traveling in less protected waters;\n       (4) the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 provides for the \n     reimbursement of vessel \n     [[Page S1452]] owners who are forced to pay a license fee to \n     secure the release of a vessel which has been seized, but \n     does not permit reimbursement of a fee paid by the owner in \n     advance in order to prevent a seizure;\n       (5) Canada required that the license fee be paid in person \n     in 2 ports on the Pacific Coast of Canada, or in advance by \n     mail;\n       (6) significant expense and delay was incurred by \n     commercial fishing vessels of the United States that had to \n     travel from the point of seizure back to one of those ports \n     in order to pay the license fee required by Canada, and the \n     costs of that travel and delay cannot be reimbursed under the \n     Fishermen's Protective Act;\n       (7) the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 should be \n     amended to permit vessel owners to be reimbursed for fees \n     required by a foreign government to be paid in advance in \n     order to navigate in the waters of that foreign country if \n     the United States considers that fee to be inconsistent with \n     international law;\n       (8) the Secretary of State should seek to recover from \n     Canada any amounts paid by the United States to reimburse \n     vessel owners who paid the transit license fee;\n       (9) the United States should review its current policy with \n     respect to anchorage by commercial fishing vessels of Canada \n     in waters of the United States off Alaska, including waters \n     in and near the Dixon\n      Entrance, and should accord such vessels the same treatment \n     that commercial fishing vessels of the United States are \n     accorded for anchorage in the waters of Canada off British \n     Columbia;\n       (10) the President should ensure that, consistent with \n     international law, the United States Coast Guard has \n     available adequate resources in the Pacific Northwest and \n     Alaska to provide for the safety of United States citizens, \n     the enforcement of United States law, and to protect the \n     rights of the United States and keep the peace among vessels \n     operating in disputed waters;\n       (11) the President should continue to review all agreements \n     between the United States and Canada to identify other \n     actions that may be taken to convince Canada that any \n     reinstatement of the transit license fee would be against \n     Canada's long-term interests, and should immediately \n     implement any actions which the President deems appropriate \n     if Canada reinstates the fee;\n       (12) the President should continue to immediately convey to \n     Canada in the strongest terms that the United States will not \n     now, nor at any time in the future, tolerate any action by \n     Canada which would impede or otherwise restrict the right of \n     passage of vessels of the United States in a manner \n     inconsistent with international law; and\n       (13) the United States should redouble its efforts to seek \n     expeditious agreement with Canada on appropriate fishery \n     conservation and management measures that can be implemented \n     through the Pacific Salmon Treaty to address issues of mutual \n     concern.\n\n     SEC. 402.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Congress has enacted and the President has signed into \n     law numerous Acts to control or prohibit large-scale driftnet \n     fishing both within the jurisdiction of the United States and \n     beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation, including \n     the Driftnet Impact Monitoring, Assessment, and Control Act \n     of 1987 (Title IV, P.L. 100-220), the Driftnet Act Amendments \n     of 1990 (P.L. 101-627), and the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries \n     Enforcement Act (Title I, P.L. 102-582);\n       (2) the United States is a party to the Convention for the \n     Prohibition of Fishing with Long Driftnets in the South \n     Pacific, also known as the Wellington Convention;\n       (3) the General Assembly of the United Nations has adopted \n     three resolutions and three decisions which established and \n     reaffirm a global moratorium on large-scale driftnet fishing \n     on the high seas, beginning with Resolution 44/225 in 1989 \n     and most recently in Decision 48/445 in 1993;\n       (4) the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted \n     these resolutions and decisions at the request of the United \n     States and other concerned nations;\n       (5) the best scientific information demonstrates the \n     wastefulness and potentially destructive impacts of large-\n     scale driftnet fishing on living marine resources and \n     seabirds; and\n       (6) Resolution 46/215 of the United Nations General \n     Assembly calls on all nations, both individually and \n     collectively, to prevent large-scale driftnet fishing on the \n     high seas.\n\n     SEC. 603. PROHIBITION.\n\n       The United States, or any agency or official acting on \n     behalf of the United States, may not enter into any \n     international agreement with respect to the conservation and \n     management of living marine resources or the use of the high \n     seas by fishing vessels that would prevent full \n     implementation of the global moratorium on large-scale \n     driftnet fishing on the high seas, as such moratorium is \n     expressed in Resolution 46/215 of the United Nations General \n     Assembly.\n\n     SEC. 604.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my \nfriend, the senior Senator from Alaska, in introducing the Fisheries \nAct of 1995. This legislation addresses an issue of great importance to \nthe people of Massachusetts, the Nation and, indeed, the world--the \npromotion of sustainable fisheries on a worldwide basis.\n  One of the world's primary sources of dietary protein, marine fish \nstocks were once thought to be an inexhaustible resource. However, \nafter peaking in 1989 at a record 100 million metric tons, world fish \nlandings now have begun to decline. The current state of the world's \nfisheries has both environmental and political implications. Last year, \nthe U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] estimated that 13 of \n17 major ocean fisheries may be in trouble. Competition among nations \nfor dwindling resources has become all too familiar in many locations \naround the world.\n  The bill before us today will strengthen international fisheries \nmanagement. Among the provisions reinforcing U.S. commitments to \nconserve and manage global fisheries, are the following: First, \nimplementation of the FAO Agreement To Promote Compliance With \nInternational Convention and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on \nthe High Seas; second, implementation of the Convention on Future \nMultilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries; third, \nimproved research and international cooperation with respect to \nAtlantic bluefin tuna and other valuable highly migratory species; \nfourth, reimbursement of United States fishermen for illegal transit \nfees charged by the Canadian Government; fifth, a ban on U.S. fishing \nactivities in the central Sea of Okotsk; sixth, a prohibition on U.S. \nparticipation in international agreements which undermine the U.N. \nmoratorium on large-scale driftnet fishing, and seventh, approval of \nthe governing international fishing agreement between the United States \nand the Republic of Estonia.\n  The measures of this bill will make a substantial contribution to \nU.S. leadership in the conservation and management of international \nfisheries. I encourage my colleagues to join with me to support its \npassage.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BUMPERS:\n  S. 268. A bill to authorize the collection of fees for expenses for \ntriploid grass carp certification inspections, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n           the triploid grass carp certification act of 1995\n\n Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, these days we hear a lot about the \nneed to reinvent Government and make it more responsive and less \ncostly. Today, I am introducing legislation along with Senator Pryor \nthat will help the Fish and Wildlife Service achieve both these goals.\n  For many years, the Fish and Wildlife Service has conducted a \ntriploid grass carp certification program. The triploid grass carp is a \nsterile fish that is used by 29 States to help control aquatic \nvegetation in lakes, ponds, and reservoirs. This fish has proven to be \nboth effective and economical and many States prefer using it over \nchemicals and pesticides.\n  As more and more States have legalized the use of the triploid grass \ncarp, they have adopted regulations requiring that the Fish and \nWildlife Service verify through certification that these fish are \nsterile. If a reproducing triploid grass carp was to accidentally enter \na pond or river ecosystem it could seriously damage the habitat of \nexisting fish species. Certification by the Fish and Wildlife Service \nensures that the fish are ecologically sound and clears the way for \nthem to be shipped to various States by private producers.\n  Last year, the Fish and Wildlife Service conducted 550 triploid grass \ncarp certifications, free of charge. The cost for providing this \nservice was $70,000. Unfortunately, because of severe fiscal \nconstraints, the agency can no longer afford to absorb the costs \nassociated with the certification process and is moving to discontinue \nthe program in the next 60 days. The producers of the triploid grass \ncarp have informed the Fish and Wildlife Service they are willing to \npay the agency for this service, provided that the money comes back to \nthe agency and is used only for the triploid grass carp certification \nprogram. The agency supports this ``fee for service'' concept but needs \ncongressional authorization before it can be instituted.\n  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today, will give the Fish \nand Wildlife Service the authority it needs to charge a user fee and \napply it to the triploid grass carp certification program. Without this \nlegislation, a valuable program that benefits the public will be \nterminated.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation and \nlook forward to its speedy passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 268\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. COLLECTION OF FEES FOR TRIPLOID GRASS CARP \n                   CERTIFICATION INSPECTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior, acting \n     through the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Director''), may charge \n     reasonable fees for expenses to the Federal Government for \n     triploid grass carp certification inspections requested by a \n     person who owns or operates an aquaculture facility.\n       (b) Availability.--All fees collected under subsection (a) \n     shall be available to the Director until expended, without \n     further appropriations.\n       (c) Use.--The Director shall use all fees collected under \n     subsection (a) to carry out the activities referred to in \n     subsection (a).\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DOLE (for Mr. Simpson):\n  S. 269. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nincrease control over immigration to the United States by increasing \nborder patrol and investigator personnel; improving the verification \nsystem for employer sanctions; increasing penalties for alien smuggling \nand for document fraud; reforming asylum, exclusion, and deportation \nlaw and procedures; instituting a land border user fee; and to reduce \nuse of welfare by aliens; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n         the immigrant control and financial responsibility act\n\n Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I introduce legislation which will \nprovide the Immigration Service with some badly needed tools to further \nthe goal of achieving control over immigration. The bill will also \nreduce the abuse of the public welfare system by immigrants.\n  For years, as chairman or ranking member of the Immigration \nSubcommittee, I have advocated strong measures to control illegal \nimmigration so that we can maintain a legal immigration program that \nwill have the support of the American people. This legislation will \ncontinue that effort by authorizing additional Border Patrol officers \nand an increase in the personnel who investigate alien smuggling and \nthe hiring of unlawful aliens. Most important, the bill will provide \n[[Page S1454]] for the establishment of a new verification system to \nenable the Immigration Service, and employers, to verify the work \nauthority of new hires. The system will also verify the eligibility of \napplicants for public assistance.\n  Alien smuggling has become a serious and growing problem. This \nmeasure will provide new authority to the Justice Department to assist \nthem in combating what the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees has \nreferred to as a ``modern day slave trade.''\n  The manufacture and use of fraudulent documents has reached such \nproportions that one can obtain high quality Social Security cards, \ndriver's licenses, voter registration cards, or whatever, simply by \nplacing a morning order on a Los Angeles street corner and picking up \nthe documents later that day for less than $100. My legislation will \nincrease the penalty for such document fraud. It will also provide new \npenalties for false statements in documents required by the Immigration \nService.\n  To combat the abuse of our immigration laws by persons who arrive at \nour ports-of-entry with no documents, or with fraudulent documents, the \nbill will provide for the expedited exclusion of such aliens. To more \neffectively remove persons found to be unlawfully in the United States, \nthe bill will streamline our deportation proceedings.\n  In recent months we have seen the Attorney General's parole authority \nbeing used to admit groups of persons for permanent residence in the \nUnited States. This is an abuse of the spirit, if not the letter, of \nthe law allowing the Attorney General to parole aliens into the United \nStates in certain circumstances.\n This bill will limit the use of parole authority to individual cases \nfor humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit, and will \nrequire that the number of parolees who remain more than a year must be \noffset by a reduction in regular immigration.\n\n  In recent years many unlawful aliens have discovered the key to \nextending their stay in the United States. By claiming fear of \npolitical persecution at home, they are able to delay their departure \nfor years as they remain here and work while awaiting their hearing. \nThere are over 400,000 persons in the backlog of such asylum claimants. \nThis legislation will make clear that asylum claimants are not \nnecessarily entitled to work authority, and it will provide increased \nresources for addressing the asylum application backlogs.\n  The Refugee Act, passed nearly 15 years ago, set the ``normal flow'' \nof refugees to be resettled in the United States at 50,000 per year. \nBut the number of refugees resettled here in those 15 years has \nexceeded that number by hundreds of thousands. Every single year since \nthe Refugee Act passed in 1980 refugee admissions have far exceeded the \n``normal flow.'' This legislation will require congressional approval \nfor the admission of more than 50,000 refugees in a fiscal year--except \nin a refugee emergency.\n  Thirty years ago, in order to provide a legal status for the hundreds \nof thousands of Cubans who had fled Cuba after Castro's Communist \nintentions became clear, Congress passed the Cuban Adjustment Act. This \nallowed those Cubans who had fled the island in the 1960's to adjust to \npermanent resident status after 1 year in the United States. The \npersons for whom this extraordinary legislation was enacted have long \nsince regularized their status in the United States. Yet, the Cuban \nAdjustment Act remains on the books as an anachronism that is both \nunfair and unnecessary. While nearly 4 million persons await their \nimmigration visas in our vast immigration backlogs, some for as long as \n20 years, any Cuban who gets to the United States, legally or \nillegally, can get a green card after 1 year. This special treatment is \nno longer justifiable and is not right. This bill will repeal the Cuban \nAdjustment Act.\n  It has been the tradition of the United States for more than 100 \nyears that newcomers to this country should be self-sufficient. Our \nlaws have long provided that those persons who are ``likely at any time \nto become a public charge'' are inadmissible, and that those immigrants \nwho later do become ``public charges'' are deportable. These provisions \nhave proven to be unenforced, or unenforceable. This legislation will \nmake clear that an American resident or citizen who sponsors his or her \nrelatives will be financially responsible for them until they become \ncitizens. The bill also makes clear that those immigrants who do become \n``public charges'' become deportable. My bill will not deny legal \nimmigrants access to our public welfare system--the safety net will be \nthere--but those immigrants who become dependent upon public assistance \nwill run the risk of deportation. Under this legislation any immigrant \nwho receives public assistance for more than 12 months will be \ndeportable. Illegal immigrants will be denied all public assistance \nexcept certain emergency and child health and nutrition benefits.\n  Finally, this bill will impose a border crossing users fee to help \noffset the cost of maintaining our border controls. This fee will raise \nmoneys that can be used to improve our border crossing facilities and \ndeter the entry of unlawful aliens.\n  There will be other comprehensive legislation introduced in the \nSenate. And I understand the Clinton administration is working on their \nown legislative package on immigration reform. I intend the legislation \nI introduced today to be the basis for hearings at which we will \nconsider all other responsible proposals.\n  The Commission on Immigration Reform has provided as with serious and \nthoughtful recommendations. Those that were not already in legislation \nI introduced in the last Congress, I have included in this legislation, \nsuch as a new system to verify eligibility to work in the United \nStates. This bill also follows the Commission's recommendation for an \nenforceable contract of support, signed by the person in this country \nwho sponsors any immigrant relative for immigration to the United \nStates. This will require such a sponsor to reimburse governments which \nprovide the immigrant with welfare or other assistance.\n  The bill I introduce today focuses on illegal immigration control \nissues. Our legal immigration program is also in need of thoughtful \nreform and revision. I am presently drafting the legislation to \naccomplish these needed reforms. I understand the Commission on \nImmigration Reform will present us with their recommendations on legal \nimmigration reform in the early spring. I look forward to those.\n  To be sustainable, immigration must always serve the national \ninterest. We must be able to assure the American people that whatever \nother goals our immigration policy may further, its overriding goal is \nto serve the long-term interest of the majority of our citizens.\n  We have much to do on immigration reform. The election last November \ndemonstrated clearly that the American people wish us to ``get on with \nthe job.'' This bill I introduce today is the first step and other \nserious steps will soon follow.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Simpson, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Cochran, \n        Mr. Reid, and Mr. Gregg):\n  S. 270.

Mr. President, we have a major opportunity early in this \nCongress to enact vitally important legislation to protect our Nation \nagainst the scourge of international terrorism. On behalf of myself, \nthe distinguished chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, Senator \nSimpson, and Senators D'Amato, Cochran, Gregg, and Reid, I introduce \nthe Alien Terrorist Removal Act of 1995.\n  Mr. President, one of this Senator's greatest disappointments about \nlast year's crime bill was that certain members of the conference \ncommittee from the House side insisted on stripping from it the Smith-\nSimpson alien terrorist removal amendment. Apparently at the \ninstigation of a number of aliens' rights organizations, they killed a \nsorely needed antiterrorism measure that had been proposed by the \nReagan Justice Department and actively promoted by the Bush Justice \nDepartment. In her letter to the conferees regarding the crime bill, in \nfact, Clinton administration Attorney General Janet Reno said that our \namendment is both constitutional and addresses a problem that needs to \nbe solved.\n  [[Page S1455]] FBI Director Louis Freeh has now made clear that he \nshares our disappointment. A December 2, 1994, article in the Los \nAngeles Times quotes Director Freeh as saying that the Justice \nDepartment should make resurrecting the Smith-Simpson amendment one of \nits highest antiterrorism legislative priorities in the 104th Congress.\n  Let us explain briefly what our proposal is all about. The Alien \nTerrorist Removal Act of 1995 would establish a special procedure under \nwhich classified information could be used to establish the \ndeportability of alien terrorists. It is designed to safeguard national \nsecurity interests, while at the same time according appropriate \nprotection to the constitutional due process rights of aliens.\n\n\n                   the problem addressed by the bill\n\n  Under current law, classified information can be used to establish \nthe excludability of aliens, but not their deportability. Thus, when \nthere is insufficient unclassified information available to establish \nthe deportability of a terrorist alien, the Government faces two \nequally unacceptable choices.\n  First, the Justice Department could declassify enough of its evidence \nagainst the alien to establish his deportability. Too often, however, \nthat simply cannot be done because the information in question is so \nsensitive that its disclosure would endanger the lives of human sources \nor compromise highly sensitive methods of intelligence gathering.\n  The Government's second, and equally untenable, choice would be \nsimply to let the terrorist alien involved remain here. Unfortunately, \nthat is not just a hypothetical situation. It happens in real cases. \nRecently, in fact, we understand, it happened in the case of an alien \nterrorist who is a high-ranking member of a notorious Middle Eastern \nterrorist organization. Due to the unavailability of the procedure that \nwould be established by our bill, that terrorist had to be allowed to \nremain at large in the United States.\n\n\n                  how the bill would solve the problem\n\n  Utilizing the existing definitions of terrorism in the Immigration \nAct of 1990 and of classified information in the Classified Information \nProcedures Act, our bill would establish a special alien terrorist \nremoval court made up of sitting U.S. district judges that is modeled \non the special court created by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct. The special court\n procedure established by our bill could only be invoked when the \nJustice Department certifies under seal that: First, the Attorney \nGeneral or the Deputy Attorney General has personally approved invoking \nthe special procedure; second, an alien terrorist is physically present \nin the United States; and third, the removal of the alien in normal \npublic immigration proceedings would pose a risk to the national \nsecurity because it would disclose classified information.\n\n  Under our bill, once the Justice Department made those \ncertifications, a U.S. district judge would determine whether the \ninvocation of the special procedure is justified. In order for the \nprocedure to be invoked, the district judge would have to determine \nthat: First, the alien involved has been correctly identified; second, \na public deportation hearing would pose a risk to the lives of human \nsources or the national security because it would disclose classified \ninformation; and third the threat posed by the alien's physical \npresence is immediate and involves the risk of death or serious bodily \nharm to American citizens.\n  Our bill provides that if the U.S. district judge makes those \ndeterminations, a special removal hearing would be held. The alien \nwould be provided the right to be present at the hearing and to be \nrepresented by counsel, at public expense if necessary. The alien also \nwould be given the right to introduce evidence on his or her own behalf \nand to ask the judge to issue subpoenas for witnesses. For its part, \nthe Justice Department would provide the U.S. district judge with the \nclassified information, in camera and ex parte, to establish the need \nfor the alien terrorist's removal.\n  Under our legislation, the U.S. district judge then would review the \nclassified information in chambers. Where possible, without \ncompromising the classified evidence, the Federal judge would give the \nalien an unclassified summary of the evidence and/or the facts \nestablished by that evidence. Ultimately, the Federal judge would \ndetermine whether, considering the record as a whole, the Justice \nDepartment has proven, by clear and convincing evidence, that the alien \nis a terrorist and should be removed. Finally, under our bill, the \nalien involved would be given the right to appeal to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Federal Circuit and to petition for a writ of \ncertiorari from the Supreme Court.\n\n\n                     why the bill is constitutional\n\n  When the Bush Justice Department was in the process of deciding \nwhether to adopt the Reagan administration proposal that our bill \nembodies, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel reviewed its \nconstitutionality. As a result of that review, the OLC determined that \nthe proposal is constitutional and the Bush administration subsequently \nendorsed it. When the Senate considered the Smith-Simpson amendment \nlate in 1993, our colleague, then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman \nJoseph Biden, agreed. Calling the case for the constitutionality of \nthis proposal irrefutable, Senator Biden commented that nothing in the \nproposal rises to the level of being unconstitutional. Finally, as we \nhave noted, when the Senate adopted our amendment and sought the \nClinton Justice Department's comments, the Department wrote to members \nof the conference committee that it continues to regard our proposal as \nconstitutional.\n  The constitutionality of our bill would be determined under the test \nset forth by the Supreme Court in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. at 335. \nThe Court set forth these three factors to inform a court's decision, \nin a given case, whether due process has been satisfied:\n\n       First, the private interest that will be affected by the \n     official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation \n     of such interest through the procedures used, and the \n     probable value, if any, of additional or substitute \n     procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's \n     interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and \n     administrative burdens that the additional or substitute \n     procedural requirement would entail.\n\n  Given the compelling nature of the national security interests at \nstake in the rare cases in which the need for this special procedure \nwould arise and the protections that are afforded to the alien by our \nbill, we have no doubt that our proposal is fully constitutional.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Judiciary Committee to hold prompt hearings \non this important measure. I would hope that it can be passed and sent \nto the President in the early months of this historic 104th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 270\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to repeal the 22d amendment relating \nto Presidential term limitations; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              joint resolution to repeal the 22d amendment\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is not without a sense of \nirony that I am introducing legislation today contrary to the spirit of \none of the more notable provisions in the renowned Republican Contract \nWith America. This resolution I put forth would repeal the Presidential \nterm limit--the 22d amendment to the Constitution which Republicans \nhastily, and regrettably, passed nearly 50 years ago.\n  This is, in my view, the only term limits bill which should pass \nCongress.\n  As we all know, the Contract with America, signed by Republican \ncandidates for the House of Representatives last year, included a call \nfor congressional term limits. Term limits are wildly popular in some \nareas of the country. But term limits also are misguided, undemocratic \nand a particularly bad idea for some sparsely populated States where \nthe clamor for them is greatest.\n  Fortunately, the contract promised a House vote on term limits, not \npassage. That vote is a promise the House should keep. And for the \nNation's sake, it is my hope that the vote result will be a resounding \n``no.''\n  The popular sentiment for term limits is the ultimate and, perhaps, \ninevitable manifestation of public disdain for government. It is what \nCongress gets for being irresponsible on the fundamentals--principally \nmoney matters. People justifiably do not feel they are getting a return \non their investment in government. As their elected tax money managers, \nso to speak, we are in the crosshairs. And they are coming after us \nwith term limits--a very blunt instrument of electoral revenge.\n  Term limits are the legislative translation of voters leaning out \ntheir windows screaming: We're mad as hell and not going to take it \nanymore.\n  Fifty years ago, there was such a sentiment, confined primarily to \nthe Republican caucus, contained in the 1940 and 1944 Republican Party \nplatforms, and directed at the architect of the New Deal--President \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt. In 1947, a Republican congressional \nmajority, fresh from a virtual political exile, passed the 22d \namendment to the Constitution to limit Presidents to two terms in \noffice. They were determined that history not repeat itself--there \nwould be no more four-term Roosevelts. They would see to it.\n  Mr. President, not a single Republican in the House or Senate voted \nagainst that term limit amendment in 1947. It was a brash, ill-\nconceived, hastily executed and strictly partisan response to the \nunprecedented tenure of President Roosevelt. As constitutional scholars \nhave observed, this was the first constitutional modification that \nconstricted voter suffrage. And Republicans should take heed, for it is \nwe who have been hoisted by their petard. It is poetic justice, in a \nsense, that Presidents Eisenhower and Reagan are the only ones, thus \nfar, who have been constrained by the 22d amendment.\n  The Presidential term limit does not, as some have contended, argue \nfor congressional term limits. The 22d amendment was a mistake, Mr. \nPresident, and that is why I am introducing today a Senate Joint \nResolution to repeal it. It would be fitting, and in the national \ninterest, for the Republican majority of 1995 to rectify a mistake made \nby the Republican majority of 1947. Democrats hesitant to change that \nwhich has been the status quo for half a century may want to review \nPresident Harry S. Truman's words in favor of repeal:\n\n       What have you done? You have taken a man and put him in the \n     hardest job in the world, and sent him out to fight our \n     battles in a life and death struggle. And you have sent him \n     out to fight with one hand tied behind his back, because \n     everyone knows he cannot run for reelection.\n       He is still the President of the whole country, and all of \n     us are dependent upon him to do his job. If he is not a good \n     president, and you do not want to keep him, you do not have \n     to reelect him.\n\n  Mr. President, it is that simple. The vote gives voters the power to \nlimit terms.

Res. 69\n\n       Whereas on January 22, 1995 a brutal and cowardly terrorist \n     attack near Netanya, Israel killed 19 Israelis and wounded \n     dozens more;\n       Whereas the terrorist group ``Islamic Jihad'' claimed \n     credit for the January 22, 1955 attack in a statement issued \n     in Damascus, Syria;\n       Whereas on December 25, 1994, a ``Hamas'' terrorist attack \n     in Jerusalem wounded 13 civilians, including 1 American \n     citizen;\n       Whereas on October 19, 1994, a Hamas terrorist attack in \n     Tel Aviv killed 22 Israelis and wounded 48 more;\n       Whereas 110 Israeli citizens have been killed and hundreds \n     more have been wounded in terrorist attacks since the \n     Declaration of Principles was signed on September 13, 1993;\n       Whereas the Declaration of Principles obligates the \n     Palestinian Authority to publicly condemn terrorist attacks, \n     and to bring to justice perpetrators of such acts in \n     territories under their control;\n       Whereas no perpetrators of these terrorist attacks have \n     been brought to justice for their acts of violence by the \n     Palestinian Authority;\n       Whereas the governments of Syria and Iran continue to \n     provide safe haven and support for terrorist groups, \n     including Islamic Jihad and Hamas, among others;\n       Whereas continued acts of terrorism threaten the peace \n     process in the Middle East;\n       Therefore, be it resolved by the Senate that--\n       (1) The terrorist attacks in Israel are condemned in the \n     strongest possible terms;\n       (2) Condolences are extended to the families of all those \n     killed, and hopes are expressed for the rapid and complete \n     recovery of all wounded in the January 22, 1995 attack;\n       (3) Chairman Arafat should, consistent with the obligations \n     of the Declaration of Principles, publicly and forcefully \n     condemn acts of terror against Israelis, take immediate steps \n     to bring to justice those responsible for such acts, and \n     implement steps to prevent future acts of terrorism in all \n     territory under his control;\n       (4) President Assad should immediately end all support for \n     terrorist groups, including safe haven, material and \n     financial support, in all territory under his control;\n       (5) The administration should undertake strong efforts to \n     end the safe haven, training, and financial and other support \n     granted terrorists by Iran, Syria and other states.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise in support of this resolution \ncondemning the brutal terrorist attack in Israel. Any peace process \nmust show benefits if it is to work. Unfortunately, average Israelis \nare seeing increased terrorism and increased insecurity as extremists \nseek to use violence to derail peace. If the Israeli population \nconcludes that the peace process is not in their interest, the process \nwill halt.\n  Since September 13, 1993, when the Declaration of Principles was \nsigned, 110 Israelis have been killed in acts of terrorism. Hundreds \nmore have been wounded. And despite requirements for the Palestinian \nauthority to bring those responsible for acts of violence to justice, \nnot one terrorist has been convicted and sentenced.\n  Just as troubling as Chairman Arafat's inaction in the face of \nterrorism is the continued refusal of Syrian President Assad to crack \ndown on terrorist groups operating from Syria and Syrian-controlled \nLebanon. It is a sad fact that the statement claiming credit for last \nSunday's barbaric attack was issued by Islamic Jihad from Syria. Syria \nand Syrian-controlled Lebanon remain the address of choice for many of \nthe most bloodthirsty terrorists in the world.\n  The peace process in the Middle East is at a crossroads. Israel is \ndivided over the best course to protect its future. We in the United \nStates cannot and should not get involved in the internal Israeli \ndebate. We can and should, however, express our condolences to those \n[[Page S1458]] murdered, and our hope that those injured recover \ncompletely. We should also express our outrage that these acts \ncontinue--without adequate responses from Syria or the PLO. I am \npleased to be joined by my colleagues in passing this expression of the \nSenate's views. I ask unanimous consent that a list of Israelis killed \nin terrorist attacks since September 13, 1993, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n         Israeli deaths from terrorism since September 13, 1993\n\nDeaths since September 13, 1993 (as of Jan. 24, 1995)...............110\n  Civilian deaths....................................................70\n  IDF deaths.........................................................40\n1995 Deaths (as of Jan. 23)..........................................20\n  Civilian............................................................2\n  IDF deaths.........................................................18\n1994 Deaths..........................................................70\n  Civilian...........................................................35\n  IDF deaths.........................................................35\nDeaths between Sept. 13 and Dec. 31, 1993............................20\n  Civilian...........................................................15\n  IDF deaths..........................................................5\nDeaths Since May 4, 1994.............................................64\n  Civilian...........................................................32\n  IDF deaths.........................................................32\nDeaths between Jan. 1 and May 4, 1994................................26\n  Civilian...........................................................23\n  IDF deaths..........................................................3\nDeaths between Sept. 13 and Dec. 31, 1993............................20\n  Civilian...........................................................15\n  IDF deaths..........................................................5\nDeaths between Sept. 13, 1993 and May 4, 1994........................46\n  Civilian...........................................................38\n  IDF deaths..........................................................8\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I watched with utter revulsion and horror \nthe news accounts of the terrorist attack in Netanya, Israel. The \ncasualties now stand at 19 dead and more than 60 injured, all \napparently at the hands of the radical Islamic Jihad organization.\n  Once again, Israelis are reminded of the human costs of pursuing \npeace with the Palestinians. Once again, the Islamic radicals have \ndemonstrated their capacity to seize the initiative with their craven \nacts of terror. Once again, Israel is forced to seal off the \nterritories and reexamine its willingness to participate in the \nPalestinian experiment with self-rule. And once again, in a perverse \ntwist of logic, the enemies of peace become the beneficiaries of a \nhorrible tragedy.\n  The Israeli Government, to its enormous credit, has concluded that it \nwill not allow the terrorists to dictate Israel's decision to implement \nits peace agreement with the Palestinians. Prime Minister Rabin has, in \nmy opinion, made the right and courageous decision to stand by his \npledge.\n  What concerns me most, Mr. President, and what I wish to highlight \ntoday, is the price to be paid for that decision. All of us who follow \nevents in Israel know that Prime Minister Rabin has a limited mandate \nto reach peace with the Palestinians and Israel's other neighbors. With \neach act of terror, with each addition to the list of casualties, the \nPrime Minister's political standing, and his ability to take risks for \npeace, are eroded.\n  Even more important, there is a real danger that the Israeli public \nwill change its fundamental view of the peace process. In Israeli \nminds, last year's moving images of White House signing ceremonies and \nhopeful talk of peace and understanding have been replaced by the \nbloody carnage of the bombing site and the mournful cries of the \nvictims' families.\n  Although opposition to the peace process--even violent opposition--is \nto be expected, my fear is that is that we are fast approaching a point \nof no return, a point where Israeli government calls to continue the \npeace talks will fall on deaf ears. In order to maintain their support \nfor the peace process, Israelis have to know that they will be secure, \nand that the Palestinians are making a good faith effort to ensure that \nis the case. Otherwise the Israeli public will see no reason to make \nother difficult concessions for peace.\n  If the Palestinians do not take dramatic steps to reign in Hamas and \nthe Islamic Jihad, then the simple fact is that more terrorist acts \nwill occur. At some point in the not too distant future, Israelis--and \neven the Israeli government--could decide that adherence to the process \nis no longer worth the effort. It is up to all interested parties--the \nIsraelis, the United States, the Syrians who provide support and safe \nhaven to the terrorists, and, more to the point, to the Palestinians \nthemselves, to see that does not happen.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor a resolution condemning the \nacts of terrorism, which will be offered shortly by Senators Dole, \nDaschle, and others.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/24/senate-section/article/S1457-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       SENATE RESOLUTION 70--ELECTING CHAPLAIN OF THE U.S. SENATE\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHRONE (for Mr. Dole) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Due to an inadvertent omission at the time, \nthe bill was not printed in the Record.\n\n                                 S. 255\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. STABILIZATION OF NATCHEZ BLUFFS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In accordance with the recommendations of \n     the reports prepared by the Army Corps of Engineers entitled \n     ``The Natchez Bluff Study'', ``The Natchez Bluff Study: \n     Supplement I'', and ``The Natchez Bluff Study: Supplement \n     II'', dated September 1985, June 1990, and December 1993, \n     respectively, the Secretary of the Army shall carry out such \n     activities as are necessary to stabilize the portions of the \n     bluffs along the Mississippi River in the vicinity of \n     Natchez, Mississippi, designated in figure 4 of the December \n     1993 report as--\n       (1) Clifton Avenue, area 3;\n       (2) the bluff above Natchez Under-the-Hill, area 7;\n       (3) the bluff above Silver Street, area 6; and\n       (4) Madison Street to State Street, area 4.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Department of the Army such sums as \n     are necessary to carry out this section.\n                  VETERANS' HEALTH ADMINISTRATION ACT\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today \nto amend chapter 74 of title 38, United States Code, to revise certain \nprovisions relating to the appointment of clinical and counseling \npsychologists in the Veterans Health Administration [VHA].\n  The VHA has a long history of maintaining a staff of the very best \nhealth care professionals to provide care to those men and women who \nhave served their country in the Armed Forces. It is certainly fitting \nthat this should be done.\n  Recently a quite distressing situation regarding the care of our \nveterans has come to my attention. In particular, the recruitment and \nretention of psychologists in the VHA of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs has become a significant problem.\n  The Congress has recognized the important contribution of the \nbehavioral sciences in the treatment of several conditions from which a \nsignificant portion of our veterans suffer. For example, programs \nrelated to homelessness, substance abuse, and post traumatic stress \ndisorder [PTSD] have received funding from the Congress in recent \nyears.\n  Certainly, psychologists, as behavioral science experts, are \nessential to the successful implementation of these programs. However, \nthe high vacancy and turnover rates for psychologists in the VHA--over \n11 and 18 percent, respectively, as reported in one recent survey--\nmight seriously jeopardize these programs and will negatively impact \noverall patient care in the VHA.\n  Recruitment of psychologists by the VHA is hindered by a number of \nfactors including a pay scale not commensurate with private sector \nrates of pay as well as by the low number of clinical and counseling \npsychologists appearing on the register of the Office of Personnel \nManagement [OPM]. Most new hires have no postdoctoral experience and \nare hired immediately after a VA internship. Recruitment, when \nsuccessful, takes up to 6 months or more.\n  Retention of psychologists in the VA system poses an even more \nsignificant problem. I have been informed that almost 40 percent of VHA \npsychologists had 5 years or less of postdoctoral experience. Without \ndoubt, our veterans would benefit from a higher percentage of senior \nstaff who are more experienced in working with veterans and their \nparticular concerns. My bill provides\n incentives for psychologists to continue their work with the VHA and \nseek additional education and training.\n\n  Several factors are associated with the difficulties in retention of \nVHA psychologists including low salaries and lack of career advancement \nopportunities. It seems that psychologists are apt to leave the VA \nsystem after 5 years because they have almost reached peak levels for \nsalary and professional development in the VHA. Furthermore, under the \npresent system \n[[Page S1473]] psychologists cannot be recognized nor appropriately \ncompensated for excellence or for taking on additional responsibilities \nsuch as running treatment programs.\n  In effect, the current system for hiring psychologists in the VHA \nsupports mediocrity, not excellence and mastery. Our veterans with \nbehavioral disorders and mental health problems are deserving of better \npsychological care from more experienced professionals than they are \ncurrently receiving.\n  A hybrid title 38 appointment authority for psychologists would help \nameliorate the recruitment and retention problems in several ways. The \nlength of time it takes to recruit psychologists could be abbreviated \nby eliminating the requirement for applicants to be rated by the Office \nof Personnel Management. This would also facilitate the recruitment of \napplicants who are not recent VA interns by reducing the amount of time \nbetween identifying a desirable applicant and being able to offer that \napplicant a position.\n  It is expected that problems in retention of behavioral science \nexperts will be greatly alleviated with the implementation of a hybrid \ntitle 38 system for VA psychologists, primarily through offering \nfinancial incentives for psychologists to pursue professional \ndevelopment with the VHA. Achievements that would merit salary \nincreases under title 38 should include such activities as assuming \nsupervisory responsibilities for clinical programs, implementing \ninnovative clinical treatments that improve the effectiveness and/or \nefficiency of patient care, making significant contributions to the \nscience of psychology, earning the ABPP diplomate status, and becoming \na fellow of the American Psychological Association.\n  Currently, psychologists are the only doctoral level health care \nproviders in the VHA who are not included in title 38. This is, without \nquestion, a significant factor in the recruitment and retention \ndifficulties that I have addressed. Ultimately, an across-the-board \nsalary increase might be necessary. However, the conversion of \npsychologists to a hybrid title 38, as proposed by this amendment, \nwould provide relief for these difficulties and enhance the quality of \ncare for our Nations' veterans and their families.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 82\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Jewish \nFederation of Greater Bridgeport for their extraordinary efforts to \nprovide for the Jewish population in the State of Connecticut.\n  For nearly 55 years, the Jewish Federation of Greater Bridgeport has \nserved and represented Jews in need in its service cities and towns of \nBridgeport, Easton, Fairfield, Monroe, Stratford, and Trumbull by \nproviding health, social, and educational opportunities to their \ncitizens through agencies such as the Greater Bridgeport Jewish \nCommunity Center, the Jewish Home for the Elderly, Jewish Family \nService, and Hillel Academy and Merkaz Community Hebrew High School.\n  The Jewish Federation of Greater Bridgeport, through the continuing \nnational work of the United Jewish Appeal, has aided both with social \nand humanitarian services countless hundreds of thousands of Jews in \nIsrael and in 40 countries the world over.\n  The tide of peace in 1994 has rolled in and washed over the nations \nand peoples of the Middle East as never before, witnessed by the \nsigning of a treaty ensuring peaceful cohabitation in the region \nbetween the people of Jordan and Israel, limited self-rule of the \nPalestine Liberation Organization in Jericho and the Gaza Strip, and \nthe final emigration of Jews from Syria while talks continue between \nthose two nations toward a comprehensive peace.\n  The annual combined super Sunday telethon campaign of the Jewish \nFederation of Greater Bridgeport, and the United Jewish Appeal will \ntake place on Sunday, February 5, 1995, in order to raise vitally \nneeded funds to continue providing these worthwhile services here at \nhome, in Israel, and around the world.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/24/senate-section/article/S1473-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1474]]\n                      MR. EDELMAN'S QUALIFICATIONS\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I read George Will's column \nattacking Peter Edelman. It was a column written by someone who, \nobviously, has not had a chance to get acquainted with Peter Edelman. \nKnowing both George Will and Peter Edelman, my instinct is that if the \ntwo of them got acquainted, George Will would be one of his \nenthusiastic supporters, or at least a supporter.\n  John Douglas, who headed the Civil Division of the Justice Department \nunder Robert Kennedy, is the son of our former colleague Senator Paul \nDouglas. Paul Douglas was one of the finest people who ever served in \nthe U.S. Senate, and John is cut from the same cloth.\n  I believe my colleagues would be interested in his letter to the \neditor, which appeared in the Washington Post.\n  I join in the sentiment it expresses.\n  I've known Peter Edelman for a number of years, and I've always \nregarded him as a solid, substantial, well-balanced person, who would \nbe a great judge.\n  I ask to insert the John Douglas letter into the Record at this \npoint.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                      Mr. Edelman's Qualifications\n\n                          (By John W. Douglas)\n\n       I write in response to George Will's attack on Peter \n     Edelman's qualifications to be a judge on the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals here, an attack centering on a law review article he \n     wrote some years ago on the 14th Amendment [op-ed, Dec. 18].\n       I have known Mr. Edelman for more than 30 years and have \n     the highest opinion of his character and competence. He \n     worked as my special assistant in 1963 and 1964 when I was an \n     assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice \n     Department's Civil Division. He performed in outstanding \n     fashion in a variety of matters, including litigation for \n     which he was directly responsible, handling his work with \n     skill, excellent judgment and high standards.\n       He has earned equally high marks for his subsequent work as \n     an assistant to Sen. Robert Kennedy, a vice president of the \n     University of Massachusetts and a law professor at \n     Georgetown. This long record of distinguished and principled \n     service commends him strongly for nomination to the federal \n     judiciary.\n       Thus, it would be a shame if his critics' attacks on his \n     article's treatment of theoretical constitutional issues were \n     allowed to preclude his nomination. I am confident that at a \n     confirmation hearing Mr. Edelman would be able to convince \n     the committee that, if confirmed, he would faithfully follow \n     the law, as is required of all federal judges, and that he \n     fully understands that neither the due-process clause nor any \n     other constitutional provision guarantees subsistence, or any \n     level of subsistence, to its citizens; consequently, these \n     are matters for the political branches, particularly the \n     legislatures, to deal with and decide.\n       In any event, this particular question should not be \n     decided in advance of a hearing and in a vacuum without \n     giving due weight to Mr. Edelman's impressive record.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/24/senate-section/article/S1474-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 HOMICIDES BY GUNSHOT IN NEW YORK CITY\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to announce to the Senate \nthat during the past week, 17 people were killed with firearms in New \nYork City, bringing this year's total to 44.\n  I should point out to my colleagues that the average age of those \nmurdered with firearms in New York City so far this year is \napproximately 25. Some have been as young as 16 years old. \nConsistently, those between the ages 15-24 comprise the largest \npercentage of those murdered with firearms, according to mortality \nstatistics compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nIn 1993, according to the F.B.I.'s Uniform Crime Report, 6,244 of the \n16,189 people murdered with firearms were between the ages of 15-24. \nThat is nearly 40 percent. A similar percentage of murder offenders in \n1993 were between the ages of 15-24. These are, in many cases, children \nkilling children.\n  Mr. President, as I have often reminded the Senate, we must begin to \nrecognize the epidemic nature of gun violence in America. Homicide is \nthe second leading cause of death among our youth and the leading cause \nof death among our black youth. A disproportionate number of these \nmurders are carried out with firearms.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/24/senate-section/article/S1474-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JONATHAN H. WOODWARD\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of \nConnecticut's most devoted civic servants, Mr. Jonathan H. Woodward. \nMr. Woodward was educated in private schools from the 1st grade. After \nattending St. Paul's School in New Hampshire, Mr. Woodward studied at \nHarvard College. There he excelled both in the classroom and on the \nbaseball field. Following his graduation Mr. Woodward joined the Army \nAir Force and served under a wide variety of different posts until the \nend of the war in 1945.\n  Following his service in the military, Mr. Woodward went to work at, \nand ultimately purchased, the J.M. Layton Company. Indeed, his business \nsense would propel Mr. Woodward to such positions as director of the \nMerchant's Bank and Trust Company, South Norwalk Savings/Gateway Bank, \nGreater Norwalk Chamber of Commerce, Connecticut Public Expenditure \nCouncil, and Maritime Center at Norwalk. As stated by his son David, \nMr. Woodward, ``Believed that in hiring good people and having them \nserve the clientele to the best of their ability both the firm and the \nindividuals would prosper.''\n  In 1953, Mr. Woodward was elected to Norwalk Hospital's Board of \nTrustees. He would later be elected and serve as the hospital's \npresident from 1966 to 1970. His involvement in the development of this \nhospital was capped by his efforts to raise nearly $20 million to \nexpand the facility in 1991. Through this astounding effort, the \nNorwalk hospital has been able to greatly increase its service to the \nstate of Connecticut.\n  Counterbalanced by his strong business prowess, was his undeniable \ndesire to serve the public good. ``He was a towering figure in the city \nboth psychically and civically . . . he was very proud of his heritage \nand equally interested in the good of all citizens in the city.'' \nThrough this desire to serve the populace, Mr. Woodward became the \ndirector of such charitable institutions as the Norwalk YMCA, Norwalk \nCommunity-Technical College Foundation, and United Way of Norwalk.\n  John Woodward lived a life that should be an example to all of us.

WOODWARD\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of \nConnecticut's most devoted civic servants, Mr. Jonathan H. Woodward. \nMr. Woodward was educated in private schools from the 1st grade. After \nattending St. Paul's School in New Hampshire, Mr. Woodward studied at \nHarvard College. There he excelled both in the classroom and on the \nbaseball field. Following his graduation Mr. Woodward joined the Army \nAir Force and served under a wide variety of different posts until the \nend of the war in 1945.\n  Following his service in the military, Mr. Woodward went to work at, \nand ultimately purchased, the J.M. Layton Company. Indeed, his business \nsense would propel Mr. Woodward to such positions as director of the \nMerchant's Bank and Trust Company, South Norwalk Savings/Gateway Bank, \nGreater Norwalk Chamber of Commerce, Connecticut Public Expenditure \nCouncil, and Maritime Center at Norwalk. As stated by his son David, \nMr. Woodward, ``Believed that in hiring good people and having them \nserve the clientele to the best of their ability both the firm and the \nindividuals would prosper.''\n  In 1953, Mr. Woodward was elected to Norwalk Hospital's Board of \nTrustees. He would later be elected and serve as the hospital's \npresident from 1966 to 1970. His involvement in the development of this \nhospital was capped by his efforts to raise nearly $20 million to \nexpand the facility in 1991. Through this astounding effort, the \nNorwalk hospital has been able to greatly increase its service to the \nstate of Connecticut.\n  Counterbalanced by his strong business prowess, was his undeniable \ndesire to serve the public good. ``He was a towering figure in the city \nboth psychically and civically . . . he was very proud of his heritage \nand equally interested in the good of all citizens in the city.'' \nThrough this desire to serve the populace, Mr. Woodward became the \ndirector of such charitable institutions as the Norwalk YMCA, Norwalk \nCommunity-Technical College Foundation, and United Way of Norwalk.\n  John Woodward lived a life that should be an example to all of us. He \nloved and provided for his family while at the same time excelling both \nin the workplace and in his service to the environment. He will forever \nbe remembered as a man who touched many and helped countless others. \nThe state of Connecticut has much to remember him by. We are grateful \nfor his good work and for his dedication to the people of our fine \nstate.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/24/senate-section/article/S1474-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR THIS EVENING AND TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE.
