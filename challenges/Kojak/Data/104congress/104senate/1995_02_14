Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of House Joint Resolution 1, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A House joint resolution (H.J. Res. 1) proposing a balanced \n     budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the joint resolution.\n\n       Pending:\n       Reid amendment No. 236, to protect the Social Security \n     system by excluding the receipts and outlays of Social \n     Security from balanced budget calculations.\n\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that--the Senator \nfrom Utah will soon be here, is that right?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Utah and the \nSenator from Nevada each have 7\\1/2\\ minutes. That was the original \nagreement, and it will put off the vote for approximately 3 or 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, that is my understanding. I think we can go \nahead and begin. Perhaps the Senator can take his time and Senator \nHatch will be here momentarily.\n  Mr. REID. I am going to reserve the final 2\\1/2\\ minutes because it \nis my amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. If the Senator will yield, is he saying the vote will \nnot occur until when?\n  Mr. REID. Within 3 or 4 minutes of 9:30.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield 1 second more, I understand that \nthe majority leader, Senator Dole, wants 2 minutes at the very end.\n  Mr. REID. I forgot to mention that Senator Daschle is also going to \nspeak for a brief time.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I wanted to point out, Mr. President, that if I do not \nleave here at 9:30, I am not going to get to make a speech. Obviously, \nI am not going to be able to make that speech.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to advise me when I have \n2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. President, Social Security is presently running huge surpluses. \nThis year, $70 billion; in 2002 over $700 billion, and a few years \nafter that, it will be $3 trillion.\n  It now appears that there are people who want to tap into that \nsurplus in an effort to balance the budget. My amendment draws a line \nin the sand that says you cannot tap Social Security to balance the \nbudget. Those Social Security trust funds which have been set aside for \nsome 60-odd years, should be kept in the trust fund and they should not \nbe looted. It should not become a Social Security slush fund. It is \nunfair to seniors, unfair to the baby boomers, and certainly unfair to \ntoday's youth, to raid the Social Security trust fund.\n  This Congress realizes this. This Senate realized this when, in 1990, \nby a vote of 98 to 2, we set up Social Security as a separate part of \nour revenues. It was no longer part of the general revenues of this \ncountry. A vote to kill my amendment will mark the death knell, I \npredict, of Social Security.\n  Everybody in this Chamber has made public pronouncements that they \nwant to protect Social Security. The only way to protect Social \nSecurity is by voting for my amendment.\n  Mr. President, if you try to do it by implementing legislation, it is \nunconstitutional once the underlying amendment passes. Anything less \nthan my amendment would be an express statement that you are willing to \nhave the \n [[Page S2584]] fox guard the henhouse or allow Willie Sutton to guard \nthe bank.\n  Those watching this debate should not be fooled by transparent \narguments being put forth as to why my amendment will not work. The \namendment simply says Social Security shall not be used to balance the \nbudget. That is all it says.\n  No one watching this debate should be under any illusions about what \nthis vote is about. A vote to kill this amendment means that Social \nSecurity will be used to balance the budget of this country. That would \nbe unfair.\n  There have been advertisements in the State of Nevada and around the \ncountry by the Republican National Committee to try to get me to back \noff this amendment. I am not going to. There is not enough money in the \nworld to stop me from doing that, because I am obligated not only to \nprotect today's senior citizens but my children's vested interest in \nSocial Security, and my children's children.\n  They have a right, of course, to put out these advertisements. I \nrecognize that. But rights carry responsibilities. And it is simply \nirresponsible to jeopardize the viability of Social Security. The \nreason they are after Social Security is because that is where the \nmoney is. As we all know, you cannot balance the budget with ease \nunless you use Social Security moneys. They are wanting to say: ``OK, I \ndid what I could to protect Social Security. I am sorry the amendment \npassed and now we must use Social Security to balance the budget.'' \nThat is wrong. They want to be able to take the billions and billions \nand even trillions of dollars out of the Social Security trust funds to \nbalance this budget. A vote to kill or defeat my amendment will allow \nthem to do just that. It is not right, it is not fair, and it is not \nequitable.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as we approach the vote to table the Reid \namendment, which would carve out a constitutional exemption for Social \nSecurity from the balanced budget amendment, let me just express a few \nlast thoughts.\n  First, let me thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada and those \non both sides of this debate for comporting themselves with dignity \nthroughout this debate. There are differences of opinion, but there has \nnot been any rancor in this debate. I attribute that to my friend and \ncolleague from Nevada, and we can all been proud of that.\n  Now, let me just point out why the Senate should reject the Reid \namendment, in addition to the fact that writing a statute into the \nConstitution really should not be done. That is why we have \nimplementing legislation. And this amendment provides that we shall \nhave implementing legislation to do exactly what the distinguished \nSenator says.\n  Mr. President, let us just be honest about it. The Social Security \ntrust fund is off budget, but the Federal Government is borrowing from \nit daily and giving a piece of paper, an IOU, for the repayment. If we \ndo not do something to straighten out the budgetary problems of this \ncountry and do something about the deficit, those IOU's are going to be \nworthless pieces of paper, no matter what this amendment seems to say.\n  The fact of the matter is that not only will they be worthless pieces \nof paper, but this country is not going to be able to pay for Social \nSecurity or any other programs in the future if we do not get spending \nunder control, especially deficit spending which drives up our interest \ncosts and crowds out our ability to spend on anything else. The only \nway we are going to get spending under control is if we put a fiscal \nmechanism into the Constitution that requires us to do so.\n  Also, if you refer to a statute, as my good friend and colleague \nwould like us to do here, if you write a statute into the Constitution, \nas it were by reference, you are talking about putting in tremendously \nconvoluted and technical language and giving quasi-constitutional \neffect to language like this here on this poster. We would not know \nfrom week to week what the Constitution means as long as Congress can \namend the underlying language of the statute referred to. That is just \none illustration.\n  Let me give you another illustration on this next poster. It is a \ntechnical amendment to the Social Security Act in the sections \nreferenced by the pending amendment. This is not constitutional \nlanguage. But all of these details would have some type of \nconstitutional significance under the pending amendment.\n  Let me further illustrate the complexity involved in referring to a \nstatute in the Constitution. This poster shows just one of the \ndefinitions in the statute as referred to by the amendment. Is this \nconstitutional language? It covers pages in the United States Code. \nAnd, Congress could make whatever changes it wants to in the \nConstitution any time it wants to by a mere 51-percent vote by merely \nchanging the underlying statute. Or perhaps the opposite is true: \nPerhaps we could only amend the underlying statute through the process \nof a constitutional amendment. My sense is that the former is the more \nlikely, that the meaning of the Constitution could be altered by \naltering the referenced statute.\n  Mr. President, look at this statutory language on disability \ninsurance benefit payments in the statutory definitions of \n``disability'' and ``benefit payments'' on this poster. And this is \njust one set of definitions in the United States Code, covering a \nnumber of pages. There are thousands of pages on the subject of the \npending amendment and thousands of regulations, all of which would be \nwritten into the Constitution by reference. It would become the biggest \nloophole we could imagine. It would make the balanced budget amendment \na totally worthless piece of paper and it would denigrate the \nConstitution.\n  Last week, we voted 87 to 10 to direct the Budget Committee to come \nup, at its earliest convenience, with a way of balancing the budget \nwithout touching Social Security, either from a revenue or from a \nspending standpoint. It will show that we can do what we said we could \nwithout taking the unprecedented and unjustifiable step of placing a \nmere statute into the text of the Constitution.\n  The real threat to Social Security is our staggering national debt \nand the high interest costs it drives. High Government debt and yearly \ndeficits slow economic growth, make wages stagnant, increase interest \ncosts, and can lead to inflation. All of these things hurt Social \nSecurity recipients by decreasing the amount of trust fund revenues and \ndecreasing the real value of the benefits paid from the fund. As the \nmammoth pile of debt increases, the Government comes under increasing \npressure and is less able to repay its debt to retirees unless it \nprints more money, which would drive inflation higher.\n  Balancing the budget is not a threat to Social Security, but a \nprotection of Social Security for our current retirees and future ones, \nand is a protection against economic chaos and Government disaster. Any \nexemption in the balanced budget amendment can and would be used to \navoid the strictures of the amendment and would be used to continue \nbusiness as usual with ever-spiraling debt.\n  As I have pointed out here in this debate, this exemption would take \nthe unprecedented step of writing a mere statute into the text of the \nConstitution and exempting that statute from the operation of the \nbalanced budget amendment. Such a step opens a loophole that Congress \ncan redefine in any way it wishes in the future. All the pressure of \nbalancing the budget would be focused on adding popular spending \nprograms into the Social Security system, endangering the primary \npurpose of Social Security and evading the balanced budget amendment. \nThis course risks devastating both Social Security and our Nation's \neconomy by allowing the dangerous spending spree to continue as it has \nin the past. Our growing national debt threatens the strength of our \nGovernment, our economy, and our Nation for future generations.\n  As we have pointed out in our balanced budget debt tracker, every day \nthat we have debated our budgetary deficit has grown from the $4.8 \ntrillion that we started with, at a rate of over $829 million a day. We \nare now on our 16th day since we started this particular debate, and we \nnow have a national debt that has increased $13,271,040,000 \n [[Page S2585]] just in the 16 days that have expired since we started \nthis debate.\n  Mr. President, the debt is the threat to Social Security. We need to \nenact a rule into the Constitution to end this process of spending our \nchildren's legacy and threatening our ability to meet our commitments \nto retirees by running up a mountain of debt that we may not be able to \nservice much longer. Let us reject all loopholes like this one offered \nby the Senator from Nevada, one which ironically could endanger the \nvery program the exemption proponents are attempting to save, and which \ncould gut the balanced budget amendment, our last best hope for setting \nthe Nation's fiscal house in order. Let us table the Reid amendment \nnow, and any others like it that may be offered hereafter.\n  Mr. President, may I ask the Chair how much time we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 45 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I spent a lot of time yesterday talking \nabout honoring honesty. It occurred to me, as I was driving home last \nnight, that no group better exemplifies those virtues than the \ngeneration now most dependent on the solvency of Social Security--that \nis, the Social Security trust fund--and that is the generation that \nfought and won World War II.\n  There are now events honoring those that fought and died and survived \nplaces like Iwo Jima. Yesterday, there were events that signified the \nfact that 50 years ago there were 2 days of intensive bombing in \nGermany. These grizzled veterans had a clear notion of right and wrong. \nThey were fighting to protect future generations against the tyranny \nover the minds and souls of man so dark and so bloody that it had to be \neradicated. They were fighting, Mr. President, for decency and for \nhonesty, for dignity and even honor. They were fighting not only for \nthemselves, but for their children and for unnumbered generations yet \nunborn.\n  Though there are a sprinkling yet of these heroes still serving, even \nin this Chamber, those victors of World War II have largely passed the \ntorch to new hands.\n  Are we, Mr. President, to let its light go dim when we pass it on to \nthe next generation? We bear--we Members of the U.S. Senate--the same \nresponsibility to those generations yet to come as we did and do to the \nheroes of that great conflict.\n  We are faced today with a decision of whether to abrogate moral \nresponsibility or to face it squarely and honor a promise we have made \nto the American people. If we fail to keep that promise, if we break \nour word, we have twice failed that generation of giants. We have \nthreatened their security in the years when the old soldier should be \nwarmed by the fireside and his widow comforted.\n  Even worse, I think, in the eyes of those heroes is we have also \nfailed to keep the commitment they made to those generations yet \nunborn: The promise of security for the old, the orphaned, and the \ninfirm.\n  If we fail to keep that promise, may we be forgiven, for I daresay \nthe American people have a very long memory. May we honor their \nmemories by our vote today, by protecting the Social Security trust \nfunds.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I sympathize with the amendment offered \nby Senator Reid. But, for several reasons, I am not going to support \nit.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that the benefits of current Social \nSecurity retirees are threatened by this amendment. For several very \ngood reasons, those benefits will be protected as we begin to move \ntoward a balanced budget.\n  It is important to remember that a balanced budget amendment will \nhave to be implemented by enabling legislation which specifies what \nspending reductions and revenue increases are to be made.\n  In developing such enabling legislation Social Security is certain to \nfare well. This is true for several reasons. The Social Security \nProgram has always enjoyed strong support in the Congress. The \npolitical power of increasing numbers of older people dependent on \nSocial Security will certainly help to protect the program.\n  It is also important to remember that the Social Security system is \ncurrently running large surpluses. I believe that the income to the \nretirement fund from the FICA taxes will exceed the amount needed to \npay beneficiaries this year by around $69 billion. So the Social \nSecurity Retirement Program is not part of our deficit problem.\n  Several existing statutory provisions also protect the Social \nSecurity Program. They establish a firewall around the program. They do \nso in the following ways:\n  Any legislation which worsens the actuarial balance of the Social \nSecurity trust funds is subject to a point of order requiring a three-\nfifths vote of the Senate to waive.\n  Section 310(g) of the Budget Control and Impoundment Act stipulates \nthat a point of order, requiring 60 votes to override, may be brought \nagainst any provision in a budget reconciliation bill pertaining to the \nOld Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Program established under \ntitle II of the Social Security Act.\n  This provision of the Budget Act makes it very difficult to alter the \nbenefit and tax structure of the Social Security Program. Essentially, \nit requires 60 votes, rather than a simple majority, to pass changes in \nthe Social Security Act program through reconciliation legislation.\n  Finally, the leadership of the House of Representatives and of the \nSenate has promised not to touch the Social Security Retirement Program \nfor at least 5 years.\n  Mr. President, I said that I did not believe that Social Security \nwould be the target of deficit reduction efforts and I said also that I \ndo think that that is necessary.\n  In the long run, however, the Social Security Retirement Program \nfaces a major imbalance between its own income and expenditures. And in \nthe long run, therefore, there will have to be changes made in Social \nSecurity. I think everyone understands that. A number of Senators who \nhave spoken in this debate in favor of the amendment to take Social \nSecurity out of the balanced budget amendment have acknowledged this \npoint.\n  The most recent reports of the board of trustees of the Social \nSecurity trust funds, released in April 1994, concluded that the trust \nfund faces longer range funding problems.\n  The trustees predicted that the disability part of the system would \nbecome insolvent in 1995. They expected the buildup in the retirement \npart of the system to peak in the year 2020, and then be drawn down as \nthe number of baby boomers drawing Social Security retirement increases \nrapidly after they begin to retire in the year 2010. The trustees \nestimated that the retirement fund would be exhausted by the year 2036.\n  Legislation enacted late last year will keep the disability trust \nfund solvent until the year 2015. With the enactment of that \nlegislation, the retirement fund begins to spend out more than it takes \nin in approximately 2013. According to recent estimates, that \nretirement fund will be completely exhausted in approximately 2030.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that excluding Social Security from \nthe balanced budget amendment is going to protect the program from very \ndifficult decisions in this longer range future I am describing.\n  After 2030, the non-Social Security operating accounts of the Federal \nGovernment could be in perfect balance. They would be required to be in \nbalance by the balanced budget amendment.\n  But the Social Security deficit after 2030 could grow to huge \nproportions as the gap increases between the income to the trust funds \nfrom the FICA taxes, and the benefits paid out to beneficiaries.\n  If those Social Security trust funds themselves face a large Social \nSecurity deficit, how are we going to pay the benefits due to the baby \nboomers and the generation X'ers who follow them?\n  We are not going to pay those benefits from the trust fund surpluses \nshown on the books of the Social Security Administration. A number of \nSenators have already noted that, given that we have been running a \nlarge deficit for some years, the Social Security \n [[Page S2586]]  surpluses have already been spent on the operating \nexpenses of the\n Federal Government. The trust fund balances will continue to be spent \nfor other Federal activities as long as we are running a deficit in the \noperating accounts of the Federal Government. This happens whether or \nnot Social Security is an independent agency. It happens whether or not \nSocial Security is displayed on-budget or off budget. It will happen \neven were we to accept this amendment to take Social Security out of \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n\n  This happens because the balances in the Social Security trust funds \nare held in the form of Treasury securities--loans to the Treasury in \nreturn for which the Treasury essentially issues IOU's to the Social \nSecurity Program. When the time comes for the Social Security \nAdministration to redeem those IOU's, the Treasury will have to find \nthe money to pay them.\n  Achieving a balanced budget at some point in the future will help \nreduce this drain on the Social Security trust funds. But by the time \nwe have arrived at that point we will already have spent on other \nFederal activities tens of billions of dollars from the Social Security \nfunds. Those funds are not going to be there when the Social Security \nAdministration goes to the Treasury to make good on the IOU's it holds.\n  Thus, when that time comes after the baby boomers begin to retire, we \nwill face some difficult choices. We will have to substantially raise \nSocial Security taxes. Or we will have to float massive new debt. Or we \nwill have to cut back on benefits.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that the Congress will act to guarantee \nthat the Social Security promise will be there for future generations. \nI am not able to say exactly how we will do that. But I remember back \nto the early 1980's when we had to form the National Commission on \nSocial Security reform to figure out how to save the system from \nbankruptcy. We saved the system then, and we will do whatever we have \nto do in the future to guarantee the integrity of the system.\n  When that time comes, I do not believe that having Social Security \nout of the balanced budget amendment will shield us from the need to do \none, or some combination, or those things--raise payroll taxes, float \nmore debt, or reduce benefits--in order to maintain the integrity of \nthe Social Security Program.\n  Mr. President, it is obvious that we cannot wait until the year 2030 \nuntil we begin to make changes in the Social Security Retirement \nProgram. The baby boomers begin to retire in the year 2010. Once they \nhave entered retirement, it will be difficult to make the chances that \nwill be required. It will be difficult both because it would be unfair \nto change the terms of retirement for people already retired, even \nthough the last Congress did just that when it raised the percentage of \nSocial Security benefit subject to the personal income tax for retirees \nabove a certain income level. And it will be difficult because the big \nbaby boom generation will resist changes in the program.\n  So, Mr. President, certainly not later than 10 years from now the \ncountry, and the Congress, is going to have to face the pressing need \nto make changes in the retirement program that will go into effect not \nlater than the year the baby boomers begin to retire. That is not a \nlong time in the development of public policy.\n  Mr. President, it is important to remember that large Federal \ndeficits threaten the Social Security Program. In fact, I do not think \nit is an exaggeration to say that they are the main threat to the \ncurrent, and especially the future, Social Security Program. Social \nSecurity benefits to retirees re drawn from the wealth of the society \ninto which they retire. Current and future economic health and \nprosperity are thus the first line of defense for the current and \nfuture Social Security Program.\n  Most economists believe that growing deficits result in lower \nproductivity and lower living standards. As real wages decline because \nof large Federal deficits, there will be increasing resistance to \npaying the taxes necessary to support the Social Security system. \nGrowing deficits also contribute to high interest rates and growing \nFederal interest payments for Federal debt. Such interest payments can \ncrowd out other spending, including spending for Social Security. \nCurrently, interest payments on the Federal debt are around $300 \nbillion per year.\n  It is very important that we begin to get a grip on our deficit \nspending habits and I think that passage of this balanced budget \namendment is the best way to do it.\n  I want to make one other point, Mr. President. And that is that we \nmust remember that we are considering an amendment to the Constitution \nof the United States. As a former member of the Constitution \nSubcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, I had ample opportunity to \nreflect on the Constitution. That document establishes the basic \nstructure of American Government. It does so with just a few thousand \nwords. Those words outline fundamental principles of our governmental \nsystem. They outline fundamental relationships between the branches of \nGovernment.\n  Surely it is inappropriate to include mention of any statute, even a \nstatute as important as the Social Security Act, in a document such as \nthe Constitution.\n  This is not a precedent we should establish. Once we have added \nmention of the Social Security Act, what other statutes will future \nCongresses be tempted to add--statutes which provide veterans benefits? \nStatutes which provide medical care to the elderly?\n  We should remember that a constitutional amendment should provide \ngeneral guidance on basic principles or concepts.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered by \nSenator Reid. The purpose of the amendment is basically sound--to \nprotect Social Security from budget cuts. Most of us support this.\n  However, in my view, the Reid amendment will likely fail to protect \nSocial Security as well as the intent of the balanced budget \namendment--to eliminate billions of dollars of annual deficits.\n  Right now, we fund Social Security and run up billions of dollars of \ndebt. What the American people want is to protect Social Security from \ncuts and to put an end to deficits. That is what we propose.\n  The American people are saying that $1.5 trillion in taxpayer dollars \nis enough. Spending 19 percent of national income on Government is \nenough. They want us to make it work.\n  But this amendment will have as its long-term effect funded Social \nSecurity and billions of dollars in annual budget deficits. This is \ntrue because although Social Security will have the political clout to \nremain a funding priority, the Social Security trust fund will begin to \nrun operating deficits in the year 2013 and will be completely \nexhausted in the year 2029. Thereafter, Social Security will run large \nannual budget deficits. While I am confident the Government will \ncontinue to make these transfer payments, I am equally certain we will \nnot pay these bills if Social Security is not contained within the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Furthermore, in the short term, this amendment will produce cuts in \nall other spending programs which will make the cuts opponents of the \nbalanced budget amendment have described as draconian, seem trivial.\n  For instance, many Senators who support the Reid amendment have \nwarned that in order to balance the budget by 2002--hold harmless \nnational defense, Social\n Security, and interest on the debt, and pay for the Contract With \nAmerica's tax cuts, all other Government spending programs would have \n  to be cut by 30 percent across the board.The irony is that the Reid \namendment would have the practical effect of forcing even deeper cuts \nin Government programs than those about which Senators on the other \nside have expressed concern.\n  Here is how this would occur. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the accumulated Social Security trust fund surpluses will total \n$636 billion from 1996 to 2002. If we were to remove that surplus from \nthe budget, the annual budget deficit will increase accordingly--and \nthe required reductions in spending would be much more than 30 percent \nif we must balance that portion of the budget not included in the Reid \namendment.\n   [[Page S2587]] At last Wednesday's Budget Committee hearing, I asked \nOffice of Management and Budget Director Alice Rivlin to give me a \nrough estimate about how much more spending would have to be cut in all \nother areas of the budget if we totally remove Social Security from the \nrest of the budget as this amendment suggests.\n  Dr. Rivlin told the committee that all other Government programs \nwould have to be reduced by 40 percent. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office and the Senate Budget Committee staff, spending would \nhave to be reduced across-the-board spending cuts between 40 and 50 \npercent.\n  In other words, the amendment will produce massive short-term budget \ndislocations and no long-term end to the red ink. Accordingly, I will \noppose it.\n  Mr. President, the simple fact is that today Social Security will be \nprotected from budget cuts because an overwhelming number of \nCongressmen and Senators will vote to protect it. It will be protected \nafter the balanced budget amendment is passed because that same group \nof Congressmen and Senators will vote to protect Social Security in the \nbalanced budget enabling legislation. And in the future, it will be \nprotected. This is because Social Security will always be able to \ncompete effectively as a budget priority, especially as the number of \nrecipients increases as a percentage of the electorate.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Reid amendment \nbecause it fails to protect both Social Security and the intent of the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, Social Security is without a doubt \nthe most important and the most successful program Government has \ncreated in the entire 20th century. We hear a great deal these days \nabout the Contract With America. With all due respect to the drafters \nof that document, I agree with Senator Byrd--the only contract I have \nwith America is the Constitution of the United States.\n  However, a close second to the Constitution is the Social Security \ncontract. Social Security represents a real contract with the American \npeople. It represents an almost sacred trust; and our job, as \nfiduciaries of that trust, is to act with prudence and responsibility, \nso that Social Security will be there when Americans need it.\n  The Social Security Act was signed into law by President Franklin D. \nRoosevelt on August 14, 1935. In 1934, in a speech outlining the \nobjectives of his administration, President Roosevelt stated that,\n\n       Our task of reconstruction does not require the creation of \n     new and strange values. It is rather the finding of the way \n     once more to known, but to some degree forgotten, ideals and \n     values. If the means and details are in some instances new, \n     the objectives are as permanent as human nature. Among our \n     objectives, I place the security of the men, women and \n     children of the Nation first.\n\n  Accordingly, President Roosevelt announced that he would be sending \nto Congress a proposal to ``Provide security against several of the \ngreat disturbing factors in life--especially those which relate to \nunemployment and old age.'' That proposal, of course, became what is \nnow our Social Security system. When signing the legislation into law, \nPresident Roosevelt noted:\n\n       We can never insure 100 percent of the population against \n     100 percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life, but we \n     have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of \n     protection to the average citizen and to his family against \n     the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age.\n\n  Sixty years after President Roosevelt uttered those words, his vision \nhas become reality. Social Security has helped millons of Americans \navoid living out their final years in destitution. In fact, there is \nprobably no other Federal program that has made such an extraordinary \ndifference in the lives of so many Americans.\n  As a result, Americans view Social Security as a binding commitment, \nvalid, and enforceable against the Federal Government. It has achieved \na special status, and is viewed with reverence by current \nbeneficiaries--and even by many baby boomers, who will be collecting \nSocial Security benefits much sooner than we like to think.\n  But the same is not true for those in our younger generations. As \nmany of you in this body know, I have a 17-year-old son, Matthew. I \nhave mentioned him often during the course of this debate, because the \nmost fundamental issue at stake in the balanced budget amendment \ndebate--whether the American dream will be alive and well for the next \ngeneration and beyond--is so critically important to Matt, and to the \nrest of his generation.\n  When you speak to people who are Matthew's age, one thing becomes \nclear. Young people today--members of the so-called generation X--have \nabsolutely no faith that Government will be there for them when they \nneed it, that it will help them enjoy retirement security, or \naffordable health care, or the opportunity to enjoy a higher standard \nof living than their parents had.\n  And why should they, Mr. President? Since my son was born in 1977, he \nhas never seen a balanced budget. He has no idea what it means to live \nunder a Federal Government that spends within its means. He has heard \npolitician after politician promise to balance the budget, yet has only \nseen the deficit skyrocket.\n  Our children have been told, time and time again, that a brighter day \nis just around the corner. They have been told that the Government will \nprovide for people--including them--in their old age. The Federal \nGovernment has told them, time and time again, to trust me. But our \nchildren are not stupid. They are every bit as informed and aware of \nthe political system, and how that system impacts on their lives, as we \nwere at their age. And the failure of politicians to face the facts and \nacknowledge the difficult choices we face--politicians who would prefer \nto sweep our fiscal problems under the rug to score points with current \nvoters, at the expense of future generations--has fueled a cynicism \nabout Government that grows deeper and deeper every day, \nnotwithstanding all our efforts to convince people that a brighter day \nis just around the corner.\n  The current debate surrounding Social Security--whether it should be \non or off budget; whether proposals to keep it off budget should be \nincluded in the text of the constitutional amendment itself, or instead \nbe dealt with in implementing legislation--only feeds public \nskepticism. I spoke the other day of my work on the Entitlement \nCommission. I believe that one of the most important messages delivered \nby that body was the warning that, if Social Security is to remain \nviable well into the next century--allowing it to ensure retirement \nsecurity for my son Matthew and beyond--there must be reform, Congress \nmust act. Indeed, according to the Social Security trustees, reform is \nthe only way to ensure that Social Security will be there for my son.\n  I realize that, anytime you mention Social Security reform, people \nget scared. But there is no reason to fear Social Security reform. \nReform will not lower, by even 1 penny, the amount of benefits \ncollected by any current Social Security recipients, or of anyone old \nenough to be thinking seriously about retirement. Indeed, if the \nchanges are to be viewed as legitimate, they must be known well in \nadvance. They must be long term ones, phased in gradually over time, \nwhen an opportunity for all Americans to fully participate in the \ndialog and debate over what form those changes should take. There are \nnumerous options for reform, but it would be wrong for this Congress to \nchoose any of them in advance of expensive\n consultation with the American people as to why reform is necessary, \n  and what the merits and problems each option for reform presents.Howev\ner, the bottom line is that this debate must take place, a bottom line \nthat is in no way affected by whether Social Security is kept on or off \nbudget. In the long run, it makes no difference. Without reform, we \nwill not be able to keep Social Security's promise to Matt and millions \nof other Americans.\n  We need to tell the American people the truth, Mr. President, about \nour budget problems generally, and about the need for long-term reform \nof Social Security specifically. The American people don't fear the \ntruth. Far from it. They want to know the truth, and I am confident, \nthat once they have it, they will want Congress and the President to do \nwhat the facts require--to act to keep Social Security secure for \nfuture generations and to restore real \n [[Page S2588]] budget discipline to the Federal Government.\n  Among the truths Americans have a right to know is this one: America \nis graying, due both to longer life expectancies and the aging of the \nbaby boomers. When the Social Security system was established, the \naverage life expectancy was 61 years; now, it is 76. This simple truth \nhas numerous implications. Social Security benefits are funded \nprimarily from payroll taxes on current workers. As our population \nages, and as the baby boom generation retires, there will be fewer \nworkers to support more retirees. While in 1990 there were almost five \nworkers for each retiree, in 2030, there will be less than three. What \nthat means is that, if current trends remain unchanged, the Social \nSecurity trust fund will begin to pay out more than it takes in by \n2012. By 2029, the fund will have exhausted all of its previously \naccumulated surpluses. In other words, without long-term reform, Social \nSecurity will not be able to fully meet the promises it has made.\n  Now, it is true that the long-term Social Security imbalance doesn't \nhave to be fixed today. But it is also true that the longer we wait, \nthe more unnecessary risk for future Social Security recipients we \ncreate. So we should act--now.\n  What we have before the Senate today, however, are not proposals for \nreform that will guarantee Social Security's long-term solvency. \nInstead, what we have is a proposal to constitutionally reform Social \nSecurity from the budget. Frankly, Mr. President, if I thought this \nproposal would make any difference at all to the long-term prospect for \nSocial Security--if it would make Social Security's future any more \nsecure at all--I would oppose any balanced budget constitutional \namendment that did not include it. More than that, I would filibuster \naround the clock to prevent the passage of any constitutional amendment \nthat did not contain the Social Security proposal now before us.\n  And I have to say that I strongly support the idea of taking Social \nSecurity out of the budget for purposes of helping the American people \nunderstand what our real budget problems are--and what it will take to \nsolve them.\n  The truth is, however, that this proposal has a short-term focus when \nour budget problems, and protecting Social Security's future, demand a \nlong-term solution. And the truth is that even adding a provision to \nthe Constitution to take Social Security out of the budget will not be \nable to accomplish that goal in anything other than in an accounting \nsense.\n  I share the view that decisions involving Social Security should be \nmade only for Social Security-related reasons. I do not think Congress \nshould ever make changes in Social Security to solve problems in other \nareas of the budget. Unfortunately, taking Social Security out of the \nbudget, even via constitutional amendment, cannot guarantee that. Only \nthe continued active involvement of the American people, only their \ncontinuing interest in keeping the Social Security compact intact, can \nguarantee that.\n  It is true that for the next 15 to 17 years, Social Security will be \nrunning a surplus--it will be taking in more than it spends. I agree \nthat the existence of these annual surpluses does make the consolidated \nbudget deficit look smaller in the relatively short-run. But that \nsurplus is a temporary phenomenon. After about 2012, Social Security \nwill be paying out more than it takes in. After that point, Social \nSecurity will be consuming its accumulated surplus.\n  The temporary or permanent nature of the surpluses perhaps would not \nbe important if it were actually possible to take Social Security \ncompletely out of the rest of the Federal Government. However, as long \nas the Social Security system buys Treasury bonds, it is not. The \nsimple truth is that taking Social Security off-budget won't raise or \nlower the amount of bonds the Treasury Department will have to issue \nbetween now and the year 2002--the date the balanced budget is supposed \nto be achieved--by even $1.\n  Right now, the Treasury Department is selling bonds to the public, \nboth here and abroad, and to the Social Security system.\nWhether Social Security is part of the budget or not, it will buy \nexactly the same amount of bonds. And that means that, whether Social \nSecurity is part of the budget or not, the Treasury Department will be \nselling exactly the same amount of bonds to the public--and it is the \namount of bond sales to the public that is the real measure of Federal \n  deficits in any given year.On the other hand, if by the year 2012, \nwhen the Social Security trust fund ceases to take in more money than \nit pays out, the Government will be required to pay off those Treasury \nbonds. Whether Social Security is part of the budget or not is \nirrelevant to the fact that the Treasury Department will have to find \nthe cash to pay off those bonds. And there are only three basic ways to \ndo that: issue new bonds to the public, thereby increasing Federal \ndeficits in those years, raising taxes by the amount necessary, or \ncutting spending on other programs by the amounts needed.\n  Talking Social Security out of the budget, therefore, does nothing to \nmake our long-term budget problems either better or worse. It does \nnothing to protect Social Security from the rest of the budget, because \nTreasury bond purchases and sales continue to bind Social Security \ntightly to the rest of the budget. And perhaps most importantly, it \ndoes nothing to protect the long-term future of Social Security.\n  After all, as we vote on the balanced budget amendment, we have to \nkeep our eyes on the prize. The point of this exercise is not simply to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002. The point is to ensure that the \nbudget stays balanced, not merely in 2002, but in each year thereafter. \nWithout taking the steps necessary to reform the Social Security \nsystem, it will be impossible to ensure the budget stays balanced.\n  Mr. President, I know it is not popular to talk about reforming the \nSocial Security system. But the people back in Illinois who sent me to \nthe Senate told me that it was important for politicians to level with \nthe American people. They told me it was important to stand up for what \nis right, to end the conspiracy of silence surrounding our Nation's \nfiscal programs--including long-term problems facing Social Security--\nand to end the practice of ignoring the facts that are staring us in \nthe face.\n  As I have said before, the American people are tired of the cynical \nmanipulations, the smoke and mirrors, that have been used to obscure \nour budget problems in the past. The people know that getting our \nfiscal house in order will not be easy, and certainly will not be \npainless, but the long-term consequences of not acting are far worse \nthan any short-term pain.\n  We have to take actions that will actually make a difference, instead \nof just making us feel good. We need to define the objectives that are \nimportant to us as a nation, then work to see how we can most \neffectively accomplish those objectives. On the issue of retirement \nsecurity, the American people have spoken loud and clear: there are \nfew, if any, goals as important to Americans. But deciding that the \nGovernment should provide old age security is only half the battle; in \norder to succeed, we need to continuously keep our eyes firmly fixed on \nthe future.\n  Mr. President, the other day when I spoke of why it was so important \nthat Congress act now on the balanced budget amendment, I pointed out \nthat the Federal deficit for the current fiscal year--estimated at $193 \nbillion--would not exist if the huge increases in our national debt run \nup during the 1980's had not occurred. This year, and next year, the \nbudget would be balanced if not for the reckless supply-side economics \nthat caused the deficit to balloon from its 1980 level of about $1 \ntrillion to its current level or more than $4.7 trillion. If we had \nacted in 1980 to tackle the deficit, rather than adopting programs that \nmerely fed its rapid growth, the problems we face today--in terms of \ndemographics, and the aging of the baby boomers--would seem much more \nmanageable.\n  We, therefore, need to acknowledge that not acting will not make our \nproblems go away. Our ability to guarantee retirement security for all \nAmericans will be much greater if we begin reform of the system now. We \nneed to face Social Security's long-term future not for any reason \nconnected to the rest of the budget, but to meet our responsibility to \nfuture generations of Social Security recipients. We cannot afford to \nlet \n [[Page S2589]] any distractions related to budgetary accounting keep \nus from acting on what is really important--keeping Social Security \nviable.\n  Because taking Social Security off budget does not help us keep the \npromise of Social Security alive for future generations, including my \nown son, I cannot support it. What I do support is keeping Social \nSecurity's contract with the American people. And keeping that \ncontract, by acting to protect the long-term integrity of the Social \nSecurity system, will help bring greater integrity to the Federal \nbudget generally--and that is a fringe benefit that will help every \nAmerican.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nrespond to the amendment introduced by my friend, the Senator from \nNevada, [Mr. Reid] and my other distinguished colleagues on this side.\n  Social Security, as well as Medicare, has been one of the more \nsuccessful government-run programs in the history of this country. \nEvery hard-working, taxpaying American participates in these programs--\nwe all have a vested interest in the Social Security program whether we \nare present or future beneficiaries.\n  As it stands now, Social Security is set up to go bankrupt in 2029. \nOnly a few years ago, the Social Security program was projected to go \nbroke in 2036.\n  I acknowledge the fact that Social Security may be on the caboose of \nthis balanced budget train because of its current surplus versus other \nmore problematic programs like Medicare and Medicaid, but this program \nis still connected to the budget as a whole.\n  This Senator believes Social Security is vital to a high quality of \nlife for all Americans. It is my belief that the Senators who are \noffering this amendment are doing so because they, too, believe Social \nSecurity is vital to our Nation.\n  There are indications that an exemption for Social Security is the \nonly way to get the balanced budget amendment through the Senate. As a \nsupporter of the balanced budget amendment, I hope that is not the \ncase. Even so, to keep one of the largest programs in the country out \nof the balanced budget discussion is fiscally irresponsible and wrong.\n  It is wrong because it would provide constitutional protection to a \nsingle statutory program--Social Security. The Constitution should not \nbe used for this purpose. There are sound reasons to consider ways to \nkeep Social Security solvent beyond 2029 in the coming years. Codifying \nSocial Security in the U.S. Constitution prevents Congress from \nconsidering anything that may in fact be intended to preserve Social \nSecurity for the future.\n  The Constitution is not the place to set budget priorities, nor to \nenshrine statutes passed by Congress. Congress can exempt Social \nSecurity through statute.\n  I would also ask why not, if Social Security, any other worthy \nprogram? The argument that Americans have paid into Social Security and \nshould not be denied getting those benefits rings hollow when we all \nknow for a fact that a majority of current and past retirees are \nreceiving or will receive far more in benefits than what they paid into \nSocial Security plus interest.\n  Americans also pay into a variety of very good and worthy programs as \nwell, in the form of taxes. Should those worthy programs also be \nexempted using that kind of argument?\n  Keep in mind that the balanced budget amendment does not specify \nwhere the cuts will take place. This language only forces Congress to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002. Year after year, Congress will \nhave the authority, should this measure pass, to choose what cuts will \ncome from what programs.\n  Social Security would not necessarily have to be cut. This hype we \nare getting about how necessary it is to have a Social Security \nexemption in order to preserve benefits is driven by powerful lobbying \ngroups and is unjustified. You and I know that Congress will not vote \nto cut Social Security benefits to those who need those benefits.\n  There may be trimmings of benefits for the wealthiest of Americans, \nbut we are not about to vote to deny benefits to the millions of \nAmericans who rely on Social Security as their only source of \nretirement income. So a constitutional exemption is not necessary.\n  To prioritize which program or programs are worthy of exemption in \nthe balanced budget amendment will only chip away, piece by piece, the \nvalue of a balanced budget amendment and pit one program against \nanother.\n  Let me take just a few more minutes and read to you a couple letters \nI have received this month from Coloradoans regarding the treatment of \nSocial Security and Medicare, the two largest entitlement programs in \nour Federal budget. Take for example, Donald Kynion, from Walsenburg, \nCO, who says:\n\n       I feel you should do what is best for the country. If \n     changes in Social Security and Medicare are necessary then \n     make them. Cut spending and too much government!\n\n  Or listen to 72-year-old Edith Seppi from Leadville, CO, who says:\n\n       I hope you will be fair to all Americans and pass \n     legislation that will cut the debt, even if we all must be a \n     part of the cuts. I hope interest groups will not control the \n     decisions you make. I hope you do what you believe is best \n     for our country. So, count me in on the side that says do the \n     best that you can.\n\n  Doing the best that we can, is not allowing certain privileged \nprograms to be exempt from this difficult task of balancing our budget.\n  If a family was forced to balance their budget for the month, could \nthey be successful by omitting their mortgage payments? Where should \nthis family then get the money to make this payment?\nWhere then should Congress find the funds to pay the baby boomers when \n  they retire?I beg my colleagues not to exempt any program, no matter \nhow successful or useful it is to us, from the balanced budget \namendment. If we are forced to balance the budget, all programs on this \ntrain, whether they are Medicare, veteran's pensions, unemployment \ncompensation, SSI, and Social Security, will have a chance for a better \ntomorrow if we balance our budget today.\n  The balanced budget amendment gives this country hope for a better \nquality of life further down the tracks. Let us not derail this effort.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, for years now, from the first time this \namendment to balance the budget came before us, several of its features \nhave caused me concern.\n  In addition to the constitutional issues involved in how we will \nenforce a balanced budget, and the lack of any provision for long-term \ninvestments, I have been most concerned by the inclusion of the social \nsecurity trust fund in the budget that House Joint Resolution 1 \nrequires to be in balance each year.\n  Those concerns have been the grounds not only for my statements here \non the Senate floor, in the Judiciary Committee, and elsewhere, but \nalso for my votes in the last two sessions of Congress.\n  Last year, I voted for a constitutional balanced budget amendment, \none that excluded Social Security from budget calculations.\n  Back in my State of Delaware, my constituents share my concern about \nthe Social Security trust fund, so when I raise that issue here I am \nspeaking about their worries as well as my own.\n  Social Security is a unique program with a unique impact on our \nbudget. That is why we voted, 98 to 2, to take it offbudget in 1990.\n  Here on the Senator floor, Senator Reid and Senator Feinstein have \nshown us the exact language with which we took Social Security \noffbudget in the 1990 budget agreement.\n  By the way, Mr. President, we all owe them our gratitude for raising \nthis issue, and for leading the defense of Social Security here on the \nfloor.\n  That 1990 agreement was made between the bipartisan leadership of \nCongress and President Bush.\n  We took that step for a very good reason, Mr. President. We were \nundertaking significant budget reforms and deficit reduction, and \nconcluded that the most honest bookkeeping procedure would be to keep \nthe Social Security trust fund out of the calculations of the annual \nbudget.\n  I see no reason to reverse that decision now, particularly in light \nof its effects on future deficits, and certainly not in the \nConstitution.\n  [[Page S2590]] The Social Security trust fund holds a unique position \nin our political system, and it deserves special consideration as we \nset a course for the Federal budget that could last for the next 200 \nyears.\n  The Social Security system has been the very symbol of the National \nGovernment's promise to provide a safety net under those who \ncontributed to the trust fund, and by, extension, to this country's \nprosperity.\n  Ironically, that same system that has been for so many years a symbol \nof a promise made and a promise kept is now seen by the generation just \nmoving into the work force--the generation of my sons and, in a few \nyears, my daughter--as a symbol of the Federal Government's duplicity \nand irresponsibility.\n  We have all heard that humorous opinion poll finding, that more young \npeople today believe in UFO's than believe that the Social Security \nsystem will be there for them when they need it.\n  That might be funny, Mr. President, if it were not such a sad \ncommentary on the attitude of our young people about our Government \nmore generally.\n  Of all the harm our inability to manage our finances has caused, that \nmay be the most damaging--the declining faith in our Government's \nability, even willingness, to keep its word.\n  There are of course many reasons for the cynicism of our young \npeople, which is just part of a wider national disaffection.\n  But at the top of anyone's list of reasons must be the perception \nthat Social Security--the symbol of a responsive Government for my \nparents' generation--has become for my children's generation the symbol \nof a Government that takes from the unorganized and gives to the people \nwith the best lobbyists.\n  For my parents' generation, Social Security is symbol of a Government \nguarantee of a secure future; for my children's generation, it is a \nsymbol of why they are increasingly insecure about the future.\n  I'm afraid, Mr. President, that keeping Social Security in the \nbudget--by constitutional mandate, no less--we may well prove those \nskeptics right.\n  Let there be no mistake, Mr. President, the money in the Social \nSecurity surplus--$69 billion this year alone, and it will accumulate \nto nearly $3 trillion by the year 2020--will be far too tempting for us \nif we are to be bound by the Constitution to balance our budgets.\n  Those funds could be used to ease a lot of short-term pain as we face \nthe major budget choices needed to lower our deficits.\n  It is precisely because we do not trust ourselves or future \nCongresses to write responsible budgets that we are considering this \nbalanced budget amendment right now.\n  If we leave an extra $3 trillion on the table do we really expect \nthat we will leave Social Security alone?\n  This fiscal year, we will have the benefit of a $69 billion Social \nSecurity surplus, that under the terms of the balanced budget \namendment, we would be constitutionally allowed to use to make the \ndeficit in the rest of the Government's operations look smaller.\n  By the year 2002, that Social Security surplus will be $111 billion. \nEvery year thereafter, the annual surplus will grow, as it should, to \ncover the future obligations of the Federal Government to Social \nSecurity beneficiaries.\n  And therefore, every year the task of balancing the budget to meet \nthe requirements of the balanced budget amendment will be that much \neasier. At least, Mr. President, for the short term.\n  Mr. President, by the very logic that led to this debate today, we \nwill use that money to delay those tough choices for future decades.\n  If we lack the will to do the right thing about our deficits without \na constitutional requirement, why should we be trusted to leave Social \nSecurity alone if its surpluses will help us avoid some of the \npolitical pain of complying with the Constitution?\n  The Social Security system is not the cause of today's deficit \nproblem; it should not be made the short-term solution for those \nproblems, either.\n  That is why we should protect Social Security by accepting the Reid \namendment.\n  To be sure, the system faces its own imbalances--even monumental \ndeficits--all too soon, when the baby boomers retire.\n  At that time, the Social Security system will begin a freefall into \ndeficits that will eventually swamp the rest of the Federal budget in \nred ink.\n  At that time, our problem will be the reverse of the short-term \ntemptation to use the current surplus to mask the cuts needed to get \nthe rest of the budget into balance.\n  When the Social Security trust fund heads south, when its surplus \nbecomes an increasing deficit, we will then be scrambling to find ways \nto cut the rest of the budget to accommodate the requirements of the \nConstitution.\n  The Social Security balances will accumulate surpluses up to roughly \n2020, when the whole system just falls right off the table, as we spend \nout at a rapid rate to meet obligations to an increasing number of \nretiring baby boomers who will be supported by a declining number of \nworkers.\n  The Social Security system's financial problems are driven by a \nnumber of factors, some of which we can control. But there is one \nfactor that will always be beyond our control.\n  Demographic trends--the most famous of which we call the baby boom--\nwill determine how many beneficiaries will be receiving benefits from \nthe system and how many workers will be paying their payroll taxes into \nthe system.\n  The Social Security system--no matter how well our policies are \ndesigned--cannot be balanced on an annual basis but must be balanced \nover decades, even over generations.\n  Therefore, unless we do away with Social Security all together, the \nbalanced budget amendment will mix--in the constitutional definition of \nthe budget--programs with very different balances.\n  I might add that is the same problem we will have if we neglect to \nprovide for a capital budget, a way of carrying the cost of long-term \nassets on our books without having to count them as a current expense.\n  By attempting to lump every kind of activity into a single definition \nof the budget, the balanced budget amendment ignores the kinds of \ndistinctions we all make in our daily lives.\n  Mr. President, we all distinguish between our savings accounts, our \nmortgage payments, and our monthly checkbook balances.\n  We do not count our savings account balances--or the balances in our \nretirement accounts--when we balance our checkbooks every month. In the \nreal world, it wouldn't do us any good anyway--we would still have to \npay our bills.\n  Unless we intend to use that retirement account to pay our current \nmonthly bills, that retirement account should not even be considered \nwhen we balance our checkbooks.\n  Unless we intend to use the Social Security surplus to cover annual \noperating expenses, Mr. President, there is no reason to keep the \nSocial Security trust funds in the constitutional definition of our \nannual budget.\n  No one here would deny that Social Security needs fixing on its own \nterms. And, Mr. President, we all know that we will never give it the \nattention it needs if we are able to hide behind a constitutional \ndefinition of the budget that uses the surplus to mask the true extent \nof the deficit in the rest of the Government's operations.\n  I for one don't for a minute think that those choices--how to cut the \ndeficit--will be made easier if we hold the system apart from the rest \nof the Federal budget.\n  They will not be made more easily if we accept this amendment, Mr. \nPresident, but they will be made more honestly.\n  Those tough choices should not be tangled up with the solution for \nother budget issues not caused by the Social Security system.\n  The Reid amendment will preserve the Social Security system's unique \nplace in our laws, and will permit us to address its very real problems \non their own merits.\n  That is, after all, only what the opponents of the Reid amendment say \nthey want, too--to keep Social Security off the table when we start the \ncutting that will be required to comply with the balanced budget \namendment.\n  If that's what they want, then let them join us in taking it off the \ntable now.\n  [[Page S2591]] Surely, they cannot argue that Senator Dole's \namendment that we accepted earlier provides the protection that Social \nSecurity needs and deserves.\n  As Senators Hollings and Heflin have conclusively argued, once the \nSocial Security system is included in the constitutional definition of \nthe Federal budget, no mere statute or statement of this Congress' \nintention will prevent future Congresses from using the Social Security \nsurpluses to comply with the balanced budget requirement.\n  So we can talk all we want about what we would do, or what we expect \nfuture Congresses to do. The Reid amendment takes care of this problem \nat its roots, in the Constitution.\n  Even with Senator Dole's amendment, the temptation to use these \nfunds--and the equally distressing prospect of saddling ourselves with \nthose future deficits--will always be there.\n  Even now, Mr. President, despite the apparently bipartisan chant that \nwe should keep our hands off of Social Security, there are other voices \nout there that we should be aware of, too.\n  The new Speaker of the House, in his opening address on January 4, \nreferring to the balanced budget amendment, said, and I quote, ``I \nthink Social Security should be off limits, at least for the first 4 to \n6 years, because I think it will just destroy us if we bring it into \nthe game.''\n  And the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, during hearings on \nthe balanced budget amendment, said that failure to include the assets \nof the Social Security system ``would require us to make spending cuts \nmore sweeping than currently contemplated.''\n  In other words, the House chairman intends that those funds be \navailable to make the transition to a balanced budget easier--to cover \nthe deficit in the rest of the budget with the assets set aside for \nfuture Social Security beneficiaries.\n  It is statements like that, Mr. President, that make me more than a \nlittle concerned about the future of Social Security, especially now \nthat the majority has rejected our call for a specific plan to bring \nour budget into balance.\n  Having failed to get any specifics about a plan to get us to a \nbalanced budget, we are now asking a much narrower, more focused, and \neasier question: ``Will you leave Social Security out of the \nconstitutional definition of a balanced budget?''\n  Mr. President, that is all that Senator Reid's amendment calls for--\nan honest accounting of one very important program. It calls for an \nhonest accounting of how we will deal with the Social Security system.\n  Those of us who want an honest accounting will vote for this \namendment. I cannot understand why anyone would vote against it.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise today to announce my support for the \nReid amendment to the constitutional balanced budget amendment. This \namendment proposes to exempt explicitly Social Security from the \nconstitutional balanced budget amendment.\n  I support the Reid amendment for one fundamental reason. Its passage \nwould promote truth in budgeting to the American people. For the past \n10 years, the surplus from the Social Security trust fund has been used \nto mask the size of the annual Federal deficit. Instead of being saved \nor invested to pay for the retirement of the baby boom generation in \nthe next century, the surplus is being borrowed and used to pay for \ngeneral fund obligations. Its use in this fashion understates the \nannual deficit by $70 billion in fiscal year 1995, and this amount will \nkeep increasing each year between now and 2002, at which point the \ngeneral fund will have borrowed $1 trillion from the Social Security \ntrust fund. Over the next 7 years, the general fund will borrow and \nspend over $630 billion from the Social Security trust fund. I oppose \nthe use of these surpluses in this fashion. I believe we are setting a \nfiscal time bomb for the next generation.\n  I understand well why many of my colleagues oppose the Reid \namendment. Its passage would make the job of balancing the budget, a \ngoal I support with or without the constitutional balanced budget \namendment, more difficult. Under current projections, over $1 trillion \nin deficit reduction will have to be found over the next 7 years to \nbring the budget in balance by 2002. Not being able to use the Social \nSecurity trust fund surplus would require an additional $110 billion in \ndeficit reduction in the year 2002 in order to balance the budget that \nyear.\n  Budget cuts of this magnitude cannot be made painlessly, although \nthere is a continuing search for such painless methods in order to \navoid facing the tough decisions. Realistically, I think the passage of \nthis amendment would mean also that the time frame for balancing the \nbudget would have to be extended, probably by about 3 years.\n  There are some who are promoting the Reid amendment as an effort to \navoid all tough decisions on Social Security and to pretend that the \nsystem can remain unchanged. I dissent from this view. We must dispel \nthe notion that everything is well with the Social Security trust fund. \nThe important findings of the Kerrey-Danforth Bipartisan Commission on \nEntitlement and Tax Reform clearly spelled out the demographic and \nfiscal challenges\n which confront the Social Security system. Thirty years ago, there \nwere four workers for every Social Security beneficiary. Today, there \nare only three. Thirty years from now, there will be only two. If we do \nnothing, we know what awaits us. In 2013, receipts from payroll taxes \nwill no longer pay for Social Security benefits. And their news gets \neven worse--in 2029, if no changes are made, the Social Security system \nwill be insolvent.\n\n  Some who support this amendment view it as rendering Social Security \nuntouchable. I not only disagree with this interpretation; I believe \nthat considering Social Security untouchable will bring about the long-\nterm insolvency of the Social Security program.\n  My reasons for voting for the Reid amendment are simple. I believe \nthat we are courting fiscal disaster by continuing to use social \nSecurity surpluses for general funding programs--in effect putting \nIOU's from the general fund into the Social Security trust fund for \nthese borrowed funds.\n  According to the Social Security Board of Actuaries, by the year \n2013, when payroll tax receipts will no longer cover the cost of Social \nSecurity benefit payments, the general fund--the taxpayers of America--\nwill owe the Social Security trust fund over $2.5 trillion.\n  This means that when the demographics turn around in 2013, the \ngeneral fund will have to begin paying back the Social Security trust \nfund. At this point, the Social Security trust fund will remain \nsolvent, but the general funds will be under severe pressure because of \nthe debt which must be repaid each year.\n  The dilemma is that for the next 18 years, based on current \nprojections, excluding Social Security from the constitutional balanced \nbudget requirement will require a tighter fiscal policy and more \nefforts to balance the budget. Once the Social Security trust fund \nbegins running a deficit, the exclusion will make fiscal policy less \nstringent.\n  I believe that we must begin to realize that we are mortgaging the \nfuture for the taxpayers in years ahead unless we balance the budget \nwithout using the Social Security trust fund surpluses. These surpluses \nshould be invested in outside activities beyond the reach of the \nFederal Government, so that we will no longer borrow these surpluses \nand mask the true fiscal picture.\n  One of the three central findings of the Strengthening of America \nCommission, which I cochaired with Senator Domenici, was the need to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002 without using the\nSocial Security surplus. The Commission did not advocate a adoption of \na balanced budget amendment, but the balanced budget amendment we have \nbefore us, as amended by the Reid amendment, would be consistent with \nthe recommendations of our Commission: balancing the budget by the year \n2002 without using the Social Security surplus. Our Commission, \nhowever, believed that getting to a real balance without using the \n  Social Security surplus would require 10 years rather than 7.I \nbelieve solutions for Social Security's long-term problems can be found \nand enacted in a fashion which will \n [[Page S2592]] preclude cuts in benefits for current retirees or those \nabout to retire, and provide for the long-term fiscal soundness of the \nSocial Security system. But if we ignore the long-term challenges \nfacing the Social Security system, its future is at risk.\n  I think it is important to note that the Reid amendment does not make \nSocial Security a constitutionally protected benefit. It merely \nexcludes it from the calculations under this amendment. The challenge \nof finding a way to keep the Social Security program solvent into the \n21st century remains, with or without the Reid amendment. Indeed, even \na constitutional amendment that did purport to guarantee Social \nSecurity benefits would be futile. The only guarantee that future \nbenefits can be paid is future economic growth. No amendment can \nguarantee people a slice of a pie that does not exist.\n  I do not view this amendment as a vote to make a particular \nGovernment benefit program a constitutional right. I certainly do not \nview it as the first step in an effort to place one program after \nanother outside the bounds of the budget process, exempt from scrutiny. \nSocial Security is a unique program with a unique demographic and \nfinancial situation. It has a large surplus today, and it will have \neven larger deficits in the future. My vote for the Reid amendment is \nin recognition of the fact that we need two solutions: a long-term \nsolution for Social Security, and a long-term solution for the rest of \nthe Federal budget.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we have had a good debate on this amendment, \nas we promised the distinguished Senator from Nevada we would have.\n  I do believe now we have come to a point where we would like to \nconclude action on this very important legislation this week. We have \nbeen on it now, this is the 11th day, as I calculate. And I hope, I \nthink, the votes are there. Or they are not there. The 67 votes are \nthere or they are not there.\n  I think there is broad bipartisan support for protecting Social \nSecurity, though I must say, personally, sometime--the Entitlements \nCommission pointed out earlier--we will have to face up to some of \nthese issues. Senator Danforth and Senator Kerrey issued a report last \nDecember. But I think for the moment, everybody is willing to protect \nSocial Security. We voted 83 to 16 to adopt a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment stating we should not raise Social Security or cut Social \nSecurity benefits in order to balance the budget.\n  On Friday, we adopted a motion reaffirming that commitment by a vote \nof 87 to 10. We will be putting forward--and in fact, Senator Domenici \nis working on it right now--a 5-year plan to put the budget on a path \nto balance by 2002.\n  Our plan will not raise taxes. Our plan will not touch Social \nSecurity. Everything else, every Federal program, from Amtrak to zebra \nmussel research, will be on the table, including agriculture, which \ntalk show hosts always ask me about, since I am from Kansas. Everything \nwill be on the table.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote to table the \nReid amendment.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the Reid amendment. I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on House Joint \n     Resolution 1, the constitutional balanced budget amendment:\n         Bob Dole, Orrin G.

Mr. President, we have had, I think, now 10 or 11 days of \ndebate. Nobody has been crowded. Everybody has been given all the time \nthey need.\n  It seems to me, if we are going to continue with our work in the \nSenate--we have a number of matters we would like to bring up--we need \nto come to a vote one way or the other, a final vote on the balanced \nbudget amendment. Knowing it takes 67 votes, and knowing there is \nbipartisan support, we have tried to approach it on that basis. I \ncongratulate the Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch, and others, Senator \nSimon and others who have been debating some of the very important \nissues--including Senator Reid who has just completed I think 3 days of \ndebate on an amendment.\n  What we would like to do--obviously we want to finish action on this \nmeasure by Thursday evening, this Thursday evening, if at all possible. \nThat will be our intent. If not, we will come back on next Wednesday \nand finish it next week. I do not believe anybody--there was some \nmisunderstanding on unfunded mandates. We thought we understood what \nwas happening but then there was this big flap about there was not any \ncommittee report, even though \n [[Page S2593]] we thought we had it understood if it would be printed \nin the Record that would satisfy concerns. So in this case it was the \nintention of the leadership on this side to make certain that would not \nhappen. We did not want any misunderstanding. We wanted to protect \nevery Member's rights.\n  Hopefully we have done that. Some just do not want the balanced \nbudget to ever pass. They could care less if we ever vote on anything \nas long as we are eating up time. But we have the line-item veto, we \nhave other measures that we would like to take up. So I hope, if the \nSenator from California intends to offer an amendment, we can get a \ntime agreement. If not, we will have no recourse but to move to table \namendments from here on to try to bring this matter to a conclusion. I \nthink we have spent ample time. Some people have criticized us for \nspending too much time. I hope we could have some agreement to bring \nthis matter to a conclusion by Thursday evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the majority leader is certainly within \nhis rights to offer the cloture motion. We understand his reasons for \ndoing so. But I must say I am disappointed that he has seen the need to \ndo so this soon. This is not just another bill. This is not just \nanother amendment. This is a proposal to amend the Constitution of the \nUnited States for the first time in 200 years to directly affect the \nfiscal policy of this country.\n  We have only had the opportunity thus far to offer two amendments. As \nI have watched the debate I have been very pleased with the \nextraordinary participation on both sides on both issues. We debated \nthe right to know for several days. We had a good vote. Unfortunately \nwe did not get any Republican support for the effort to propose the \nright to know.\n  We then had a very good debate on the Social Security amendment that \nhas just been completed. Again we had very little Republican support. \nBut we have only had those two amendments, two very significant \namendments. We have amendments relating to capital budgeting, \nadditional amendments relating to natural disasters--issues that have a \nvery consequential effect on how ultimately this amendment may be \nproposed to the Constitution. I certainly hope we could hold off on \ncloture votes and some effort to curtail debate, given the consequence \nof this amendment, given the legitimate concerns expressed, I think, by \npeople on this side of the aisle with regard to just what ought to be a \nconstitutional amendment on balancing the budget.\n  So I urge the leader, with all of the concerns he has with \nscheduling--legitimate as they are--to give us an opportunity to have \nthe debate that this amendment deserves. As I say, we will debate a lot \nof issues in this session of Congress relating to virtually everything. \nBut to have a debate longer on unfunded mandates or on congressional \ncoverage than we have on a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget would certainly not serve the country and not serve this body.\n  I certainly hope we can continue to have the kind of debate we have \nhad, now, for several good days on issues that are of direct concern to \nthe American people and certainly affecting the people in this body as \nwe continue to come to some conclusion on this amendment itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am advised this is the 12th day, not the \n11th day. I stand corrected. It will be 3 weeks Thursday we have been \non this. I think we have spent far too much time on congressional \ncoverage and unfunded mandates. It took 1 hour and 20 minutes in the \nHouse, we spent at least a week on congressional coverage. Unfunded \nmandates, we had people extending debate when they were for unfunded \nmandates. It passed 86 to 10. You kind of wonder what all the fuss was \nabout. That took a couple of weeks. Now we are in almost 3 weeks on the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  What it will mean is we will not have any recesses this year. I can \nsay very clearly, we can eat up all the time we want but it is going to \ncome out of the calendar. It is not going to come out of anything else. \nIf that is the wish of the membership--my view is we get paid for being \nhere every day and we will be here every day. You can count on that, as \nI think one ad used to say, if we cannot move this legislation.\n  People are opposed to this amendment. They do not care if they talk \nfor a week. They do not care how long they talk if they think they can \nkill the amendment and frustrate those who are for it on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  This is a bipartisan effort. I have not gone back to check to see the \nlength of debates we have had in previous years on this amendment, but \nI doubt it has taken any more time or as much time as we have spent \nnow.\n  So I would just say to the Democratic leader, I certainly understand \nthe need for full debate. But I am prepared now to have a time \nagreement, if there is going to be an amendment by the Senator from \nCalifornia, for 2 hours for the Senator from California, 30 minutes on \nthis side, and then have the vote.\n  If not, we will just have to move to table at the earliest possible \ntime and that time will come sometime today or sometime during the \nnight. So I hope we can work it out. Those who are opposed to the \nbalanced budget amendment, we know they do not want to do anything but \nto frustrate the efforts of a clear majority in this body, hopefully 67 \nor more, who support the amendment.\n  So I ask the Senator from California if she intends to offer an \namendment, and if so, if she is prepared to enter into a time \nagreement?\n  Mrs. BOXER. If we could have a quorum call then perhaps we can \ndiscuss it?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and thank my \ncolleagues, Senator Dorgan and Senator Boxer, for agreeing to a brief \ncomment by me and also a brief discussion with the manager of the bill, \nthe senior Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch.\n  I favor the balanced budget amendment and have on three votes since I \nhave been in the U.S. Senate in the past 14 years. I think it is very \nimportant that the Government of the United States live within its \nmeans, just as every other government has to--the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania and every county in my State, every city and every other \nState in the Union, just as we must all do so as individual citizens. \nBut I have a considerable problem with the amendment which we just \nvoted on where I voted in favor of excluding Social Security from the \ncomputation.\n  Although I know my vote was on the losing side I wanted to express \nmyself briefly on the subject and perhaps have a comment or two with \nSenator Hatch.\n  I have consistently voted to exclude Social Security from a \nconstitutional amendment, going back to a vote on July 29, 1982, August \n4, 1982, March 12, 1986, and March 1, 1994. I have also voted to keep \nSocial Security off budget, a subject which was explained by my late \ncolleague, the distinguished Senator John Heinz.\n  The concerns that I have are when we have a trust fund established \nfor a specific purpose and specific contributions as a very basic \nprinciple of law, those funds ought to be used for no other purpose. \nAnd when the Secretary of the Treasury, James Baker, invaded the trust \nfund, I took the floor and said that, if this were a matter within the \njurisdiction of the district attorney's office when I was district \nattorney of Philadelphia, this would be an appropriate matter for \ncriminal prosecution because it is fraudulent conversion. You have a \ntrust fund established for a specific purpose and when that purpose is \nviolated by having the funds used for something else it is in fact a \nfraudulent conversion.\n  When we have a balanced budget amendment, I think it is very \nimportant that we not spend more than we take in. It is not truth in \naccounting where you have other funds, a trust fund like Social \nSecurity, figured into the accounting process, or we have the \naccounting processes on other trust funds, such as the airport trust \nfund \n [[Page S2594]] and the highway trust fund where again, in my judgment, \nthey ought not to be used in the computation of the balancing of our \nbudget. Those are not funds for general revenue purposes. They ought \nnot to be taken into consideration because they are set up for a \nspecific purpose, like Social Security, the highway trust fund or the \nairport trust fund. I believe there is a very, very basic fundamental \nprinciple of law of such a nature that I would put it in the \nconstitutional amendment recognizing the very high level of legal \nprocedure which is embodied in a constitutional amendment.\n  I thank my colleague from Utah for being willing to have a brief \ndiscussion. The essence of my question to Senator Hatch is, is it not \ntrue that under the law the Social Security trust fund is set up for a \nspecific purpose, to receive revenues, contributions made by citizens, \ncontributions made by employees and employers for the specific purpose \nof paying benefits to those employees when they have reached the \neligibility status at age 62 or 65, or whenever?\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from Utah agree with me that the truth \nin accounting to have a balanced budget would be that we ought to \ncalculate the revenues, the taxes which the U.S. Government receives \nand deduct from that the expenses of the U.S. Government without \nincluding the artificial raising of the revenues which are Social \nSecurity revenues, or for that matter even the highway trust fund or \nthe airport trust fund?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would agree with the Senator--certainly as to the Social \nSecurity trust fund--as does the Senate. We voted last week 87 to 10 to \ndirect the Budget Committee to find ways of balancing the budget \nwithout touching Social Security.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague for that answer. I appreciate the \nvote we had last week. I supported the amendment by the distinguished \nmajority leader, Senator Dole, to have that direction. But my followup \nquestion is: Is there any assurance that that direction will be carried \nout?\n  Mr. HATCH. There is assurance by the vote on the unfunded mandates \nbill concerning a resolution to this effect, which Members are on \nrecord as favoring overwhelmingly; and, the vote last week on the Dole \nmotion to refer to the Budget Committee which was also overwhelmingly \nsupported by both sides of the aisle; and the assurance that has been \nmade on the floor by many that the implementing legislation will also \nwork to establish what the distinguished Senator would like to have \nestablished, which is the protection of the Social Security trust fund.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague for that answer. When it comes to \nthe unfunded mandates, I would suggest that is a significantly \ndifferent category.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield so I may add a little bit more.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I so yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. Nothing under the balanced budget amendment will keep us \nfrom segregating accounts or running a surplus equal to or exceeding \nthe value of the trust fund surplus. We have other trust funds like the \ncrime trust fund, the highway trust fund, as the Senator has mentioned, \nand things can and will continue on as they have in the past; that is, \nwe protect Social Security as we have always wanted to do, and I \nbelieve will do. So the amendment does not stop us from doing it as we \nhave done in the past.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree with my colleague that it does not stop us from \ndoing that, but the concern I have is that it does not tell us to do \nthat.\n  Mr. HATCH. It does not; it does not require us to make any changes in \nthe protections Social Security now enjoys.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask the distinguished Senator from Utah one other \nquestion about a field that I have had perhaps more experience than \nsome, having been a district attorney for Philadelphia for 8 years.\n  Would my colleague agree with me that on the general principle of law \nwhere you have a trust fund set up for a specific purpose, such as \ncontributions and specific beneficiaries, that if someone takes money \nfrom that trust fund for a purpose other than specified it is in fact a \nfraudulent conversion?\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree generally, except the Government is doing that \nevery day as they give IOU's to the Social Security trust fund and take \nthe money and use it for other expenditures in the Government; that is \nthe law, and that is how the trust funds are dealt with under current \nlaw: the trust fund loans money to the Treasury in return for Treasury \nbonds. But I think the Senator makes a good point. I do not know \nwhether we should call it fraudulent conversion as such. But I think we \ncan certainly call it a fraud on the taxpayers to take moneys out of \nthe Social Security trust fund that are dedicated to those who have \npaid into the trust fund on a monthly basis, and dedicated to those who \ndeserve those funds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would accept my colleague's statement that it is a \nfraud on the taxpayers which is about the same thing as a fraudulent \nconversion, which I think is the technical term.\n  Mr. HATCH. The technical term would be a fraudulent conversion.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That would be a fraudulent conversion.\n  I find it is of great interest that my friend from Utah said except \nthat Government does it every day, a multitime offender. It is not a 3-\ntime loser or 33-time loser. It is a 33,000-time loser, maybe a 33 \nmillion-time loser, or 33 billion-time loser. That is the concern I \nhave.\n  I have a very deep concern that there is not truth in accounting \nwhen, instead of taking our revenues and expenditures to balance the \nbudget, we add other funds which are set up as a trust fund. It seems \nto me that this is such a very basic principle of law, trust law, \ncriminal law, that it is worth embodying in the Constitution.\n  And then, of course, you have the concerns which the senior citizens \nof America talk about; whether they are being treated fairly and \nwhether their trust funds are being segregated so that they will have \nfunds when they seek to retire. That is an enormous concern with many, \nmany of the elderly who worry about every political statement which is \nmade and every 30-second campaign ad, let alone a constitutional \namendment for a balanced budget which does not isolate and protect \ntheir funds.\n  I thank my colleague from Utah for engaging in this discussion. I \nthank my other colleagues for interrupting the regular schedule.\n  Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada. In order to fully protect the earnings of our \nsenior citizens and the generations that follow, I believe we must keep \nthe Social Security trust fund set apart as it was meant to be.\n  I have consistently supported the interest of older Americans and \nfuture generations as a U.S. Senator. In March 1994, the Senate \nconsidered a substitute balanced budget amendment offered by Senator \nReid which would have, among other things, exempted Social Security \nfrom budget calculations. After very care consideration, I decided to \nvote for that amendment. I believe the Social Security trust fund is a \nself-financed program that must be preserved and protected. It is \nsupported entirely by employer and employee-paid payroll taxes, and \nmore importantly, it is a contract between Americans and their \ngovernment. In addition, by law the fund must be self-supporting \nbecause it has no claim on general tax revenues.\n  My Senate voting record on the Social Security issue has been \nconsistent. When the Senate considered a balanced budget amendment in \n1982, I voted in favor of an amendment offered by Senator Moynihan to \nexempt Social Security. A few days later I voted for another amendment \nauthored by Senators Cranston and Moynihan to exempt Social Security, \nand veterans' benefits, which our senior citizens depend upon. When the \nSenate considered a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution in \n1986, I voted against tabling a Metzenbaum amendment to exempt Social \nSecurity. As I mentioned, in March 1994, I voted for the substitute \namendment offered by our colleague from Nevada, Senator Reid. And most \nrecently, in January of this year, when the balanced budget amendment \nwas being considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee, I voted against \ntabling an amendment to exempt Social Security authored by Senator \nFeinstein.\n  [[Page S2595]] I have voted several other times on the Senate floor \nto preserve the integrity of Social Security. In 1990, I voted in favor \nof an amendment by Senator Heinz to remove Social Security from \ninclusion in deficit calculations. In that same year, I voted for an \namendment offered by Senator Hollings to exclude Social Security trust \nfunds from inclusion in budget deficit calculations.\n  I believe there is a prevailing view that we ought to leave Social \nSecurity alone and not subject it to budget cuts. I appreciate the need \nto reduce the Federal deficit while keeping Social Security fiscally \nsound because confidence in the stability of the program is of great \nimportance to current and future retirees.\n  In conclusion Mr. President, we must protect Social Security or we \nrun the risk of jeopardizing the futures of young and old Americans \nalike. I believe this amendment will enable us to balance the budget in \na way that will protect the hard earned savings Americans have set \naside for their twilight years. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 10:30 a.m. \nSenator Boxer be recognized to offer an amendment regarding disasters \nand that the time prior to the motion to table be limited to 3 hours 15 \nminutes to be divided in the following fashion, with no second-degree \namendments in order prior to the motion to table: 2 hours 45 minutes \nunder the control of the distinguished Senator from California [Mrs. \nBoxer] and 30 minutes under the control of the Senator from Utah [Mr. \nHatch]. I further ask that at the conclusion or yielding of time today \nthe majority leader or his designee be recognized to make a motion to \ntable the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I agree \nwith this. I think it is an excellent time agreement. I want to clarify \nbecause a couple of my colleagues would like to speak as if in morning \nbusiness. If they should go over the 10:30 time by just a few minutes--\nI do not think it is their intent to speak too long--we can adjust this \nso that we still have the time. We may be starting later than 10:30.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am certainly amenable to that, as long as the majority \nleader is.\n  I ask unanimous consent that those who are talking in morning \nbusiness, if they go beyond the hour of 10:30--and I hope they will \nnot--that the time will be adjusted so that the distinguished Senator \nfrom California will still have her 2 hours 45 minutes and I will still \nhave 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I want to thank the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, as I understand it, there is a \ndefinite time when this is to take place and that will start at 10:30 \nand there will be 3 hours and 15 minutes for the debate. The definite \ntime is scheduled for a 3:30 vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business for the next 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is my intention to yield to my friend, \nSenator Conrad from North Dakota, when I finish speaking. But for 1 \nminute, let me yield on a matter of national importance to my friend \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Lieberman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2592-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT BASKETBALL\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from North Dakota. This is a matter \nof national importance.\n  Mr. President, I have had the honor for the last 6-plus years to \nstand and speak on many occasions on behalf of the people of \nConnecticut. Today, I stand to crow on behalf of the people of \nConnecticut because of the extraordinary accomplishments of the \nUniversity of Connecticut men's and women's basketball teams.\n  Mr. President, Connecticut, a small State, is proud of its many \nfirsts: The world's first written Constitution; the world's first \nwarship and nuclear-powered submarine; the world's first American \ndictionary was published in Connecticut.\n  But another first today: The first time that a university's men's and \nwomen's basketball teams were rated No. 1 in the country at the same \ntime.\n  Connecticut is a small State, but these extraordinary athletes and \ntheir fine coaches have made us all feel 10 feet tall today. We \ncongratulate them. We know it has not come easily. They have worked \nhard and played by the rules.\n  In the spirit of the amendment under discussion, they are an \nextremely balanced team, and they have been rewarded with the victory \nand recognition they have now received.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I hope this debate moves \nexpeditiously during the day so that it will allow Senator Dodd and I \nto go to the UConn-Georgetown game at the arena tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2595-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2595-S2596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           A NEW DIRECTOR FOR THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let the record show that my colleague from \nConnecticut crowed, as he said he would.\n  It is probably appropriate that he talked about basketball because he \nwill understand that one important element of the game is a referee. \nNobody would go to a basketball game and wonder about the results, if \nhe did not think the referee was going to be fair. Give me a referee, \nand I will win any game I ever played.\n  I want to talk about referees for a second, though. One of the most \nimportant appointments that we are going to make in Congress is going \nto be the appointment of somebody to head the Congressional Budget \nOffice. This person will, in effect, be the referee on budget issues, \ntax issues, economic issues. The referee. How can our referee, the \nCongressional Budget Office, discharge its obligation effectively? \nWell, by having the confidence of the Members of the Senate that the \nCBO will do so impartially and in a manner that is eminently fair.\n  For that reason, the law with respect to the Congressional Budget \nOffice says that the Director of the Congressional Budget Office shall \nbe chosen ``without regard to political affiliation and solely on the \nbasis of his fitness to perform his duties.'' That language is not an \naccident. That is written into the law for a very specific purpose. \nThis is a critical appointment, and the appointment must be of someone \nof great substance, first of all, and second, somebody who will be \nrespected as fair, nonpartisan.\n  We understand that the majority has decided to appoint Prof. June \nO'Neill to that post. I will not stand here and in any way try to \ntarnish the reputation of Professor O'Neill. I have never met her and I \ndo not know her. I come to express great concern about this appointment \nand to say, along with my colleague, Senator Conrad, I am sending a \nletter to the President pro tempore asking that he not effect this \nappointment of Professor O'Neill to head the CBO.\n  Senator Exon, the ranking minority member of the Budget Committee, \nsaid in his letter to the chairman of the Budget Committee: ``It has \nbeen our recommendation that we should seek additional applicants \nbefore reaching a decision.''\n  They are not comfortable with this appointment, and I am not \ncomfortable with it for several reasons. I do not know much more than \nwhat I have read, but if what I read is accurate, then I am very \nconcerned with the notion that they are finding someone who believes \nthat when you score issues, they ought to be scored dynamically.\n  What is dynamic scoring. This theory says that if you cut tax rates, \neconomic activity will increase to such an extent that the Government \nwill actually collect more revenue. If you cut capital gains taxes, for \ninstance, the \n [[Page S2596]] Federal Government will supposedly collect a lot more \nmoney. Well, we have seen that sort of dynamic scoring in the past. \nThis theory held sway in 1980 and 1981, and the result--$3\\1/2\\ \ntrillion later--was massive hemorrhaging of red ink in our Government. \nThat is the result of dynamic scoring.\n  Well, that is the kind of refereeing I do not want to see happening \nat CBO. I want scoring to be professional and to be nonpartisan. There \nis a question about the Consumer Price Index--do we put somebody at the \nhead of CBO who believes the CPI radically overestimates inflation, as \nAlan Greenspan said? The consequence would be to reduce the deficit, if \nyou can say the CPI is overstated. And you can cut Social Security \npayments and increase taxes, as well.\n  I am concerned about this appointment, and I hope it will be held at \nthis point until other Members of the Senate can review the records and \ndetermine whether they think this candidate has the credentials and \ncapability and the nonpartisan approach we would expect for somebody to \nhead the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my friend, Senator Conrad from North \nDakota, for further comments on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2595-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONCERN ABOUT CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE APPOINTMENT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank my \ncolleague, Senator Dorgan, as well. I think this is a very serious \nmatter. The appointment of the head of the Congressional Budget Office \nis supposed to be nonpartisan. This is supposed to be done with both \nsides working together.\n  For the first time since I have been in the U.S. Senate, that is not \nwhat is occurring. Instead, the majority has decided they are going to \nput in the scorekeeper, the person who makes the forecast for the \nFederal Government, for the Government of the United States, and they \nare doing so on what appears to be partisan basis. That is a break from \nthe past; that is a break from tradition; that is a break from what the \nlaw provides.\n  Mr. President, I think this is a very serious matter. If we are going \nto work collegially, if we are going to cooperate, if we are going to \nwork together, then there has to be a basis of trust. Always in the \npast, part of that basis of trust is the person who is made the head of \nthe Congressional Budget Office is somebody of very high professional \nstandards, someone who is above being considered partisan.\n  I can say, in terms of the Democrats, since I have been here, they \nhave had Bob Reischauer, Rudy Penner, Alice Rivlin, all of them broadly \nrespected, all of them above partisanship. As a matter of fact, I \ncannot remember a concern that has been raised by the majority side \nwhile I have been in the Senate about CBO scoring on partisan basis.\n  But now, Mr. President, the majority has decided to impose on the \nCongress their choice, without the kind of agreement, without the kind \nof consultation, without the kind of, I think, nonpartisan working \ntogether that this position requires. And so, Mr. President, what is at \nstake? I can say that I am on the Budget Committee and the Finance \nCommittee, and we are very dependent on what the Congressional Budget \nOffice says the results of policies will be.\n  We now have before us someone, frankly, who does not have a national \nreputation, someone who is not of the stature that one would expect of \nsomeone appointed to be the head of CBO. And even more disturbing than \nthat is that this is someone who has indicated they are willing to \nconsider so-called dynamic scoring.\n  Well, what is dynamic scoring? It is largely make-believe. It is \nmake-believe. It says if you cut taxes, you get more money. We tried \nthat back in the 1980's in this country, and it was an absolute \nunmitigated disaster for this country. We saw people saying we could \ncut taxes, we can increase spending, and somehow it would all add up. \nIt did not add up. It did not come close to adding up.\n  Instead of adding up, we got an explosion of the national debt; we \ngot an explosion of deficits that have put this country in a deep hole \nthat we have yet to climb out of and now it appears we are about to \nrepeat the exercise.\n  I understand that this is a matter that should be handled in a \ndifferent way. The appointment of the head of the Congressional Budget \nOffice ought to be done together, both sides putting someone in place \nwho is of the highest professional reputation, of the highest \nprofessional standards, and someone who both sides recognize will not \ndo forecasts in a partisan, political manner. Unfortunately, Mr. \nPresident, that is not the suggestion for an appointment that we have \nbefore us.\n  I have joined my colleague from North Dakota in asking the President \npro tempore that he not go forward with this appointment until and \nunless there is broad bipartisan agreement with respect to the \nappointment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is their objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I do not \nobject to the Senator's additional 2 minutes--let me amend that to add \n3 minutes for the Senator from Montana and that this additional 5 \nminutes does not come off from the total time agreed upon for the Boxer \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I just want to make sure \nthat the vote would now be 5 minutes later, or at 3:35. If that is part \nof the agreement, that is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would observe that would be 3:37.\n  Is there objection? Hearing none, the Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me simply underscore, in my 2 minutes \nremaining, the point that Senator Conrad just made. We are asking the \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate to withhold action on this \nappointment, to withhold action on this appointment to give the Senate \nand other Senators time to get some answers about this candidate.\n  We are not talking about just any appointment or a run-of-the-mill \nappointment or some general candidate being appointed to some office or \nanother. The CBO Director is the referee who will score every economic \ndecision, every financial judgment that will be made on legislation. \nAnd when they pick a referee--when I say ``they,'' those who have \neffected this, the congressional majority--when they pick a referee who \ngives me the impression that this referee is on the home team, then I \nsay, ``Wait a second. That is not the kind of game we play.''\n  We have very aggressive games around here that are played for real \nand for big stakes. We need to have referees who are fair and impartial \nand who do not owe their allegiance to either side.\n  This appointment is not--it is not--in the genre of an appointment of \nMr. Reischauer or Mr. Rudy Penner, as an example, both of whom would be \nconsidered to have been generally nonpartisan and very well qualified. \nThis appointment falls short on that.\n  And my interest is not in tarnishing this person. I do not know the \nperson. But, based on what I have read, I certainly want to find out \nmore about the person before this Senate would decide that this person \nshall become our referee.\n  That is the purpose of our making this request to the President pro \ntempore. I hope he and the majority would honor that request so that we \ncan understand more about this candidate. And if this candidate does \nnot meet the test of fairness, does not meet the qualifications test, \nthen I think we ought to find someone who does and who would be \nacceptable on a bipartisan basis to this body. That I think is the fair \nway for us to proceed. I hope the President pro tempore will agree.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2596-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2596-S2597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                IWO JIMA\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, on this date 50 years ago, a formidable \nAmerican armada moved even closer to another objective in the Pacific. \nWhile that was going on, long-range bombers \n [[Page S2597]] were in the air and continued to bombard an 8-mile \nsquare chunk of volcanic rock and ash known as Iwo Jima. The Japanese \nhigh command was acutely aware of the island's strategic and \npsychological importance and their forces on Iwo Jima constructed \nelaborate defenses that would be the toughest encountered by forces of \nthe United States, in particular the United States Marine Corps, during \nthe war of the Pacific.\n  Our Army, Navy, and air forces subjected Iwo Jima to the longest and \nmost intensive preparation given any objective in the Pacific during \nWorld War II. Beginning June 15, 1944, American air attacks continued \nsteadily through the summer and the fall, culminating in a 74-day round \nof continuous strikes by Saipan-based bombers. These air attacks, plus \nheavy naval gunfire 3 days before the assault, destroyed everything, or \nalmost everything, above ground on Iwo Jima. But most of the Japanese \nunderground guns and defenses were relatively untouched.\n  Against Iwo's rocky terrain and caves, naval gunfire could do only so \nmuch and victory or defeat would rest with the fighting spirit of \n70,000 men of the 5th Air and Amphibious Corps, under the command of \nMaj. Gen. Harry Schmidt. This force included the 3d, 4th, and 5th \nMarine Divisions, many of whose members were battle-hardened veterans \nof earlier Pacific assaults.\n  Facing them on Iwo was a force of around 20,000 dedicated Japanese \nsoldiers, every one of whom was under orders to make it his duty to \ntake 10 of the enemy before dying. In a matter of days, the opposing \nforces would clash in a struggle that would prove decisive in the war \nin the Pacific. It was here on this island atop Mt. Suribachi, where \nthe most famous of all photos was taken from the Pacific--the raising \nof the flag. It has been a symbol of American gallantry, the symbol of \npride and dedication of the U.S. Marine Corps, and all of those who \nshared in that pride with that uniform. And I, not being one of those \nthat went on Iwo, have I shared that uniform.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, thank you very much. And I thank my \ncolleagues for working with me to get a time agreement, which I hope \nwill enable all of our colleagues who have various views on the \namendment I shall offer an opportunity to express them today before we \nhave a vote.\n  Mr. President, my amendment, which has been coauthored by Senator \nLeahy of Vermont, will enable the Congress to respond to a federally \ndeclared disaster should the balanced budget amendment become part of \nthe Constitution.\n  I am proud that we have a number of cosponsors. They include Senator \nFeinstein, my colleague from California; Senator Bumpers from Arkansas; \nSenators Inouye and Akaka from Hawaii; Senator Murray from Washington, \nand there are others.\n  Mr. President, balancing the Federal budget is a goal we should \nattain. You know, I saw this national debt go from $1 trillion to $4 \ntrillion in the decade of the eighties and there was a very clear \nreason why this happened--huge increases in the military, huge tax cuts \nto the wealthy. And I will tell you, it does not add up to a balanced \nbudget. It led to a terrible situation which finally, under President \nClinton, we were able to get our arms around when, unfortunately on \nstraight party lines, we did have a vote to reduce that deficit, and \nthe deficit is now about half of where it would have been. So we are \nmaking progress.\n  There are those who believe we must have this amendment in the \nConstitution in order to continue progress. I think the facts belie \nthat. I just want to make sure that if we do have this amendment, it is \nin fact a flexible one. We should be able to act to meet the needs of \nour people. Why else are we here if we cannot do so?\n  The only exception in this amendment that would enable Congress to \ntake the budget out of balance with a simple majority vote rather than \na supermajority vote is a declaration of war. Of course, that makes \nsense. But there are other times that it should take a simple majority.\n  For every other emergency right now in this amendment to the \nConstitution, we would have to have 60 votes in the Senate out of 100 \nSenators and 261 out of 435 votes in the House of Representatives to \nrespond.\n  In other words, Mr. President, we would need a supermajority to take \nthe budget out of balance for the particular year in which a disaster \nstruck. We are not just talking about a small problem here. We are \ntalking about a federally declared disaster. We would take a \nsupermajority to take us out of balance to fund that disaster \nemergency.\n  Now, Mr. President, I believe that creates a dangerous situation that \nflies in the face of reason. It flies in the face of reason. It is \ndangerous. I believe it is reckless, because I believe responding to \ndisasters and emergencies is one of the most honorable and dutiful \nobligations of this U.S. Senate.\n  Many Members have felt the pain of seeing our States damaged very \nbadly. Our people dislocated, families mourning the dead and the \ninjured because of a natural disaster. Floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, \nearthquakes, severe storms, volcanoes.\n  Many have gone to the shelters. I think the most haunting memories of \nall those trips that I have made, unfortunately, on too many occasions \nin my State in the north and the south and everywhere, the most \nhaunting memories to me are the faces of the elderly and the children \nwho were so disoriented when something like this happens. They are \nrooted out of their homes and they are afraid. We need to respond in \nthose kinds of desperate circumstances.\n  Now, I think a reasonable question to ask me is, Senator, how big a \nproblem is this in the Nation? Are you just talking about your State of \nCalifornia? Some might say we could understand why you would feel this \nway, but what about the rest of the United States?\n  I think the chart I have up here will explain that there truly is not \na State that is immune from the possibility of disaster, and as a \nmatter of fact, the likelihood. Before I point out what this chart \nmeans, I want to say that today there is not a State in the Union that \nis not vulnerable to flooding.\n  This report from the National Research Council states, ``Floods occur \nmore frequently in the United States than any other natural hazard. All \n50 states have communities at risk from flooding which occurs primarily \nas flash floods caused by thunderstorms, rapid melting of ice and snow \nand storm surges.'' It talks about the great Midwest floods.\n  The point I am making is that this chart does not even show the \nflooding possibilities, because basically the chart would be covered, \nbecause every single State has the possibility of disastrous floods.\n  Looking at the chart, here are the earthquakes in this teal color. \nThe light teal color shows the low risk of earthquake, and we see it is \nall over the country. If we point to the various teal colors here, all \nthrough the country. We are not talking about merely in California. \nNow, the medium risk, we can see where that lies, pretty much through \nthe country. There is actually a high risk here in the Midwest for \nearthquakes.\n  Now, looking at tornadoes we see the whole midsection of the country \nover to the east and the extreme risk of tornado here in the midsection \nof the country.\n  The blue and yellow shows the hurricane, some risk for hurricane, and \nthe dark blue is extreme risk for hurricane, which we see on the \ncoastal areas and of course over in Hawaii.\n  There is also volcano risk, which many can never forget Mount St. \nHelens, that is in the West. And tsunami risk, the entire west coast of \nthe Nation, including the islands as well.\n  As we look on this chart we can see that this country is magnificent. \nIt is also quite vulnerable to disasters if we look at this risk \nprofile.\n  While many of my colleagues here truly believe that responding to the \nneeds of his or her people is not a requirement to ensuring domestic \ntranquility. I always go back to the preamble of the Constitution. We \nread it \n [[Page S2598]] as kids in school, but it is very meaningful, or it \nshould be quite meaningful to everyone.\n  When we say we are to ensure domestic tranquility, I can say when a \nperson is forced out of their home because of an earthquake, a flood, a \ndrought--many things by the way, not even on this chart; droughts we do \nnot even show--but you are forced out because you cannot get water or \nfarm your land, let me assure you, you do not have a situation of \ndomestic tranquility when so many of your people are dislocated. It is \npretty basic.\n  Now, I asked my colleagues, who would ever want to be a Senator in \nJapan after the Kobe disaster? Many have seen the elected officials and \nthe people in the government going to various town hall meetings and \ngatherings throughout Kobe, and looking at the memorial there and \nsaying ``I am sorry. We are powerless to act. We do not have a plan in \nplace. We cannot act.''\n  I assure Members that without the Boxer-Leahy amendment, we are in \neffect, I think, unilaterally surrendering this body's commitment to \ndisaster relief. I will prove it. I will prove it. If we need a \nsupermajority to act we are simply not going to be able to act.\n  Our amendment provides a critical safety valve. It says that in any \nfiscal year in which spending occurs as a result of an emergency \ndeclaration by the President and the Congress has also said, ``Yes, it \nis an emergency,'' the provisions of the balanced budget amendment may \nbe waived by a majority vote of those present and voting in each House.\n  I want to make a point here. We purposefully constructed it such that \nit is not a 51 vote, but those present and voting. When we have a \ndisaster we need to act fast. Suppose there happened to be a couple of \nseats vacant in the Senate, or people are ill and not here in the U.S. \nSenate. We should be able to move with the majority. Majority vote is a \nvery important concept.\n  This amendment does violence to--not my amendment, but the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution---does violence to that notion of \nfairness of majority rule. When we require a supermajority to act, \nwhether it is a recession period, a depression situation, a natural \ndisaster, if we require a supermajority we are giving a huge amount of \npower to the minority. When we do that we can tie this body in knots. \nWe have seen it happen here many, many times.\n  By the way, I know what I am talking about. I voted to end the \nfilibuster, although I am now in a minority in this body. I think \ninaction is inexcusable. We should not put ourselves in a situation \nwhere we cannot act. Full debate, absolutely. But at some point we \ndecide we have had the debate, and we move on.\n  As I said at the outset of this debate on the balanced budget \namendment, our States are not colonies of the Federal Government. \nNeither are they separate fiefdoms. When disaster strikes, we should \nbe, as the words above the beautiful Capitol dome, e pluribus unum, \nfrom the many, one. What a beautiful thought that is. From the many, \none. E pluribus unum. We help each other. That is the way it should be. \nOne nation, under God, indivisible. That is what I believe in. From the \nmany, one. We pull together, in times of crisis, in times of disaster. \nAnd we do not allow one State--whether it is in the middle of the \ncountry or at either end or anywhere in between--to stand alone in that \ncircumstance.\n  We talk a lot about family values here and caring and compassion. My \ngoodness, when we are in the midst of one of these disasters, that is \nthe time to pull together. And we should not create hurdles in this \nbalanced budget amendment which will make it impossible or very \ndifficult for Members to move to resolve and to move quickly.\n  I believe that without the Boxer-Leahy provision, we will not be from \nthe many, one. We will be divided. We will be stressed. We will be \nincapable of acting, because getting 60 votes to fully respond to a \ndisaster will be extremely difficult. If we cannot get that, we will \nneed to get offsetting moneys to fund the disaster. Budget cuts right \non the spot, turning sensible budgeting out the window.\n  We will throw sensible budgeting out the window because of a \ndisaster. If we cannot get 60 votes, we will have to cut the budget \nelsewhere. We will have to cut into the bone of education, \ntransportation, health research, defense, things we need to do in this \ncountry to respond to a disaster.\n  Let me tell you, Mr. President, we have had those votes, and every \ntime it has failed. Every time we have tried to get offsets to pay for \nan emergency, we never got the votes. It did not work. Why? Common \nsense tells you, an emergency is unexpected. It happens to us in our \nfamilies. We should have a rainy day fund--of course we should--and we \ntry to give FEMA a rainy day fund. But sometimes the rains keep on \ncoming. And I can tell you they are coming right now again in Los \nAngeles today, and we hope we will not experience the kind of problems \nwe did last month.\n  So you plan for a rainy day, but you do not know when it is going to \nhappen and to what extent it is going to happen. That is not something \nto be upset about. It is something to be ready for. It is life, and \nlife does throw us some curves sometimes in our personal lives and here \nsitting in the U.S. Senate.\n  Why do I say that it will be very difficult to get 60 votes or a \nsupermajority to respond to a disaster? The Republican leadership in \nthe House of Representatives has given us a preview in a letter dated \nFebruary 7, signed by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, House Majority \nLeader Richard Armey, House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, and \nHouse Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston.\n  Mr. President, let me talk a little bit about this letter. Their \nletter threatens no action on disaster relief. Right now, forget about \nwaiting for a balanced budget, they are right out here. They are \nalready on the record.\n  The President has asked for funding for an emergency supplemental to \nmeet the needs of several disasters. He has asked for emergency funding \nin the supplemental to deal with the Midwest floods and the Northridge \nearthquake. He also asked for emergency funds to deal with unexpected \nmilitary obligations and the House leadership is not objecting to that. \nThey have found some offsets, as I understand it, in the military. But \nwhen it comes to the emergency supplemental which, in the main, has \nthis money for California and the Midwest--and by the way, 40 States, \nas I understand it, still need to be paid for emergencies--what do they \ntell us? I am quoting from the letter:\n\n       We will not act on the balance of requests until you have \n     identified offsets and deductions to make up for the funding. \n     Whether these activities are emergencies or not, it will be \n     our policy to pay for them rather than add them to the \n     deficit.\n\n  Now, here it is, here it is. So this is not any guessing game we have \nhere. The House leadership says it is their policy, and you know they \nseem to be able to control the votes over there. I think they had about \nseven or eight people who went off the party line on one vote, and they \ngot called to the woodshed. This is discipline, my friends. They are \nnot interested in going out of balance to meet these needs, and I can \nassure you, this emergency supplemental is going to be in trouble. So \nif we do not act and we get this balanced budget amendment into the \nConstitution requiring 60 votes, we are in deep trouble.\n  I am going to repeat what they said:\n\n       Whether these activities are emergencies or not, it will be \n     our policy to pay for them rather than add them to the \n     deficit.\n\n  Mr. President, since a large proportion of FEMA's funding for \ndisasters supports repair and recovery of public buildings, more \nreliable estimates of the actual dollars that would be necessary for \nthe Northridge recovery were not available when the revised \nsupplemental was transmitted to Congress last year. Here is the point: \nA lot of these supplemental requests come before we know the extent of \nthe damage. You do not want to go out there with estimates, you want to \ngo out there with real numbers.\n  So many times there is a time lag. We had in California 120,000 \nschools, hospitals, city buildings, and other businesses and residences \nwith damage from the quake. It takes time. You cannot judge the extent \nof the damage to a structure by looking at the exterior. You need to go \nin there, and then you can find out what the damage is. It takes time.\n   [[Page S2599]] Look what happens after it takes time. After the rush \nof sympathy is over, what do they tell us?\n\n       Whether these activities are emergencies or not, it will be \n     our policy to pay for them rather than add them to the \n     deficit.\n\n  Meaning they are going to seek offsets, and I will tell you, Mr. \nPresident, it is going to be hard to find those offsets when we already \nare in tight budgetary times.\n  An example of this late discovery of damage is California State \nUniversity at Northridge. The library appeared only to have minor \ndamage, but once the inspectors got behind the drywall, they found all \n86 steel beams were sheared in half.\n  I am talking about California clearly because I know it the best. But \nit is not the only State that would lose if this attitude and this \nbalanced budget amendment passes without the Boxer-Leahy language.\n  The disaster supplemental, again, requested by the President includes \nfunds, as I said, for 40 States and territories. James Lee Witt, the \nDirector of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has warned us that \nwithout these supplemental appropriations, the agency will not be able \nto meet any disaster requirements by May 1 and no further spending on \ncurrent relief programs after July.\n  I will tell you, Mr. President, get down on your hands and knees \ntonight because if you have a disaster in your State and you see those \nlooks on people's faces when they are living in shelters and they \ncannot go home and they are afraid to enter their home because of fear \nof flood or earthquake, you stand up there and say, ``Gee, I didn't \nrealize it when I voted against Boxer-Leahy.''\n  I ask you this: Will disasters go away because we want them to, \nbecause we are in a tough time right now? Will they go away because of \nthis balanced budget amendment?\n  Let us look at my second chart called ``Probable Costs of Future \nNatural Disasters.'' I want to make this point to my friends because, \nagain, those people who say, ``Well, sure, Senator Boxer is up here \nspeaking about disasters. It is her State,'' let us take a look at the \neast coast and take a look at the largest disasters that we are looking \nat across the country.\n  Let us take a look at this. We are talking here about the predictable \nfuture. I want to make a side point that a lot of this work that was \ndone, so that we know what our future holds in our country, was done by \nthe U.S. Geological Survey. I think it is important to point that out \nbecause in the Republican Contract With America, they want to do away \nwith the funding for the U.S. Geological Survey, which is where we get \nour information as to where the high risks are so we can share this \ninformation with others, but I will not get into that debate today \nbecause there will be other times to raise that question.\n  But let us take a look across the country. If you look at the \nNortheast, a $45 billion class 4 hurricane, and that is really the \nwhole Northeast. Then a $52 billion class 4 hurricane out of New York \nwhich would impact that region. Out of Hampton, VA, a $33.5 billion \nclass 5 hurricane is predicted.\n In Miami, a $53 billion class 5 hurricane is predicted; in New \nOrleans, a $25.6 billion class 5 hurricane. And I wanted to note that \n  Senator Johnston is also a cosponsor of this amendment.In the \nMidwest, the real big earthquake. It is very interesting, my friends. \nIt is not predicted for California. We do have a couple of huge ones \nhere and also in Seattle, but the real big one is predicted in the \nmidsection of our Nation, a $69.7 billion loss, an 8.6 earthquake \npredicted on this fault.\n  Here, moving to Galveston, TX, a $42.5 billion class 5 hurricane. In \npast disasters, we have had some very conservative Members of the \nSenate on this floor demanding that we act fast not to get offsets but \nto take care of their people. Why? Because they looked at their faces. \nIt is real easy to say, well, we will vote against Boxer-Leahy, but \nwait until it comes to your State and you cannot act. And that is what \nI am trying to get colleagues to think of on both sides of the aisle. \nThis is one that comes back to haunt you, not maybe but probably. \nRemember, the whole country is subjected to floods, serious floods. We \ndo not even show that.\n  Now we get over here to Honolulu, a $30 billion class 4 hurricane. \nHow we can ever forget the last one that hit there? Los Angeles, a 7.0 \nearthquake, $57 billion; San Francisco, $84 billion, 8.2; and up in \nSeattle, where a lot of people do not think of it that much, a 7.5 \nearthquake costing $33 billion.\n  (Mr. KEMPTHORNE assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. So let us not kid the American people; disasters are not \ngoing to go away. And I have to tell you again no disaster supplemental \nappropriation has ever been passed with offsetting spending required. \nIt just has not. It is on the books. We have the votes to show you. It \ndoes not happen. And why? Because these are emergencies, and we do not \nwant to destroy everything else we need to do for this country when one \nof our States is in trouble. So we come together, e pluribus unum, come \ntogether from the many as one, and we help and we do not destroy the \nrest of the budget. And then the next year we look back and we say, \nyes, we had some of these disasters; we are going to be even tougher on \nour budgeting, but we do not force 60 votes because it is not going to \nhappen. Disasters are beyond our planning.\n  Mr. President, I am not a constitutional scholar, but I do know a \nlittle bit about the origins of our Government. I know that the \nConstitution was not the first fundamental law governing this Nation; \nthe Articles of Confederation preceded the Constitution. But that \ndocument regulating the relations among the States proved weak and \ninefficient. The articles provided for a supermajority vote before the \nNational Government could request revenue from the States. And do you \nknow what James Madison called that? A ``radical infirmity''--a radical \ninfirmity to require a supermajority. Without careful change to ensure \nflexibility, this balanced budget amendment is a radical infirmity of \nthe 1990's. It is an infirmity. It is a condition. And it is radical \nbecause it takes away the rule of the majority.\n  Now, I know a lot of people said this election was about a \nrevolution. Maybe it was. But I hope we respect the Founding Fathers \nhere and realize that there is a reason we have majority rule in most \ncases in this body. We should not shackle the ability of the Congress \nto respond to emergencies by requiring a supermajority vote.\n  Now, a measured attack on the budget deficit is a priority of the \nCongress. I am on the Budget Committee. I have been on the Budget \nCommittee over on the House side, now on the Senate side. I am proud to \nbe here. And I was proud to vote for the largest deficit reduction \npackage in history that has worked. We are on the path. We should \nrestrain spending for the benefit of generations to come, but we must \nnot allow this constitutional amendment to turn the back of the Senate \non decent Americans. And listen to this one. If you think about who is \nimpacted by disasters, they are decent Americans who usually, if you \nlook at all these areas, pay their fair share in taxes, who probably \nhave never asked the Federal Government for anything else in their \nlife.\n  I have seen it. I have seen people who said, ``I never asked the \nFederal Government for anything. All I want now is a chance to get back \non my feet,'' because they were hit with a flood, a hurricane, an \nearthquake, frost, drought, and they are knocked off their feet. And \nthey are saying, yes, I have some insurance, but I need to have my \nGovernment be a partner in helping me continue to be productive.\n  It seems to me that is reasonable. That is why we are one nation, to \nact as one when there are serious emergencies, and that is what we do \nwith our amendment, the Boxer-Leahy amendment.\n  From fiscal year 1988 to fiscal year 1993, Congress has passed six \nmajor disaster relief supplemental appropriations bills. I wish to \nexplain this. They totaled $17 billion in budget authority--since 1988, \n$17 billion in budget authority. In 1994, Congress passed a \nsupplemental that included $8.4 billion for disasters. That is a lot. \nBut compare it to the military budget that is about $280 billion every \nyear. You can see we spend a great deal defending this Nation, as we \nshould. We have to defend our Nation when we are struck with \n [[Page S2600]] the hurricanes, the floods, the devastation of \nearthquakes, tsunamis, whatever are predicted to happen--$17 billion \nsince 1988.\n  Now I am going to show you some photographs from some of these \ndisasters because I think again we have to put a human face on what we \nare talking about here. This is what happens to America in these times. \nAnd the funding that I show here basically is a small proportion of the \nfunds that went for FEMA programs because these were put together by \nthe Federal emergency people. There are other dollars that are added, \nand I will go into that.\n  But here is South Carolina, Hurricane Hugo, 304,369 victims. You can \nsee the child, the mother, the ruination, the shock. I have been to too \nmany of these.\n  Here is the Cypress Freeway in Oakland. I am really familiar with \nthis because my husband takes his car over this freeway, or did, every \nday for 20 years plus. An hour before it went down, he was on that \nfreeway. This is not something that is far away from my heart.\n  This happened on the night of the World Series between two California \nteams, and everyone was sitting in their seats waiting for them to play \nball. We did not have a baseball strike. That is a local other issue. \nBut they never did play ball that night because the earthquake struck. \nPeople died. There were 896,245 victims--meaning not deaths, victims--\npeople touched by this. And I want you to know something. It took us a \nwhile to get the plans to rebuild the Cypress structure because, guess \nwhat, we did not want to build it the same way it was built originally \nbecause it would have fallen down again. So we had to go back and get \nthe engineering done and do it in a way that would not hurt the \ncommunity. So it took a while.\n  There was a move on this Senate floor to deny the funds to rebuild \nthis freeway. I remember it because I had to fight it. And I won that \nvote by a vote of--I think we had 53 votes, not 60, friends. If this \nsupermajority requirement had been in place, forget it; we would be \nlooking at disaster. Now, tell me something, is that what we want to \nsee in our communities?\n  Here is Hurricane Andrew. This is extraordinary. There were 219,825 \nvictims, in other words people hurt directly by this disaster. The \nhomes are literally gone.\n  Do we want 60 votes to be able to make these people have a chance at \nlife again? I hope not. We would be like they are in Kobe, Japan, going \nto community meetings saying, ``Gee, we're sorry, we cannot act. Move \nto another place, move to another town.''\n  I can imagine the American people's reaction. Forget it. We are not \nreserved here. Anybody who has had community meetings, you stand up and \nyou are sent to protect the people of your States and help them--if you \nstand up at a community meeting and say, ``Sorry, I could not get 60 \nvotes''--it is not even a viable thought.\n  Here is Hurricane Iniki. This literally looks as if a bomb dropped on \nthis house; the magnificent blue sky and a complete, total wreck of a \nhome. That is what it looks like. This is what we are talking about. I \nam not up here because this is an unimportant issue. I want to show you \nsome more pictures.\n  Missouri floods, 168,340 victims. Their dreams, their hopes, their \nmemories, their wedding book pictures--destroyed.\n  Northridge earthquake, Los Angeles area. I will never forget the \nfirst thing I heard about was a policeman rushing out to help people \nand he could not see that the freeway was gone. He was one of the first \ndeaths. I have to go get 60 votes if this amendment passes without the \nBoxer-Leahy language.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will help me with \nthis one. Let us not do another party line vote here. My God, I do not \nask people if they are Republicans or Democrats when they are faced \nwith this. I do not care. We are Americans when these things happen. We \nhelp each other. Let us not put something in the Constitution that ties \nour hands, whether Republicans or Democrats, that ties our hands and \nsays you cannot act in a disaster except if you have a supermajority.\n  After this election, half the people said, ``What's going to happen \nin the Senate?''\n  I said, ``You know what is going to happen? We are not going to be \npartisan here. It is not like the House that tends to be very partisan. \nWe are going to see reasonable people here come together.''\n  I am waiting. This is a good one. Reasonable people should say that \nwe should not require a supermajority to act in times of disaster.\n  Here is one that was unbelievable, the volcano eruption in Washington \nState. That does look like a bomb went off. 1,891 victims.\n  Then let us look at Houston, TX--horrible floods, 34,000-plus \nvictims. This looks literally like something dropped on this house. You \nsay a flood? This is a picture of what happens when the water is so \nhigh.\n  I have to tell you, I visited northern California in the last flood \nthat we had. I was driving down the road and I looked out the window \nand I said there is the Russian River. Somebody said the Russian River \nhas never been there, it is on the other side of the bank. In other \nwords it had made a second river.\n  These things happen. Does it mean we should not require that people \nwho live in a floodplain have insurance? Of course, and we do. We \nshould have insurance programs in place. I am on a task force looking \nat how better to meet these needs. But the bottom line is with \ninsurance, with savings, with all the things we do, once in a while we \nare going to have a disaster that is beyond our ability to plan for. Do \nwe then turn our backs because we need a supermajority? Or do we in \nfact make it possible for us to respond in a reasonable fashion, a \nmajority of those present and voting? I hope that makes common sense to \nmy colleagues.\n  I want to give my friends a picture of the number of times we have \nhad to respond to disasters, and I will show the chart of the predicted \ndisasters. We are here talking about the whole Nation, not just \nCalifornia. Between 1977 and 1993, the Federal Government responded to \n578 disasters or emergencies, totaling $120 billion in inflation-\nadjusted dollars. The reason I say that is you need to know that we are \njust talking about very large numbers here, of people across the Nation \nand not just in California.\n  I want to make a point. With all these disasters that we have had in \nthe past, this is what will probably happen in the future. When Senator \nLeahy gets here--and I expect that he is on his way and will be here \nshortly to talk about it from his perspective on the east coast. It is \ngoing to be hard to believe this, but experts have told us that with \nall the horror stories and all the photos I showed, in many ways they \nsay we have been lucky. How can they say we have been lucky? Because if \nHurricane Andrew in Florida had struck just 25 miles further north into \nthe heart of Miami, there would not have been 350,000 homeless but 1.6 \nmillion homeless. So, 25 miles made a difference between 350,000 \nhomeless, which is horrendous, and 1.6 million homeless. The damages \nwould not have been $20 billion but what have been $62 billion, \naccording to the study by the Miami Herald.\n  The Northridge Earthquake severed eight major roads right here \nleading to downtown Los Angeles. Gas and water lines ruptured. I flew \nover that area hours after the disaster happened, and it was the most \nextraordinary thing you ever did see. For miles it was pitch black, no \nelectricity, people not able to function. Again, the elderly and the \nchildren are the most vulnerable. We always talk about them here--the \nelderly and the children, the most vulnerable, the most dislocated. And \nmany of the children still have what they call the post-traumatic \nsymptoms: After the trauma.\n  We talked about gas and water lines ruptured, fires, power failures. \nI talked about water service disruption. More than 50,000 homes and \napartments were damaged, nearly 170 schools were damaged. And as bad as \nthis disaster was--and it was horrible, hard to imagine--I have to tell \nyou that disaster struck at 4:31 a.m. on a holiday. Had it struck on a \nschool day, you can just imagine what could have happened: 700,000 \nschool children, 6 million commuters. So when these things happen we \nwonder why, we ask ourselves why, and then we say, ``My God, the \nexperts say it could have even been worse.''\n   [[Page S2601]] Looking at the future, we do not know where the worst \ncould occur. It could happen anywhere--east, west, north, south. I am \nsaying to my friends here, please--this has been my decade to see the \ndisasters. Somebody started calling me Calamity Jane because I am \ncoming down here and telling these stories about what happens to my \npeople. But the next decade it could be someone else's decade. I do not \nwish that on any of my friends here or the people that they represent.\n  I wish it were possible to say this is not true. They say there is \nnothing certain except death and taxes. I think we can say death, \ntaxes, and natural disasters are going to happen. The question before \nthis body with the Boxer-Leahy amendment is: Do we want to put \nourselves in a circumstance where it is so difficult to respond that \npeople suffer while we try to get 60 votes or find offsets in an \nalready tight budget?\n  I see my friend, the coauthor of this amendment, has arrived. So I am \ngoing to wind down and finish my remarks for this time in the next few \nminutes while he gets ready to address the Senate.\n  I mentioned before, I say to my friend from Vermont, that all 50 \nStates are at risk of flooding and tornadoes and about 40 are at risk \nfor earthquakes. There are 65 active or potentially active volcanoes in \nthe United States. Most of the Pacific Northwest, Alaska and Hawaii, \nand the entire west coast is subjected to tsunami risk--which are these \nincredible waves that are caused from an earthquake which is out at \nsea. A study by the University of Southern California on the probable \ncost of future natural disasters estimates that an earthquake at 7.0 in \nthe Richter scale in LA, West Los Angeles, would cost $57 billion. You \nsee that reflected on this chart.\n  I think it is important to note that James Lee Witt, Director of \nFEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, noted recently another \nearthquake along the New Madrid fault in America's heartland has a 50-\n50 chance of occurring in the next 5 years. If such an 8.6 earthquake \nstruck at Memphis, the cost would be $69.7 billion. I say to my friend \nfrom Vermont, it is extraordinary, everyone thinks of earthquakes as \nbeing a California phenomenon. The next large earthquake predicted to \nhit, the largest one, would be in the middle of our country.\n  So the Boxer-Leahy amendment is not about California and it is not \nabout any one State. It is about America. I have to tell you that in \nthis very sobering information a 7.0 earthquake along this fault, that \nis along the New Madrid, that is even smaller than the 8.6 they expect, \ncould kill 14,000 and cause 240,000 homeless. That is unbelievable. \nThese are not fantasy figures. Earthquakes estimated at greater than \n8.0 struck the Mississippi Valley in late 1811 and early 1812. In 1990, \na 4.7 earthquake struck the new Madrid region.\n  So I show these charts, and my colleagues will do so as well, not to \nfrighten anybody but to say that we need to be prepared for this. It is \nvery immature to close your eyes to problems.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to add one thing to what the \ndistinguished Senator from California said. She reminded us that this \nis not a California amendment; it is not only for earthquakes in \nCalifornia. In fact, one of my colleagues asked me walking through the \nhalls this morning, ``Why is this a Boxer-Leahy amendment? You don't \nhave earthquakes in Vermont.'' For a practical matter we do have very \nmild ones. But I said this is not a Vermont amendment. This is not a \nCalifornia amendment.\n  There are a lot of areas, whether it is the flooding in the Midwest \nthat we saw last year, that this amendment addresses. I remember, Mr. \nPresident--and the distinguished Senator from California and I have \ndiscussed this--the time when I first became chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee. We were in a massive drought, unprecedented \ndrought throughout the Midwest. There were Time magazine cover stories. \nNetworks were doing special segments on it. I took the Senate \nAgriculture Committee staff else in an airplane and we went around for \n3 days to view what was going on and see the extent of the disaster.\n  I recall one place in North Dakota where they were digging a well \ndown through the soil to where they first found moisture. They found \nmoisture about 2\\1/2\\ feet down in this particular place, and the crop \nhas a root system of only 2 or 3 inches.\n  We came back here and with bipartisan support we wrote a disaster \nbill, a very significant disaster bill. But had we not been able to \nmove quickly through the House and the Senate, we would have seen not \nonly thousands of farms go out of business but the ripple effect of \nthousands of other businesses, everything from the tractor dealers to \nthe clothing stores to the shipping companies to those who export to \nother parts of the world. It would have affected our balance of \npayments, especially in a country like ours where we have had now for a \nnumber of years balance of payment deficits except in agriculture and \nsome of the intellectual property areas. That was a disaster.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, I am about to yield to him as much \ntime as he wishes on this subject. He is such a respected Member of \nthis Senate. I am so proud that we are working together. I wanted to \nconclude my portion right here at this time--or course, we have time \nreserved until approximately 3:30--to say that according to the report \nby the National Research Council for the World Conference on Natural \nDisaster Reduction, and I am quoting:\n\n       There are more people and investments at risk, natural \n     disasters today, than ever before. More than half of the U.S. \n     population live in coastal zones or along fault lines.\n\n  Therefore, I say to my friend, my colleague, a coauthor of this \namendment, that this is not the time for the Federal Government to bind \nitself from responding to disasters. And without the Boxer-Leahy \namendment to this balanced budget provision I think we are doing just \nthat.\n  I yield as much time as he may consume to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from California send the \namendment to the desk?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 240\n\n (Purpose: To provide Federal assistance to supplement State and local \n efforts to alleviate the damage, loss, hardship, and suffering caused \n by disasters or emergencies by exempting spending that is designated \n     emergency requirements by both the President and the Congress)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mr. \n     Leahy, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Bumpers, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Akaka, \n     and Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment numbered 240.\n\n       At the end of Section 5, add the following: ``The \n     provisions of this article may be waived by a majority vote \n     in each House of those present and voting for any fiscal year \n     in which outlays occur as a result of a declaration made by \n     the President (and a designation by the Congress) that a \n     major disaster or emergency exists.''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is not a \nsufficient second.\n  The Senator from California has yielded time to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask again for the yeas and nays on the \npending Boxer-Leahy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, is my understanding correct that the \nSenator from California has yielded to me such time as I may require?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining under the \ncontrol of the Senator from California?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 114 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n   [[Page S2602]] Mr. President, I might ask one more question of the \nChair, I was not here when the unanimous consent was entered into. What \ntime was the Senate to recess for the party caucuses?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate, under the previous order, will \nrecess at 12:30.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Boxer-Leahy amendment \nto House Joint Resolution 1, the constitutional balanced budget \namendment.\n  In fact, I think those of us who are concerned about such issues as \nnatural disasters and our country's response to them have to commend \nthe distinguished Senator from California for her leadership. She has \nbeen the spearhead in this area. I also thank Senator Bumpers and \nothers who have come with their support.\n  Senator Boxer has stated more passionately and eloquently than I ever \ncould the reason why this amendment would give Congress the authority \nto waive the balanced budget amendment if we need Federal relief for \nmajor disasters and emergencies, but only if they have been declared so \nby the President of the United States. And even then, if it had been \ndeclared so by the President, Congress would still--while it would have \nthe flexibility that it needs--require a majority vote of those present \nand voting in each House of Congress for Federal relief.\n  I would like to think that we would never have such an emergency. The \nfact of the matter is that we all know from even recent history that \nthe Federal Government has been called on to give critical aid to \nsupplement State and local efforts to protect the public health and \nsafety in response to major disasters and emergencies. Much of this aid \nhas been paid for by supplemental appropriations not only because of \nthe unexpected nature of the disasters but also because of the size of \nthe disasters.\n  Flooding in the Midwest a year ago was of a size and severity that \nnobody had predicted. Certainly the terrible scenes of the earthquake \nin Los Angeles are such that even as we watched them, most of us--\ncertainly here in the East--could hardly believe what we were seeing, \nand I expect the same could be said of the inhabitants of Los Angeles. \nTo just show you what happened, the chart I have here displays \nsupplemental appropriations from fiscal years 1989 through 1994. In \nthose years, Congress had to appropriate supplemental major disaster \nand emergency relief in every year but one. Look what we have.\n  In 1989, the administration requested $200 million. We ended up with \na supplemental of $1,108,000,000. In 1990, $1,150,000,000 went for \ndisaster relief. These were, incidentally, votes cast overwhelmingly by \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, realizing that the Nation faced, in \nparts of the country, such disasters that we could address them only as \na Nation, and that no one State or region could address it. The Nation \nhad to come together to do it.\n  In 1991, we were fortunate. There were no supplemental \nappropriations. But in 1992, the supplemental was $4,136,000,000. \nAgain, Mr. President, I ask, is there any part of the country, any one \nState that could, in facing a disaster, come up with $4 billion by \nitself? Not even the 10 most populated States could do that. Certainly \nin areas like my own--a State of under 600,000 people--we could not \nbegin to respond like that. In 1993, it was $2 billion. And last year, \n$4,709,000,000 in supplemental. That is a pretty significant \nsupplemental, especially when it came up to total outlays of \n$5,001,000,000.\n  To give you some idea of where this went, in 1992, over $4 billion in \nsupplemental appropriations went to a number of areas: the Los Angeles \nriots; Chicago floods; Hurricane Andrew. In 1993, it was $2 billion. \nThat went to help victims of the Midwest floods. In 1994, as we have \nalready said, it was $4 billion to help victims of the Northridge \nearthquake in Los Angeles.\n  In each one of these years, certainly it was my feeling that --and \nalso from the calls and letters that came to my office and the reaction \nfrom around the country--people realized that as a Nation we had to \ncome together. We had to spread the pain and the efforts to take care \nof these disasters.\n  I know firsthand the devastation of a major disaster and the benefits \nof swift Federal relief. Let me speak of one not the size of California \nor the Midwest, but I use as example my home town of Montpelier, VT, \nthe capital of our State. It is a beautiful capital, I might say, Mr. \nPresident. But it is a city of only 8,500 people. If it is not the \nsmallest in population of any capital, it is certainly among the \nsmallest.\n  I was born and raised in a home right on State Street, almost \ndiagonally across the street from our State capitol, a lovely marble \nbuilding--a little like a miniature version of this Capitol. It is \nnestled in the hills of Vermont, with a beautiful river running along \nit. But that river becomes the rub, because in 1992 we were hit by \nenormous amounts of rain, ice jams, and a flood--the worst flood in my \nlifetime in Vermont. In fact, it was the single greatest catastrophe to \nhit Montpelier since the floods of 1927.\n  I mention that because one of our country's largest newspapers \nreported after those floods that Vermont would never be heard from \nagain, that this natural calamity was such that it could wipe out the \nState of Vermont. We had been hit with a number of problems during the \nCivil War. We had one of the highest mortality rates of any State, on a \nper capita basis. Many of our soldiers that joined the Union during \nWorld War I--again, a case where Vermonters had answered the call so \nstrongly--never came back. And now this devastating flood. At that \ntime, the President of the United States went to Vermont and declared \nhelp and we had it.\n  In this case, in the downtown part of Montpelier, VT, virtually \neverything is on the same level. The town is surrounded by hills. The \nState House and everything are on the same level. All the stores along \nthe streets downtown, on which I had walked back and forth to school, \nwhere I delivered newspapers, were badly damaged and some were \ndestroyed. The printing shop that my father and mother had in downtown \nMontpelier, where we had been raised, was in that damaged area.\n  Again, there are 8,500 people, and unless you live there, that may \nnot seem like an enormous amount or anything in the grand scheme of \nthings. It obviously was to those of us from Montpelier, those of us \nwho lived there. I use the example of Montpelier not out of some \nparochial interest but because it showed what can go right in this \ncountry when there is a disaster.\n  I talked with the President about the floods. He was not a President \nof my own party. It was President Bush, who I want to say responded \nimmediately and showed great concern and talked with me about it. He \nsent Federal officials up to Montpelier. The President declared \nMontpelier and five surrounding counties a major disaster. He took a \npersonal interest in it. I want to commend President Bush for that.\n  The Federal Government swiftly provided disaster relief at a critical \ntime in the local cleanup effort. Major figures within the Bush \nadministration that were involved in disaster relief went to \nMontpelier, and when the cleanup effort was finally completed, the \nFederal Government had provided $4 million. That may not be much \ncompared to disasters in other parts of this country, but it was $4 \nmillion that the people of Vermont and the State of Vermont could not \nhave provided. And to the people of Vermont in Montpelier and other \nareas, that relief came at the darkest moment. Today, Montpelier is \nback as the beautiful capital it once was and will always be, and it \nenjoys a thriving downtown.\n  Now the current version of the balanced budget amendment would make \nit much harder for future Congresses to help victims of major disasters \nand emergencies like the Montpelier floods. Instead of a simple \nmajority, the balanced budget amendment would require a supermajority \nof both Houses of Congress to help major disaster and emergency victims \nthrough supplemental appropriations that might throw the budget out of \nbalance.\n  In fact, a small minority of both bodies could hold critical disaster \nand emergency relief hostage, making it impossible for the majority to \nspeak on such things.\n  And I might say, Mr. President, if your State is hit by a major \ndisaster or emergency, do you want, as a Member of this body, to have \ncritical Federal assistance hang on the whims of 41 Senators? I will \nfight for the 51, but I \n [[Page S2603]] would hate to have to have a supermajority.\n  I think relief for major disasters and emergencies has to be \nflexible, especially as it is often the aid that comes immediately that \nis most valuable and most needed, as compared to the aid that might \ncome a year or 2 or 3 years later. Disaster and emergency relief by \nconstitutional mandate is a prescription for gridlock, not for swift \naction, not for the help people need.\n  The Founding Fathers of this country rejected requirements of \nsupermajorities, and I think we ought to ask why. I mean, this was the \ntime that allowed this country to become the most powerful, most \nrespected democracy in history. We have to look at their sound reasons \nfor rejecting supermajority requirements before we impose on our \ncitizens a three-fifths supermajority vote to provide Federal relief \nfor major disasters and emergencies.\n  Go back to the Federalist papers, I believe it was No, 22, where \nAlexander Hamilton painted an alarming picture of the consequences of \nthe ``poison'' of supermajority requirements. Mr. Hamilton said that \nsupermajority requirements served ``to destroy the energy of the \ngovernment, and to substitute the pleasure, caprice, or artifices of an \ninsignificant, turbulent, or corrupt junto to the regular deliberations \nand decisions of a respectable majority.''\n  I could not say it better myself, Mr. President; would not even \npretend that I could come close.\n  But Alexander Hamilton said it very well in speaking of the \nsupermajority requirements as a recipe for increased gridlock and not \nmore efficient action.\n  Let me read again from Hamilton. He said: ``Hence, tedious delays; \ncontinual negotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of the \npublic good.''\n  In fact, I would go somewhat further, I say to my friend from \nCalifornia, even further than what Mr. Hamilton said. I would say that \nthe supermajority requirements reflect not only a basic distrust just \nof Congress, but of the electorate itself. I reject that notion. I \nreject the notion that somehow the majority of the people in this \ncountry cannot be expected to do what is right.\n  I fear that if you require a supermajority requirement, in effect, \nsaying we do not trust democracy, we do not trust a democracy and the \nrules of democracy that made us the greatest, most respected power on \nEarth, then you are going to lead Congress to play politics with \ncritical relief from disasters and emergencies; you will have them \nplaying politics with those very things that bind us together as a \nnation.\n  It is a question of a person in Vermont helping to respond to a \ndisaster in Colorado or Idaho or California, or vice versa. These are \nthe things that remind us why we have come together as a Union and why, \nas a democracy, even with the individual identities of our 50 great and \ndifferent States, those 50 great and different States come together to \nhelp each other when needed.\n  Even today, where we have a simple majority requirement for \nsupplemental appropriations for disaster and emergency relief, we have \nseen the potential for partisan politics. And even with a simple \nmajority, if you have a chance at partisan politics, imagine what it \nwould be with a supermajority.\n  In fact, last Friday's Wall Street Journal reported that:\n\n       A multibillion-dollar disaster-aid package for California \n     is caught in the budget wars between President Clinton and \n     House Republicans.\n\n  The Journal article reported that the House Republican leadership was \ndelaying action on a request from the President for $6.7 billion in \nsupplemental appropriations for emergency relief for victims of the \nCalifornia floods and Los Angeles earthquake.\n  Now, Senator Boxer, our distinguished colleague from California, well \ndocumented this gamesmanship. Earlier today, she read from the House \nRepublican leadership's letter. That, plus the Wall Street Journal \narticle, shows exactly what can happen with the politics of a simple \nmajority. Can you imagine what it would be like if you are talking \nabout a supermajority? If you would have to clear that supermajority \nhurdle to pass disaster emergency relief, what we have seen in that \nletter and what we have seen in the Wall Street Journal article would \nlook like child's play.\n  I am no fan of the balanced budget amendment. As I have said before, \nI worry why we should even have to start amending the Constitution for \neverything. I worry that some of the strongest supporters of the \nbalanced budget amendment are the same people that voted for the \nenormous deficits of the Reagan era, and now say we need a \nconstitutional amendment so in the year 2002 somebody will pay off the \nbills we ran up in the eighties, and of those who speak of a deficit \ntoday without realizing those deficits are basically just paying \ninterest on the debt they voted for in the last decade. But I digress.\n  Even as bad an idea as the balanced budget amendment is, this \namendment would improve what is a flawed balanced budget amendment. I \nthink we should tear down as a requirement the supermajority barrier. \nOtherwise, you are telling future Congresses they are not going to be \nable to provide the critical disaster and emergency relief that would \nbe needed by those in other parts of our country.\n  So, Mr. President, I commend the Senator from California. I thank her \nfor yielding me this time. I strongly support the Boxer-Leahy \namendment. I am pleased and proud to have had my name joined on her \namendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. I just want to make \nsure we reserved the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time of the \nSenator from California to her or to her control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, at this time, I will only speak briefly to \nthe Boxer amendment. But I think it is important that the record of the \nCongress, as it relates to dealing with emergencies in our country and \ndisasters in our country so declared by our President, be very clear \nfor the record.\n  The Senator from California and the Senator from Vermont are \nabsolutely correct. There has not been a time in the Congress of the \nUnited States, when we were faced with a natural disaster that had \nbadly damaged a State or region of the country and put our citizens in \nperil, that we did not respond.\n  And so, when I was looking at crafting a balanced budget amendment, \nalong with a lot of other Senators and Representatives, one of the \nthings we needed to recognize was the very thing the Senator from \nCalifornia is speaking about; that the amendment itself and the \nrequirement, because we wanted to put it in the Constitution, could not \nbe so rigid as not to respond to the needs of the public. And so we \nprovided the supermajority to be the escape valve, if you will. But \nonly under a critical situation could it be applied, not under the \nsimple majority, not even the constitutional majority that I am \nsurprised the Senator did not require in her amendment.\n  Be that as it may, here is what the record of the U.S. Congress has \nbeen like for the last decade in responding to natural disasters. In \n1989, for Hugo, pictures 1 and 2 so demonstrated on that display by the \nSenator from California, the Senate voted 97 to 1, almost 37 votes \nbeyond the supermajority required by our amendment, to fund Hugo.\n  There was no question in the mind of any Senator that this was not \nsomething that we ought to respond to.\n  The House voted 321 to 99, clearly beyond the supermajority target \nthat we have spoken about and that is embodied within the Constitution.\n  It causes us all to think. It causes us all to be tremendously \ndedicated to looking at the details of the proposal as presented by the \nBudget Committee or by the President for us to consider an emergency, \nand that we should do. It ought not be the snap of a finger and a \nsimple majority here, not even a constitutional majority, to do so. But \nclearly, we fell under the purviews of the amendment as it is proposed, \nnot the Boxer amendment, but Senate Joint Resolution 1, the true \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Again, in 1990, the Hugo supplemental, the Senate voice voted it. It \nwas so easy to get through the Senate, \n [[Page S2604]] so understanding that there was a crisis down there \nthat had to be adhered to that we voice voted it. The House, 362 to 59, \nan even larger vote than the initial supplemental appropriation for the \nHugo disaster.\n  In 1992, Andrew, Senate, 84 to 10; House, 297 to 124, once again, \nwell beyond the supermajority that is required under the Constitution.\n  The Midwest floods, in 1993, the House voted 400 to 27; the Senate \nvoice voted it. We recognized the magnitude of that disaster, and we \nresponded to it.\n  In essence, what I am saying is, in every case I cited, what the \nSenator from California is proposing simply was not necessary and, at \nthe same time, under the amendment as I and others have drafted it, we \nallowed this kind of flexibility and the standard was met, though it \ncould have been waived. But what our amendment would do would cause the \nSenate and the House to seriously consider and work with the States to \nmake sure that the money was being well spent, that the States could \nnot handle their particular disaster and that, in the end, if it was \nabsolutely necessary, the general public of this country, the general \ntaxpayer, would respond through the General Treasury of our Federal \nbudget.\n  The 1994 L.A. earthquake, the very kind that the Senator from \nCalifornia is talking about that has brought her to the floor with her \nconcern--and I do not question that concern in any sense--what was the \nvote in the Senate? 85 to 10, well beyond the 60 that would be required \nunder the constitutional amendment. The House voted 337 to 74.\n  From 1978 down through 1994, time and time again, and as I look at \nthe voting record I find in only one situation in the Senate where, \nunder the supplementals as they were proposed, the supermajority would \nnot have been acquired. And in most instances, where the House had a \nrecorded vote, the Senate voice voted it. What does that voice vote \nexpress? That without question, this was something that the Senate \njointly, in a majority, in fact with a unanimous vote, agreed to.\n  Having said that and looking at the details of the amendment as \nproposed by the Senator from California, what we find here is a waiving \nby a simple majority for an entire year of any moneys that might be \nnecessary. I believe that is an opening up of this amendment that \ncannot be accepted.\n  I also believe that the premise, not the emotion, not the concern and \nnot the dedication by which the Senator from California has offered \nthis amendment, but under the premise of what she has offered the \namendment, that the supermajority could not be acquired, simply does \nnot exist on the record. The record clearly shows that this Senate time \nand time again, by a supermajority vote in the seventies and eighties \nand nineties and unanimously, has voted out the supplemental moneys to \nfund the emergencies that she talks about because she, like I, \nunderstands that what can happen to California might some day happen to \nthe State of Idaho or it might happen to the State of Vermont, as the \nSenator from Vermont spoke.\n  Where we may differ is on different funding programs. On these \nnational disasters where the lives and the properties of our citizens \nare truly in peril, we have always stood united. It is on the extra \nwhere it is really questionable whether the money can be wisely spent \ndo you find the House or the Senate backing away.\n  In fact, in the instances of California, it has been the Governor of \nCalifornia over the last several years that has been saying to the \nFederal Government, ``Get out of my way, back away from your \nregulations and your obstacles and your controls, we can do it for less \nmoney. Your Feds and your regulators have created environments that are \nmuch more costly in responding to the needs of the citizenry.''\n  As it happened in the California earthquake, it has happened in the \nCalifornia floods recently where the Governor has had to say to the \nFederal Government, ``Back away, let us do it quickly and let us do it \nright and we can save hundreds of millions of dollars.''\n  While that is not directed at this amendment or the amendment that \nthe Senator is amending, my point is, with restraint and with the \ncurrent understanding of the Congress of the United States, these \nproblems can be handled through the current amendment as it was \ncrafted. Both the House Judiciary and Senate Judiciary Committees \nunderstood these problems, and it is my premise, my firm belief that it \nis dealt with in the amendment and the amendment by the Senator from \nCalifornia simply is not necessary to deal with her concerns or the \nconcerns that I have as it deals with national disaster.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  The Senator from Idaho is a wonderful debater and he fights hard for \nhis State and he makes his points well. I have to say to the Senator, \nhe is incorrect in some of the things he has just stated, and I would \nlike to particularly point out that when the Senator from Idaho says \nthat the Governor of California says to the Federal Government, ``Back \naway,'' when it comes to disasters, you have the wrong Governor.\n  Pete Wilson is here after every disaster or calling, as well he \nshould, Members of the Senate, Members of the Congress on a bipartisan \nbasis saying, ``Help us in this disaster.''\n  So where the Senator from Idaho gets the idea that former Senator \nWilson, currently Governor Wilson, does not want the Federal \nGovernment's help in a disaster, I do not know because I have never \nseen that happen. As a matter of fact, I would say to my friend----\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me finish and then I will be happy to yield to you. I \nsay to my friend, not only does he want help 90 percent of the way, he \nasked us to waive the law so we can pay for California 100 percent of \nthe way. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I was not referencing the money, and that is exactly what \nthe Senator from California was talking about. What I was referencing \nare the rules and regulations, the web of regulations that causes the \nrebuilding of freeways at twice the expense it ought to cost or the \nreplacing of a bridge in Monterey, CA, that costs twice as much because \nyou have to do environmental impact statements and all of those kinds \nof things.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me just take--do you want to take it on your own \ntime? Would the Senator like to take it on his own time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. My point is, the Governor from California asked those \nrules be waived.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Parliamentary inquiry. Who has the time at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has the floor. The \nSenator may yield if she wishes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am not going to yield on my time. If the Senator would \nlike to yield on his time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If I can complete my statement on my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. CRAIG. You and I do not have any disagreement. I was referencing \nFederal rules and regulations that the Governor of California did ask \nthat the Feds back away from so they can complete the freeway \nrebuilding way ahead of schedule. That is exactly what happened. I was \nnot referencing money. You are absolutely right, the Governor of \nCalifornia was here and by a supermajority of the U.S. Senate, \ncompletely within the compliance of the amendment we have proposed, the \nGovernor of California got the money he asked for.\n  Thank you. I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me say to my friend, perhaps my friend does not \nremember this, the Governor from California almost did not get the \nmoney because to rebuild this Cypress structure, let me tell you what \nthe vote was. The vote was 43 to 52. We only got 52 votes to rebuild \nthis structure.\n  I want to make the point, when I started my rebuttal to my friend, \nthat the facts are not what they are alleged to be by my friend from \nIdaho. He makes a great debating point. He says we always vote a \nsupermajority. Wrong, we do not.\n   [[Page S2605]] The vote to rebuild this structure, a direct result \nof the Loma Prieta earthquake, was not a supermajority. And I say to my \nfriends who are going to vote against this amendment, beware, because \nyou may not get the 60 votes.\n  Now, the Senator from Idaho makes the point that he corrects the \nrecord. He said, oh, yes, Governor Wilson did not back away from the \nmoney; he wanted you to back off on regulations. Let me again say for \nthe record the cooperation between the Clinton administration's Federal \nEmergency Management Agency and the State disaster team headed by Dick \nAndrews is superlative. They worked together, as they should, and they \nwere able to be flexible enough to rebuild freeways in record time. But \nto say that the Governor of the State of California was up here telling \nus to back away does not make any sense whatsoever in this regard \nbecause what this is about is getting the funding. Of course, that is \nwhat this is about. This Boxer-Leahy amendment is about getting the \nfunding.\n  I see that my friend from Maine is in the Chamber. I have had the \nprivilege of working with her for many years over in the House. And, \nbelieve it or not, we do work together on some things, and I hope \nsometime in the Senate soon we will be able to do that again.\n  I call to her attention the facts about Maine, that between the years \nof 1989 and 1994, Maine received disaster funds nine times for \nflooding, ice jam, severe storms, Hurricane Bob, coastal storms, heavy \nrains, ice jams--these are all the different incidents--snow, severe \nblizzard conditions, the Yellow Mine fire.\n  I am sure she knows of all of these things very, very well. It is \nimportant to point out to her and all my colleagues here because I \nthink when we talk about disasters and we look at this chart again, we \nsee they have been all over the country. I would say to my friend from \nMaine, I hope she is never in a position that I was in where I almost \nwas unable to get the funding from this Senate to complete this \nhorrible problem where the Cypress structure fell down. Also, it is an \neconomic issue if people cannot get to work.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be glad to yield on her time.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I would like to make a point.\n  How much time does the majority have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 20 minutes 15 seconds. The \nSenator from California controls 87 minutes 39 seconds.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chair. I will do it on my time.\n  I just want to respond to the Senator from California because the \nSenator is correct in suggesting that the State of Maine has benefited \nfrom emergency supplemental assistance in times of disaster, as have \nmany States throughout the country, including her State of California.\n  I think the point is that Congress has risen to that occasion, has \ndemonstrated its compassion when it has been necessary to respond to \nemergencies and disasters as they have occurred in this country over \nthe past years. And unfortunately and regrettably, California has had \nmore than its share. I think the point is that we do not want to \nobviate the need for a balanced budget amendment, because I think what \nthe Senator's amendment is doing is essentially, by requiring just a \nmajority vote in each house, definitely eliminating the requirements of \nthe three-fifths majority to raise the debt ceiling. So a simple \nmajority could remove the requirements for a balanced budget amendment \nin making the decisions on supplemental appropriations. So really it is \ncircumventing the entire intent of the constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget.\n  As the Senator from Idaho indicated with his examples, time and time \nagain the House and the Senate, far beyond a three-fifths requirement, \nhave in fact approved many of the emergency supplementals to respond to \nthe disasters that have occurred in California, Maine, and elsewhere. \nSo we have demonstrated that on many occasions.\n  I think the concern that I and many of us have about the amendment of \nthe Senator is that basically it is going to undermine the \neffectiveness of the balanced budget amendment because it only requires \na simple majority in the dead of night to remove the three-fifths \nrequirement of the balanced budget amendment. That would really preempt \nthe effectiveness of a balanced budget amendment, not to mention the \namount of money that we might indebt ourselves because it would only be \na simple majority.\n  So I would like to respond to the Senator from California in that \nregard. We certainly understand what she is trying to do. But I think \nthe point is here that the balanced budget amendment will take care of \nthat with a three-fifths majority. In many cases that is exactly what \nhas happened in the House and Senate without a balanced budget \namendment. We have done that and will do that in the future. And a \nbalanced budget amendment will not preclude our compassion in instances \nof disasters and when we recognize a justifiable need.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I will make a couple of remarks and I \nwill yield to my friend, or let him take as much time as he wishes.\n  I wish to say to my friend from Maine I never ever have questioned \nher compassion. I do not worry about her vote in an emergency. But we \nare putting an amendment into the Constitution here, and when the \nSenator from Maine talks about an exception for a disaster ``just a \nmajority vote in the dead of night,'' I am stunned with that phrase. \nJust a majority vote. I would assure the Senator if she won by just a \nmajority vote, which she did, and fairly so, and a nice majority--I do \nnot think it was 60 percent. I might be wrong. Was it 60 percent? She \ndid.\n  Well, this Senator won by a margin of 6 percentage points, a little \nbit under, but I do not think that the Senator from Maine would \nquestion the fact that a majority vote is a hallmark of democracy. So \nto talk about ``just a majority vote in the dead of night'' is \nastounding to me.\n  As a matter of fact, I say to my colleague from Vermont, it makes me \nfeel so much stronger about this amendment than I did before because if \nthat is the attitude of the other side of the aisle, ``a majority vote \nin the dead of night,'' that is a statement against majority rule and \nagainst democracy and for tyranny of the minority, and it gives me \ngreat trouble in my heart and soul to hear that kind of language on the \nSenate floor--``just a majority vote in the dead of night.''\n  I say to my friend, we did not get a supermajority to rebuild the \nCypress structure.\n  Show me the next chart here. Let me show you what else did not get \n``a majority vote in the dead of night'' or middle of the day--this, \nthe Midwest flood, an amendment by Senator Durenberger to offset the \nmoney, not to leave these people without help--a majority vote, just a \nmajority vote. Fortunately, it did not prevail. If we have a balanced \nbudget amendment, it is not a majority vote. It is a supermajority \nvote. I have shown you two occasions where that did not happen. And had \nthe balanced budget amendment been in place, we could not have rebuilt \nthe Cypress structure and we could not have helped the people in the \nMidwest floods because there was a requirement for an offset.\n  I am going to yield to my friend from Vermont and then my friend from \nWashington before we have the break for the various conferences, but I \nwant to again let my colleague know, maybe she is unaware, that the \nHouse Speaker signed on to a letter--I wonder whether the Senator's \nState is even affected by this--talking about the emergency \nsupplemental that is coming up which deals with natural disasters.\n\n       Whether these activities are emergencies or not, it will be \n     our policy to pay for them rather than add to the deficit.\n\n  Which means in plain, simple language they are going to have to cut \nother programs, and I assure you, we may have a lot of trouble getting \nfunding for those States. As I understand it, 40 States are involved in \nthat.\n  So I yield to my friend from Vermont as much time as he needs; saving \nsome time for my colleague from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n   [[Page S2606]] Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I will be very brief. I \nhave suggested over and over again on this floor as one who reveres the \nConstitution, I worry very much when we add anything to the \nConstitution at all, but I especially worry when we add \nsupermajorities.\n  This is not a case, when we have matters involving great disasters, \nwhere somehow we slip in here in the dead of night and pass them. One \nof the things I cherish about the House and Senate is that they are \nopen to the public and the press at every hour when we are in session. \nPeople can see, especially with television, exactly what we vote on and \nhow we vote on it. That is, of course, as it should be.\n  But my concern on supermajorities again is what Alexander Hamilton \nsaid when he spoke: ``Hence, tedious delays; continual negotiations and \nintrigue; contemptible compromises of the public good.''\n  Madam President, I have managed more bills on the floor of the \nSenate, I believe, than anybody who is presently on the floor. I have \nmanaged a number of major bills, including disaster bills. I know by \nthe time we come to the floor, there have been all kinds of \nnegotiations or other steps before the bill even gets here on the \nfloor. Sometimes it has been joked that more legislation gets passed in \nthe Cloakrooms or the elevators than on the floor.\n  But the fact of the matter is on a major bill you have Senators of \nboth parties and members of the administration going back and forth \nnegotiating what might be done. Those negotiations would be seen in an \nentirely different light if anybody involved in them knows whatever you \nhave to do requires a supermajority.\n  I have won close elections and I have won landslide elections. I have \nbeen fortunate that every single time I have run for office in my \nnative State I have gotten more votes than I did the time before. I \nappreciate that kind of trust that the people of Vermont have shown.\n  I also remember the statement of my father, God rest his soul, that \nit is better to win by one vote than lose by a landslide. But what he \nwas doing was referencing that under our system of democracy one vote \nmakes you a majority.\n  In a country that has seen the benefits of adhering to democratic \nprinciples of majority votes, we should be always very, very hesitant \nwhen we do anything to change the requirement of just a majority vote \nand especially hesitant to write it into that sacred covenant, our \nConstitution.\n  So I hope we will think back to what Alexander Hamilton said. As we \nstand here almost in indecent haste, wanting to amend our Constitution, \nthink of a little bit of history. Think of a little bit of history.\n  We have only amended the Constitution 17 times since the Bill of \nRights. Already in this session alone there have been about 75 \nproposals to amend it. Somehow this country, this great, wonderful, \npowerful democracy, the model democracy for the world, has been able to \nsurvive for 200 years with only 17 amendments after the Bill of Rights. \nSomehow since the elections of November the country has gone to such \nhell in a hand basket because we now need 75 new proposals to amend the \nConstitution.\n  Madam President, I do not believe that is happening. My State was not \none of the Thirteen Original--it was the 14th State. But I know people \nin my own State feel we should go slowly in making changes.\n  I yield to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I yield so much time as she may consume \nto the Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague from California for sponsoring this \namendment, and I am honored to be here today as a strong cosponsor of \nthis amendment, to add my voice of support to those of my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senator Boxer and Senator Leahy.\n  One's decision on this amendment can be made very easily. If any of \nmy colleagues can foresee their state's future forever free of \ndisasters and emergencies, then their opposition to this amendment will \nbe understood. Lacking the powers of Nostradamus, though, all of us \nmust realize the unfortunate certainty of natural disasters and \nunpredictable emergencies.\n  A balanced budget, we all agree is a goal we must work towards \nrapidly. I am concerned however, that House Joint Resolution 1 would \nblock the ability of the Federal Government to respond immediately in \nthe event of a national disaster. The current proposal's only exception \nfrom the requirement of a three-fifths vote to approve spending above a \nbalanced budget is upon a declaration of war.\n  This flexibility is needed, however not only to defend our national \nsecurity, it is just as needed to defend our security against natural \ndisasters and unforeseen emergencies that would require an immediate \nresponse by Congress and the President.\n  I have come to know the tragedy of natural disasters through the \nheavy and devastating tolls they have placed upon the residents of \nWashington State. From the unusual volcanic eruption of Mount St. \nHelens to seasonal fires and floods, Washingtonians have responded to \nthese increasing emergencies through the support of our Federal \nGovernment. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is the only body \nprepared to handle disasters of this magnitude. Their ability to \nquickly respond is the key to emergency management.\n  FEMA's mission is to provide national leadership and support to \nreduce the loss of life and property. This endeavor serves not only \nthose impacted by the disaster but begins the economic steps of \nrebuilding the community.\n  I am sure many of my colleagues have toured disaster sites \nimmediately following an emergency. These are the memories we should \nrecall when deciding whether a balanced budget overrides the concerns \nof our constituents in need. I had the unfortunate opportunity to visit \nthe fire-ravaged lands of my State last summer. Hearing the stories of \nthose left homeless, of firefighters burned while saving others, puts a \nvery real face on the numbers we hear in the news. A few moments ago my \ncolleague from California, Senator Boxer, put up a chart by Air, Risk \nEngineering, Inc., that predicted that a Seattle earthquake may occur \nin the very near future of 7.5 magnitude, costing as much as $33-plus \nbillion.\n  I cannot imagine going back to my State in those times of pain and \nsuffering and explaining to my neighbors that a balanced budget \namendment prevents them from receiving assistance. Just as we mandate \nthat hospitals can not turn away those in need of medical attention, \nthe Government of the people cannot turn its back on those ravaged by \nunforeseen natural disasters.\n  Sadly, none of us are immune from nature's wrath. Fires in my State \nare no different from hurricanes on the gulf, flooding in the Midwest, \nice storms in the East, or earthquakes in California. In 1994 alone, \nFEMA responded to 36 major disasters totaling over $3.6 billion. \nRemember that 90 percent of all disasters are funded through \nsupplemental appropriations. No budget can prepare for the destruction, \nthe death, or the injury caused by these unforgiving tragedies.\n  All of our hearts are extended to the citizens of Kobe, Japan who \nhave experienced one of the greatest disasters of recent history. If \nany lesson can be unearthed from that devastation, it is a sign of our \nfeeble attempt to control nature. Technology and preparedness can not \ncombat the unrelenting will of the Earth.\n  At best, in an emergency we can respond and cope. Our ability to aid \ndisaster victims and rebuild fallen communities must not be held \nhostage by political amendments. I urge my colleagues to support the \nBoxer-Leahy amendment and remember their constituents who may well be \nthe victims of their State's next natural disaster.\n  I thank my colleague from California and I yield her back the time.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I want to respond to a couple of points \nof the Senator from California. I will be very brief.\n  The point is she makes reference to one project with respect to the \nfact they did not receive a supermajority \n [[Page S2607]] vote. Yet, time and again, as I mentioned earlier in my \nremarks, the House and the Senate voted on emergency disaster funds \nwith overwhelming votes. The fact is that out of 14 occasions since \n1978, all but 2 were passed by voice vote here in the U.S. Senate. They \nwere passed by overwhelming votes in the House every time there was a \nrecorded vote taken. And I have before me a resolution that passed on \nOctober 26, 1989, a joint resolution, by a vote of 97 to 1 here in the \nSenate. It provides specifically for funding for reconstruction of \nhighways which were damaged as a result of Hurricane Hugo in September \n1989 and the Loma Prieta earthquake of October 17, 1989. In fact, that \nsection refers to the fact that the $100 million limitation contained \nin that section shall not apply to the expenditures with reference to \nthe reconstruction of those highways in either one of those disasters.\n  The point is that time and time again the House and the Senate have \ndemonstrated their compassion and their acknowledgment of the serious \ndamage that has been done by the events beyond one's control. I think \nit is important to reference that.\n  I know the Senator was making reference to my comments about a simple \nmajority the other night. I should remind the Senator that often I was \nreminded in my campaign about the midnight pay raise that occurred here \nin the U.S. Senate a few years ago. But it did occur in the dead of \nnight. And it may have been off the budget. But no one was informed of \nthe fact that vote was going to be taken. The point in all of this is \nthat we have been on record in recognizing disasters and that we were \nwilling to take the action necessary.\n  The Senator's amendment would really bypass and I think really render \nthe balanced budget amendment ineffective by only requiring a simple \nmajority--a simple majority--to waive the requirement of the balanced \nbudget amendment. That is the issue here. We well know that this could \neasily circumvent the intent and the purpose of the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I know that sometimes in debate both \nsides might use overstatement. But I have to respond to this one. To \nsay that this exception for disaster--by the way, there is already an \nexception in the balanced budget amendment. Let us not get away with \nnot recognizing that--declaration of war. I assume that my friend fully \nsupports that exception. I am sure she does because she supports the \namendment as it is. There is an exception because, yes, in the dead of \nnight we might declare war, and we do not want to see that a minority \ncould stop us from funding that national emergency.\n  So let us not make it seem that the Boxer-Leahy amendment is opening \nup an exception in and of itself because it is not. What we are saying \nis in time of war, says the amendment, there is an exception to the \nthree-fifths vote, the 60 votes. We agree. What the Boxer-Leahy et al., \nSenator Feinstein, Senator Johnston, Senator Inouye, Senator Akaka, and \nothers are saying, sometimes our people are in deep trouble. Let us \ntake a look at this.\n  This is deep trouble. There is deep water. They are trying to survive \na hurricane. Guess what? That is a disaster too. People are killed, I \nsay to my friend from Maine, in disasters as sure as people are killed \nin national emergencies that see us bringing home coffins from far away \nplaces. What we are saying is it is time to make sure that we do not \ntake the Constitution that has worked so well and go back to the days \nof the Federalist papers, when the Articles of Confederation did not \nwork so well--they were called radical--when we said we have to get a \nsupermajority vote to act. We are saying no. We are not opening up an \nexceptions clause here. There already is an exceptions clause. This \nlooks like a war, I say to my friend. This looks like war. So does \nthis. So does this. So does this. It is a war on our people which comes \nfrom a natural disaster. We are saying let us not require a \nsupermajority.\n  What I find amazing is that the argument is made over and over that \nit is easy to get these supermajorities. The fact is my colleagues are \nignoring specific votes that just took place in which we failed to get \na supermajority to help the people in the flood and we failed to get a \nsupermajority to rebuild this freeway. So I am not making up some doom \nand gloom scenario. And my friends are ignoring a letter from the \nRepublican leadership in the House saying--my friends, it is in black \nand white; it is in the Record; read it--they are not going to act on \nthat emergency supplemental until they can figure out what they are \ngoing to cut in Maine, in Texas, in California, wherever they decide \nthey are going to cut.\n  So my friend from Maine is engaging in a wishful thought when she \nsays we will always respond, that it is easy to get 60 votes. I show \nher the Record. I show her in the Record. As a matter of fact, one of \nthose was led by Senator Dole. I think it is going to be very \ninteresting when he comes to northern California. I am going to take \nhim to see the Cypress Freeway. He led the fight not to fund it. I had \nto fight against Senator Dole. That was hard. We won, though. We were \nable to make our case, despite his eloquence, that in fact this was a \ndisaster and it needed to be funded. But I could not get 60 votes on \nthat vote. What did I get? Fifty-two. So it was a bare two-vote \nmajority. We could fix this freeway.\n  I see my friend from Hawaii has come on to the floor, a major sponsor \nof this amendment. I have a picture here to share with him from \nHurricane Iniki in Hawaii. If this does not look like a war zone, what \ndoes?\n  I thank my friend from sponsoring the amendment. I would like to \nyield to him at this time.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, the amendment by the Senator from \nCalifornia is deserving of most serious consideration because nature's \nwork and God's work are unpredictable, for one thing. In the case of \nHurricane Iniki, if that hurricane had proceeded just one-quarter of a \ndegree to the west, it would have devastated the city of Honolulu. And \nthe cost of that would have been astronomical. It would not have been \n$1 billion, $2 billion, or even $3 billion. It would have exceeded $50 \nbillion. To suggest that this is not an unusual cost item would seem \nrather strange.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I want to again thank the Senator from \nHawaii. He is a leader in this U.S. Senate making sure that our country \nis prepared for defending itself. He is the ranking member on the \nDefense Appropriations Committee. And to have his support, his active \nsupport, is very meaningful to me as well as Senator Akaka. Let me tell \nyou why. They have seen the faces of the children and the old people \nand the young people and the families who get into these situations.\n  Madam President, it is my understanding that we are going to stop \nthis debate momentarily and then come back after the conferences for \nlunch.\n  I ask at this time that I retain the balance of my time.\n  How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 56 minutes and \n21 seconds, the majority side has 15 minutes and 13 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Madam President. I look forward to \nresuming this debate when we return from the caucus lunches.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2597-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from California is recognized.\n   [[Page S2608]] Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is certainly my honor, \nunder the previous order, to continue debating an amendment that I have \noffered on behalf of myself, Senator Leahy, and several other Senators, \nwhich essentially would say that should the balanced budget amendment \nbecome part of the Constitution, in addition to a waiver for a \ndeclaration of war, where you would no longer have to have 60 votes to \ngo out of balance but a majority vote, that you would add to that \nexception a federally declared, Presidentially declared, \ncongressionally declared, natural disaster--an emergency.\n  I think it is very important because if you really look around the \ncountry, you can see that we really live in a country where we are at \nrisk. If you look here on the chart, here are the earthquake risks. We \ncan see them not just in the West, by the way, but here and all the way \nacross. The tornado risks are centered here, some of these quite \nextreme in the smaller circle. The hurricane risks are here; some are \nnoted over here and, of course, closer to the coast is a tremendous \nrisk of hurricanes. On the entire west coast here, as well as the \nislands, the risk of tsunami, which is a terrible, overpowering wave \nthat occurs because of an earthquake in the ocean floor.\n  So as we look at our Nation--the most beautiful Nation on Earth, the \nmost prosperous Nation on Earth, the most wonderful Nation on Earth--we \ndo have times when we have disasters, and if ever there was a time to \npull together as one, it certainly would be during those times.\n  In the course of the debate this morning, there were those who said: \nSenator Boxer, you are totally right, we do have these problems, but \nthere has not really been any time when the Nation has not responded \nand the Senate has not responded overwhelmingly, as well as the House. \nThe truth is that there have been occasions where we have not received \n60 votes to move ahead when there was earthquake rebuilding or, \nfrankly, recovery from flood. I have documented that on at least two \noccasions in the Senate where we did not get 60 votes. We got 52 on one \noccasion and 54 on another occasion. Today I read into the Record \nexcerpts of something from House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the \nleadership of the House which says very clearly that they are not \ninterested in funding these emergencies off budget. In fact, they will \nnot even consider funding them until they are offset.\n  What does this mean? It means that if there is a horrible disaster \nanywhere in our Nation--and it could occur anywhere--and if the view of \nthe new Republican Speaker of the House prevails --and he seems to have \nthe votes over there on everything he has done--there would have to be \noffsets, and you could not, in fact, take care of an emergency the way \nwe have done it in the past.\n  I want to make it clear that in the past, under every single Budget \nAct we have had, we have always exempted emergencies. I think this is a \nvery important point to make at this time in the debate.\n  The Republican-controlled Office of Management and Budget in 1990 \nsaid, in the budget summit agreement of 1990, that ``for a \nPresidentially declared emergency request for supplementals or regular \nappropriations bills, the across-the-board offset would not apply to \nthe extent the fund requested by the President * * *.''\n  In other words, that is bureaucratic language to say that when a \nsupplemental appropriation does come down to the Senate floor because \nwe have run out of money for an emergency, it will not have to be \noffset, as everything else would have to be. In other words, if, in the \nmiddle of the budget year, a Senator comes down to the floor with a \ngreat new idea on how to teach our children and has a great grant \nprogram that he or she wants to put forward, that would have to be \noffset with spending cuts.\n  But, under the bipartisan agreement of that 1990 Budget Act and, as I \nstated before, agreed to by the Office of Management and Budget, which \nwas a Republican Office of Management and Budget, emergencies would not \nhave to have offsets.\n  Additionally, under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, which amended the Budget \nAct, the same thing was true. There was an exception from ordinary \nbudget rules and ordinary budget caps for disaster emergencies.\n  So, basically, the Boxer-Leahy amendment, which would give this \nconstitutional amendment more flexibility, is actually in line with all \nthe other budget laws.\n  One of my colleagues said today, in opposition, ``Well, Senator, your \namendment would do violence to the balanced budget amendment.'' And I \nam quoting her, I think, directly. She said ``In the dead of night, you \ncould come in here and, with a mere majority, take this budget out of \nbalance.''\n  The fact of the matter is, in a bipartisan way, ever since the \n1980's, we have been working with the assumption that when an emergency \nstrikes, we would meet that emergency and not wait until we identified \nother parts of the budget to cut. Under the balanced budget amendment \nas it is before us, without the Boxer-Leahy amendment added, we would \nneed 60 votes, my friends, to act in an emergency.\n  I want to go over these charts one more time. One of my colleagues \nwill be arriving shortly, at which time I am going to yield him the \nfloor.\n  This is a chart that shows the probable costs of future natural \ndisasters, because many times we look back and we learn from history. \nAnd that is very important. What we learn from history now is we do not \nalways get 60 votes to respond to a disaster. That is why I find this \nBoxer-Leahy amendment so important, because we would have been in big \ntrouble if that 60-vote requirement had been before us.\n  But let me show you what is predicted here by the experts. Starting \non the east coast, we are looking at class 4 hurricanes here in the \nNortheast. This looks like one is out of New Jersey and one is out of \nNew York. These would impact on all these States here, up and down the \nNortheast, $45 billion here--that is the loss that would be incurred--\n$52 billion, a class 4 hurricane here in New Jersey; in Virginia, a \nclass 5 hurricane, costs $33 billion. Remember, just because it starts \nhere does not mean it does not impact the whole coast. It impacts the \nwhole coast and I would say inland areas, as well.\n  In Miami, looking at another huge class 5 hurricane, $53 billion in \nlosses; in New Orleans, a class 5 hurricane, $25 billion; in Texas, a \nclass 5 hurricane at $42 billion.\n  Centered in Memphis--it is interesting because people think about \nearthquakes being a California phenomena--one of the largest predicted \nearthquakes in the future, 8.6 on the Richter scale, $69.7 billion, is \ncentered in Memphis, again affecting all these midsection States.\n  And in Seattle, a 7.5 earthquake--something else that is not really \nthought about, the Northwest, an earthquake here; a predicted \nearthquake in San Francisco, in Los Angeles; in Honolulu, a class 4 \nhurricane.\n  So we see, these are just the biggest, most expensive disasters.\n  I want to point out to my friends that in fact, every single State in \nthe Union, according to a report that I read into the Record, is \nsubjected to floods--floods that could be very, very damaging.\n  So I say that the Boxer-Leahy amendment, which has many cosponsors at \nthis point and gaining all the time, speaks to an issue that is of \ngreat import to the entire Nation. Again, there is a change in \natmosphere now. That is why this amendment is so important.\n  We have the Speaker of the House, the new Republican Speaker, proudly \nsends a letter, saying to the President, ``Do not bother sending up an \nemergency supplemental''--by the way covering 40 States, 40 States that \nneed this money in the emergency supplemental--``unless you cut \nspending elsewhere.''\n  Now, all of us want to be fiscally responsible. I cast one of the \ntoughest votes of my life when I voted for the deficit reduction bill. \nThe fact of the matter is it passed by one vote and, as a result, we \nhave cut the deficit in half from where it was supposed to be. That was \na tough vote.\n  The balanced budget amendment vote, that is an easy vote. That is an \neasy vote. You are not voting to cut anything. You are just going to go \nhome and tell your constituencies that you are a fiscal conservative.\n   [[Page S2609]] Well, I think the question Americans have to ask, and \nI think they need to ask, their Senator and their Congressperson is \nthis: ``Do you vote for an amendment to the Constitution that is going \nto take effect in 2002 if the States ratify it?'' Or, ``Do you have the \nguts and the courage to vote to cut spending now?'' And, ``Are you \ngoing to vote for an amendment that ties the hands of the Federal \nGovernment to respond to ensure domestic tranquility?'' Which is so \nimportant it is in the preamble to the Constitution.\n  And do you have domestic tranquility when you have situations like \nthis?\n  Hurricane Hugo in South Carolina. You can see the faces of these \nvictims. The Cypress Freeway in Oakland, which, by the way, we could \nnot get 60 votes to fix. So unless Boxer-Leahy passes, the Cypress \nFreeway could have remained this way.\n  Look at this, Hurricane Andrew in Florida. It looks like any war zone \nyou could imagine.\n  And the beautiful blue sky of Hawaii, look at what was once a \nbeautiful home after Hurricane Iniki.\n  These are times when you want to help people, whether you are from \nIndiana or California or anywhere else.\n  I will show you some more photos. The flooding in the Midwest. They \ncannot even take their eyes off it, because they cannot believe here \nright in front of their house they are knee deep in water. The \nNorthridge earthquake, where a police officer, rushing to help people, \ndid not realize the freeway was down and lost his life, one of the \nfirst lives lost there.\n  Mount St. Helens in Washington; and the Houston, TX, floods. It \nalmost looks like--it actually looks like a bomb dropped on this House. \nWe need to be able to respond to that.\n  So, Mr. President I see that my friend, my adviser, my colleague from \nWest Virginia is here. I know he wishes to speak on this amendment. I \nwould ask him if he is prepared at this time to begin.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am prepared to yield to him as much time as he might \nconsume, just assuring that we do save 5 minutes. If he does intend to \ntake that much time, that is fine with me. I just want to make sure 5 \nminutes are reserved to close.\n  At this time, I am very honored to yield to my colleague, Senator \nByrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California yields all her \nremaining time, with the exception of 5 minutes, to the Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my friend from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer, for yielding to me at this time.\n  Mr. President, mankind has always been plagued with floods, famines, \ndroughts, plagues, and other pestilences of one kind or another, which \nwe refer to ordinarily as acts of God or natural disasters.\n  The first flood for which there is any record was that which is \nchronicled in the Book of Genesis, when God caused it to rain 40 days \nand 40 nights upon the Earth.\n  The hills and mountains were covered, and all flesh died that moved \nupon the Earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast and of every \ncreeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth and every man. All in whose \nnostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died. \nOnly Noah remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark; \nnamely, his wife and his three sons--Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and his \nsons' wives.\n  The first fire that I found recorded was the fire that was rained \nupon the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. God destroyed those cities with \nfire out of Heaven, and he destroyed all the plain and all the \ninhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the ground. Only \nLot, his wife, and two daughters were spared destruction in the fire, \nand Lot's wife later was turned into a pillar of salt because she \ndisobeyed God's warning.\n  The first famine of which I can find any record occurred in Egypt, \nand it was 7 years of duration. Joseph opened all the storehouses. The \nfamine was sore in all lands.\n  Most of us are familiar with the plagues of Egypt during the sojourn \nof the Israelites in that country. The Israelites came into Egypt \nsomewhere between 1,700 and 2,100 years before Christ, and their \nsojourn lasted 430 years. We have long been familiar with the plagues \nin Egypt which were chronicled by Moses, the author of the Pentateuch, \nthe first five books of the Bible--Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, \nand Deuteronomy. The waters were turned to blood, and all fish in the \nriver died. There were subsequent plagues of frogs, lice, flies, a \nplague on all cattle, the plague of boils on human beings, and the \nplagues of hail, locusts, and darkness, followed by the deaths of the \nfirst born.\n  The first tidal wave of which I can find any record was the tidal \nwave in the midst of the Red Sea which covered the chariots and the \nhorsemen and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea in their \nattempt to overcome and subdue the Israelites who were being led by \nMoses, and there remained not so much as one of them.\n  As to earthquakes, I turned again to that history of all histories, \nthe Bible. There was the earthquake which occurred when Elijah fled \nfrom Jezebel, and while Elijah stood upon a mountain, the Lord passed \nby and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and broke in pieces \nthe rocks, and then the earthquake occurred. In the Book of Amos and \nalso in the Book of Zechariah, we read of the earthquake which occurred \nin the 27th year of Uzziah, King of Judah. Josephus says that this \nearthquake was so violent as to divide a mountain in half, which lay to \nthe west of Jerusalem.\n  Subsequent such disasters have occurred in our own times. There was \nthe great Galveston, Texas, tidal wave in 1900. Charleston, South \nCarolina, suffered an earthquake in 1886, when most of the city was \ndestroyed, and we have heard of the great San Francisco earthquake of \n1906, about which songs have been written.\n  History tells us of the Black Death of the Middle Ages, a very, very \nvirulent form of plague that ravaged Asia and Europe in the 14th \ncentury. It raged in England during the years 1348-1349, and again in \n1361-1362, and again in 1368-1369 causing a mortality in some places \nprobably as high as two-thirds of the population.\n  There was the Great Flood of 1927--that was the year in which \nLindbergh flew across the Atlantic in the Spirit of St. Louis. He flew \n3,600 miles in 33\\1/2\\ hours. He carried five sandwiches with him and \nate 1\\1/2\\ of them. Sometimes he was 10 feet above the water, and \nsometimes he was 10,000 feet above the water. And as he took off and \nflew over Cape Breton, those with powerful glasses, according to the \nNew York Times, could see the number 211 on that little plane which \ncarried a load of 5,500 pounds.\n  Nineteen hundred and twenty-seven was also the year in which I first \nsaw a radio. I was living in a coal mining community in southern West \nVirginia, a community named Stotesbury, and my foster father, a coal \nminer, had promised me that on that occasion we would listen to the \nsecond Dempsey-Tunney prize fight and we would listen to it on the \nradio. So, we walked about a mile from where I lived in the upper end \nof the coal mining community, down the road, to what we referred to as \nthe community grill, where one could buy a bottle of Coca-Cola, if he \nhad a nickel. And there, upon that occasion, upon that night--I can see \nit as though it were last evening--there was Julius Sleboda, the \noperator of the community facility, and there were a group of men and \nboys--I do not recall any ladies being there--they were gathered around \nwaiting to hear the fight.\n  Jack Dempsey was my idol when I was a boy. I was 10 years old at that \ntime. I am still a boy, but I am 77 years old now. So, I stood there \nwith open eyes and open ears and open mouth waiting to hear Jack \nDempsey put Gene Tunney out of the ropes and into the floor with the \ncrowd. But it did not happen. I went away that night a disappointed \nlad. I was disappointed because Jack Dempsey did not win the fight and \nI did not hear the radio. There was only one set of earphones. And so \nJulius Sleboda listened to the fight. He wore the earphones. The rest \nof us could not hear it. Finally, the general manager of the operation \ncame into the grill, and he was Mr. C.R. Stahl. He took the earphones \nfrom Julius and put them on, and he gave to us \n [[Page S2610]] a blow-by-blow description of one of the greatest \nfights of all times.\n  So that was 1927, and in that year there was a great flood that \noverflowed the Mississippi from Cairo, IL, to the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Then came 1937. That was the year in which I married my high school \nsweetheart. We were still in the throes of the Great Depression. And \nspeaking of my high school sweetheart, there was a boy in my class by \nthe name of Julius Takach. His father had a grocery store down at Ury, \ncommonly called Cook Town in Raleigh County.\n  Every day when Julius came to school, he would fill his pockets with \ncandy and chewing gum from his father's grocery store. He would hand \nout the candy and chewing gum, and I made it a point, Mr. President, to \nbe the first always to greet Julius when he arrived at the schoolhouse \ndoor. He would give me some candy and chewing gum, and I did not chew \nthe gum or eat the candy, may I say to my colleague, Senator Hatch. I \nalways waited until the class had changed and gave the chewing gum and \ncandy to my sweetheart, Erma James.\n  If I may advise some of these youngsters around here, that is the way \nyou court your girl--with another boy's bubble gum! And it stuck, as \nyou see. I am still married to that same girl now 57 years later. And \nthe Good Lord willing, if we can live another 3 months from the 29th of \nthis month, then we will have been married 58 years.\n  Well, in 1937, the Ohio and the Mississippi Valleys were overrun by \nthe rivers; 400 people died, 1 million were left homeless, and $500 \nmillion worth of property destroyed. That was $500 million in 1937. So \none might imagine what it would be now.\n  In the Book of Matthew, we were told by Jesus that ``Ye shall hear of \nwars and rumors of wars * * * there shall be famines and pestilences \nand earthquakes in divers places.''\n  He knew what he was talking about. We have had them 2,000 years \nlater, throughout the 20 centuries, and we will continue to have them.\n  In just the last few years the Congress has appropriated billions of \ndollars for disasters caused by fires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, \nand drought right here in our own country.\n  Mr. President, no one except the Almighty has any control over the \ntiming, the frequency, or the magnitude of such natural disasters. They \nsometimes seem to come just in batches. Who is to say we will not have \nmore frequent and more costly natural disasters in the coming years? No \none can say. What will the next earthquake cost in terms of damages and \nlives, the destruction of buildings and towns and cities, highways, \nrailways? When will it occur? Where will it occur? No one can say. They \ncannot be anticipated by the Office of Management and Budget. OMB \ncannot tell us when there will be an earthquake, a flood, a drought, a \nfire, a hurricane, a tornado, a cyclone. They cannot be predicted by \nany Senate committee. Their cost cannot be forecast in any State of the \nUnion Address prior to their happening. They cannot be budgeted for in \nadvance with any accuracy. That is why it is so important we provide a \nmeans to quickly pay for the costs of natural disasters. We have to \nprotect the victims and the area economies from the devastation.\n  Now, this chart to my left sets out a number of natural disasters \nthat have occurred in the United States during the last 15 years.\n  The Mount St. Helen's volcano eruption, which occurred in May 1980, \nrequired appropriations totalling $1,015,337,000. Hurricane Hugo \noccurred in September 1989 and the budget authority and loan authority \namounted to $2,826,522,000. It wreaked havoc along the Atlantic Coast. \nAnd who paid the bill? The Federal taxpayers, as I say, were called on \nto provide more than $2.8 billion for needed assistance to the victims \nwho had lost their jobs, their homes and their livelihoods.\n  Also, in 1989, we had the Loma Prieta earthquake, for whose victims \nCongress appropriated $3,027,155,000. Then we were spared further major \ndisasters until the summer of 1992 when we suffered the destruction \nfrom both Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki and Typhoon Omar which required \nappropriations of $10,449,513,000. That is a lot of money--\n$10,449,513,000. In 1993, we had the terrible floods of the \nMississippi, for which $6,886,433,000 has been appropriated. And \nfinally in January 1994, we had the Northridge earthquake which \nrequired $10,127,583,000 in Federal appropriations.\n  Mr. President, our Nation has responded immediately to each of these \nnatural disasters with the enactment of emergency appropriations bills \nto help their victims and to restore the devastated communities which \nresulted from each of these freaks of nature. We had to act quickly.\n  I was chairman of the Appropriations Committee at the time we \nappropriated the moneys for Hurricane Hugo, at the time we appropriated \nthe moneys for the Loma Prieta earthquake, at the time Congress \nappropriated moneys for Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki and Typhoon Omar, \nand, of course, I was chairman and brought the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bills to the floor to deal with the Mississippi flood in \n1993 and the Northridge earthquake in 1994. We responded quickly, and \nmy distinguished colleague, Senator Hatfield, who was the ranking \nmember at that time, who is now the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, and his colleagues on the Republican side, responded \nquickly, and we worked together and brought these bills to the floor to \ngive help.\n  We could not afford to wait until we could have a long debate about \nwhich areas of the budget to cut in order to fully offset these \nunanticipated costs. Can you imagine the outcry if the Senate became \nmired in debate for weeks or even months about how to offset the costs \nof a natural disaster, while victims were left to twist in the wind and \ndrown in the swirling waters while local economies perished? That is \nexactly what could happen if the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution ever becomes part of the national charter.\n  It was precisely to avoid such delay and such misery that emergency \nfunding was exempted by statute from any requirement for funding \noffsets. We made that decision at the budget summit in 1990 during the \nBush administration, that such disasters would be provided for by \nemergency funds that would be exempted from any requirement for funding \noffsets. But this is no loophole for frivolous spending. To qualify for \nthis exemption, appropriations for emergencies must meet certain \nrequirements; namely, such funding must be:\n  A necessary expenditure--An essential or vital expenditure, not one \nthat is merely useful or beneficial;\n  Two, such funding must be for an emergency that has occurred \nsuddenly--quickly coming into being, not building up over time;\n  Also, it must be urgent--pressing and compelling need requiring \nimmediate action.\n  We are talking about what qualifies for the designation \n``emergency.''\n  It must have been unforeseen--not predictable or seen beforehand as a \ncoming need (an emergency that is part of an aggregate level of \nanticipated emergencies, particularly when normally estimated in \nadvance, would not be ``unforeseen''). So it has to be unforeseen.\n  And it must not be permanent--the need is temporary, it is urgent, it \nis necessary, unforeseen, and it is not permanent in nature.\n  In addition, as I have previously stated, to qualify as emergencies, \nappropriations must be so designated by the President and by Congress. \nThey must agree on designating the appropriation as an emergency. So it \nhas to be designated in law, passed by Congress.\n  To further emphasize the utter confusion we will face if the balanced \nbudget amendment is enacted, let us examine more closely the funding \nrequirements for such unforeseen emergencies and natural disasters.\n  Specifically, section 251(b)(2)(D) of the Budget Enforcement Act \nreads as follows:\n\n       Emergency Appropriations.--(i) If, for any fiscal year, \n     appropriations for discretionary accounts are enacted that \n     the President designates as emergency requirements and that \n     the Congress so designates in statute, the adjustment shall \n     be the total of such appropriations in discretionary accounts \n     designated as emergency requirements and the outlays flowing \n     in all years from such appropriations.\n\n  This very important provision of law allows us to quickly respond to \nnatural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, \nand forest fires. It enables the President and Congress \n [[Page S2611]] to provide emergency funding for the victims of such \ndisasters expeditiously, without having to find funding offsets from \nother programs.\n  We do not have time to tarry around. We do not have time to wait and \nto quibble. The people who have been hit with these sudden terrible \ndisasters need help.\n  It enables the President and Congress to provide emergency funding \nfor the victims of such disasters expeditiously, without having to find \noffsets from other programs.\n  Mr. President, as Senators are aware, the constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget now before the Senate does not include any such \nexemption for emergencies and natural disasters.\n  That is what the very distinguished and eloquent Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer, is concerned about. She is trying to correct \nthat by offering the amendment which is at the desk.\n  But we are told by the proponents not to worry. ``Don't worry, be \nhappy,'' they say. They claim that surely we will be able to muster the \n60 votes necessary to waive the balanced budget requirements of this \namendment for such important things as earthquakes and fires and \nhurricanes and droughts, tidal waves, and floods. Indeed, one such \nproponent has even stated that he has researched the past votes of the \nHouse and Senate on funding for natural disasters and found that those \nemergency appropriation bills passed by larger margins than the 60-\npercent supermajorities required under the balanced budget amendment. \nAre we, therefore, to conclude that, indeed, Congress would follow that \npattern in every case in the future and thereby we could expect to \ncontinue to be able to exempt funding for natural disasters from the \nbalanced budget amendment requirements?\n  I wish that I could share that kind of optimism. However, I have, I \nbelieve, good reason to question his conclusions.\n  As my colleagues are aware, last Monday Congress received President \nClinton's budget request for fiscal year 1996.\n  There is a part of the President's budget upon which Congress has \nbeen asked to act immediately. That part of the budget is the \nPresident's request for 1995 supplemental funds for emergencies for \ndefense totaling $2,557,000,000 and for FEMA disaster relief totaling \n$6,700,000,000. The FEMA request, Mr. President, is to enable the \nPresident to continue to meet the continued funding needs of some 40 \nStates in connection with disasters which have already occurred.\n  For the Northridge earthquake, which occurred on January 17, 1994, \nand devastated southern California, affecting over 700,000 people and \n120,000 structures, including schools, hospitals, municipal buildings, \nand private residences, the President is requesting an additional \n$4,865,603,000. Remember now, this is 1 year later and the costs are \nstill coming in.\n  The balance of the request is to fund and complete projected \nrequirements from previously declared disasters in at least 40 States; \nand ensure that adequate funds are available to address future disaster \nassistance requirements during the current fiscal year that already \nwell exceed FEMA's 1995 disaster relief fund appropriation of $320 \nmillion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this statement which deals with the FEMA \ndisaster relief fund and indicating the States and territories \naffected, and the additional requirements for each State and territory, \nbe printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n

Mr. President, in past years, we have been able, on a \nbipartisan basis, to quickly enact emergency appropriations for such \nimportant disaster relief efforts. We do this in order to get needed \nrelief to the victims of such natural disasters as quickly as we can, \neven though we fully recognize that we will often have to add more \nfunding later, once the full extent of the damage caused by each \nearthquake, flood, hurricane, and so on is known. That is the purpose \nof the President's latest $6.7 billion emergency FEMA request.\n  I am sorry to say, Mr. President, that the new leadership of the \nHouse of Representatives has now taken a position that these \nemergencies should no longer be exempt from funding offsets. I have \nhere a letter to the President, dated February 7, 1995, on the \nstationery of the Speaker of the House, which I will read into the \nRecord.\n  Here to my left is a replica of the letter addressed to the President \non February 7, 1995, by Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House, Richard \nArmey, the majority leader of the House, John Kasich, chairman of the \nHouse Committee on the Budget, Robert Livingston, chairman of the House \nCommittee on Appropriations, and the letter reads as follows. It is \nwritten by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, as all who view \nthe charts can see. So I will read the letter:\n\n       Dear Mr. President: The Fiscal Year 1996 budget which you \n     transmitted to Congress contains an additional $10.4 billion \n     in supplemental budget requests for Fiscal Year 1995. Your \n     budget submission further reflects only $2.4 billion in \n     rescissions and savings for FY 1995. Most of these requests \n     are for emergencies.\n       The House Appropriations Committee will proceed to review \n     and act on these requests. But highest priority will be given \n     to replenishing the accounts in the Department of Defense \n     badly depleted by contingencies in the Persian Gulf, Somalia, \n     Rwanda, Haiti and other activities. The committee in the \n     House in turn will act only after offsets for these \n     activities have been identified.\n       However, we will not act on the balance of the request \n     until you have identified offsets and deductions to make up \n     the balance of the funding. Whether these activities are \n     emergencies or not it will be our policy to pay for them \n     rather than to add to our already immense deficit problems.\n       We, therefore, ask you--\n\n  Meaning you, Mr. President, the President of the United States--\n\n     to identify additional rescissions as soon as possible so we \n     can move expeditiously on your supplemental request.\n\n  Mr. President, unless I misunderstand the intent of this letter, it \nlays down a marker that its authors do not intend to even consider \nfunding the $6.7 billion in emergency FEMA disaster relief funding \nuntil the President recommends offsets.\n  Could this mindset with the likely impact of a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget and I believe what emerges is a nation \nwhich may be totally unable to help its people at a time of national \ndisaster.\n  Imagine that! Another California earthquake occurs, a flood in Iowa, \na hurricane in Georgia or South Carolina, thousands of homeless \nchildren injured, death, devastation, sadness, whole communities wiped \nout and the response of the Nation is, tough luck! Never mind the \nmisery. Never mind the sadness. First things first, And first things \nfirst means we will have to find \n [[Page S2612]] a way to pay for every dollar, offset every dollar, \nbefore we lift a finger to help the victims.\n  Where is the Christian brotherhood in that approach?\n  Oops, sorry Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer. The hurricane in Florida will \nactually cost us $10 billion instead of $5 billion so we are out of \nbudget balance and you owe us some more money for last year's tax bill. \nOr do we just say, tough it out Florida? We cannot afford the hurricane \nbill. Maybe you could petition Japan for a little disaster assistance.\n  Because of its ill-crafted, rigid inflexibility, I believe that this \nbudget amendment will have us careen from budget crisis to budget \ncrisis.\n  Think of what the Desert Storm conflict could have done to our\n   budget situation. We began the military deployment in August 1990, I \nbelieve. It was never a declared war. We do not declare wars any \nlonger. But, it was certainly a hotly debated issue here in the Senate. \nWe were out trying to rustle up dollars from our allies in order to \nhelp pay for that action, and we did not know until the conflict was \nnearly over to what extent our costs would actually be reimbursed by \ncontributions from our friends and allies. Even though we were \nreimbursed, it was necessary for the United States to pay for \nsubstantial costs at the outset of the deployment.\n\n  The full cost of Desert Storm was unknown for months, for the very \ngood reason that it was impossible to predict how difficult the \nconflict would be and how long it would last, how easy it would be for \nus to prevail, what our casualties would be, how well the coalition \nwould work together, and other variables which are always uncertainties \nin any armed conflict. Can we be sure that future important \ninternational involvements, undeclared wars, but important military \nactions, can be declared a threat to national security by a joint \nresolution adopted by the whole number of each House?\n That is talking about a majority of the whole number of each House.\n\n  How in the world are we ever going to know what conflicts we are \ngoing to be able to afford in the future? First, we will have to be \nsure that we can waive the provisions of this amendment by having a \nserious threat to national security declared by a joint resolution and \nadopted by a majority of the whole number of each House, which becomes \nlaw. How will the Department of Defense ever be able to adequately \nplan? Will our allies ever again rest easy knowing that we may have to \nhedge on our commitments to them because of uncertainty about our \nfinancial ability to fully engage our forces in their behalf? How will \nwe ever be sure that we can come up with the money should the fiscal \nyear have ended in the middle of a conflict, and the costs had thrown \nthe budget badly out of balance?\n  Suppose the conflict became unpopular after it had begun and support \nfor paying to complete U.S. responsibilities had ebbed. Talk about a \nbouncing ball of fiscal uncertainty. We could become unable to be \ncertain of our ability to handle any emergency either abroad or at \nhome.\n  In a perfect world, there are no uncertainties. In a perfect world, \nstorms do not rage, famine and drought never occur, and all \ninconvenient problems abroad end before the close of the fiscal year \nwith money left over to pay the bills.\n  But we do not live in a perfect world. We live in a dangerous, \ncrisis-ridden, unpredictable world, and we will rue the day that we \nhandcuff our fiscal policy to the fallacies and flaws of this most \nimperfect and thoroughly misguided balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter to the President \nfrom the House Republican leadership be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 1995.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The Fiscal Year 1996 Budget which you \n     transmitted to Congress contains an additional $10.4 billion \n     in supplemental budget requests for Fiscal Year 1995. Your \n     budget submission further reflects only $2.4 billion in \n     rescissions and savings for FY 95. Most of these requests are \n     for emergencies.\n       The House Appropriations Committee will proceed to review \n     and act on these requests. But highest priority will be given \n     to replenishing the accounts in the Department of Defense \n     badly depleted by contingencies in the Persian Gulf, Somalia, \n     Rwanda, Haiti and other activities. The Committee and the \n     House in turn will act only after offsets for these \n     activities have been identified.\n       However, we will not act on the balance of the requests \n     until you have identified offsets and deductions to make up \n     the balance of the funding. Whether these activities are \n     emergencies or not it will be our policy to pay for them, \n     rather than to add to our already immense deficit problems.\n       We therefore ask you to identify additional rescissions as \n     soon as possible so we can move expeditiously on your \n     supplemental requests.\n           Sincerely,\n     Newt Gingrich,\n                                             Speaker of the House.\n     John Kasich,\n       Chairman, House Committee on the Budget.\n     Richard Armey,\n                                     Majority Leader of the House.\n     Robert L. Livingston,\n       Chairman, House Committee on Appropriations.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished Senator \nfrom California, Senator Boxer, for offering this amendment. I support \nher amendment, and I hope if there is a motion to table the amendment, \nthat motion will be rejected.\n  I return any time I may have remaining to Senator Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from California has \n9 minutes and there are 15 minutes remaining on the other side.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask my friend, does he have anything to contribute? I \nwould like to, first, if it is all right, yield 4 minutes to my friend \nfrom Arkansas at this time and I will retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator from California for yielding me 4 \nminutes. Let me preface my remarks by saying I will never forget this. \nI had been Governor of my State I guess about 3 months. Arkansas is \npart of what we call ``tornado alley.'' We have a terrible tornado in \nBrinkley, AR, and my staff said, ``You have to go over there.'' I said, \n``They would think I was trying to politicize their plight.'' They \nsaid, ``You do not understand it; they are desperate and they want to \nsee authority figures. They want to know somebody is going to help \nthem.'' They finally talked me into going, even though I thought it was \na political thing to do. I never failed to go immediately to every \nflood and tornado after that, because when those people saw me, they \ncrowded around me and wanted me to hear their stories, wanted me to \nassure them that everything was going to be all right. It was one of \nthe most gratifying things I ever did in my life.\n  Senator Boxer's amendment is the exemplification of simplification. \nIt just simply says that if we have a big disaster in this country, by \na majority vote--and who could quarrel with that? By a simple majority \nvote, we can spend the money to alleviate the terrible plight of people \nin California, southern California or northern California, who had been \nhit by a terrible earthquake; or we can cover 10 States in the Midwest, \nwhose homes, farms, cities had been wiped out. Can you not just see us \nsitting here and people dying, water washing their homes away and \nsaying: Well, we tried. We got 59 votes but we just could not quite cut \nthe mustard. You people just do the best you can.\n  How silly can you get? That is not what this country is made of. I \nadmit that a flood in Arkansas gets my attention more than a flood in \nWest Virginia or California. You know, some day, if you look at this \nmap, you will see that the New Madrid fault in Northeast Arkansas is \none of the most dangerous areas in the United States. The maximum risk \nof earthquake is along the New Madrid fault. The Presiding Officer \nknows where it is because Tennessee is part of it, too. To sit here and \nsay that, in the interest of killing every single amendment, we are \ngoing to kill this one, too, and we are not \n [[Page S2613]] going to allow a simple majority vote in the Senate to \ndetermine whether we are going to help American citizens who through no \nfault of their own have been decimated, it would be the height of \nirresponsibility to vote to table an amendment as well conceived and \nsensitive as this one is.\n  So, Mr. President, I applaud the Senator from California for offering \nthe amendment. I am very pleased to cosponsor it, to vote for it, and I \nhope the people who walk in this Chamber in about 15 minutes will not \njust vote that knee-jerk vote we have been watching ever since we \nstarted this amendment, but stop and reflect. If you cannot go home and \ntell the people of your State that you voted for this because you want \nto take care of them in case of emergency, you do not deserve to be \nhere.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] \nis recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. I wanted to make a couple of comments about some of the \narguments that have been made today with respect to this amendment. I \nthink it is a good amendment in the sense that it brings the very \nimportant issue to light of how we will deal with natural disasters \nunder the strictures of the balanced budget amendment.\n  I will first state that we have 7 years before we have to get to a \nbalanced budget. And during the first 6 years, there are no strictures \nat all placed on either body, other than the ones now in place with \nrespect to the Budget Act, to passing supplemental emergency \nappropriations bills. For the first 6 years, we are pretty much under \nthe same rules we have been, which I see as an opportunity, as Senator \nSimon suggested, with respect to the overall budget, but I think even \nmore particular with respect to emergency appropriations, for us to be \nable to build up reserve funds over the next 6 years, specifically \ntargeted for this kind of emergency. We know emergencies will occur. We \nhave had votes on emergency supplementals just since my election in \n1990 to the House. We have had 16 such votes in the House and Senate. \nUnder the 1990 Budget Act, which put in a high hurdle to get an \nemergency supplemental appropriation passed, we have done that. I think \nwhat we should do is understand that emergencies will occur and we \nshould set aside some funds to be available for that purpose. We have 6 \nyears between now and the year 2002 when we have to get to the balanced \nbudget to accumulate money in that account.\n  So I suggest that that might be an effort that the Senator from \nCalifornia and others from other States who are subject to more natural \ndisasters than other States would work on and hopefully implement.\n  The other point I wanted to make is with respect to the margin with \nwhich all of these supplemental appropriations since the 1990 Budget \nAct have passed. We have had 16 such votes in the U.S. Senate. All 16 \npassed with greater than a 60-vote margin. Every single one of them \nwould have passed under the constitutional amendment that we are now \nconsidering, which requires a 60-vote margin here in the Senate, \nrequires three-fifths.\n  All of those would have passed here and we would have, in a sense, \nwaived the constitutional requirements for a balanced budget here in \nthe Senate. All but two would have passed in the House of \nRepresentatives. The only two that would not have passed is one having \nto do with the Los Angeles riots; and it was a very controversial aid \npackage because of some of the measures that were put in it, \ncontroversial measures that were put in for the city of Los Angeles. I \ndo not think anyone had any problem with providing financial assistance \nto the riot-torn areas of Los Angeles, but there were some measures \nthat were included that caused some controversy; but that was a close \nvote, relatively close. The other had to do with extension of \nunemployment benefits in 1993, which was a relatively close vote in the \nHouse.\n  Both of which, I think you can make the argument with respect to some \nof the pork that was in the Los Angeles riot bill and the need in 1993 \nwhen in the middle of the President's debate on passing his deficit \nreduction package that we were going to throw more money to \nunemployment benefits without paying for it, both had legitimate \nreasons for objections in the House.\n  But I think it just goes to show you that when this country, when \nthis body and the other body is faced with a natural disaster, such as \nthe earthquake that Senator Boxer has been referring to, we stepped to \nthe floor and in overwhelming numbers passed the disaster assistance.\n  I will refer to the Northridge, CA, earthquake last year, the \ndisaster in 1994, 337 to 74 in the House and 85 to 10 in the Senate. \nThe Midwest flood, a flood in the Mississippi River and other rivers in \nthe Midwest, 400 to 27 in the House, and it was voice voted in the \nSenate, which shows fairly unanimous support here in the Senate.\n  When the disasters are serious, when people are in need, we \nunderstand we have an obligation to respond to that and we do in \noverwhelming numbers. We do not need an amendment to this \nconstitutional amendment to solve this problem. We will solve it on our \nown and we have met and will continue to meet the expectations of the \npublic when such disasters occur to this country.\n  So, while I support the intention of the amendment of the Senator \nfrom California, I think it is unnecessary. And I believe if it truly \nis a disaster the House will go ahead--they do not have a supermajority \nprovision right now; they can pass bills over there with a simple \nmajority. Here in the Senate, we, in a sense, have a supermajority \nrequirement already. We have filibusters here and we have cloture \nvotes. Most legislation around here, if it is somewhat controversial, \nhas to get that 60-vote requirement to pass. And so we already have \nwhat the constitutional amendment would require of us here in the \nSenate.\n  Really, all this constitutional amendment does is put a little higher \nburden on the House. And I do not think that is a bad idea. I think, in \nfact, it may screen out some ``emergencies,'' like some of the ones I \ndescribed here, make those bills that respond to those emergencies be \ncleaner and directly targeted to the aid, as opposed to Christmas \ntreeing it with a whole bunch of other projects that Members of the \nSenate and House may want to attach.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes and forty-five seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I really appreciate the comments of my \ndistinguished colleague from Pennsylvania. He spoke great truth here. \nHe has made it very clear why this amendment needs to be defeated.\n  Naturally, I am opposed to this amendment, because it is one more \nproposed loophole to the balanced budget amendment.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania said, and Senator \nCraig and Senator Snowe demonstrated this morning when they reviewed \ncongressional votes in recent years approving various disaster relief \nmeasures, Congress has never been reluctant to approve, by overwhelming \nmargins, emergency relief for Americans suffering the effects of \nnatural disasters--never. The balanced budget amendment is not going to \nstop Congress from continuing to do that, and so there is no need for \nthis amendment.\n  But the amendment that the distinguished Senator from California \nsincerely is putting forth here actually would open a loophole as wide \nas a barn for any kind of spending program to go through.\n  House Joint Resolution 1 would not deprive the Congress of the \nability to continue to respond to such emergencies, since it already \ncontains a mechanism for dealing with fiscal emergencies.\n  First, when the balanced budget amendment goes into effect, \nimplementing legislation can address the prospect of unexpected \ndevelopments. It can set aside a contingency fund, available for use in \nsuch emergencies, as part of a balanced Federal budget.\n  Second, in drafting the balanced budget amendment, the authors have \nanticipated the possibility of sudden and unexpected emergencies, such \nas \n [[Page S2614]] natural disasters, requiring prompt action by the \nCongress and the Federal Government to provide needed relief to \ndisaster victims or people who suffer from disasters.\n  For that reason, the amendment already includes mechanisms which give \nCongress the flexibility necessary to respond in emergencies by \nproviding relief to disaster victims:\n  Under section 1 of the amendment, three-fifths of both Houses can \nvote a specific excess of outlays over receipts.\n  Under section 2 of the amendment, the Congress, by three-fifths vote \nof each House, would have the power to increase the debt limit where \nnecessary in order to provide emergency relief and assistance in the \nwake of any natural disaster.\n  The amendment proposed by our friend from California, however, does \nnot simply create a mechanism by which Congress, reacting to a sudden \nand unexpected emergency, may waive the debt limitation provision of \nthe balanced budget amendment in order to provide emergency relief to \ndisaster victims.\n  Let us be very clear about this. What is being proposed in this \namendment is not a waiver for emergency disaster relief only. Read the \nfine print. Senator Boxer's amendment provides that in any money, even \n$1, is spent ``as a result of a declaration made by the President--and \na designation by the Congress--that a major disaster or emergency \nexists ``the Congress, by the smallest of margins, a simple majority \nnot of the whole congress but only of those present and voting at a \nparticular moment, may completely waive the balanced budget amendment \nfor that entire fiscal year.\n  Under the language of the Boxer amendment, there is no link \nwhatsoever between the amount of emergency disaster relief and the \nincrease in the debt ceiling. This goes way beyond being a loophole \nthrough which Congress could slip a few billion dollars in new debt \nwhenever it chooses. Once a so-called disaster relief waiver is passed \nby a simple majority of those present and voting, there would no longer \nby any limitation on increasing the national debt in that fiscal year. \nActually, none. What a loophole. The door is open; the roadblocks are \nremoved; the Federal pork-barrel, deficit-spending express is back on \ntrack, cleared once again to run full speed ahead, carrying the \nAmerican people to economic ruin.\n  This amendment would not only permit future Presidents and Congresses \nto evade what would otherwise be a constitutional mandate that the \nFederal Government finally live within its means, it would be an open \ninvitation to such evasion, precisely because it would make such \nevasion so very easy.\n  The fact is that in every fiscal year after the balanced budget \namendment goes into effect, there will be sufficient pretext for a \nspending-minded President and simple majority of Congress to invoke the \ndisaster relief waiver and thereby eliminate the prohibition on new \ndebt if they so choose. And that is exactly what they will choose--we \nhave 25 straight years of deficit spending since 1969, with 5 more \nyears and another trillion dollars of debt to come according to \nPresident Clinton's 1996 budget proposal, as proof of that contention.\n  Talk about disasters; if this amendment passes, the balanced budget \namendment dam will be broken, releasing a further flood of red ink \nwhich will drown the American people in an ever-rising sea of debt.\n  Congress does not need the debt limitation waiver mechanism proposed \nby this amendment in order retain its ability to respond, as it always \nhas, to the needs of disaster victims. The American people, however, \ncannot afford to have dangling before future Presidents and Congresses \nwhat would almost certainly prove to be an irresistible temptation to \ncircumvent the necessary discipline of a balanced budget amendment. \nThis amendment is not only unnecessary, but potentially fatal to our \neconomic future. I urge that it be defeated.\n  If you read the language of this amendment, the language is just \nunbelievably broad.\n\n       The provisions of this article may be waived by a majority \n     vote in each House of those present and voting for any fiscal \n     year in which outlays occur as a result of a declaration made \n     by the President and a designation by the Congress that a \n     major disaster or emergency exists.\n\n  Once the President declares an emergency or disaster, Congress could \nspend any amounts it wants--on any programs--during that whole fiscal \nyear, according to the way this is written.\n  I have to say that there was another amendment filed on this subject \nthat at least did not go that far. It was more narrowly tailored than \nthis one. But this one goes so far that it would allow any big-spending \nPresident and any big-spending Congress to deficit-spend whenever they \nwant to do it, and without any consideration whatsoever to the \ntaxpayers of America.\n  So this amendment deserves to be defeated, and we are going to move \nto table as soon as the distinguished Senator from California finishes \nher concluding remarks.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the rewriting of history that goes on \naround here is really incredible. The Senator from Utah gets so worked \nup about the idea that a majority of the Members of this body could \nvote to say that an emergency that kills people, that is happening in \nour country, could say to this Senate, ``Yes, we are going to pay for \nthat and we are going to do it now.''\n  Do you know that every year since the Republicans had control of the \nSenate, Mr. President, that has been the rule. Where has the Senator \nfrom Utah been? I never heard him complain about it before, when \nRepublican Presidents said, ``Yes, a disaster should be an exception by \na majority vote, and we should not have to find offsets.'' It happened \nin a Republican Senate.\n  So my amendment is the conservative one. Without this amendment, we \nare being radicalized by this U.S. Senate into a position that we \ncannot respond. I was happy to hear the comments of my friend from \nPennsylvania, and I agree with him. We will have some time to work on \nthis problem, and we are. I am appointed to a task force, and I hope \nthe Senator can join us.\n  Senators should know we do have rainy day funds now that are in the \nbudget. The problem is some years it rains more than the rainy day \nfund. And that is the definition of a disaster emergency. You do not \nknow where it will hit and how much it will hit.\n  I ask if we could have a final chart on the newspaper story. By the \nway, I want to say to my friend from Pennsylvania, in his own case in \nPennsylvania in 1993, $24 million for severe snowfall winter storms; in \n1994, severe winter storms, snow and rain, $72 million the Senator's \nState received. I hope and pray you do not have this experience again, \nbut I also hope and pray if you do, you do not have to count on 60 \nvotes, because unlike what was said by the Senator from Pennsylvania \nand others today, twice on this very floor we failed to get 60 votes \nfor emergency spending for disaster relief. We fell short. We got 52 \nvotes. But guess what, this is America, majority rules. But not if you \nvote for this balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. You are \ngiving the power of the American people to a minority in this U.S. \nSenate.\n  Let me show you this headline. L.A. Times, February 5: ``FEMA \nChief''--that is the Federal Emergency Management Agency--``Warns of a \nKobe-Like Quake in the United States. Visiting disaster area, James Lee \nWitt says chances of temblor in Midwest are growing. He declines to \ncriticize Japan's emergency response,'' which is a very interesting \nstory in and of itself. This is what he said:\n\n       If a quake the size of the Kobe temblor struck along the \n     New Madrid, the eastern part of the United States could be \n     deprived of much of its petroleum supplies, Witt says.\n       * * * ``And if [an earthquake] hits in the wintertime, \n     we're in big-time trouble,'' Witt said.\n       Witt said his agency has been trying to persuade operators \n     of pipelines to install safety shutoff valves.\n       The percentages gets higher and higher every year for a \n     major earthquake on the ``New Madrid. By the year 2000, it's \n     more than a 50-50 chance that you could have a major \n     earthquake,'' he said.\n\n  I want to get to Kobe. I want my colleagues here, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, to think about what it would be like to stand in front \nof a group of constituents in your hometown and tell them, ``Sorry, I \ncouldn't \n [[Page S2615]] get 60 votes, move to another city.'' And to my \ncolleagues who get up here and say this is a terrible amendment, this \nis going to ruin America, let me tell them that more people died in two \nearthquakes in California than died in Desert Storm. We are talking \nabout terrible, terrible outcomes here. We have an exception for war, \nand we should. I did not write that exception. The Republican Congress \nwrote that exception. I am saying we ought to add an exception for an \nemergency like this because dead is dead is dead.\n  Now I want to tell you:\n\n       About 250,000 refugees are still living in parks or \n     government-managed evacuation centers in unheated gymnasiums.\n\n  This happened in Kobe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I further say people died in those shelters because they \ndid not have enough doctors to take care of them. At this point, I \nyield the floor. I understand there is going to be a motion to table. I \nurge my colleagues to vote against that motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will yield, I have a question for the \nSenator from California [Mrs. Boxer]. She keeps referring to a 52 vote \non something. I am looking at all these disasters since 1987. I do not \nsee anything here that says 52 votes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am very glad that the Senator asked me that. I already \nplaced it in the Record. I will give you exact dates. On February 10, \n1994, last year, by a vote of 43 to 52, the Senate defeated the Dole \namendment to strike funding to repair the Cypress freeway which was \ndestroyed in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake--we have a picture of it--\nand to find offset budget cuts. That failed and also another vote \nfailed----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Can I reclaim my time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. On the floods as well.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That was the 1984 earthquake supplemental which passed \n85 to 10 which would have met the scrutiny. What you are referring to \nis an amendment that failed. That, obviously, would not require a \nthree-fifths vote. An amendment to a supplemental appropriations would \nnot be violative of the balanced budget amendment. What finally \nhappened----\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator is incorrect on that.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. What happened is 85 to 10 on final passage of that \nbill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator is incorrect. Had that amendment been before \nthis body under the rules of the balanced budget, we could not have \nrebuilt this freeway on which people died, period, end of quote. We \nwould have needed 60 votes. I could only get 52 votes. Thank the Lord, \nwe were able to rebuild this freeway. The same thing happened with the \nMidwest floods.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I can reclaim my time. The fact of the matter is \nthat bill passed 85 to 10, which is well in excess of two-thirds. An \namendment is not under the strictures of a three-fifths majority. I \nbelieve the Senator from California is aware of that. I will be happy \nto yield back the time.\n  Mr. HATCH. We yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby by my friend and colleague from California, Senator Boxer, which \nwould allow Congress to respond quickly and responsibly to \nPresidentially declared emergencies.\n  Mr. President, on September 11, 1992, Hurricane Iniki struck the \nisland of Kauai and the Waianae shore of Oahu with the force of a \nsledgehammer. Sustained winds of 140 miles per hour, with gusts of up \nto 226 mph, were recorded. In a few nightmare hours, the lives of \nKauai's 51,000 permanent residents and thousands of tourists had been \nradically transformed for the worse. On Kauai alone, 7 people died and \nover 100 were injured, and $2 billion in damage was recorded in private \nand public property loss.\n  More than 14,000 residences were destroyed or damaged, leaving \nthousands homeless or poorly sheltered from the elements. Five thousand \nutility poles were knocked down, leaving residents without electricity \nor the ability to communicate with themselves or the outside world. The \nloss of power also meant that no water could be pumped to faucets. Tons \nof debris blocked roads, shutting down transportation island-wide. \nHarbors, schools, offices, and other government infrastructure \nsustained heavy damage. And the local airport, the island's major link \nwith the rest of the State, was knocked out of commission, preventing \nimmediate relief and evacuation.\n  Today, 2\\1/2\\ years later, thanks to the quick reaction of Federal, \nState, and local officials, the energy and enthusiasm of volunteer \nagencies, and to the courage and fortitude of the people of Kauai, \nKauai is slowly recovering. Unemployment is still unacceptably high, \nand the rebuilding is not complete by any stretch of the imagination, \nbut a semblance of normalcy has returned. Roads are open, the phones \nare working, and tourists are returning to newly refurbished hotels and \nbeaches.\n  Yet, Mr. President, little of this would have been possible without \nthe $1.2 billion in Federal disaster assistance that Congress \nappropriated in the months following Hurricane Iniki. That funding \nensured that a tiny island like Kauai, and a small State like Hawaii, \nwhich on its own would never have been able to raise the necessary \nfunds to avert massive homelessness and unemployment, would in time \nrecover.\n  And this is what the Boxer amendment is all about, Mr. President. It \nis about helping your neighbor when he is in need. It is about \nextending a helping hand to those who, through no fault of their own, \nare struck down by disaster, natural or otherwise. It is about pulling \ntogether as a country when the chips are down. It is about Californians \nhelping Missourians cope with floods; it is about Missourians helping \nSouth Carolinians rebuild after a hurricane; and, it is about South \nCarolinians aiding Californians when the Earth shakes.\n  Mr. President, I have previously articulated my opposition to a \nconstitutional balanced budget amendment. But if we must adopt the \nmeasure, we must ensure that Congress has the necessary flexibility to \nrespond quickly and responsibly to emergencies that are well beyond the \nmeans of localities and States to address. We must avoid the risk of \nundermining the very reason for the Union itself. Our national motto is \nand remains United We Stand, not United We Stand, Unless We Run a \nFiscal Deficit.\n  So, for the sake of unity and compassion, for the sake of shared \nresponsibility, I urge my colleagues to support this important, \nprudent, and altogether necessary amendment. Let us not sacrifice our \nsense of common purpose on the altar of fiscal expediency.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment which will \nwaive the provisions of the bill before us when the President of the \nUnited States declares a Federal disaster.\n  Over the last few years the United States has experienced more \ndisasters than at any other time--the Loma Prieta earthquake in \nCalifornia; Hurricane Hugo which struck the Carolinas; Typhoon Omar \nwhich struck Guam; Hurricanes Andrew, Bob, and Iniki; the floods that \ncovered much of the Midwest; the more recent floods that devastated \nTexas; the wildfires which struck southern California; the Northridge \nearthquake in southern California just over 1 year ago; and the floods \nthat are still plaguing California.\n  In California, earthquake activity has dramatically increased. \nLeading seismologists have predicted that there is an 86-percent chance \nof a 7.0 quake in southern California in the next 30 years.\n  California can do more and will do more to prepare for future \ndisasters, but as we saw in Kobe, Japan, even what is considered good \nplanning can be ripped apart.\n  But much more than California is at risk. It is inevitable that \nFlorida and the eastern seaboard will see another hurricane. Hawaii \nwill see another hurricane or a volcano. A tornado, floor, or deep \nfreeze will hit the Midwest, and on down the list. Currently, there are \noutstanding requests for disaster assistance in 40 States. Every State \nin the Union is at risk from Mother Nature.\n  [[Page S2616]] This exemption is not frivolous. More times than not, \nFEMA has had the capability to cover the costs of a federally declared \ndisaster. FEMA has provided assistance in cases of heavy snow, \ntornadoes, floods, and many other situations, and has not required \nadditional funding from Congress. People should not be under the \nimpression that FEMA marches up to Capitol Hill after every disaster \nand request more money.\n  We need this exemption for those infrequent instances when the size \nand scale and destructive force of a disaster is simply too \noverwhelming for the affected local and State officials to handle.\n  Twelve times since 1974 the administration has requested a \nsupplemental appropriations bill to pay for the costs of disasters. \nSeven of those twelve times, the supplemental request has been less \nthan $1 billion. In no instance has Congress required these bills to be \noffset by cuts in other funding, which would be the required course of \naction if this amendment fails.\n  Congress passed the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \nAssistance Act to outline in what ways the Federal Government should \nsupplement State and local efforts in times of disaster.\n  Through the Stafford Act, the Federal Government has recognized that \nit has a vital role in responding to disasters. We must maintain that \ncommitment, and this amendment will ensure that we do so.\n  Oftentimes we in the Senate do not move quickly to pass bills. \nThankfully, we have moved quickly to pass bills to help restore the \nlives of disaster victims. In such cases of catastrophic disasters, \nwhen local officials cannot meet the needs of the victims, we must not \nlet budget debates and haggling over how to achieve 60 votes slow our \neffort to meet our commitment.\n  Some may argue that the Federal Government is too intrusive in our \nlives--but when disaster strikes, trust me, even the greatest \ngovernment cynic is glad to see someone wearing a FEMA jacket.\n  In response to the Northridge earthquake in my State of California, \nCongress passed a bill that included $8.6 billion in Federal emergency \nassistance. This money has been absolutely vital in getting Los Angeles \nback on its feet. Federal disaster relief funds have played a critical \nrole in Hawaii, and Florida, and the Midwest as well.\n  Some will argue that if these billions of dollars are so small in \ncomparison to our Federal budget, why should they be so difficult to \noffset? Let me address that question. Last week the House \nAppropriations Committee approved a measure to offset the supplemental \nspending bill that was requested by the President to bay for military \noperations in Haiti and elsewhere. This $3.2 billion bill was offset \nwith $1.8 billion in cuts in defense spending, and $1.4 billion in \nnondefense spending. The $1.4 billion in cuts in nondefense cuts, had \nlittle if any hearing and were cut at the expense of programs totally \nunrelated to the purposes for which they were going to be sacrificed.\n  Will we use bills to help victims of disasters as a vehicle to \nwantonly cut unrelated programs with little or no thought? If this \nbecomes the case, when these disaster bills finally wind their way to \nthe floor, as victims wait for our assistance, the programs that have \nbeen cut in committee will be the subject of debate, and the victims of \nthe disaster will sit and wait. The debate on disaster bills should be \nabout the victims, not about the budget.\n  There is another point I would like to make with respect to the \nBudget Act of 1990. Under the provisions of balanced budget amendment, \n60 votes in the Senate would be necessary to waive the requirement of \nbalancing the budget. The Budget Act of 1990 specifically gave the \nCongress the authority to consider bills deemed to be emergency \nspending by both Congress and the President, without subjecting the \nbill to a point of order. Once a bill is the subject of a point of \norder, it takes 60 votes to waive the provisions of the budget act. By \nsubjecting emergency bills to the balanced budget amendment, we would \nbe requiring 60 votes the amendment, the same requirement that \nemergency bills were specifically exempted from in 1990.\n  Additionally, there has been criticism in the past that these bills \nhave been loaded up with pork unrelated to disasters. I have \ncosponsored a bill with Senators McCain and Feingold to eliminate \namendments to these bills that are unrelated to the disasters so \nemergency funding bills are only for emergencies. I hope that bill will \nsee swift passage.\n  Disasters are unexpected, and can cause, in some cases, tremendous \namounts of damage. We cannot plan for them, and funds for assistance \nmust not be delayed because of our fear of throwing the budget out of \nbalance, but the speed with which we pass these bills can be vital to \nan effective recover effort.\n  As an aside, I would like to make a suggestion to my colleagues with \nrespect to helping to prevent the need for emergency disaster bills in \nthe future. FEMA will have approximately $320 million this year for its \ndisaster relief fund, a figure based on an old average of yearly needs, \nwhen in fact the average outlays from the disaster relief fund from \nfiscal year 1985 through fiscal year 1996 projected--is $1.527 billion. \nI would suggest to my colleagues that we use this figure as a new \nbaseline instead of the $320 million. These funds if not expended, can \nbuild up, so we would be better prepared financially for future \ndisasters. I recognize that we would need to find an additional $1.2 \nbillion annually to cover the difference, but perhaps that would be \neasier than finding the much bigger sums that we have to produce all in \n1 year in the face of huge disasters such as Northridge.\n  To close, I would like to say, disaster bills will not break the \nbudget, but will help put the lives of the thousands of disaster \nvictims back together.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the debate we have had. I \nlistened to part of it in my office. It seems to me this amendment \nwould create a gaping loophole in the balanced budget amendment. \nAccording to the language of the amendment, if the President declares \nthat a major disaster emergency exists ``a simple majority vote in both \nHouses of Congress would waive the balanced budget requirement for that \nyear.''\n  The balanced budget amendment already contains a safety valve. If \nthere is a major disaster emergency, a three-fifths supermajority vote \ncould raise the debt limit to cover the potential cost of disaster \nrelief.\n  I think, as everybody pointed out on the floor, I think I voted for \nevery disaster we had in America, whether it was California, Florida, \nor the Midwest. It is not difficult to achieve the three-fifths vote. \nAfter all, we are going to be responsive wherever the disaster may be. \nI think that will be true in both Houses of Congress.\n  So it seems to me we want to move on with this effort. We would like \nto pass the balanced budget amendment this week and get it out to the \n38 States. I think you will see the States quickly ratify the \namendment. They understand the importance of it. I hope we can speed up \nthe process. Therefore, I move to table the amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is a motion to refer House Joint \nResolution 1 to the Budget Committee with instructions to report back \nforthwith in status quo and require the Budget Committee to issue a \nreport at the earliest possible time which would include the text of a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution and which, Mr. President, I had \noriginally intended to offer directly to House Joint Resolution 1 at \nthe appropriate time.\n  The procedural situation before us makes it difficult to have a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution considered directly because we are \nconsidering the language of a possible constitutional amendment.\n  The instructions attached to the motion to refer that we have here \nhave the effect, however, of allowing us to vote on the substance of \nwhat would have been a sense-of-the-Senate resolution if a regular \nlegislative measure had been pending.\n  Mr. President, the language of the instruction is intended to put the \nSenate on record for the first time with respect to the issue of \nwhether an across-the-board tax cut or a middle-class tax cut is \nconsistent with efforts to balance the Federal budget and reduce the \nFederal deficit. And the motion goes through some of the issues that \nall of us know to be involved in not having a balanced budget, issues \nhaving to do with the fact that the Federal deficit is still in excess \nof over $190 billion a year despite the efforts we have made in the \npast couple of years.\n  The fact is that the Federal debt within the next couple of months \nwill, for the first time in our country's history, exceed the \nastonishing figure of $5 trillion. This motion points out that the \nFederal budget deficits and the growing Federal debt have a strong \ntendency to reduce savings and capital formation in this country. We \nalso point out that the Federal budget deficits contribute, very \nunfortunately, to a higher level of interest rates than would otherwise \noccur. This raises capital costs. It has the consequence of hurting our \neconomy by curtailing the total investment that we have in the economy.\n  Add to this, the failure to balance the Federal budget contributes to \nsignificant trade deficits and dependence on foreign capital. And worst \nof all, the point that is perhaps most often made on this floor having \nto do with the issue of balancing the budget and the balanced budget \namendment, the failure to deal with the Federal deficit and the Federal \ndebt is very likely to leave a potentially crushing burden on future \ngenerations that would make their living standards lower than they \notherwise would have been.\n  As we have pointed out frequently on this floor, Mr. President, \nduring the 103d Congress, the annual Federal deficit actually declined. \nIt declined for 2 years in a row for the first time in two decades. And \nnow, under the current estimates, it is projected to decline for a \nthird straight year in a row. This has not happened for many, many \ndecades, I believe as far back as President Truman.\n  Our concern in offering this motion is that the progress in reducing \nthe Federal deficit achieved during the 103d Congress could be very \nquickly reversed if we do not have the will to say no to either an \nacross-the-board tax cut or a middle-class tax cut. If we do not say no \nto these tax cuts--a difficult thing to do politically--the legacy of \nthe 104th Congress will not be the passage of a balanced budget \namendment. The legacy will be dropping the ball and forever making the \nFederal deficit and the Federal debt unsurmountable barriers.\n  Quite simply, our motion says that enacting such tax cuts is \ninconsistent with and contrary to efforts being made to achieve further \ndeficit reduction during the 104th Congress and that tax cuts are \nclearly, Mr. President, contrary to the goal of achieving a balanced \nbudget.\n  So, Mr. President, the motion concludes by saying it is the sense of \nthe committee--this being the Budget Committee--that reducing the \nFederal deficit should be one of the Nation's highest priorities, and \nthat enacting across-the-board or so-called middle-class tax cuts \nduring the 104th Congress would hinder efforts to reduce the Federal \ndeficit, and that enacting such tax cuts would be inconsistent with \nproposals to adopt a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. So \nthat is our intent.\n  I believe that this is an opportunity for both sides of the aisle, \nRepublican and Democrat, to go on record for the first time on this \nvery key issue. And the issue is whether or not the November 8 \nelections were really about tax cuts.\n  People have a lot of theories about what was intended by the \nelectorate in that election. One theory is that people wanted a tax \ncut, that was the driving force, and that is why the President, \nsupposedly, offered a middle-class tax cut, and that is why the \nRepublican contract offers an even more dramatic and surprisingly large \ntax cut at a time of major Federal deficits.\n  I believe, based on my reading of this issue--and I think my \ncosponsors agree--that is not what the electorate meant at all. The \npeople of this country were not calling for a tax cut, because they \nknow the hard and difficult facts. They know who they are stealing from \nif we do not reduce the Federal deficit. They know that a tax cut today \nmeans a larger deficit and larger debt for tomorrow for their children \nand grandchildren. And the numbers bear it out very well.\n  Mr. President, one of the charts I have here today describes the \nimpact of the smaller tax cut proposal, the proposal by the President \nfor a $63 billion tax cut over the next 5 years. As the chart shows, if \nwe go through with the President's proposal, by fiscal year 2000 the \ndeficit would still be hovering at almost $200 billion after we, under \nthe leadership of that very same President, finally got the deficit \nbelow that figure for the first time in many years.\n  What this chart suggests is that if we do not enact the President's \ntax cuts, and add to it the interest savings that accrue from not \nmaking the deficit worse, you net out about a $25 billion difference in \nthe fifth year alone. In one year alone, not doing this tax cut could \nmean a $25 billion improvement in our deficit picture. And that is not \nsomething to sneeze at.\n  Put together all those 5 years, again you are talking about just $63 \nbillion saved, plus all the interest saved.\n  What I believe the American people think is that if we have these \ncuts to be made--the President says he has them, he has identified \nthem, he has put them on paper, he has put his name to them and taken \nthe political heat--what the American people are saying is, ``Good. Do \nthose cuts, but use them to bring down the Federal deficit,'' as this \nchart shows we could fairly easily do just using the President's own \nfigures.\n  Now a second illustration is even more dramatic. It suggests, as I \ncertainly would, that compared to the President's proposal, which at \nleast pays for all the tax cuts with spending cuts, that there is an \neven more extreme proposal in the Republican Contract With America.\n  Over that same time period of 5 years, the Contract With America \ncalls not for $63 billion in tax cuts, but the whopping sum of $196 \nbillion in tax cuts by the year 2000.\n  Now, this is from the same folks, largely, who say they are going to \npass a balanced budget amendment, that they do not need to tell you \nwhere the money is going to come from, that we do not need a glidepath, \nand that we are going to be able to give out this tax cut and \neverything is going to be just fine. We are going to have a balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  But if we do what the Contract With America suggests over the next 5 \nyears, we will not have this type of deficit reduction and we will miss \na tremendous opportunity to enormously decrease the Federal deficit.\n  This second chart shows that in the fiscal year 2000, if we do not do \nthe Republican tax cut--which I do not think the American people want \nanyway--that instead of having an almost $200 billion deficit, we could \nfinally be making real progress. We could take all those Republican \ncuts and the deficit would be down to $114 billion in fiscal year 2000.\n  In other words, we would actually be within reach of our shared goal. \nAnd \n [[Page S2619]] that shared goal, whether we are for the balanced \nbudget amendment or not, is that, at least by the year 2002, this \nfigure would be zero, that we would have a balanced budget.\n  How can the Contract With America talk about a balanced budget and a \nbalanced budget amendment and then propose a tax cut that takes us just \nin the opposite direction? Two-hundred billion dollars in the wrong \ndirection.\n  So, Mr. President, I suppose those who support the Republican \nContract With America's tax cuts are advocates of trickle down \nReaganomics, if you will. They may argue that by doing these tax cuts \nthe economy may do better than doing nothing; somehow the revenues will \ncome in and these figures will then be reduced and our estimating will \nbe wrong and we will wipe out the deficit that way. I sure hope that is \ntrue, if we go down that road.\n  The way we got into this deficit in the first place was 12 years \nwhere tax cuts for all folks, including high-income folks, had just the \nopposite result, where the deficit went out of control.\n  I suppose those on the other side of the aisle could say that \nPresident Clinton's proposal for a middle-class tax cut is, in effect, \ntrickle up. Give middle-income people some money, they will spend it, \nand the economy will do better and that will bring in the revenues to \nsolve our fiscal problems. I hope that is true. I like his idea better \nthan the Republican contract.\n  But the evidence is just not there that that will be the actual \nimpact on our Federal budget. I would suggest just the opposite would \noccur. Putting that money in the economy at this point may actually \ndrive up inflation, drive up interest rates, and lead to just the \nopposite conclusion.\n  So whether you look at it from the point of view of the Contract With \nAmerica or from the point of view of the President's proposal, which I \nknow he offers in good faith, neither proposal is consistent with or \nmakes any sense if people in this body are sincere when they talk about \nbalancing the Federal budget over the next 7 years. We cannot have it \nboth ways.\n  And what I am most struck by is that the American people are, of \ncourse, ahead of us on this, as they so often are. They know better \nthan we do. They are ahead of our rhetoric. They are ahead of the tax \ncut.\n  In fact, it gets even worse if you look into the outyears. The 10-\nyear cost of the President's tax cuts is not just $63 billion. The 10-\nyear cost of the so called middle-class tax cut is $174 billion. That \nis a pretty high figure. Of course, it is not even as high as the \nentire amount of the Republicans' $196 billion for the first 5 years.\n  So what is the 10-year impact if we go down the road of the \nRepublican contract and their tax cut? Believe it or not, the \nRepublican contract and its tax cut call for a $704 billion tax cut \nover the next 10 years, and they are going to balance the budget? Who \nin this country would even begin to believe that that was possible? \nThat is the guaranteed route to the worst budget disaster we would ever \nhave, and it is hard to believe we could do worse than in the 1980's. \nIf we do that one in 10 years, that is exactly where we will be.\n  Just in terms of interest costs, the interest we would save in the \n10th year alone by not adopting the Republican contract tax cuts is \n$48.4 billion, just in the 10th year; $50 billion worth of interest. \nThat is almost as much as the President's whole 5-year tax-cut plan. \nThat is what the Contract With America calls for in the name of the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  That is 30 percent more than the Federal Government will spend on \ntransportation in fiscal year 1996 and more than we will spend this \nyear on all of the Federal judiciary, the entire legislative branch and \nthe programs and personnel of the Small Business Administration, the \nGeneral Services Administration, the Commerce Department, the State \nDepartment, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Interior \nDepartment and the Justice Department combined. That is just the \ninterest that we lose and that we have to pay out on just the 10th year \nof the Republican plan that includes as well the notion of a balanced \nbudget amendment. Mr. President, this makes no sense on the facts.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to point out that although some \nsay it is very courageous to stand up here and make this motion to \nrefer and, of course, that is nice for me and all the Senators, it does \nnot take that much courage to go along with what your constituents are \ntelling you to do.\n  Since December 15, in my office we have received well over 400 \nletters and phone calls on the issue of whether the people of Wisconsin \nwant us to do the middle-class tax cut. The figures are surprising \nperhaps to some but they do not surprise me, because I find almost no \none in my State who wants this tax cut.\n  Here are the figures: 356 people who have contacted me say they do \nnot want the tax cut. They say they want the money used from the cuts \non programs to reduce the Federal deficit. Only 73 people contacted us \nto say go ahead with the tax cut. I realize it goes against political \nconventional wisdom, but I guess I would be the first to say that even \nthough the November 8 elections were clearly not about people wanting a \ntax cut. I do not think there is any evidence of that, but I do know \nwhat the November 8 elections were about is that people are tired of \npolitics as usual. Even though politicians are taught in politics 101 \nor in their first campaign, do not ever go against a tax cut, the \nAmerican people are smashing that conventional wisdom. They are saying \nthat they know it is pandering. They are saying that they know we have \na greater problem, a problem that affects not just them and the bills \nthey have today, but a problem that could destroy the future of their \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  That is the experience the other Senators who are cosponsoring this \nhave had. They have come up to me, have done the town meetings in their \nStates and have said, Senator Feingold, we are hearing the same thing \nyou are. People are saying do the cuts, please take the fat out of the \nFederal Government, pare it down, but do not throw away that money on a \nmeaningless tax cut that fails to deal with our national budgetary \nproblems.\n  So I have been pleased with the support in this body. I actually have \nnot had a single conversation with any Member of the Senate who says he \nor she is very much for the tax cut. At best, they are ambivalent about \nit. I know in the House there is more support for a tax cut. After all, \nit is part of the Republican contract. There is a certain group looking \nto see what percentage of the items in the contract may pass. Is it \ngoing to be 100? I do not think so because I do not think term limits \nis going to pass. But some are shooting for 70, 80 percent, some magic \nnumber. These are numbers in the contract that the other body ought to \ntake a look at because I do not think the people want that tax cut.\n  That is what one of the Members of the other House discovered when he \nwent out and decided to have a town meeting of his own, apparently, \nover the weekend.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Washington Post of \nFebruary 12, entitled ``Many Say They could Skip the Tax Cut,'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 12, 1995]\n\n                    Many Say They Could Skip Tax Cut\n\n                          (By Dale Russakoff)\n\n       MANVILLE, NJ., Feb. 11.--The House Budget Committee came to \n     this town today to hear how real people feel about the \n     federal budget crisis. After three hours of listening to \n     people of all ages demand less federal spending on defense, \n     welfare, the arts, public broadcasting and congressional \n     salaries, committee Chairman John R. Kasich (R-Ohio) hit the \n     crowd of about 1,000 with a hardball question.\n       Who was so concerned about the federal deficit that he or \n     she would forgo tax cuts promised by both Republicans and \n     Democrats until after the budget is balanced?\n       The question apparently wasn't hard at all. In the packed \n     meeting hall of a Veterans of Foreign Wars center here in \n     heavily Republican central New Jersey, hands went up \n     everywhere. Kasich then asked how many people wanted their \n     tax cuts up front, before the budget is balanced. Only a few \n     hands went up, and they were booed.\n       ``Both parties are offering a political rebate,'' Cole \n     Kleitsch, 33, a property manager who lives in Princeton, NJ., \n     and works for the debt-fighting Conquer Coalition, told the \n     committee, ``The people it [the debt] is going to hurt most--\n     the children--are not in this \n      [[Page S2620]] room. That's our posterity and we're supposed \n     to take care of it. So far, we're taking care of our \n     posterior.''\n       Despite the overwhelming sentiment for deferring tax cuts, \n     which Kasich said he and the committee also found in three \n     previous field hearings in the Midwest, West and South, the \n     chairman said there are no plans to reconsider the $200 \n     billion in tax relief that Republican House candidates \n     promised in their ``Contract With America.''\n       ``The number one thing we have to do in this country is \n     keep our word, and keeping our word involves doing the kind \n     of relief that is promised in the contract,'' Kasich said \n     after the hearing. ``It's something of a problem when you \n     have people overwhelmingly saying, `We don't want to do \n     this.' But I think if we start breaking our word, they're \n     just going to say, `Ah, it's just another group of \n     politicians.'''\n       ``It's not as clear to the public as it is to us that the \n     way you bring down deficits is to deny the government \n     revenue,'' said Rep. Robert S. Walker (R-Pa.), a close friend \n     and adviser of House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), \n     explaining the determination to press ahead with tax cuts.\n       Kasich emphasized that four hearings hardly constitute a \n     scientific example of national sentiment. (Voters told a \n     Washington Post-ABC poll that they favor deficit reduction \n     over tax cuts by a margin of 3 to 2).\n       But Kasich said that if the Senate pares down the tax \n     relief the House intends to pass--including a $500 per child \n     tax credit and a capital gains tax cut--sentiments like those \n     expressed at his committee's field hearings might make it \n     easier for House members to go along.\n       The hearing drew heavy turnout in this hard-luck community \n     that was the home of Johns-Manville Corp., the asbestos \n     manufacturer bankrupted by an avalanche of lawsuits from \n     victims of asbestos disease. More than 100 people were turned \n     away after the meeting hall filled to capacity.\n       An aide to Kasich said this was the first field hearing \n     that appeared to draw ``special interests,'' which he defined \n     as union members and advocates of tuition aid to the poor. A \n     number of anti-GOP banners were displayed outside the hall, \n     including: ``Big Welfare for the Rich and Orphanages for the \n     Poor? No Way!'' Another, with an arrow pointing toward the \n     meeting hall, said: ``The Tooth Fairy?''\n       Most speakers proposed cutting the budget in ways that \n     would not affect them directly. Phil Nicklas, who is not a \n     food stamp recipient, told the committee to eliminate the \n     food stamps program, Joel Whittaker said to toss out the \n     Legal Services Corp. and the National Endowment for the\n      Arts. Sherry Zowader said every member of Congress should \n     take a 15 percent pay cut.\n       But Carol Kasabach, 54, who lives near Trenton, told the \n     committee that she and her husband, who both are employed and \n     successful, would be willing to forgo some of the Social \n     Security benefits due them in order to help reduce the \n     deficit.\n       Walker responded that this would turn Social Security into \n     ``just another welfare program'' for those who qualify based \n     on need. Kasabach raised her voice and told Walker: ``This is \n     for the welfare of all of us, and we have a responsibility to \n     each other.''\n       The Corporation for Public Broadcasting had as many friends \n     as enemies in the audience. Walker challenged one advocate, \n     Sherry Zowader, to explain why her position did not mean that \n     working families should pay taxes ``to subsidize a $1 billion \n     industry called Big Bird.''\n       ``We can all pick out in government what we don't like our \n     money being spent on,'' Zowader said. ``And you have to pay \n     for some things you don't like as well as the things you \n     like. That's democracy.''\n       The sentiment against tax cuts was summed up powerfully by \n     Lynn Dill of Colonia, N.J., who told the committee: ``I want \n     the best thing for the country and the children. And if both \n     parties did the right thing, congressmen wouldn't have to \n     worry about getting reelected.''\n       This moved Rep. Martin R. Hoke (R-Ohio) to remark: ``We are \n     getting so much wisdom from this testimony, we should require \n     half of all the hearings in Congress be held not in \n     Washington, D.C., but outside.''\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me just take a moment on what \nhappened when Representative Kasich went out and asked the folks--\napparently he does not pretend it was otherwise--if they were for the \ntax cut. The article says, ``Who was so concerned about the Federal \ndeficit that he or she would forego tax cuts promised by both \nRepublicans and Democrats until after the budget is balanced?''\n  That is what he asked the crowd. How many people out there would give \nup their tax cut so that the budget would be balanced?\n  The article says the question apparently was not hard at all, it was \neasy for everyone.\n\n       In the packed meeting hall of the Veterans of Foreign Wars \n     Center here in heavily Republican central New Jersey, hands \n     went up everywhere. Kasich then asked how many people wanted \n     their tax cuts up front before the budget is balanced.\n\n  The newspaper reports only a few hands went up and they were booed.\n  So the message is finally reaching the other House that the American \npeople are ahead of the politicians, that the American people know that \nthis problem cannot be solved if we are going to spend $60 or $200 or \n$700 billion on tax cuts at the same time we are pretending--\npretending--to do something about the problem of the balanced budget \namendment.\n  I am also pleased to say, Mr. President, that the Concord Coalition, \nwhich has done a fine job of marshaling this issue of the Federal \ndeficit, has today endorsed our motion, writing that this is backed by \nthe 150,000 members in all 50 States and saying that, of course--of \ncourse--it is inconsistent for somebody to support the balanced budget \namendment and at the same time say they want a giant tax cut. No one \nbuys that story.\n  The same goes for the public opinion polls. On December 20, just 5 \ndays after the President's speech when everyone assumed that everyone \nwas for the tax cut, just 5 days later, a USA Today-CNN/Gallup Poll \nsaid 70 percent of the American people say that reducing the deficit is \na higher priority than a tax cut.\n  In the Washington Post, an ABC news poll on January 6, 1995, says the \npeople favor deficit reduction over tax cuts by a three-to-two margin. \nSo in every measure I can find, whether it be a man-on-the-street or \nwoman-on-the-street poll, the words of economists, calls to my office, \nthe letters to my office, I cannot find a constituency out there in the \nUnited States of America for this kind of fiscal recklessness.\n  But perhaps my favorite indication of this always is a political \ncartoon. I have to say that being a Senator has to be about the best \njob in the world, but if I had the talent, I would also love to be a \npolitical cartoonist. I do not have the artistic talent nor do I have, \nperhaps, the ability to do this. But this cartoon from our Milwaukee \nSentinel typifies this whole issue.\n  It shows an enormous creature, sort of a Jabba the Hut entitled \n``deficit.'' It just keeps eating and eating. And what it is eating is \nthe catering provided by a caterer called ``Tax Cuts R Us, Catering and \nPandering.''\n  Instead of putting this deficit monster on a diet, what this \ninstitution is on the verge of doing if we do not reverse course is to \ncontinue to feed this monster to the detriment of everyone today, \ntomorrow, and in the future.\n  Mr. President, I think this is an opportunity for us to make a \nbipartisan statement. No matter what else you feel about the balanced \nbudget amendment itself, we cannot have it both ways. The cosponsors of \nmy amendment include those who oppose the balanced budget amendment, \nsuch as myself. It includes some who have stated they will vote for the \nbalanced budget amendment, and it includes some who have said they are \nundecided.\n  What we all agree upon is that it cannot be either a rational or \nhonest process if we continue to feed this monster. A balanced budget \namendment cannot work hand in hand with an irresponsible tax cut that \nis being advocated, the false belief that the November 8 elections had \nanything to do with it.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the motion. I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I have been authorized by Senator Hatch's \nstaff to take 5 minutes of Senator Hatch's time.\n  Let me say, I agree with 99 percent of what my colleague from \nWisconsin has to say. I applaud his leadership on this. A tax cut just \ndoes not make sense when we have this kind of a deficit.\n  I am going to vote against his amendment because I do not want to get \nit mixed up with the balanced budget amendment. But I could not agree \nwith him more in terms of the substance. It is not only the things that \nhe mentioned.\n The Clinton tax cut is, frankly, more responsible than the Republican \n  tax cut, but they are both wrong.But in terms of equity, it is very \ninteresting, for those who have an income of $30,000 or less, even the \nClinton tax cut gives them only 5\\1/2\\ percent of the tax cut, while \nthose of us who get $100,000 to $200,000 a year--and that is the \nmajority of us in the U.S. Congress--some exceed that amount--we \n [[Page S2621]] get 12.4 percent of the tax cut--a much, much smaller \nnumber of people get a much bigger chunk of the tax cut.\n  A tax cut just does not make sense. My colleague from Wisconsin has \nbeen leading the effort on this, and I applaud his effort. I assume \nthis issue is going to come before the Budget Committee. I am going to \nbe with Senator Feingold there. I assume it will be debated in the \nChamber. I am going to be with Senator Feingold in the Chamber. I do \nnot favor having it on this particular constitutional amendment. I \nthink we should try to avoid everything that might confuse the \nconstitutional amendment. But in terms of principle, he is absolutely \non target, and I commend him.\n  I yield back the remainder of my 5 minutes to Senator Hatch.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois, who \nwas one of the very first persons who came up to me after the new year \nand said that, in fact, he was having the same experience in his State. \nEven though Wisconsin and Illinois are very close physically, they are \ncertainly not identical States. But he was having the same experience. \nHe was going around the State and people were saying do not take these \ncuts that you have identified and use them to do a tax cut. Take those \nopportunities to reduce the Federal deficit. I believe that is the \nconversation we had.\n  Mr. SIMON. If I may, if my colleague will yield, the first time I did \nthis was at a town meeting somewhere. Someone asked about the tax cut, \nand I said I believe in telling you the truth, and I do not anticipate \nmy answer is going to be popular. Frankly, I had not seen the polls. \nAnd I told them I was opposed to the tax cut; that we ought to be using \nthat money to reduce the deficit. And instead of boos, I got cheers \nfrom the town meeting, and that has been my experience ever since. I \nthink that would be the experience of most Members of the Senate when \nthey try it out with the people.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I do feel the need to address what the \nSenator just suggested, that it somehow confuses people for the Senate \nto go on record on this issue. How can this be confusing? This motion \ndoes not delay. I think no one disputes that. It is an automatic \nreferral back from the Budget Committee. This is not an effort to slow \ndown the balanced budget amendment.\n  I have also pointed out to the body that this does not become part of \nthe constitutional amendment itself. This does not go out to the States \nfor purposes of their ratification process. That would not make a lot \nof sense, since it is up to us here to decide whether we are going to \nhave a middle-class tax cut or an across-the-board tax cut, so I do not \nsee how this could possibly confuse anyone, that the Senate would \nchoose to go on record that we are going to be straight with the \nAmerican people and not kid them that we can afford a tax cut at the \nsame time we are passing a balanced budget amendment. I do not \nunderstand how anyone could be confused by that logic.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield on that?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SIMON. I think the reality is if we put this in as a sense of the \nSenate here now, there are some of my colleagues who disagree with the \nSenator and me, in fact probably a majority disagree with the Senator \nand me on this. But even assuming it is a majority on our side, there \nmay be some who would vote against the proposition because this sense \nof the Senate is there, and so I think it has the possibility--I am not \nsaying it is a probability, but I think it has the possibility of \nlosing a vote or two, and I think my colleague from Utah would agree we \nneed every vote we can get.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I think this is exactly what is wrong \nwith this balanced budget amendment process. We saw this with regard to \nthe so-called glidepath amendment, the so-called right to know. In the \ndesperate desire to get enough votes to pass the balanced budget \namendment, we are closing the door on honesty with the American people.\n  This body has, unfortunately, refused to lay out that 5- or 7-year \nplan that would tell us where it is going to come from. That is bad \nenough. But when you close off an opportunity to make a clean statement \nthat we cannot afford the tax cut and still have a balanced budget \namendment, then you are even going farther because what you are doing \nwith this tax cut is digging an even deeper hole. It is already hard \nenough to lay out exactly how we are going to put together the numbers \nunder the current problem. But when you add another $60, $200, $700 \nbillion, $1 trillion, as you claim to be solving the problem, that is \nwhere the real obfuscation, the real confusion, the real misleading of \nthe American public comes.\n  Mr. President, do you know what the American people think when they \nhear about the balanced budget amendment? I believe they think we are \ngoing to actually balance the budget when we do this. I do not think \nthey really all realize that we are setting into motion here something \nthat is going to take probably the better part of a decade, and in the \nmeantime there will be no legal requirement that we balance the budget.\n  So what is a more important and appropriate time than right now, as \nthis amendment comes to a vote in the Chamber in the next few days or \nweeks, to tell the American people we understand that cutting taxes \nwill make it virtually impossible either to meet the balanced budget \nrequirement, if it is enacted, or that the human consequence and the \npain that will be suffered by people in this country will be enormous \nif we suddenly cut $200 or $700 billion out of our Federal revenues at \nthis point, leaving it even more impossible to balance the Federal \nbudget in any kind of humane way? And for anyone who thinks this motion \nis either confusing or inappropriate, this is precisely the motion the \ndistinguished majority leader used in order to put forward his motion \non Social Security.\n  Now, if this is confusing, why was that not confusing? Presumably we \nwould not put anything on the bill if it is an issue of confusion. I \nthink the source of confusion is clear. The effort to confuse is from \nthose who do not want to tell the truth to the American people, which \nis that the Contract With America goes completely in two directions at \nthe same time.\n  Several Members on the other side of the aisle have publicly stated, \nin the Finance Committee and also in public statements and in \nstatements in the Chamber, that they, too, do not support the tax cuts, \nknowing what it means for the budget.\n  So I feel strongly that there is no reason not to pass a simple \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution at this time. It does not go out to the \nStates, and it tells the truth. And that is that all these tax cut \nplans are the ultimate demonstration that many supporters of the \nbalanced budget amendment are not as dedicated to balancing the budget \nas they pretend.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate what the distinguished Senator \nis trying to do. I know he feels very sincerely and is very dedicated \nto deficit reduction, as he has said. But the bottom line of this \nmotion to refer is that we should protect the largest tax increase in \nhistory and that we should avoid enacting tax cuts that even the \nPresident, President Clinton, has called for.\n  This is political cheerleading for the action of a single Congress in \na single piece of legislation and I think it is wholly inappropriate to \na constitutional debate like this one we are having with regard to the \nbalanced budget amendment, because the Constitution sets in place broad \nprinciples and leaves yearly budgeting priorities to be set by each \nsucceeding Congress, as it is each Congress' right and duty to do.\n  What I suggest to my friend from Wisconsin is that we can have this \ndebate more appropriately when Congress debates the implementing \nlegislation contemplated by the amendment. That would be a perfect \nplace for him to bring his concerns to the Senate. If the Congress \nchooses to accept the point of view of the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin that there should be no further tax cuts, then Congress can \ndo so. But in this context I really do not see a reason to vote for \nthis motion to refer.\n  It is ironic, indeed, for those of us who have been watching this \ndebate, to \n [[Page S2622]] see that those who have criticized proponents of the \nbalanced budget amendment for writing fiscal policy into the \nConstitution, as they say--and of course this balanced budget amendment \ndoes not do that--it is ironic to see them attempt to set tax policy \nduring this debate.\n  The motion before us serves only two purposes, I think. One, to make \na political point in praise of the tax hikes of the 103d Congress. And, \ntwo, to attempt to keep the same level of taxing that we now have to \nensure there is more money and more spending than Congress might \notherwise have, if the American people decide that the spending is not \nworth the taxes.\n  So I do urge the defeat of this motion and express the hope that we \ncan move to final passage of the balanced budget amendment soon, so we \ncan finally begin to move this Government to fiscal responsibility. \nBecause every day that goes by while we are debating this, another $829 \nmillion is added to the national debt, as is shown on our balanced \nbudget debt tracker here.\n  The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin is concerned about the \nnational debt, wanting to keep the tax increases in place, not wanting \nto allow any tax cuts that might stimulate the economy and get more \npeople paying taxes. And every day we have more amendments like this \nthe debt is going up $829 million.\n  We are now in the 16th day since we started this debate and we have \nbeen on the floor 12 days of that time, and during that time the \nnational debt has increased $13,271,040,000. Actually we are higher \nthan that because we are almost into the 17th day. So the debt is going \nup while we fiddle around here in Washington and watch our country burn \nto the ground.\n  Let me just make an additional point or two here regarding the time \nspent in previous debates on the balanced budget amendment, because \nsome have complained that we are trying to move the process along too \nfast. I have a brief breakdown of previous Senate action on other \nconstitutional amendments to balance the budget.\n  When I was chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee in the 97th \nCongress, Senator Thurmond and I brought to the floor--it was the first \ntime anybody ever brought to the floor of either House of the \nCongress--a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. We brought \nthat to the floor and the floor action on the resolution took 11 days. \nDuring that period of 11 days 31 amendments were offered, 24 Democrat \namendments and 7 Republican amendments. The resolution finally passed \nthe Senate by a rollcall vote of 69 yeas to 31 nays.\n  It went to the House, of course, and was defeated there. Tip O'Neill \nled the troops over there and he defeated us even though we got 60 \npercent of the vote. But it was 11 days of debate on the Senate floor \nat that time, and we had 31 amendments.\n  In the 99th Congress we brought it again to the floor. This was in \n1986. Again I was still chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee. We \nhad 7 days of debate on the resolution, 13 amendments were offered, 7 \nof them were offered by Democrats, 6 by Republicans, and the resolution \nfailed by rollcall vote 66 yeas to 34 nays. By one vote that resolution \nfailed back in 1986.\n  Then again, the third time it was ever brought to the floor of the \nSenate was in 1994, last year, it was designated Senate Joint \nResolution 41. On that resolution we spent 5 days of floor debate, we \nhad one amendment offered that was a Democrat amendment, and the \nresolution failed by four votes, 63 to 37.\n  Now, already in this 104th Congress, on House Joint Resolution 1, we \nare in the 12th day of consideration and debate. We have had six \namendments and three motions, three of them have been Democratic \namendments with one motion a Democrat motion and three have been \nRepublican amendments with one motion--plus this one. So what I am \nsaying is that we are moving awfully slow here this year by historical \nstandards, and we should get moving on to final passage. But I \nappreciate the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin. I know he is \nsincere. I know he is trying to resolve the deficit problems in his own \nway.\n  But really this debate ought to wait until the implementing \nlegislation where he may have a better chance of actually passing \nsubstantive language that may get him where he wants to be, which seems \nto be to stop any kind of tax reduction or tax cut--even ones like the \nPresident wants--at that more appropriate time.\n  I am prepared to yield the remainder of our time but I will be happy \nto yield the floor. I see the Senator wants to speak longer but I am \nprepared to yield back if the Senator will.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we are not prepared to yield back our \ntime. The senior Senator from Arkansas will speak in a minute.\n  Let me just say briefly I am somewhat amused at the notion that the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee brings up, the fact \nthe deficit is going up every day as we speak, as if somehow it is the \nfault of this debate that the deficit is going up.\n  But even under the terms of the balanced budget amendment, the notion \nis there would not be a balanced budget until the year 2002. I ask you, \nwhat is more damaging to the goal of balancing the Federal budget? \nDebating a subject as to how consistent it is to have tax cuts and \nbalance the budget at the same time and debating that for a few days? \nOr to pretend that somehow after we dig this huge hole for the Federal \ndeficit again that we will be able to solve it over the course of those \nnext 7 years? It does not make sense.\n  The notion that we are going to cut off debate on the basic budgetary \nchoices that are involved in the context of the balanced budget \namendment debate does not make any sense to me. I do not think it makes \nany sense to the American people. It would be one thing if we were all \nagreed that we were going to move in the same direction. If everybody \nin both Houses said of course we are going to make sure that everything \nwe do brings down the deficit, that would be one thing. But what I and \nSenator Bumpers and others are trying to point out is that this \nparticular notion of a tax cut flies in the face of any reasonable \nperson's notion of what is supposed to happen here, which is reducing \nthe Federal deficit, not increasing it by $200 or $750 billion.\n  With that I am happy to yield to the senior Senator from Arkansas, \nwho has been a leader on deficit reduction here and has been a great \nhelp on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin for \nyielding. But more important, I think him for crafting this sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution which ought to pass 100-zip.\n  I do not know how many votes we have had--maybe 60 votes since we \ncame back into session. And I will hand it to the Republicans, they \nknow how to stick together. I am speaking of votes occurring not only \non the balanced budget amendment but everything that has come up since \nwe came into session. It has been unanimous on the other side. I think \non one vote two Republicans defected.\n  So it makes you have second thoughts about even standing up here and \ntalking what you think is ordinary common sense. But the Senator from \nWisconsin, with whom I am pleased to join in this amendment, is simply \nsaying it is time we quit playing games and start debating the real \nissue, and that is, ``What are we going to do about the deficit?'' The \nbalanced budget amendment is probably a done deal. But as far as the \ndeficit is concerned, it does not make any difference whether the \nbalanced budget amendment passes or not. If it passes or if it fails, \nwe are going to be back to square one after we vote on final passage \nbecause we are going to have to figure out how to actually balance the \nbudget.\n  You see that chart over there? That is clever. I give the Republicans \ncredit for putting that chart up.\n It shows how much the deficit has gone up each day since we started \ndebating the balanced budget amendment. I wish we had a chart on this \nside showing how much the deficit would have gone up if we had not \npassed the President's deficit reduction plan in 1993 without a single \nRepublican vote. It would be 50 percent higher each day. Our chart \nwould show the deficit going up 50 to 75 percent more every day than \nthat chart shows. And we reduced the deficit that much without one \n  single Republican vote. [[Page S2623]] So, Madam President, I rise \ntoday to try to talk common sense. There is a new book out. I was down \nat Wake Forest University today delivering a speech at a convocation. A \nman caught me just as I was leaving. He said, Senator, you must read \nthis new book called ``The Death of Common Sense, How It Is Suffocating \nAmerica.'' Well, that is what we are trying to talk about--common \nsense.\n  I want you to think about this, Senators. The Republican Contract \nWith America is not a contract I signed, but it says we are going to \npass this balanced budget amendment. And we are going to give the \nAmerican people expanded IRA's to increase savings. And we are going to \nprovide an across-the-board tax cut that costs $200 billion over the \nnext 5 years and $700 billion over the next 10 years. Then we are going \nto increase defense spending by somewhere between $60 and $80 billion. \nThen we are going to provide a capital gains tax cut, 90 percent of \nwhich goes to the richest 5 percent of the people in America. We are \ngoing to do all this and balance the budget in the year 2002. What that \nadds up to, Madam President, is $1.6 trillion that must be cut in the \nnext 7 years.\n  Everybody here who has been here any time at all knows that is \nabsolutely lunacy. That is not going to happen. There are not very many \npeople in State hospitals in this country that believe we are going to \nmake all those tax cuts, increase defense spending, and balance the \nbudget. Yet the Congress bought that same argument 14 years and $3.5 \ntrillion ago.\n  Did you know that if it were not for the interest on the increased \ndebt that built up during the 12 years of the Ronald Reagan and George \nBush Presidencies, we would have a surplus today. Not a deficit--a \nsurplus--if we were not paying the interest on that staggering debt we \naccumulated when we bought the same argument we are asked to buy again \ntoday.\n  There is one thing that is really crafty about the Contract With \nAmerica. The middle-class tax cut in the Contract With America is \nsupposed to cost $200 billion in the first 5 years. Then, in the next 5 \nyears, it will cost $500 billion. That is very crafty. But the only \ntime you ever hear this Chamber so silent that you can hear the \ntermites working is when you ask, ``How are you going to pay for it?'' \nIt would make Houdini blush to suggest that this can be done in the \nnext 7 years.\n  Every Member of Congress, every economist in the country, and every \ncitizen of America, knows that this is palpable nonsense. With his \namendment, the Senator from Wisconsin is saying it is time we start \nactually doing something about the deficit instead of just putting a \nfew words in the Constitution.\n  Let me say to my colleagues that you do not even have to be \ncourageous to vote for this amendment. Look here. Here is a USA Today \npoll; 70 percent of the people of this country say put those spending \ncuts on the deficit. Everybody says, ``Senator you are going to vote \nagainst the balanced budget amendment. It is very popular.'' I say, \n``You are going to provide middle-class tax cuts and that is very \nunpopular.''\n  Let me just read a couple of letters. These are ordinary citizens, \nconstituents of mine.\n\n       Dear Senator Bumpers: The truth is, as much as I hate \n     paying taxes, I don't want this tax break. I would much \n     rather see the cuts made as proposed, taxes kept at the \n     current rate, and see some serious reduction in the national \n     debt. This is a price for my future and that of my children \n     that I am willing to pay.\n\n  Madam President, the people of America are way ahead of this crowd.\n  Here is another letter from a constituent in Warren, AR:\n\n       Dear Senator Bumpers: I urge you with your vote to cut \n     spending by the Federal Government in every way possible and \n     to not even think about tax reductions or refunds.\n\n  He says that we need to reduce the deficit.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent those two constituent \nletters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Warren, AR, January 5, 1995.\n     Sen. Dale Bumpers,\n     Dirksen Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sen. Bumpers: I urge you with your vote to cut \n     spending by the Federal government in every way possible and \n     to not even think about tax reductions or refunds. In my \n     opinion, we need to not only reduce the deficit spending but \n     to eliminate it and start reducing the debt.\n       I realize my request is almost impossible to fulfill but \n     there has to be a day of reckoning where the dollar won't be \n     worth two cents if we continue our deficit spending for \n     things the nation can not afford. We have been living in a \n     fairland for too many years.\n           Respectfully yours,\n     F. Martin Hankins.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               Siloam Springs, AR.\n       Dear Senator Bumpers. I am writing to you in regard to the \n     numerous tax reduction plans for the middle class. I am, I \n     assume, one of those discussed, as the combined annual income \n     of my wife and I fall in the 40-50,000 dollar range.\n       The truth is, as much as I hate paying taxes, I don't want \n     this tax break. I would much rather see the cuts made as \n     proposed, taxes kept at the current rate, and see some \n     serious reduction in the national debt. This is a price for \n     my future and that of my children that I am willing to pay.\n       I am not alone in my belief. I have talked to a great many \n     people on this issue, and all of them have been of the same \n     voice. We would rather see the money invested in debt \n     reduction than to go out to McDonald's an extra time each \n     month on the tax savings.\n       On the issue of budget cuts, I recently returned from my \n     fourth trip from the National Fire Academy. This is a superb \n     organization and would very much like to see it's funding \n     maintained or increased. The U.S. continues to have the \n     highest fire loss in the industrialized world. There is much \n     that needs to be done. But the results produced by the \n     National Fire Academy and the U.S. Fire Administration have \n     made a tremendous difference in training, education and \n     research. I hope that room may be found to allow them to \n     press forth with their plans for the future.\n       Thank you for your time, interest and involvement.\n                                                    Andy Mitchell.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, it just drives me insane, the \ntalk about providing $700 billion in tax cuts, then providing another \nLord knows how much for the Pentagon, and, then say, ``Folks, just as \nsoon as we can get these words in the Constitution, we will balance the \nbudget in the year 2002.'' What are we doing? We are treating them like \nchildren who could not possibly understand the nuances, the \nsophistication, the complication of the budget process. ``But they \nunderstand if you put it in the Constitution. The Constitution is a \nsacred document.''\n  We have had 11,000 constitutional amendment proposals since this \ncountry was founded. Besides the Bill of Rights, those 10 amendments \nadopted together in 1789, the people of this country have amended the \nConstitution 17 times. But people here in Congress have tried to get \nthem to amend it over 11,000 times. You know something else. Of the \n11,000, the majority of those amendments have occurred in the last 32 \nyears. And 35 constitutional amendments have been proposed since we \ncame back into session January 3. That is one a day. Jefferson, Jay, \nAdams, Hamilton, the most brilliant congregation of minds ever \nassembled under one roof, gave us this sacred document and we \ntrivialize it. Norm Ornstein said the Constitution is the fix of last \nresort. Do you want a figleaf to go home and talk to your constituents \nabout instead of actually doing something to reduce the deficit? Term \nlimits, put it in the Constitution. Prayer in school, put it in the \nConstitution. The Constitution is not crafted to deal with social \nproblems for which there is a legislative fix. You know that virtually \nevery one of the 35 constitutional amendments that have been introduced \nthis year have been introduced by Republicans, who consider themselves \nconservatives. But you know what, Robert Gowin, a scholar at the \nAmerican Enterprise Institute, a very conservative think tank here, \nsays: ``Conservatives revere our institutions and our traditions.'' \nTrue conservatives. Robert Gowin says, ``True conservatives do not muck \nwith the Constitution.'' I could not agree with him more.\n  Madam President, what we are talking about is spine, a little \ncourage, not a figleaf to hide behind by putting a few words in the \nConstitution and hope that 7 years from now people will have forgotten \nthe grandiose and wholly unkept promises.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin and I are simply trying to introduce a \ngrain of common sense into this debate. The American people deserve it. \nIf the President can find $63 billion for a middle-class tax cut, then \nput it on the deficit. If the Republicans can find $200 billion or $700 \nbillion for tax cuts and \n [[Page S2624]] increases in defense spending, put it on the deficit.\n  Finally, let me reiterate, Madam President, that this is a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution that does not cost you a nickel. You are not \nchanging the constitutional amendment that is before us, House Joint \nResolution 1. You are simply saying, yes, I agree that we need to get \nthe show on the road in a serious way and quit talking nonsense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nArkansas for his wonderful statement of common sense. That is all we \nare trying to do is to be a little bit direct with the American people \nand say that it is wholly impossible to balance the Federal budget at \nthe same time you are talking about massive tax cuts.\n  In a moment, the distinguished Senator from Minnesota will join with \nus. But let me just say that I think what the Senator was saying at the \nend is important to reiterate. A lot of folks here that are for the \nbalanced budget amendment--and maybe some of them do not plan to be \naround here when we have to actually make these hard decisions; maybe \nsome will retire; maybe some will be President; maybe some will be term \nlimited; maybe they will be kicked out of here by their own vote for \nterm limits. But this is an awfully sweet deal for a politician. If you \nvote for a balanced budget amendment, you get to hand out a giant tax \ncut to everybody, and you do not have to say what you are going to cut \nfor many years. It is like a hat trick. That is about the best thing a \npolitician could have. That is exactly the kind of concern I have here. \nI think many people are very sincere about balancing the Federal \nbudget. But if we are not honest about this issue, that you cannot have \nit both ways, you cannot have a tax cut and balance the budget, then we \nare failing our responsibility to be direct with the American people.\n  Madam President, I want to note one thing about the debate thus far. \nThe hour and a half is coming to an end. I have not heard one single \nSenator say one good thing about the tax cut proposal. Not a single \nSenator has come out and said it is a good idea to cut taxes across the \nboard or to have a middle-class tax cut. But I have heard at least four \nMembers from the other side of the aisle--the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont, the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Oregon, chairman of the Finance Committee--all publicly say that \nthis might not make sense. They may not well be able to support this \ntax cut.\n  Madam President, I guess what I am in search of now is, who is for \nthis? Why do we not start building the foundation of a balanced budget \nby pointing out that there is nobody in the U.S. Senate who cares \nenough to come down here and defend the Contract With America's tax cut \nprovision. There is not a single Senator that has come out and defended \nthe President's notion of a middle-class tax cut. I am reading from \ntoday's debate that there is not a constituency--certainly not among \nthe American public. Maybe the good news here is that we are not even \ngoing to try to do this. If that is what we get out of this process, I \nwill be delighted. I await the day when a Senator comes out here and \nsays, First, he is for a tax cut of this magnitude, $200 billion, and \nsecond, he can show us how to have a balanced budget while he does it.\n  I am delighted to yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I might, I would like to respond to the \nchallenge of the Senator from Wisconsin very briefly before we hear the \ncomments of the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I assume that comes off of their time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It does.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator. I will challenge it in this way, \nwithout talking about all of the proposals in the Contract With \nAmerica.\n  One of the key proposals in the Contract With America is to reverse \npart of the tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of \nthis country, that raised a tax on seniors. As a matter of fact, it \nsays that if you are a wealthy senior making a grand sum of $34,000 a \nyear, we are going to tax 85 percent of your Social Security. We think \nthat is wrong and we think that tax increase should be repealed. That \nis part of the Contract With America.\n  What the amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin suggests is that \nthat tax cut ought to be off the table, that we should not consider any \npart of the Contract With America tax cuts, because it will make it too \nhard to balance the budget. Well, in some respects it does make it \nharder to balance the budget because you have to, in effect, pay for \nthe tax cuts and the reductions called for in balancing the budget. But \nthere are some of us who think the Federal Government spends far too \nmuch and we can achieve the savings to accomplish both goals.\n  We also believe that it is important as a matter of public policy and \nas a commitment to the seniors of this country to repeal that \npernicious tax increase that was part of the President's large tax \nincrease of 2 years ago--this Social Security tax increase.\n  In the last several days, a lot of Members--particularly from the \nother side--were in the body here proposing that we protect seniors by \ntaking Social Security off budget. ``We cannot allow the balanced \nbudget amendment to hurt seniors,'' they said. But they are willing to \nsay that we should not help seniors by repealing this onerous 85-\npercent Social Security tax increase. It is a little bit like playing \nthe first half of a ball game--of course, the Democratic party was in \nthe majority 2 years ago; they had the House, the Senate, and the \nPresidency, so they had the power to ram that tax increase through--and \nthen when the second half of the ball game starts and the Republicans \nare in control of the Senate and the House of Representatives and we \nwould like to play in the game and repeal that tax increase that the \nPresident got through and that they supported, they say no, no, we are \ngoing to call an end to the ball game now. We are not going to play the \nsecond half. We are going to leave that tax increase in the law so that \na wealthy senior who makes $34,000 a year--wealthy by that definition, \nof course--is going to be taxed 85 percent on Social Security. We say \nthat is not right, that we should repeal that tax and that we can \nrepeal that tax at the same time that we are beginning the process of \nbalancing the budget. It will take 6 or 7 years, but we will get there \nand we will get there for one reason: Because the balanced budget \namendment will force us to get there.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, briefly, I appreciate the input of the \nSenator from Arizona. We want to find out what Senators are supporting \nso-called tax cuts, and we are interested to know how in the world it \nis going to be paid for while we go forward with increasing defense \nspending and balancing the Federal budget and all of the things \nprovided for in the contract. I think this is exactly what we are \nconcerned about. We are concerned that the contract's effect is not to \nbalance the budget, but to undo the progress made in the last 2 years.\n  The Senator just described one of the elements that led to the \nreduction of the Federal deficit for the first time in many, many \nyears. He is on record that he is going to try to repeal it. We do not \nhave on record how we are going to pay for that item, or how we are \nthen going beyond that. Because the problem with repealing that is you \nhave to come up with the money to pay for its repeal, and even then you \nstill have not done one single penny of net deficit reduction. You have \ngone in the wrong direction.\n  So that is what the debate has to be about. That is what the American \npeople are entitled to.\n  I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Madam President.\n  First of all, let me thank the Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], \nfor his leadership on this issue. I think, Madam President, the thing \nthat I appreciate the most about the Senator from Wisconsin is his \ninsistence that we be very straightforward with people and that we \ntreat the people that we represent with intelligence and that we lay \nout very honestly and truthfully what the options are.\n  Now we can disagree in good faith about what those options are. And I \nunderstand that full well. But from my perspective, Madam President--\nand I \n [[Page S2625]] have said this a couple of times about these tax cuts--\nI really liken this, to use an old Jewish proverb, to trying to dance \nat two weddings at the same time. I just think you cannot talk about \nmore deficit reduction and at the same time say you are going to have \nthis broad-based tax cut--broad-based; we are not talking about one \nparticular proposal, broad-based to the tune of $200 billion since we \nare talking about a balanced budget amendment between 1996 and 2002 and \nthen another $500 billion between 1992 and 1997. That is $700 billion \nof tax cuts that is to be made that has to be made up somewhere even \nbefore we begin to then get back to deficit reduction.\n  And so, Madam President, my concern about the direction of all this, \nas I have stated on the floor before, is that when I add up the \nbaseline $1 trillion that we know we have to do by way of budget cuts \nto get to this balanced budget by 2002 and then the additional revenue \nthat we lose by virtue of the tax cuts, which we have to make up, plus \nthe increase in the military budget, we are talking about somewhere in \nthe neighborhood of $1.4 trillion.\n  So, Madam President, it is interesting. My framework is not that \ndeficit reduction is the only public policy goal. That is not what I \nbelieve. I have always believed there are two deficits. One of them is \nthe budget deficit; the other is the investment deficit.\n  I will have an amendment on the floor dealing with children and \neducation, again, because I think we make a terrible mistake in the \nways in which we have abandoned children and not invested in children \nin our country. So from the point of view of the Senator from \nMinnesota, who understands, on the one hand, there are certain decisive \nareas of life in our Nation where we need to make the investment and, \non the other hand, understands that we have to continue on this path of \ndeficit reduction, I do not see how in the world some of my colleagues \ncan be talking about yet more tax cuts.\n  This amendment, which asks the Budget Committee to look at this, \nwhich essentially challenges all of us to have, I think, some real \nintellectual rigor on this issue, is an extremely important \ncontribution.\n  Madam President, I have to say one other thing that actually the \nSenator from Wisconsin got me thinking about. The politics of this are \nnifty. It sort of reminds me of 1981 again, where basically what some \nof the leadership in the country said to the people and the Nation was, \nwe are going to ask you Americans to make a huge sacrifice. And if you \nmake that sacrifice, our country will be much better off--high levels \nof productivity, the deficit will go down, more jobs, all the rest. We \nask you, will you let us cut your taxes?\n  And people said, ``Great.''\n  Well, what happened? We cut taxes, dramatically increased the \nPentagon budget and built up a huge deficit and a huge debt. We cannot \nrepeat that mistake again. We have to get real with people. We have to \nmake difficult choices.\n  I have never been identified as a deficit hawk. I get criticized \nsometimes for not being hawkish enough on this issue, because I keep \nsaying we have to invest in children, education, and we have to invest \nin health care as well.\n  But I also understand that we cannot make these investments where we \nneed to make the investments in our people and our communities and \ncontinue to reduce the deficit and eventually get to the point where we \nbalance the budget--though I think 2002 is a political date--without \ngetting real.\n  And that is the importance of this amendment. I would think that this \namendment would command broad-based support among all Senators who have \nsaid that they consider deficit reduction to be one of their top \npriorities. Broad-based tax cuts of this kind take us in precisely the \nopposite direction, and we know it. That is what the Senator from \nWisconsin is trying to speak to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has remaining 4 minutes 9 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I cannot think of any better allies on an issue like this than the \nSenator from Arkansas and the Senator from Minnesota, who I know are in \nthis for the long haul. We are in this for the long haul on the \nbalanced budget amendment, on the budget resolution, on reconciliation, \nyou name it. We are going to continue to raise this issue of the \nirresponsibility of these tax cuts every chance we get with the goal of \ndefeating it.\n  I think the Senator from Minnesota just made a tremendous point when \nhe pointed out what happened in the early 1980's. Naturally, when \npeople were told we are going give you a tax cut, it will cause the \neconomy to broom and everything will be great, they said, ``That sounds \npretty good.'' Human nature. Nothing wrong it. It might have worked.\n  But the amazing thing now is that in 1995, the American people are \nhearing that same line again, and what I am so impressed by and \ndelighted by is that they simply are not being fooled twice. It is not \ngoing to work this time. Telling the American people, as President \nReagan did, that he is going to balance the budget and give everybody a \ngiant tax cut--he did not do it, the Congresses then did not do it, and \nneither will the 104th Congress, because it cannot be done.\n  And so to conclude our argument on this, I would just like to return \nto those people from my State who just laid it on the line and who say \nthey are not going to fall for this again, this idea that 2 plus 2 \nequal 6 when it comes to balancing the Federal budget.\n  A couple from, for example, Eagle River, WI, wrote about the tax cut:\n\n       What I need, and what the country needs, is to have the \n     budget deficit paid off so that 20% of the national budget \n     does not go to raising money lenders into the upper class, \n     and so that in 20 years my children and grandchildren won't \n     have to suffer having their entire taxes go to pay the \n     interest and getting none of the services that government \n     should properly provide.\n\n  Folks from Cornucopia, WI, which is the northernmost point of \nWisconsin, wrote and said:\n\n       The thing is, I can't figure out why this is happening--\n     this race to cut taxes--when the majority of people, \n     according to all I've seen, heard, and read, don't care. We \n     want the deficit cut and we want our money spent more wisely.\n\n  A gentleman from Madison, WI, wrote:\n\n       I would like to pay less taxes. I have a family to feed and \n     a mortgage to pay, but what is even more important to me is \n     the yearly federal deficit and the expanding national debt.\n\n  He says to us here in the Senate:\n\n       Don't try to make me feel good and make some political \n     points by giving me a tax cut that my children will have to \n     pay for. I'm not that stupid. That doesn't impress me. Short-\n     term, feel-good tax cuts may look good to the weak-minded \n     voters, but frankly I'm extremely concerned about the \n     national debt that we will be leaving our children to pay off \n     long after you are out of office. Let's do what is right for \n     the kids, (even though they are not voters yet, you \n     politicians!). Let's make the spending cuts, leave the tax \n     rates where they are, pay off the federal debt, and leave \n     this country in a secure financial position that won't leave \n     our children cursing on our graves!\n\n  And finally, Madam President, from Birnamwood, WI:\n\n       Dear Mr. Feingold:\n       I am writing about the proposed tax cuts and write-offs \n     being proposed lately. I am all for cutting spending and \n     lowering taxes as my many letters to you prove. But throwing \n     a few crusts of bread to the masses to keep them quiet is not \n     the answer. By all means cut government spending. But use \n     that savings to eliminate the deficit and pay down the debt \n     that threatens to overwhelm us.\n\n  Madam President, in conclusion, the American people are very clear on \nthis. Why in the world can we not be clear with them and say that it is \nimpossible to push for a balanced budget amendment in good faith and \nstill believe we can have the giant tax cuts being proposed, in \nparticular, by the Contract With America?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by my good friend, the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Madam President, I serve as a member of the Senate Budget Committee, \nand I take that assignment seriously. The budget process starts in that \ncommittee. The deficit reduction starts there.\n  And, Madam President, the tough choices are made there.\n  [[Page S2626]] And, because in the last 2 years, we made tough \nchoices, the deficit is finally going down.\n  This country racked up more debt during the 1980's than we had during \nthe previous two centuries. We can never allow this type of explosive \ndebt to creep into the budget process again.\n  When I was sworn in 2 years ago, I wanted to offer a change in \nthinking, and help to solve the problem of poor fiscal management.\n  And, we are solving this problem. We are cutting unnecessary and \nwasteful programs. We are streamlining other projects.\n  This year alone, the President has sent us a budget for fiscal year \n1996 that eliminates 130 programs and significantly 270 more.\n  And, because our fiscal house is finally being put in order, the \nbudget deficit has been reduced for 3 years in a row--that is the first \ntime that has happened since Harry Truman was in the White House.\n  Madam President, we finally have seen some commonsense, rational \nsolutions in budgeting. And, we must continue providing leadership with \nlevel-headed moderate decisions, even if they are based on tough \nchoices.\n  That is why I support the Feingold amendment. It is common sense. It \nrecognizes that we do not have a lot of money to go around. And, the \nlast thing we should be doing when the deficit is finally being reduced \nis to engage in a political bidding war to enact broad-based, across-\nthe-board tax breaks.\n  This would only send our deficit soaring again, just like the 1980's. \nJust like the days when we were told ``you can have it all, and not pay \nfor it.'' Just like the time when we racked up the highest amount of \ndebt in the history of the world.\n  Madam President, let me be clear. Our colleagues should understand \nthat a vote for the Feingold amendment is not a vote against tax \nrelief. Certain Americans need tax relief. Certain tax laws are \nantiquated and need to be changed. I believe, for example, we need to \nrevise our estate and gift tax laws.\n  But, we need to go through this with common sense. I have seen many \nof the proposals for tax breaks before us. Who do they really help?\n  My friends and neighbors discuss the Federal budget with me all the \ntime. And Madam President, they tell me time and again that we should \nreduce the deficit before we discuss broad-based tax breaks.\n  Fighting this deficit is too serious for political game-playing. We \nclearly cannot push off on our kids an exploding deficit. Sometimes, \nspending programs are urgent, and, sometimes, tax relief is necessary.\n  But, bidding wars to cut taxes for political popularity are not \nurgent and not necessary. As I said, Madam President, these proposals \nmight be popular, but they are dangerous.\n  And, Madam President, I will start worrying about my own personal \npopularity when I know my kids have a secure economic future.\n  This amendment is good common sense. I thank my friend, Senator \nFeingold, for having the courage to bring it before the Senate. And, I \nurge its swift adoption.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution advanced by my colleague from Wisconsin.\n  The citizens of Montana want deficit spending brought under control. \nThey want the budget balanced and they want the job done within a \nspecified period of time. The balanced budget amendment achieves that \nresult, although, as I have noted on several occasions, not without a \ngreat deal of pain.\n  The resolution before us attempts to establish priorities between \nbalancing the budget and a middle-class tax cut.\n  I serve on the Finance Committee. Provisions to implement a middle-\nclass tax cut will come before that committee in the near future. After \nhearings and after due consideration, I and the other members of the \nFinance Committee will determine whether a middle-class tax cut should \nbe enacted and what form it should take. After the committee takes \naction, each and every Member of this body will have a chance to \nexpress their view on the proposed middle-class tax cuts, if in fact, \nthe committee forwards such cuts to the full Senate for their \nconsideration.\n  The working citizens of Montana would benefit from a middle-class tax \ncut. At the same time, they have expressed to me time and again that \ndeficit reduction is their primary concern. The issue I and my \ncolleagues will face on the Finance Committee is whether we can \naccommodate both a reduction in the deficit and tax cuts for America's \nmiddle class.\n  These priorities are properly decided by the members of the Finance \nCommittee after due consideration, not by a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I think this debate is far more \nappropriate to a debate on the implementing legislation. I hope our \nfellow Senators will vote down this motion to refer. I encourage the \ndistinguished Senator, who is very sincere in trying to handle deficit \nmatters, to do this on the implementing legislation after the balanced \nbudget amendment passes. That is the way to do it, and not at this \nparticular time. If the balanced budget amendment does not pass, then \nhe has plenty of other vehicles to try and make his points known.\n  There are many of us who believe that tax cuts actually increase \nrevenues to the Federal Government. That was proven during the \neighties. Had we not passed all kinds of additional spending programs \nas part of a deal made in order to get the marginal tax rate \nreductions, we would have had an even greater economic expansion. As it \nwas, every time President Reagan wanted marginal tax cuts reduced, \nCongress added a bunch of spending programs on the side as part of the \nbills. As a result, we still had more revenues, but we had even greater \nspending increases than revenue increases. Of course, part of those \nincreases were defense and national security spending.\n  I am not here to assess blame on anybody. All I am saying is that \nmany of us believe that tax rate reductions done in the appropriate and \nproper way actually create more opportunities for working people, more \nsavings, more investment, more jobs, and more people working, and \ntherefore, more people paying into the system.\n  So, having said that, I hope that our fellow Senators will realize \nthat this is not the time to pass on a status quo tax policy method of \nimplementing the balanced budget amendment as embodied in this motion, \nbut this is a time to stand up for the balanced budget amendment. Let \nus stay on the beam, let us stay on the ball. Let us stay focused on \nwhat has to be done.\n  Has the distinguished Senator yielded back the remainder of his time? \nI yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Madam President, I move to table and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to the \nmotion to lay on the table the motion to refer House Joint Resolution 1 \nto the Budget Committee with instructions. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order of the Senate, we \nwill now resume consideration of amendment No. 241, offered by the \nSenator from South Carolina, Mr. Hollings.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, let me emphasize that this is not \nintended to delay the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. \nIn fact, we have agreed to an hour and a half time limit. My amendment \nis drafted so that, if adopted, it will be engrossed separately by the \nStates, and therefore voted on separately by the States, so it will not \nkill the balanced budget amendment. In other words we are not trying to \ndelay or are confuse.\n  Madam President, let me go to the history of this, because I was \nthere. In the 1968 race for President, the distinguished former \nSecretary of Commerce, Maurice Stans, he came to my State and he said: \nNow, you textile leaders, you all have to contribute $35,000 apiece for \nthe Presidential race. He raised $350,000.\n  I had been in Government 20 years. I had been elected Lieutenant \nGovernor, I had been elected Governor, and they were my friends, and \nthey never got up $350,000 for this Senator.\n  I remember this course of events well. In the Presidential campaign \nof 1968, the Nixon folks went all of the county to the rich and asked \nthat they contribute to the campaign. One fellow from Chicago gave $2 \nmillion. There were several others who gave $400,000 and $500,000. \nFollowing the election, John Connally went to President Nixon and said, \n``Mr. President, there have been some real valued contributors, \nsubstantial contributors, and they have not even met you or been \nthanked by you.'' They agreed that the President would come down the \nnext week to the ranch in Texas for a barbecue. As that week arrived \nand they were turning into the barbecue at the Texas ranch, Dick Tuck, \nthe prankster from the Kennedy days, put a Brink's truck by the gate. \nThen they got a picture of it. We were all embarrassed: The public \nthought the Government was up for sale.\n  Madam President, it has gotten worse. Back in 1974, in a bipartisan \nfashion--I remember the debate well--we amended the Federal Election \nCampaign Practices Act. With these amendments we said the Government is \nnot up for sale. You cannot receive cash. Every dollar must be on top \nof the table, accounted for here at the Secretary of the Senate and the \nSecretary of State back in your home State. You can only get $1,000 \nindividually, $5,000 by way of a PAC and you will be limited to so much \nper voter. Most importantly, the total expenditures of the campaign \nwould be limited. In the State of South Carolina it would be about \n$500,000, half a million dollars. But in the State of California or \nTexas it would be, of course, millions.\n  I say it has gotten worse. But let me emphasize, we had a strong vote \non the Federal Election Campaign Practices Act in 1974 and our good \nfriend, the distinguished Senator from New York at that time, Senator \nJim Buckley--and I speak affectionately because his father contributed \nto my races, William F. Buckley, Sr. --but Jim said: Oh, no, I am going \nto sue the Senate. You can't limit what I spend on my races. You have \ntaken away my speech.\n  And in a very distorted decision, a contorted decision, the Supreme \nCourt agreed. By the Courts decision in Buckley versus Valeo, rather \nthan freedom of speech under the first amendment, for individuals and \npeople, the Supreme Court gave freedom of speech to the rich. Freedom \nto those with money, rather than to the people. The Court essentially \ntook the speech away from the poor.\n  For example, if I have $1 million and you have $50,000, I wait until \nthe first week of October and then I just offload--spending all my \nmoney on television, signs, radio, farmer shows, talk shows and \neverything I can possibly think of. And whoever I am running against, \ntheir friends and family say, ``I wonder why he does not answer.''\n  You do not answer because you do not have the money. It takes \nliterally millions of dollars now.\n  It seems like somehow somewhere there would be some shame in this \nbody. I have tried over the last 20 years. You can not offer a joint \nresolution as an amendment to a bill. It seems that in every Congress \nthere were always campaign reform bills, but I could not offer my joint \nresolutions to them. Offering joint resolutions to bills is barred by \nthe rules.\n  These campaign reform bills usually included some form of public \nfinancing. That always lead to gridlock. It appears we are not going \nthe way of public financing. I hope not, with a $4.85 trillion deficit. \nWe are not going to find a new mission for the taxpayer--that of \nfinancing politicians. So we are not going to do that. We have to \ncontrol campaign expenditures. We have to somehow control it. For \nheaven's sake, we have tried, and it has been bipartisan.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague from the other side, the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, and the \nothers who cosponsored and willingly voted to help in this particular \ncause.\n  My amendment does not say what the limits would be. I would \ncontemplate going back to what we intended, namely, limiting spending \nto so much per voter in each State; the small States the smaller amount \nof money and the large States the larger amount of money. But now today \nyou have to raise $13,200 each and every week of a six year term for \nthe average Senator to get reelected--$13,200 a week. He is in \nbusiness, not to legislate, not to debate, not to listen, not to \ndiscuss, not to hear, but by gosh to track down everybody he can and \npick their pockets--$13,200 a week.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from California, who was just \nreelected, say with her contributions and with the party contributions, \nit took her $19 million to run. Senator Feinstein would admit that. Her \nopponent, Mr. Huffington, spent almost $30 million.\n  This is a disgrace. Do not come in here with this ``ying yow\" about, \nyes, it is a good idea, but not on the balanced budget amendment. It is \njust our opportunity. We have had time and time again votes on my \namendment. We had a vote on this particular matter back in 1988. We got \n52 votes. We brought it up again later in that same year and we got a \nvote of 53 votes, and, on May 27 of 1993 we got 52 votes for a Sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution expressing that the Senate should adopt this \namendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes. I yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 30 minutes designated \nto me be designated to the distinguished Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let us be done with the phony charge \nthat spending limits are somehow an attack on freedom of speech. This \nis false. If anything the Courts decision is an attach on free speech. \nAs Justice Marshall points out in his dissent the Court's decision \nactually limits the speech of those with less money. Justice Marshall \nstates, and I quote:\n\n       It would appear to follow that the candidate with the \n     substantial personal fortune at his disposal is off to a \n     significant head start.\n\n  Indeed, Mr. President, Justice Marshall went further when he argued \nthat by upholding the limits on contributions but striking down the \nlimits on \n [[Page S2628]] overall spending, the Court put an additional premium \non a candidate's personal wealth.\n  The effect of this decision was discussed before a hearing that we \nheld in the Judiciary Committee. We have had several hearings. At one \nof those hearings, back in 1988, the Committee on the Constitutional \nSystem's Lloyd Cutler appeared, and he said and I quote:\n\n       Along with Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and Mr. \n     Douglas Dillon, I am a co-chairman of the Committee on the \n     Constitutional System, a group of 700 present and former \n     legislators, Executive branch officials, political party \n     officials, professors and civic leaders who are interested in \n     analyzing and correcting some of the weaknesses that have \n     developed in our political system.\n\n  Quoting further:\n\n       The courts approved the Presidential Campaign Financing \n     Fund created by the '76 amendments, including the condition \n     it imposed barring any Presidential nominee who accepted the \n     public funds from spending more than a specified limit. \n     However, it remains unconstitutional for Congress to place \n     any limits on expenditures by independent committees or on \n     behalf of a candidate. In recent Presidential elections, \n     these independent expenditures on behalf of one candidate \n     exceeds the amounts of Federal funding he accepted. Moreover, \n     so long as Congress remains deadlocked on proposed \n     legislation for the public financing of congressional \n     campaigns, it is not possible to use the public financing \n     device as a means of limiting congressional campaign \n     expenditures.\n       Accordingly, the Committee on the Constitutional System has \n     come to the conclusion that the only effective way to limit \n     the explosive growth of campaign financing is to adopt a \n     constitutional amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, In reality my amendment really restores the freedom of \nspeech. If you have money, you have unlimited speech. If you do not \nhave money, you have the freedom to shut up, say nothing.\n  I can tell you, the last five amendments to the Constitution itself \ndealt with elections and all were ratified by three-fourths of the \nStates in an average of 17 months. If we adopt this today the states \ncan ratify it and we can enforce limits on campaign expenditures for \nthe 1996 elections.\n  My amendment, if effect, gets us back to an even playing field where \neveryone has the same freedom, rich or poor, Republican or Democrat, \nconservative or liberal or otherwise.\n  With respect to incumbency, I think we have learned from the last \nelection that--at least we Democrats have learned--it does not pay to \nbe an incumbent. I can tell you that right now. There were 10 Senators \nthat were here last year that are not here today.\n  Right to the point, Mr. President, for 20 years Congress has been \nlike a dog chasing its tail. We have tried to correct Buckley versus \nValeo. We have had, time and time again, debates on all forms of \ncampaign reform. Again and again and again, it does not go anywhere. \nWhen it looks as if it is going somewhere, it is threatened with the \nveto. Here, with this particular approach, there is no veto. The \namendment would go directly to the States.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the effort by the \nSenator from South Carolina. I think that, at a minimum, we have to \nlimit the amount individuals can contribute to their own campaigns. The \nSenator's analysis is very clear that in order to do that, given \nBuckley versus Valeo, we must have a constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. President, my own personal view is that the problem that lies at \nthe heart of the political process is the money in the political \nprocess. There is no doubt that this is true. And I believe that while \nthe Senator's amendment is necessary, and a constitutional amendment is \nnecessary to achieve the end of preventing those with enormous \nresources from buying elections, I do not think it is sufficient. I \nsupport it because I think it is an important step that plugs up one \ngigantic loophole in this process that allows those with means to buy \nthe microphone. When you have a system where only the rich can buy paid \nmedia in sizable amounts, you directly impede political equality. That \nis what has happened, and this is the only way under our current \ncircumstances to change that.\n  Mr. President, if we do this amendment and leave all the rest there, \nwe still have a major problem: too much money in politics. So I offer, \nin support of the amendment and in addition to the amendment--and a \nvery simple idea that our only way to get money out of politics is to \nget money out of politics--two very simple proposals. One, that anybody \nin America, on their Federal income tax form, above their tax \nliability, can designate an additional $200 to go to a political fund. \nIn July, or at sometime after the primary election for Federal office \nin a particular State, that fund is divided between Republican, \nDemocrat, and/or qualified independent, and the only money that is \npermissible is the money from that fund. And the money in that fund can \nonly be contributed from citizens in your State.\n  If citizens in a particular State chose to give very little, they \nwould be less informed, no doubt in my mind. They would be less \ninformed, but they would be in charge. And the system would adjust. \nAnd, who knows, maybe we would end up with a system in which attack ads \nwould go and public discourse would grow. Unless we are prepared to \ncross the path to the side that says the only money available is money \ncontributed by citizens in your State--no PAC's, no party conduits, no \nbig contributors, and no wealthy individuals able to buy the means and \nthe microphone in an election --unless we are prepared to do all of \nthat, we are just kidding ourselves. We are going to be arguing around \nthe edges about this political reform or that political reform. But \nunless we take, I think, this radical step, we will not end money in \npolitics. It is as simple as that.\n  So the Senator's effort is not only laudable but central to getting \ncontrol of the democratic process.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania is on the floor and \nis going to speak, and he has the opportunity, given what his \nactivities are these days on the national scene, to champion \nfundamental campaign finance reform. I hope that we will cross that \nline and say: No individual contributions, no big contributions, no \nPAC's, no party conduits, and no millionaires buying elections. You can \nput up to $200 above your tax liability into a fund several months \nprior to the general election, which is divided among Republicans and \nDemocrats and qualified independents, and that is the only money; it is \nonly the money from tax returns in your State. If we do not do \nsomething that radical, we will not have fundamental campaign finance \nreform.\n  I salute the Senator for his amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield whatever time necessary to my \ndistinguished cosponsor, the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina. This is an issue which we \nhave raised repeatedly on the floor of the U.S. Senate, because it is a \ndirect way to deal with campaign finance reform without having a \nfurther burden on the Treasury of the United States.\n  We have debated campaign finance reform repeatedly in a variety of \ncontexts. Most of them come down to a proposition to have Federal \nsubsidies for candidates and then to call upon the candidates to \nrelinquish their rights under Buckley versus Valeo in order to qualify \nfor Federal funding. I have opposed such Federal funding because I \nthink it is unwise to further burden the Treasury by having campaigns \npaid for by the U.S. Treasury.\n  The necessity for this amendment was created by the decision of the \nSupreme Court of the United States in 1976 in Buckley versus Valeo. \nThat particular decision had a very significant impact on this Senator, \nbecause at that time I was running for the U.S. Senate. Under the 1974 \nstatute, there was a limited amount a candidate for the Senate could \nspend of his or her own money, based on population.\n  When I entered the race in late 1975, for a seat which was then being \nvacated by a very distinguished U.S. Senator, Senator Hugh Scott, the \nFederal law said that, on a population basis, a candidate in a primary \nin Pennsylvania would be limited to $35,000. That was about the limit \nof the means which I had at that time, having been extensively in \npublic service as district attorney of Philadelphia and for a \nrelatively short period of time in the private practice of law. Halfway \nthrough that campaign, on January 29, 1976, the \n [[Page S2629]] Supreme Court of the United States said that the \nlimitation on what an individual could spend of his or her own money \nwas unconstitutional.\n  At that time, I was running against a very distinguished \nPennsylvanian, the late Senator John Heinz, with whom I served in this \nbody for many, many years. Senator Heinz had substantially more \nfinancial capabilities and, as was appropriate under the law, utilized \nthe invalidation of the spending limit at that time.\n  It has always seemed to me that Congress ought to have the authority \nto establish a spending limit in Federal elections without regard to \nthe first amendment limitation which was applied by the Supreme Court \nin Buckley versus Valeo.\n  In approaching this matter, Mr. President, I am very concerned about \namending the first amendment to the United States Constitution--freedom \nof speech, religion, press, assembly. But the amendment that we are \ntalking about really does not go to any of these core first amendment \nvalues. This is not a matter affecting religion. It is not a matter \nreally affecting speech.\n  I think it was a very far stretch when the split Court of the U.S. \nSupreme Court said that a campaign expenditure for an individual was a \nmatter of freedom of speech. At that time, the Supreme Court did not \naffect the limitation on spending where an individual could contribute \nonly $1,000 in the primary and $1,000 in the general, except for \ncontributions by PAC's, political action committees.\n  At that time, in 1976, my brother had considerably more financial \nmeans than I did and would have been very much interested in helping \nhis younger brother, but the limitation on my brother in that primary \nwas for $1,000. It seemed to me then and it seems to me now that if a \ncandidate has the right to spend as much of his or her money as he or \nshe chooses, then why should not any other citizen have the same right \nunder the first amendment to express himself or herself by the \npolitical contributions.\n  So the decision by the Supreme Court in Buckley versus Valeo, I \nsubmit, was a unusual one and I think not well founded. And within our \nframework of Government we can change that by having this amendment at \nthis time.\n  I discussed this matter earlier today with my distinguished colleague \nfrom South Carolina. We talked about the procedural aspect of offering \nlegislation to come up through the Judiciary Committee and at this \ntime, on this resolution, it is an appropriate field to deal with this \nmatter. And as we are dealing with the constitutional amendment for a \nbalanced budget, we can deal with the constitutional issue raised in \nBuckley versus Valeo.\n  This year, Mr. President, I am undertaking another venture at the \npresent time, exploratory travel looking toward the Republican \nnomination for President of the United States. And I am impressed again \nwith how important fundraising is and how disproportionate it is to the \nundertaking for a political candidacy.\n  My idea about running for elective office, Mr. President, is a matter \nof issues, a matter of tenacity, a matter of integrity, and how you \nconduct a campaign. But money has become the dominant issue in the \nPresidential campaign. And the media focus on it to the virtual \nexclusion of the many issues of substantive matters which are really \ninvolved in a campaign for the candidacy for the Presidency.\n  So I think that the amendment which is now pending will leave it up \nto the Congress of the United States to decide what campaign finance \nlimitations should be, authority which we have under the Constitution. \nUnder a constitutional provision, the Congress does have the authority \nto deal with this issue. Article 1, section 4, of the Constitution \nspecifically vests the authority in Congress to regulate national \nelections.\n  Absent the decision in Buckley versus Valeo, we would have that \nauthority. Similarly, State legislatures would also have the authority \nto regulate their own campaigns if Buckley versus Valeo were not the \nlaw of the land.\n  In essence, Mr. President, I think that Buckley was wrongly decided. \nI think that it has limited the Congress in regulating the expenditure \nof funds. Money is too important in elections for the House of \nRepresentatives, for the U.S. Senate, as well as for the Presidency of \nthe United States.\n  So I hope we will have an affirmative vote. The last time this matter \ncame up in a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, it was passed. And if we \ncould pass it here today, I think it would be a very, very important \nstep forward for reform to eliminate money as a dominant factor in so \nmany elections.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nPennsylvania, because he has given a real life example of the \nfrustration that we have.\n  Let me yield so the other side can respond.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this need not be a lengthy debate. I \nwould be more than happy to yield back whatever time I may have left if \nthe Senator from South Carolina would like to do the same. We have been \nover this turf before.\n  I want to commend the Senator from South Carolina for understanding \nand realizing that all of the campaign finance reform bills we have \ndealt with in recent years have been unconstitutional. So at least the \nSenator from South Carolina understands that the proposals that have \nbeen kicking around here for the last 5 or 6 years clearly trash the \nfirst amendment.\n  But I would say where I differ with the Senator from South Carolina \nis not in his judgment about the fact that the campaign finance reform \nbills that we have dealt with were unconstitutional --and they clearly \nwere--but the Senator now says we ought to amend the first amendment. \nWe ought to change the first amendment to the Constitution for the \nfirst time in 200 years.\n  And by suggesting that, Mr. President, my good friend from South \nCarolina has managed to come up with a proposal that even Common Cause \nis against and the Washington Post is against. So we have two entities \nthat have been in the forefront of calling for campaign finance reform. \nCommon Cause, a leading outside interest group, special interest group, \nadvocating a campaign finance reform, says amending the first amendment \nis a bad idea, so they oppose the Hollings proposal. And the Washington \nPost, which has clearly been interested in seeing a campaign finance \nreform bill, also opposes amending the first amendment.\n  So Mr. President, I would submit a letter of a few years back by \nCommon Cause opposing the Hollings constitutional amendment and ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 Common Cause,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 1988.\n       Dear Senator: The Senate is expected to consider shortly \n     S.J. Res. 21, a proposed amendment to the Constitution to \n     give Congress the power to enact mandatory limits on \n     expenditures in campaigns. Common Cause urges you not to \n     support S.J. Res. 21.\n       The fundamental problems caused by the massive growth in \n     spending for congressional elections and by special interest \n     PAC giving demand effective and expeditious solution. The \n     Senate recently came within a handful of votes of achieving \n     this goal. For the first time since the Watergate period, a \n     majority of Senators went on record in support of \n     comprehensive campaign finance reform legislation, including \n     a system of spending limits for Senate races. It took an \n     obstructionist filibuster by a minority of Senators to block \n     the bill from going forward.\n       The Senate now stands within striking distance of enacting \n     comprehensive legislation to deal with the urgent problems \n     that confront the congressional campaign finance system. The \n     Senate should not walk away from or delay this effort. But \n     that is what will happen if the Senate chooses to pursue a \n     constitutional amendment, an inherently lengthy and time-\n     consuming process.\n       S.J. Res. 21, the proposed constitutional amendment, would \n     not establish expenditure limits in campaigns; it would only \n     empower the Congress to do so. Thus even if two-thirds of the \n     Senate and the House should pass S.J. Res. 21 and three-\n     quarters of the states were to ratify the amendment, it would \n     then still be necessary for the Senate and the House to pass \n     legislation to establish spending limits in congressional \n     campaigns.\n       Yet it is this very issue of whether there should be \n     spending limits in congressional \n      [[Page S2630]] campaigns that has been at the heart of the \n     recent legislative battle in the Senate. Opponents of S. 2, \n     the Senatorial Election Campaign Act, made very clear that \n     their principal objection was the establishment of any \n     spending limits in campaigns.\n       So even assuming a constitutional amendment were to be \n     ratified, after years of delay the Senate would find itself \n     right back where it is today--in a battle over whether there \n     should be spending limits in congressional campaigns. In the \n     interim, it is almost certain that nothing would have been \n     done to deal with the scandalous congressional campaign \n     finance system.\n       There are other serious questions that need to be \n     considered and addressed by anyone who is presently \n     considering supporting S.J. Res. 21.\n       For example, what are the implications if S.J. Res. 21 \n     takes away from the federal courts any ability to determine \n     that particular expenditure limits enacted by Congress \n     discriminate against or otherwise violate the constitutional \n     rights of challengers?\n       What are the implications, if any, of narrowing by \n     constitutional amendment the First Amendment rights of \n     individuals as interpreted by the Supreme Court?\n       We believe that campaign finance reform legislation must \n     continue to be a top priority for the Senate as it has been \n     in the 100th Congress. If legislation is not passed this \n     year, it should be scheduled for early action in the Senate \n     and the House in 1989.\n       In conclusion, Common Cause strongly urges the Senate to \n     face up to its institutional responsibilities to reform the \n     disgraceful congressional campaign finance system. The Senate \n     should enact comprehensive legislation to establish a system \n     of campaign spending limits and aggregate PAC limits, instead \n     of pursuing a constitutional amendment that will delay \n     solving this fundamental problem for years and then still \n     leave Congress faced with the need to pass legislation to \n     limit campaign spending.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Fred Wertheimer,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And also, an editorial in the Washington Post also \nopposing the Hollings constitutional amendment. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the editorial be printed in the Record, as well.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 6, 1988]\n\n                            Campaign Spinach\n\n       Sen. Ernest Hollings was not an admirer of S. 2, the sturdy \n     bill his fellow Democrats tried to pass to limit \n     congressional campaign spending by setting up a system of \n     partial public finance. He agreed to vote for cloture, to \n     break a Republican filibuster, only after Majority Leader \n     Robert Byrd agreed to bring up a Hollings constitutional \n     amendment if cloture failed. Mr. Byrd, having lost on S. 2, \n     is now about to do that.\n       Right now Congress can't just limit spending and be done \n     with it; the Supreme Court says such legislation would \n     violate the First Amendment. Limits can only be imposed \n     indirectly--for example, as a condition for receipt of public \n     campaign funds. The Hollings amendment would cut through this \n     thick spinach by authorizing Congress to impose limits \n     straightaway. The limits are enticing, but the constitutional \n     amendment is a bad idea. It would be an exception to the free \n     speech clause, and once that clause is breached for one \n     purpose, who is to say how many others may follow? As the \n     American Civil Liberties Union observed in opposing the \n     measure, about the last thing the country needs is ``a second \n     First Amendment.''\n       The free speech issue arises in almost any effort to \n     regulate campaigns, the fundamental area of free expression \n     on which all others depend. There has long been the feeling \n     in and out of Congress--which we emphatically share--that \n     congressional campaign spending is out of hand. Congress \n     tried in one of the Watergate reforms to limit both the \n     giving and the spending of campaign funds. The Supreme Court \n     in its Buckley v. Valeo decision in 1976 drew a rather \n     strained distinction between these two sides of the campaign \n     ledger. In a decision that let it keep a foot in both camps--\n     civil liberties and reform--it said Congress could limit \n     giving but not spending (except in the context of a system of \n     public finance). In the first case the court found that ``the \n     governmental interest in preventing corruption and the \n     appearance of corruption'' outweighed the free speech \n     considerations, while in the second case it did not.\n       Mr. Hollings would simplify the matter, but at considerable \n     cost. His amendment said, in a recent formulation: ``The \n     Congress may enact laws regulating the amounts of \n     contributions and expenditures intended to affect elections \n     to federal offices.'' But that's much too vague, and so are \n     rival amendments that have been proposed. Ask yourself what \n     expenditures of a certain kind in an election year are not \n     ``intended to affect'' the outcome? At a certain point in the \n     process, just about any public utterance is.\n       Nor would the Hollings amendment be a political solution to \n     the problem. Congress would still have to vote the limits, \n     and that is what the Senate balked at this time around.\n       As Buckley v. Valeo demonstrates, this is a messy area of \n     law. The competing values are important; they require a \n     balancing act. The Hollings amendment, in trying instead to \n     brush the problem aside, is less a solution than a dangerous \n     show. The Senate should vote it down.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So, Mr. President, what the Senator from South \nCarolina is proposing here is that not only the Federal Government but \nState governments, reading from the amendment, ``have the power to set \nreasonable limits on expenditures made in support of or in opposition \nto the nomination or election of any person to Federal office.''\n  Now, Mr. President, it should not be a surprise to anyone that the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union also thinks this is a terrible idea. Not \nonly do they think it is a terrible idea with regard to the power that \nwould be granted to limit speech of candidates, the provision I just \nmade reference to, which said ``in support of or in opposition to the \nnomination or election of any person to Federal office,'' but would \nalso give to the Congress the power to do the following.\n  And, Mr. President, I read from an opinion of the American Civil \nLiberties Union, which says:\n  ``Finally, as an amendment subsequent to the First Amendment, the \nexisting understandings about the protection of freedom of the press \nwould also be changed''--freedom of the press would also be changed--\n``thereby empowering Congress to regulate what newspapers and \nbroadcasters can do on behalf of the candidates they endorse or oppose. \nA candidate-centered editorial, as well as op-ed articles or \ncommentary, are certainly expenditures in support of or in opposition \nto political candidates. The amendment, as its words make apparent,'' \nsays the American Civil Liberties Union, ``would authorize Congress to \nset reasonable limits on the involvement of the media in campaigns when \nnot strictly reporting the news. Such a result would be intolerable in \na society that relishes a free press.''\n  So the proposal we have before us, Mr. President, first, amends the \nfirst amendment for the first time in history. And many people feel \nthat is not a good idea; that the first amendment has served us well.\n  The second manages to draw the opposition of even the principal \nadvocates of campaign finance reform, Common Cause and the Washington \nPost, and, also, Mr. President, even though this issue in the past was \nquite partisan--most Republicans opposing it, most Democrats supporting \nit--the following Senators on the other side of the aisle voted against \nthis proposal when it was last offered in May 1993.\n  I want to commend those Senators publicly for respecting the first \namendment, for agreeing--although they like the idea of a campaign \nfinance reform bill--with Members that amending the Constitution of the \nUnited States, amending the first amendment for the first time in \nhistory, was a terrible idea. Senator Boxer agreed with that \nproposition, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator Kohl, Senator Leahy, \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Moynihan, Senator Pell, and Senator \nRockefeller, all, even though I know they basically supported the \nvarious campaign finance reform bills proposed by those on the other \nside of the aisle, agreed with this Senator and the ACLU and Common \nCause and the Washington Post that amending the first amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution for the first time in history was a terrible idea.\n  So, Mr. President, at the appropriate time I will be making a motion \nto table, and I hope that Senators will certainly agree that no matter \nhow they may feel about passing some kind of campaign finance reform \nbill or another--and we certainly have had our differences on that \nissue--no matter how they may feel about that, it is not a good idea to \namend the Constitution, to amend the first amendment to the \nConstitution for the first time in history.\n  Now, with regard to the Buckley case on the question of whether \nspending is speech, the Supreme Court was clear. My recollection was \nthat eight out of nine members of the Supreme Court said spending is \nspeech. So there is not any question that this is an amendment about \nspeech. No matter whether some Senators wish spending were not speech \nor not, the Supreme Court has said that spending is speech. So no \nmatter how much some Senators may \n [[Page S2631]] wish that the Court had not said that, no matter how \nmuch some Senators wish the Buckley case was decided otherwise, the \nfact of the matter is the Supreme Court has said spending is speech.\n  So this amendment, Mr. President, is about amending the first \namendment to the Constitution for the first time in history. So I hope \nthat this will be defeated on a bipartisan basis, because it is really \nquite a terrible idea.\n  Mr. President, I will retain the remainder of my time should I need \nit, and I yield the floor at this point.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I enjoyed references to Senators and \ntheir votes. It is not necessarily Dale Carnegie's approach to winning \nfriends and influencing people. I am in the business of trying to \nobtain votes. So I necessarily try my best to resist the record.\n  The distinguished Senator from Kentucky made a record and he talks \nabout the first time we amended the first amendment. Well, this is the \nfirst time an amendment would do it.\n  Now, the fact of the matter is, on October 19, 1989, 5 years ago or a \nlittle more, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky voted with the \nmajority--it did not get two-thirds--but the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky voted to amend the first amendment with respect to burning the \nflag of the United States of America.\n  I would be delighted to yield. I am looking at this record. If the \nrecord is incorrect, I would be delighted to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend from South Carolina \nfor yielding.\n  We have had this same colloquy before. The Senator from South \nCarolina raised this the last time we had this discussion, and the \nSenator from South Carolina, I am sure, recalls my reply. My reply was, \n``If I had to do it over again, I would have voted differently.'' In \nfact, upon reflection, my view is that I am sure the Senator from South \nCarolina, in his history here, has never cast a vote that he regretted, \nbut I have not been so fortunate as to never having regretted a vote I \ncast here. The Senator from South Carolina and I had this exchange the \nlast time we had this debate, and he, I am sure, recalls that I said \nthat I thought I had made a mistake in voting that way on the flag-\nburning amendment, and should such an amendment come before Members \nagain, I would not so vote again.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the question is not whether it is a \nmistake. The question is whether it is a fact that a majority of the \nU.S. Senate, 51 Senators, duly elected and voting, voted at that \nparticular time to amend the first amendment with respect to burning \nthe flag of the United States of America.\n  There have been other votes to amend the first amendment. Of course, \nwe have had a majority vote on this amendment at least three times. The \ntruth of the matter is, and the reality is, and the fact is, that the \nSupreme Court in Buckley versus Valeo amended the first amendment.\n  I mean, after all, it was a 5-4 decision. If we get down to it we \nknow that, yes, it limits spending, it limits speech. Speech is equated \nwith spending. For those who have money, they can talk all they want. \nFor those who do not, they do not have the freedom of speech. Those who \ndo not have the money are limited.\n  Of course, the Buckley versus Valeo decision found nothing wrong with \nlimiting speech because they said the $1,000 was constitutional for an \nindividual contribution; the $5,000 for political action committees was \nalso constitutional. So everybody wants to act like we are making some \nkind of history and changing it around.\n  When we had the other constitutional amendments affecting elections, \nthey refer, of course, to the matter of elections on term limits. That \nis the 22d amendment. The 23d amendment, the electoral votes in \nPresidential elections. The 24th amendment, elimination of the poll tax \nwith respect to voting. And the 26th amendment gave 18-year-olds the \nright to speak. Someone could give the same argument that 18-year-olds \ndid not have the right to speak under the Constitution in elections. \nBut then they were given the freedom of speech at 18 years of age.\n  We are dealing with elections and campaign financing. It is totally a \nshame and disgrace. Absolute shame and disgrace. I will never forget \nthe feel, politically, that you get in campaigns.\n  I think it is very healthy, Mr. President, to go back on to the main \nstreet and walk up and down both sides and see the same merchants that \nyou saw. You asked for their vote. You made certain promises, I guess, \ncertain representations. You told them about your beliefs and what you \nstand for. You go out into the rural areas to the farmers. You visited \naround in the hospitals, the doctors, and everything else of that kind.\n  That is the way we politic in the small State of South Carolina. Of \ncourse, it is totally impossible in large New York or large California. \nI am not contending that it is. But right after the last election in \n1992, just a couple of years ago, I went around to each one of the \ncounties and we had town meetings, and I made the call.\n  My friends kept asking, they say, ``Why are you coming around? You \njust got elected. You got 6 years.'' And I said, ``I couldn't see you \nin the campaign. I didn't have time. I had to go raise money.'' On and \non and on. It is just like a veritable treadmill you get these campaign \nmanagers, consultants, and otherwise, they will break that time down \nfor you. They will break down when you are going to talk and have your \nearly morning for the farmers and when you will have time when the \nstudents come back to the university campuses and most importantly when \nyou will raise money.\n  This is all sophisticated. It is all tried. It is understandable and \nit is part of the game. It is very, very, very expensive. To get around \nand really expose yourself, you do not have time to talk to people \nunless you are asking for their money and being nice and making the \nobligatory appearances at debates and certain programs and you try to \ngenerate free television.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Jersey came forward with a nice \nidea, if it could work. I question it. The premise of the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey is that the people of New Jersey and the people \nof South Carolina are just as interested in the elections as the \nSenator from New Jersey and the Senator from South Carolina. I doubt \nit.\n  We just had an election in my State about 10 days ago, a special \nelection. Out of some 180,000 voters, only 6,000 cast votes. It was on \nradio; it was on TV. Signs were plastered all over, and everything else \nlike that. But we have less participation--and it is getting worse in \nthis particular country--less than 50 percent. You get, in Australia \nand other countries, almost 100 percent voting.\n  So the recommendation of the distinguished Senator from New Jersey to \ncheck-off for elections themselves to finance politics, I tell you now, \nthat is a tough one, that is a very, very tough one. I can see that \nwould have very limited chance to really be heard.\n  Eighty percent of your money is expended on television. We have had \ndifferent proposals of free TV. After all, the people of America own \nthe airwaves. With the people of America owning these airwaves, it \nseems as if we can allocate some to public office and the attaining of \npublic office. Each side would have so much free television. We have \ntried that approach. We have tried financing; we have tried voluntarily \nputting up so much money. We have tried any number of other solutions. \nThey have all failed.\n  Like I say, it has been a dog chasing its tail because we know that \nnone of these particular bills will pass because every one of them runs \ninto that unconstitutional decision, Buckley v. Valeo. There is not any \nquestion that that is a distortion.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a very good article by former \nCongressman Jonathan Bingham, of New York inserted into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From Annals of the American Academy, July 1986]\n\n  Democracy of Plutocracy? The Case for a Constitutional Amendment To \n                       Overturn Buckley v. Valeo\n\n                         (By Jonathan Bingham)\n\n       Abstract: In the early 1970s the U.S. Congress made a \n     serious effort to stop the abuses \n      [[Page S2632]] of campaign financing by setting limits on \n     contributions and also on campaign spending. In the 1976 case \n     of Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court upheld the regulation \n     of contributions, but invalidated the regulation of campaign \n     spending as a violation of the First Amendment. Since then, \n     lavish campaigns, with their attendant evils, have become an \n     ever more serious problem. Multimillion-dollar campaigns for \n     the Senate, and even for the House of Representatives, have \n     become commonplace. Various statutory solutions to the \n     problem have been proposed, but these will not be adequate \n     unless the Congress--and the states--are permitted to stop \n     the escalation by setting limits. What is needed is a \n     constitutional amendment to reverse the Buckley holding, as \n     proposed by several members of Congress. This would not mean \n     a weakening of the Bill of Rights, since the Buckley ruling \n     was a distortion of the First Amendment. Within reasonable \n     financial limits there is ample opportunity for that \n     ``uninhibited, robust and wide-open'' debate of the issues \n     that the Supreme Court correctly wants to protect.\n       ``The First Amendment is not a vehicle for turning this \n     country into a plutocracy,'' says Joseph L. Rauh, the \n     distinguished civil rights lawyer, deploying the ruling in \n     Buckley v. Valeo.\\1\\ It is the thesis of this article that \n     the Supreme Court in Buckley was wrong in nullifying certain \n     congressional efforts to limit campaign spending and that the \n     decision must not be allowed to stand. While statutory \n     remedies may mitigate the evil of excessive money in politics \n     and are worth pursuing, they will not stop the feverish \n     escalation of campaign spending. They will also have no \n     effect whatever on the spreading phenomenon of very wealthy \n     people's spending millions of dollars of their own money to \n     get elected to Congress and to state office.\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       When the Supreme Court held a national income tax \n     unconstitutional, the Sixteenth Amendment reversed that \n     decision. Buckely should be treated the same way.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 was the first \n     comprehensive effort by the U.S. Congress to regulate the \n     financing of federal election campaigns. In 1974, following \n     the scandals of the Watergate era, the Congress greatly \n     strengthened the 1971 act. As amended, the new law combined \n     far-reaching requirements for disclosure with restrictions on \n     the amount of contributions, expenditures from a candidate's \n     personal funds, total campaign expenditures, and independent \n     expenditures on behalf of identified candidates.\n       The report of the House Administration Committee \n     recommending the 1974 legislation to the House explained the \n     underlying philosophy:\n       ``The unchecked rise in campaign expenditures, coupled with \n     the absence of limitations on contributions and expenditures, \n     has increased the dependence of candidates on special \n     interest groups and large contributors. Under the present law \n     the impression persists that a candidate can buy an election \n     by simply spending large sums in a campaign. . . .\n       ``Such a system is not only unfair to candidates in \n     general, but even more so to the electorate. The electorate \n     is entitled to base its judgment on a straightforward \n     presentation of a candidate's qualifications for public \n     office and his programs for the Nation rather than on a \n     sophisticated advertising program which is encouraged by the \n     infusion of vast amounts of money.\n       ``The Committee on House Administration is of the opinion \n     that there is a definite need for effective and comprehensive \n     legislation in this area to restore and strengthen public \n     confidence in the integrity of the political process.''\\2\\\n       The 1974 act included a provision, added pursuant to an \n     amendment offered by then Senator James Buckley, for \n     expedited review of the law's constitutionality. In January \n     1976 the Supreme Court invalidated those portions that \n     imposed limits on campaign spending as violative of the First \n     Amendment's guarantee of free speech.\n       In his powerful dissent, Justice White said, ``Without \n     limits on total expenditures, campaign costs will inevitably \n     and endlessly escalate.''\\3\\ His prediction was promptly \n     borne out. Multimillion-dollar campaigns for the Senate have \n     become the rule, with the 1984 Helms-Hunt race in North \n     Carolina setting astonishing new records. It is no longer \n     unusual for expenditures in contested House campaigns to go \n     over the million-dollar mark; in 1982 one House candidate \n     reportedly spent over $2 million of his own funds.\n       In 1982 a number of representatives came to the conclusion \n     that the Buckley ruling should not be allowed to stand and \n     that a constitutional amendment was imperative. In June \n     Congressman Henry Reuss of Wisconsin introduced a resolution \n     calling for an amendment to give Congress the authority to \n     regulate campaign spending in federal elections. In December, \n     with the cosponsorship of Mr. Reuss and 11 others,\\4\\ I \n     introduced a broader resolution authorizing the states, as \n     well as the Congress, to impose limits on campaign spending. \n     The text of the proposed amendment was:\n       ``Section 1. The Congress may enact laws regulating the \n     amounts of contributions and expenditures intended to affect \n     elections to federal office.\n       ``Section 2. The several states may enact laws regulating \n     the amounts of contributions and expenditures intended to \n     affect elections to state and local offices.\\5\\\n       In the Ninety-eighth Congress, the same resolution was \n     reintroduced by Mr. Vento and Mr. Donnelly and by Mr. Brown, \n     Democrat of California, and Mr. Rinaldo, Republican of New \n     Jersey. A similar resolution was introduced in the Senate by \n     Senator Stevens, Republican of Alaska. As of the present \n     writing, the resolution has been reintroduced in the Ninety-\n     ninth Congress by Mr. Vento.\\6\\\n       No hearings have been held on these proposals, and they \n     have attracted little attention. Even organizations and \n     commentators deeply concerned with the problem of money in \n     politics and runaway campaign spending have focused \n     exclusively on statutory remedies. Common Cause, in spite of \n     my pleading, has declined to add a proposal for a \n     constitutional amendment to its agenda for campaign reform or \n     even to hear arguments in support of the proposal. A \n     constituency for the idea has yet to be developed.\n\n\n                       the nature of the problem\n\n       This article proceeds on the assumption that escalating \n     campaign costs pose a serious threat to the quality of \n     government in this country. There are those who argue the \n     contrary, but their view of the nature of the problem is \n     narrow. They focus on the facts that the amounts of money \n     involved are not large relative to the gross national product \n     and that the number of votes on Capitol Hill that can be \n     shown to have been affected by campaign contributions is not \n     overwhelming.\n       The curse of money in politics, however, is by no means \n     limited to the influencing of votes. There are at least two \n     other problems that are, if anything, even more serious. One \n     is the eroding of the present nonsystem on the public's \n     confidence in our form of democracy. If public office and \n     votes on issues are perceived to be for sale, the harm is \n     done, whether or not the facts justify that conclusion. In \n     Buckley the Supreme Court itself, in sustaining the \n     limitations on the size of political contributions, stressed \n     the importance of avoiding ``the appearance of improper \n     influence'' as ```critical . . . if confidence in the system \n     of representative government is not to be eroded to a \n     disastrous extent.'''\\7\\ What the Supreme Court failed to \n     recognize was that ```confidence in the system of \n     representative government''' could likewise be ```eroded to a \n     disastrous extent''' by the spectacle of lavish spending, \n     whether the source of the funds is the candidate's own wealth \n     or the result of high-pressure fund-raising from contributors \n     with an ax to grind.\n       The other problem is that excellent people are discouraged \n     from running for office, or, once in, are unwilling to \n     continue wrestling with the unpleasant and degrading task of \n     raising huge sums of money year after year. There is no doubt \n     that every two years valuable members of Congress decide to \n     retire because they are fed up with having constantly to beg. \n     For example, former Congressmen Charles Vanik of Ohio and \n     Richard Ottinger of New York, both outstanding legislators, \n     were clearly influenced by such considerations when they \n     decided to retire, Vanik in 1980 and Ottinger in 1984. Vanik \n     said, among other things, ``I feel every contribution carries \n     some sort of lien which is an encumbrance on the legislative \n     process . . . I'm terribly upset by the huge amounts that \n     candidates have to raise.''\\8\\ Probably an even greater \n     number of men and women who would make stellar legislators \n     are discouraged from competing because they cannot face the \n     prospect of constant fundraising or because they see a \n     wealthy person, who can pay for a lavish campaign, already in \n     the race.\n       In ``Politics and Money,'' Elizabeth Drew has well \n     described the poisonous effect of escalating campaign costs \n     on our political system:\n       ``Until the problem of money is dealt with, it is \n     unrealistic to expect the political process to improve in any \n     other respect. It is not relevant whether every candidate who \n     spends more than his opponent wins--though in races that are \n     otherwise close, this tends to be the case. What matters is \n     what the chasing of money does to the candidates, and to the \n     victors' subsequent behavior. The candidates' desperation for \n     money and the interests' desire to affect public policy \n     provide a mutual opportunity. The issue is not how much is \n     spent on elections but the way the money is obtained. The \n     point is what raising money, not simply spending it, does to \n     the political process. It is not just that the legislative \n     product is bent or stymied. It is not just that well-armed \n     interests have a head start over the rest of the citizenry--\n     or that often it is not even a contest. . . . It is not even \n     relevant which interest happens to be winning. What is \n     relevant is what the whole thing is doing to the democratic \n     process. What is at stake is the idea of representative \n     government, the soul of this country.\\9\\\n       Focusing on the different phenomenon of wealthy candidates' \n     being able to finance their own, often successful, campaigns, \n     the late columnist Joseph Kraft commented that ``affinity \n     between personal riches and public office challenges a \n     fundamental principle of American life.''\\10\\\n           [[Page S2633]] shortcomings of statutory proposals\n\n       In spite of the wide agreement on the seriousness of the \n     problems, there is no agreement on the solution. Many \n     different proposals have been made by legislators, \n     academicians, commentators, and public interest \n     organizations, notably Common Cause.\n       One of the most frequently discussed is to follow for \n     congressional elections the pattern adopted for presidential \n     campaigns: a system of public funding, coupled with limits on \n     spending.\\11\\ Starting in 1955, bills along these lines have \n     been introduced on Capitol Hill, but none has been adopted. \n     Understandably, such proposals are not popular with \n     incumbents, most of whom believe that challengers would gain \n     more from public financing than they would.\n       Even assuming that the political obstacles could be \n     overcome and that some sort of public financing for \n     congressional candidates might be adopted, this financing \n     would suffer from serious weaknesses. No system of public \n     financing\n      could solve the problem of the very wealthy candidate. Since \n     such candidates do not need public funding, they would not \n     subject themselves to the spending limits. The same \n     difficulty would arise when aggressive candidates, \n     believing they could raise more from private sources, \n     rejected the government funds. This result is to be \n     expected if the level of public funding is set too low, \n     that is, at a level that the constant escalation of \n     campaign costs is in the process of outrunning. According \n     to Congressman Bruce Vento, an author of the proposed \n     constitutional amendment to overturn Buckley, this has \n     tended to happen in Minnesota, where very low levels of \n     public funding are provided to candidates for state \n     office.\n       To ameliorate these difficulties, some proponents of public \n     financing suggest that the spending limits that a candidate \n     who takes government funding must accept should be waived for \n     that candidate to the extent an opponent reports expenses in \n     excess of those limits. Unfortunately, in such a case one of \n     the main purposes of public funding would be frustrated and \n     the escalation of campaign spending would continue. The \n     candidate who is not wealthy is left with the fearsome task \n     of quickly having to raise additional hundreds of thousands, \n     or even millions, of dollars.\n       Another suggested approach would be to require television \n     stations, as a condition of their licenses, to provide free \n     air time to congressional candidates in segments of not less \n     than, for instance, five minutes. A candidate's acceptance of \n     such time would commit the candidate to the acceptance of \n     spending limits. While such a scheme would be impractical for \n     primary contests--which in many areas are the crucial ones--\n     the idea is attractive for general election campaigns in \n     mixed urban-rural states and districts. It would be \n     unworkable, however, in the big metropolitan areas, where the \n     main stations reach into scores of congressional districts \n     and, in some cases, into several states. Not only would \n     broadcasters resist the idea, but the television-viewing \n     public would be furious at being virtually compelled during \n     pre-election weeks to watch a series of talking-head shows \n     featuring all the area's campaigning senators and \n     representatives and their challengers. The offer of such \n     unpopular television time would hardly tempt serious \n     candidates to accept limits on their spending.\n       Proponents of free television time, recognizing the limited \n     usefulness of the idea in metropolitan areas, have suggested \n     that candidates could be provided with free mailings instead. \n     While mailings can be pinpointed and are an essential part of \n     urban campaigning, they account for only a fraction of \n     campaign costs, even where television is not widely used; \n     accordingly, the prospect of free mailings would not be \n     likely to win the acceptance of unwelcome campaign limits on \n     total expenses.\\12\\\n       Yet another method of persuading candidates to accept \n     spending limits would be to allow 100 percent tax credits for \n     contributions of up to, say, $100 made to authorized \n     campaigns, that is, those campaigns where the candidate has \n     agreed to abide by certain regulations, including limits on \n     total spending.\\13\\ It is difficult to predict how effective \n     such a system would be, and a pilot project to find out would \n     not be feasible, since the tax laws cannot be changed for \n     just one area. For candidates who raise most of their funds \n     from contributors in the $50-to-$100 range, the incentive to \n     accept spending limits would be strong, but for those--and \n     they are many--who rely principally on contributors in the \n     $500-to-$1000 range, the incentive would be much weaker. This \n     problem could be partially solved by allowing tax credits for \n     contributions of up to $100 and tax deductions for \n     contributions in excess of $100 up to the permitted limit. \n     Such proposals, of course, amount to a form of public \n     financing and hence would encounter formidable political \n     obstacles, especially at a time when budgetary restraint and \n     tax simplification are considered of top priority.\n       Some of the most vocal critics of the present anarchy in \n     campaign financing focus their wrath and legislative efforts \n     on the political action committees (PACs) spawned in great \n     numbers under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974. \n     Although many PACs are truly serving the public interest, \n     others have made it easier for special interests, especially \n     professional and trade associations, to funnel funds into the \n     campaign treasuries of legislators or challengers who will \n     predictably vote for those interests. Restrictions, such as \n     limiting the total amount legislative candidates could accept \n     from PACs, would be salutary\\14\\ but no legislation aimed \n     primarily at the PAC phenomenon--not even legislation to \n     eliminate PACs altogether--would\n      solve the problem so well summarized by Elizabeth Drew. The \n     special interests and favor-seeking individual givers would \n     find other ways of funneling their dollars into politically \n     useful channels, and the harassed members of Congress would \n       have to continue to demean themselves by constant begging.PA\n     C regulation and all the other forms of statutory regulation \n     suffer from one fundamental weakness: none of them would \n     affect the multimillion-dollar self-financed campaign. Yet it \n     is this type of campaign that does more than any other to \n     confirm the widely held view that high office in the United \n     States can be bought.\n       Short of a constitutional amendment, there is only one kind \n     of proposal, so far as I know, that would curb the superrich \n     candidate, as well as setting limits for others. Lloyd N. \n     Cutler, counsel to the president in the Carter White House, \n     has suggested that the political parties undertake the task \n     of campaign finance regulation.\\15\\ Theoretically, the \n     parties could withhold endorsement from candidates who refuse \n     to abide by the party-prescribed limits and other \n     regulations. But the chances of this happening seem just \n     about nil. Conceivably a national party convention might \n     establish such regulations for its presidential primaries, \n     but to date most contenders have accepted the limits imposed \n     under the matching system of public funding; John Connally of \n     Texas was the exception in 1980. For congressional races, \n     however, it is not at all clear what body or bodies could \n     make such rules and enforce them. Claimants to such authority \n     would include the national conventions, national committees, \n     congressional party caucuses, various state committees, and, \n     in some cases, county committees. Perhaps our national \n     parties should be more hierarchically structured, but the \n     fact is that they are not.\n       On top of all this, the system would work for general \n     election campaigns only if both major parties took parallel \n     action. If by some miracle they did so, the end result might \n     be to encourage third-party and independent candidacies.\n       Let me make clear that I am not opposed to any of the \n     proposals briefly summarized earlier. To the extent I had the \n     opportunity to vote for any of the statutory proposals during \n     my years in the House, I did so. Nor am I arguing that a \n     constitutional amendment by itself would solve the problem; \n     it would only be the beginning of a very difficult task. What \n     I am saying is that, short of effective action by the \n     parties, any system to reverse the present lethal trends in \n     campaign financing must have as a basic element the \n     restoration to the Congress of the authority to regulate the \n     process.\n\n\n                    the merits of the buckley ruling\n\n       The justices of the Supreme Court were all over the lot in \n     the Buckley case, with numerous dissents from the majority \n     opinion. The most significant dissent, in my view, was \n     entered by Justice White, who, alone among the justices, had \n     had extensive experience in federal campaigns. White's \n     position was that the Congress, and not the Court, was the \n     proper body to decide whether the slight interference with \n     First Amendment freedoms in the Federal Election Campaign Act \n     was warranted. Justice White reasoned as follows:\n       ``The judgment of Congress was that reasonably effective \n     campaigns could be conducted within the limits established by \n     the Act. . . . In this posture of the case, there is no sound \n     basis for invalidating the expenditure limitations, so long \n     as the purposes they serve are legitimate and sufficiently \n     substantial, which in my view they are. . . . \n       ``. . . expenditure ceilings reinforce the contribution \n     limits and help eradicate the hazard of corruption. . . .\n       ``Besides backing up the contribution provisions, . . . \n     expenditure limits have their own potential for preventing \n     the corruption of federal elections themselves.\\16\\\n       Justice White further concluded that\n     ``limiting the total that can be spent will ease the \n     candidate's understandable obsession with fundraising, and so \n     free him and his staff to communicate in more places and ways \n     unconnected with the fundraising function.\n       ``It is also important to restore and maintain public \n     confidence in federal elections. It is critical to obviate \n     and dispel the impression that federal elections are purely \n     and simply a function of money, that federal offices are \n     bought and sold or that political races are reserved for \n     those who have the facility--and the stomach--for doing \n     whatever it takes to bring together those interests, groups, \n     and individuals that can raise or contribute large fortunes \n     in order to prevail at the polls.\\17\\''\n       Two of the judges of the District of Columbia Circuit \n     Court, which upheld the 1974 act--judges widely respected, \n     especially for their human rights concerns--later wrote law \n     journal articles criticizing in stinging terms the Supreme \n     Court's holding that the spending limits were invalid. For \n     example, the late Judge Harold Leventhal said in the Columbia \n     Law Review:\n        [[Page S2634]] ``The central question is: what is the \n     interest underlying regulation of campaign expenses and is it \n     substantial? The critical interest, in my view, is the same \n     as that accepted by the [Supreme] Court in upholding limits \n     on contributions. It is the need to maintain confidence in \n     self-government, and to prevent the erosion of democracy \n     which comes from a popular view of government as responsive \n     only or mainly to special interests.\\18\\\n       ``A court that is concerned with public alienation and \n     distrust of the political process cannot fairly deny to the \n     people the power to tell the legislators to implement this \n     one word principle: Enough!\\19\\\n       Here are excerpts from what Judge J. Skelly Wright had to \n     say in the Yale Law Journal:\n       ``The Court told us, in effect, that money is speech.\n       ``. . . [This view] accepts without question elaborate mass \n     media campaigns that have made political communications \n     expensive, but at the same time remote, disembodied, \n     occasionally . . . manipulative. Nothing in the First \n     Amendment . . . commits us to the dogma that money is \n     speech.\\20\\\n       ``. . . far from stifling First Amendment values, [the 1974 \n     act] actually promotes them . . . In place of unlimited \n     spending, the law encourages all to emphasize less expensive \n     face-to-face communications efforts, exactly the kind of \n     activities that promote real dialogue on the merits and leave \n     much less room for manipulation and avoidance of the \n     issues.\\21\\''\n       The Supreme Court was apparently blind to these \n     considerations. Its treatment was almost entirely \n     doctrinaire. In holding unconstitutional the limits set by \n     Congress on total expenditures for congressional campaigns \n     and on spending by individual candidates, the Court did not \n     claim that the dollar limits set were unreasonably low. In \n     the view taken by the Court, such limits were beyond the \n     power of the Congress to set, no matter how high.\n       Only in the case of the $1000 limit set for spending by \n     independent individuals or groups ``relative to a clearly \n     identified candidate'' did the court focus on the level set \n     in the law. The Court said that such a limit ``would appear \n     to exclude all citizens and groups except candidates, \n     political parties and the institutional press from any \n     significant use of the most effective modes of \n     communication.''\\22\\ In a footnote, the Court noted:\n       ``The record indicates, that, as of January 1, 1975, one \n     full-page advertisement in a daily edition of a certain \n     metropolitan newspaper cost $6,971.04--almost seven times the \n     annual limit on expenditures ``relative to'' a particular \n     candidate imposed on the vast majority of individual citizens \n     and associations\\23\\''\n       The Court devoted far more space to arguing the \n     unconstitutionality of this provision than to any of the \n     other limits, presumably because on this point it had the \n     strongest case. Judge Leventhal, too, thought the $1000 \n     figure for independent spending was unduly restrictive and \n     might properly have been struck down. As one who supported \n     the 1974 act while in the House. I believe, with the benefit \n     of hindsight, that the imposition of this low limit on \n     independent expenditures was a grave mistake.\n       Let us look for a moment at the question of whether \n     reasonable limits on total spending in campaigns and on \n     spending by wealthy candidates really do interfere with the \n     ``unfettered interchange of ideas,'' ``the free discussion of \n     governmental affairs,'' and the ``uninhibited, robust and \n     wide-open'' debate on public issues that the Supreme Court \n     has rightly said the First Amendment is designed to \n     protect.\\24\\ In Buckley the Supreme Court has answered that \n     question in the affirmative when the limits are imposed by \n     law under Congress's conceded power to regulate federal \n     elections. The Court answered the same question negatively, \n     however, when the limits were imposed as a condition of \n     public financing. In narrow legalistic terms the distinction \n     is perhaps justified, but, in terms of what is desirable or \n     undesirable under our form of government, I submit that the \n     setting of such limits is either desirable or it is not.\n       Various of the solutions proposed to deal with the \n     campaign-financing problem, statutory and nonstatutory, raise \n     the same question--for example, the proposal to allow tax \n     credits only for contributions to candidates who have \n     accepted spending limits, and the proposal that political \n     parties should impose limits. All such proposals assume that \n     it is a good public policy to have such limits in place. They \n     simply seek to avoid the inhibition of the Buckley case by \n     arranging for some carrot-type motivation for the observation \n     of limits, instead of the stick-type motivation of compliance \n     with a law.\n       I am not, of course, suggesting that those who make these \n     proposals are wrong to do so. What I am suggesting is that \n     they should support the idea of\n      undoing the damage done by Buckley by way of a \n     constitutional amendment.\n       Summing up the reason for such an amendment, Congressman \n     Henry Reuss said, ``Freedom of speech is a precious thing. \n     But protecting it does not permit someone to shout `fire' in \n     a crowded theater. Equally, freedom of speech must not be \n     stressed so as to compel democracy to commit suicide by \n     allowing money to govern elections.''\\25\\\n\n\n           independent expenditures in presidential campaigns\n\n       Until now the system of public financing for presidential \n     campaigns, coupled with limits on private financing, has \n     worked reasonably well. Accordingly, most of the proposals \n     mentioned previously for the amelioration of the campaign-\n     financing problem have been concerned with campaigns for the \n     Senate and the House.\n       In 1980 and 1984, however, a veritable explosion occurred \n     in the spending for the presidential candidates by allegedly \n     independent committees--spending that is said not to be \n     authorized by, or coordinated with, the campaign committees. \n     In both years, the Republican candidates benefited far more \n     from this type of spending than the Democratic: in 1980, the \n     respective amounts were $12.2 million and $45,000; in 1984, \n     $15.3 million and $621,000.\\26\\\n       This spending violated section 9012(f) of the Presidential \n     Campaign Fund Act, which prohibited independent committees \n     from spending more than $1,000 to further a presidential \n     candidate's election if that candidate had elected to take \n     public financing under the terms of the act. In 1983 various \n     Democratic Party entities and the Federal Election \n     Commission, with Common Cause as a supporting amicus curiae, \n     sued to have section 9012(f) declared constitutional, so as \n     to lay the groundwork for enforcement of the act. These \n     efforts failed. Applying the Buckley precedent, the three-\n     judge district court that first heard the case denied the \n     relief sought, and this ruling was affirmed in a 7-to-2 \n     decision by the Supreme Court in FEC v. NCPAC in March \n     1985.\\27\\\n       The NCPAC decision clearly strengthens the case for a \n     constitutional amendment to permit Congress to regulate \n     campaign spending. For none of the statutory or party-action \n     remedies summarized earlier would touch this new eruption of \n     the money-in-politics volcano.\n       True, even with a constitutional amendment in place, it \n     would still be possible for the National Conservative \n     Political Action Committee or other committees to spend \n     unlimited amounts for media programs on one side of an issue \n     or another, and these would undoubtedly have some impact on \n     presidential--and other--campaigns. However, the straight-out \n     campaigning for an individual or a ticket, which tends to be \n     far more effective than focusing on issues alone, could be \n     brought within reasonable limits.\n\n\n                             looking ahead\n\n       The obstacles in the way of achieving a reversal of Buckley \n     by constitutional amendment are, of course, formidable. This \n     is especially true today when the House Judiciary Committee \n     is resolutely sitting on other amendments affecting the Bill \n     of Rights and is not disposed to report out any such \n     amendments.\n       In addition to the practical political hurdles to be \n     overcome, there are drafting problems to solve. The simple \n     form so far proposed\\28\\--and quoted previously--needs \n     refinement.\n       For example, if an amendment were adopted simply giving to \n     the Congress and the states the authority to ``enact laws \n     regulating the amount of contributions and expenditures \n     intended to affect elections,''\\29\\ the First Amendment \n     question would not necessarily be answered. The argument \n     could still be made, and not without reason, that such \n     regulatory laws, like other powers of the Congress and the \n     states, must not offend the First Amendment. I asked an \n     expert in constitutional law how this problem might be dealt \n     with, and he said the only sure way would be to add the words \n     ``notwithstanding the First Amendment.'' But such an addition \n     is not a viable solution. The political obstacles in the way \n     of an amendment overturning Buckley in its interpretation of \n     the First Amendment with respect to campaigns spending are \n     grievous enough; to ask the Congress--and the state \n     legislatures--to create a major exception to the First \n     Amendment would assure defeat.\n       The answer has to be to find a form of wording that says, \n     in effect, that the First Amendment can properly be \n     interpreted so as to permit reasonable regulation of campaign \n     spending. In my view, it would be sufficient to insert in the \n     proposed amendment,\\30\\ after ``The Congress,'' the words \n     ``having due regard for the need to facilitate full and\n      free discussion and debate. ``Section 1 of the amendment \n     would then read, ``The Congress, having due regard for the \n     need to facilitate full and free discussion and debate, may \n     enact laws regulating the amounts of contributions and \n     expenditures intended to affect elections to federal \n     office.'' Other ways of dealing with this problem could no \n       doubt be devised.Another drafting difficulty arises from \n     the modification in the proposed amendment of the words \n     ``contributions and expenditures'' by ``intended to affect \n     elections.'' This language is appropriate with respect to \n     money raised or spent by candidates and their committees, but \n     it does present a problem in its application to money raised \n     and spent by allegedly independent committees, groups, or \n     individuals. It could hardly be argued that communications \n     referring solely to issues, with no mention of candidates, \n     could, consistent with the First Amendment, be made subject \n     to spending limits, even if they were quite obviously \n     ``intended to affect'' an election. Accordingly, a proper \n     amendment should include language limiting the regulation of \n     ``independent'' expenditures to those relative to ``clearly \n     identified'' candidates, language that would parallel the \n     provisions \n      [[Page S2635]] of the 1971 Federal Election Campaign Act, as \n     amended.\\31\\\n       These are essentially technical problems that could be \n     solved with the assistance of experts in constitutional law \n     if the Judiciary Committee of either house should decide to \n     hold hearings on the idea of a constitutional amendment and \n     proceed to draft and report out an appropriate resolution.\n       Many of those in and out of Congress who are genuinely \n     concerned with political money brush aside the notion of a \n     constitutional amendment and focus entirely on remedies that \n     seem less drastic. They appear to assume that Congress is \n     more likely to adopt a statutory remedy, such as public \n     financing, than to go for an enabling constitutional \n     amendment that could be tagged as tampering with the Bill of \n     Rights. I disagree with that assumption.\n       Incumbents generally resist proposals such as public \n     financing because challengers might be the major \n     beneficiaries, but most incumbents tend to favor the idea of \n     spending limits. The Congress is not by its nature averse to \n     being given greater authority; that would be especially true \n     in this case, where until 1976 the Congress always thought it \n     had such authority. I venture to say that if a carefully \n     drawn constitutional amendment were reported out of one of \n     the Judiciary Committees, it might secure the necessary two-\n     thirds majorities in both houses with surprising ease.\n       The various state legislatures might well react in similar \n     fashion. A power they thought they had would be restored to \n     them.\n       The big difficulty is to get the process started, whether \n     it be for a constitutional amendment or a statutory remedy or \n     both. Here, the villain, I am afraid, is public apathy. \n     Unfortunately, the voters seem to take excessive campaign \n     spending as a given--a phenomenon they can do nothing about--\n     and there is no substantial constituency for reform. The \n     House Administration Committee, which in the early 1970's was \n     the spark plug for legislation, has recently shown little \n     interest in pressing for any of the legislative proposals \n     that have been put forward.\n       The 1974 act itself emerged as a reaction to the scandals \n     of the Watergate era, and it may well be that major action, \n     whether statutory or constitutional, will not be a practical \n     possibility until a new set of scandals bursts into the open. \n     Meanwhile, the situation will only get worse.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\Personal communication with Joseph L.

Sec. 431(17).\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  The time is about up. I am sorry to have taken more time, but I \nwanted to get into the full measure of this thing. It is a bipartisan \napproach to restore free speech. What Buckley versus Valeo did is take \naway the speech of the poor and give enhanced speech to the rich. You \nknow it and I know it. This amendment will put us back to where we were \nwhen the 1974 act was passed. It will limit spending in campaigns. That \nis what we all want to do. We did it in 1974, we thought, until the \nBuckley versus Valeo decision.\n  I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 21 minutes and \n51 seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I do not know; maybe we can check with \nthe Cloakrooms to see if anybody objects to yielding back time. I do \nnot know whether my friend from South Carolina has time left he wants \nto use, but I was going to suggest that I make a few more observations \nand if the Senator from South Carolina is ready to yield back, I would \nyield back as well. But there could be those who are depending on this \nvote occurring at a certain time, so if we could ask the staff to check \non that, I would appreciate it.\n    \n    \n  Mr. President, the past majority leader, Senator Mitchell, who just \nleft the Senate a couple of months ago said on June 26, 1990, ``For 200 \nyears,'' referring to the first amendment, ``it has protected the \nliberties of generations of Americans. During that time, the Bill of \nRights has never been changed or amended,'' not once, ever. It stands \ntoday, word for word, exactly as it did when it was adopted two \ncenturies ago.\n  Senator George Mitchell went on on the same day:\n\n       Never in 200 years has the first amendment been changed or \n     amended. As a result, never in 200 years has Congress been \n     able to make a law abridging freedom of speech.\n\n  Now, that was Senator George Mitchell, the Democratic majority \nleader, expressing his views about the importance of leaving the first \namendment unamended, untampered with.\n  The current majority leader, Senator Daschle, said on June 21, 1990:\n\n       What chapter will we have ghosted for our autobiographies \n     to explain away our writing a loophole into the free speech \n     clause of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of the \n     United States?\n\n  Senator Daschle was, of course, referring to the debate on the flag \nburning amendment, but his point, his point, was about the first \namendment and freedom of speech.\n  Now, the American Civil Liberties Union, which I indicated earlier \nstrongly opposes the Hollings proposal, says:\n\n       The proposed constitutional amendment to limit Federal \n     campaign expenditures would amend the free speech guarantee \n     of the first amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court, \n     thereby limiting the amount of political speech that may be \n     engaged in by any candidate or by anyone else [anyone else] \n     seeking to be involved in the political process.\n\n  The ACLU said, Mr. President:\n\n    \n    \n       It is a highly flawed proposal, one that is \n     constitutionally incapable [incapable] of being fixed and \n     raises--\n\n    \n    \n  Said the ACLU:\n\n     a number of significant issues. It deserves to be rejected by \n     the Senate.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I have been quoting from a number of \norganizations that are supposedly on the liberal side of the political \nspectrum. Just to reassure some of my conservative friends, it is also \nthe view of conservatives that the Hollings amendment is a bad idea. \nGeorge Will in a June 28, 1993, Newsweek column said this. He was \nreally, I would say to my friend from South Carolina, admiring the \nSenator in many ways. This is a quote from Mr. Will's column, which I \nwill ask in a moment be inserted in the Record. He said:\n\n       Hollings claims--you have to admire his brass--\n\n  And, boy, we do admire the brass of the Senator from South Carolina. \nHe has more brass than anybody else in the Senate, and we do admire \nhim. He said:\n\n       Hollings claims--you have to admire his brass--that carving \n     this huge hole in the first amendment would be ``a big boost \n     to free speech.'' But by ``free'' he means ``fair,'' and by \n     ``fair'' he means equal amounts of speech--the permissible \n     amounts to be decided by incumbents in Congress and State \n     legislatures.\n\n  George Will went on. He said:\n\n       Note also the power to limit spending not only ``by'' but \n     even ``in support of, or in opposition to'' candidates.\n\n  That gets back to the point I made earlier about giving Congress the \npower to shut the newspapers up, too.\n\n       [[Page S2636]] The Senators who voted for this included \n     many who three years ago stoutly (and rightly)--\n\n  George Will said.\n\n     Opposed carving out even a small exception to the first \n     amendment protections in order to ban flag burning. But now \n     these incumbents want to empower other incumbents to hack \n     away at the Bill of Rights in order to shrink the permissible \n     amount of political discourse.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the George Will column be \nprinted in the Record; also, that the letter to which I have referred \nseveral times from the American Civil Liberties issue be included in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Newsweek, June 28, 1993]\n\n  So, We Talk Too Much?--The Supreme Court's Two-word Opinion of the \n                Senate's Reform Bill May Be Good Grief!'\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       Washington's political class and its journalistic echoes \n     are celebrating Senate passage, on a mostly party-line vote, \n     of a ``reform'' that constitutes the boldest attack on \n     freedom of speech since enactment of the Alien and Sedition \n     Acts of 1798. The campaign finance bill would ration \n     political speech. Fortunately, it is so flagrantly \n     unconstitutional that the Supreme Court will fling it back \n     across First Street, N.E., with a two-word opinion: ``Good \n     grief!''\n       The reformers begin, as their ilk usually does, with a \n     thumping but unargued certitude: campaigns involve ``too \n     much'' money. (In 1992 congressional races involved a sum \n     equal to 40 percent of what Americans spent on yogurt. Given \n     the government's increasing intrusiveness and capacity to do \n     harm, it is arguable that we spend to little on the \n     dissemination of political discourse.) But reformers eager to \n     limit spending have a problem: mandatory spending limits are \n     unconstitutional. The Supreme Court acknowledges that the \n     First Amendment protects ``the indispensable conditions for \n     meaningful communication,'' which includes spending for the \n     dissemination of speech. The reformers' impossible task is to \n     gin up ``incentives'' powerful enough to coerce candidates \n     into accepting limits that can be labeled ``voluntary.''\n       The Senate bill's original incentive was public financing, \n     coupled with various punishments for privately financed \n     candidates who choose not to sell their First Amendment \n     rights for taxpayers' dollars and who exceed the government's \n     stipulated ration of permissible spending/speech. Most \n     taxpayers detest public financing. (``Food stamps for \n     politicians,'' says Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky \n     Republican who will lead the constitutional challenge if \n     anything like this bill becomes law.) So the bill was \n     changed--and made even more grossly unconstitutional. Now it \n     limits public funding to candidates whose opponents spend/\n     speak in excess of government limits. The funds for the \n     subsidy are to come from taxing, at the top corporate rate, \n     all contributions to the candidate who has chosen to exercise \n     his free speech rights with private funding. So 35 percent of \n     people's contributions to a privately funded candidate would \n     be expropriated and given to his opponent. This is part of \n     the punishment system designed to produce ``voluntary'' \n     acceptance of spending limits.\n       But the Court says the government cannot require people \n     ``to pay a tax for the exercise of that which the First \n     amendment has made a high constitutional privilege.'' The \n     Court says that the ``power to tax the exercise of a right to \n     power to control or suppress the exercise of its enjoyment'' \n     and is ``as potent as the power of censorship.''\n       Sen. Fritz Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat, is a \n     passionate advocate of spending limits but at least has the \n     gumption to attack the First Amendment frontally. The Senate \n     bill amounts, he says candidly, to ``coercing people to \n     accept spending limits while pretending it is voluntary.'' \n     Because ``everyone knows what we are doing is \n     unconstitutional,'' he proposes to make coercion \n     constitutional. He would withdraw First Amendment protection \n     from the most important speech--political discourse. And the \n     Senate has adopted (52-43) his resolution urging Congress to \n     send to the states this constitutional amendment: Congress \n     and the states ``shall have power to set reasonable limits on \n     campaign expenditures by, in support of, or in opposition to \n     any candidate in any primary or other election'' for federal, \n     state or local office.\n       Hollings claims--you have to admire his brass--that carving \n     this huge hole in the First Amendment would be ``a big boost \n     to free speech.'' But by ``free'' he means ``fair,'' and by \n     ``fair'' he means equal amounts of speech--the permissible \n     amounts to be decided by incumbents in Congress and state \n     legislatures. Note also the power to limit spending not only \n     ``by'' but even ``in support of, or in opposition to'' \n     candidates. The 52 senators who voted for this included many \n     who three years ago stoutly (and rightly) opposed carving out \n     even a small exception to First Amendment protections in \n     order to ban flag-burning. But now these incumbents want to \n     empower incumbents to hack away at the Bill of Rights in \n     order to shrink the permissible amount of political \n     discourse.\n       Government micromanagement: The Senate bill would ban or \n     limit spending political action committees. It would require \n     privately funded candidates to say in their broadcast \n     advertisements that ``the candidate has not agreed to \n     voluntary campaign limits.'' (This speech regulation is \n     grossly unconstitutional because it favors a particular point \n     of view, and because the Court has held that the First \n     Amendment protects the freedom to choose ``both what to say \n     and what not to say.'') All this government micromanagement \n     of political speech is supposed to usher in the reign of \n     ``fairness'' (as incumbents define it, of course).\n       Incumbents can live happily with spending limits. \n     Incumbents will write the limits, perhaps not altogether \n     altruistically. And spending is the way challengers can \n     combat incumbents' advantages such as name recognition, \n     access to media and franked mail. Besides, the most important \n     and plentiful money spent for political purposes is dispensed \n     entirely by incumbents. It is called the federal budget--$1.5 \n     trillion this year and rising. Federal spending (along with \n     myriad regulations and subsidizing activities such as \n     protectionist measures) often is vote-buying.\n       It is instructive that when the Senate voted to empower \n     government to ration political speech, and even endorse \n     amending the First Amendment, there was no outcry from \n     journalists. Most of them are liberals and so are disposed to \n     like government regulation of (other people's) lives. \n     Because, journalists know that government rationing of \n     political speech by candidates will enlarge the importance of \n     journalists' unlimited speech.\n       The Senate bill's premise is that there is ``too much'' \n     political speech and some is by undesirable elements (PACs), \n     so government control is needed to make the nation's \n     political speech healthier. Our governments cannot balance \n     their budgets or even suppress the gunfire in America's \n     (potholed) streets. It would be seemly if politicians would \n     get on with such basic tasks, rather than with the mischief \n     of making mincemeat of the First Amendment.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                               American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 1992.\n       Dear Senator:\n       The American Civil Liberties strongly opposes S.J. Res. 35, \n     the proposed constitutional amendment to limit federal \n     campaign expenditures. The proposal would amend the free-\n     speech guarantee of the First Amendment, as interpreted by \n     the Supreme Court, thereby limiting the amount of political \n     speech that may be engaged in by any candidate or by anyone \n     else seeking to be involved in the political process. It is a \n     highly flawed proposal, one that is constitutionally \n     incapable of being fixed, and raises a number of significant \n     issues. It deserves to be rejected by the Senate.\n       First, as many members of the Senate recognized during the \n     debate about the flag-burning amendment proposed a few years \n     ago, it is wrong for the Senate to consider changing the \n     First Amendment, a provision that is a justifiable source of \n     pride for the United States and much admired throughout the \n     world. If Congress could carve out exceptions to the reach of \n     free speech through constitutional amendment, particularly in \n     the important area of political speech, then none of our \n     liberties and freedoms are safe and proposals to give \n     Congress authority over other forms of speech will abound. \n     Moreover, since the Constitution does not grant freedom of \n     speech to the people, but is a reflection of its Framers' \n     natural-rights philosophy--one that recognizes that these \n     rights inhere in the people and are inalienable--it is \n     unlikely that Congress, even by way of constitutional \n     amendment, has the authority to interfere with or restrict \n     those rights. In other words, S.J. Res. 35 may well be an \n     unconstitutional constitutional proposal.\n       Second, if the proposed amendment were implemented, it \n     would operate to distort the political process in numerous \n     ways. if implemented evenhandedly, it would operate to the \n     benefit of incumbents who generally have a higher name \n     recognition and thus an ability to do more with lesser \n     funding. And it would operate to the detriment of dark-horse \n     and third-party candidates who start out with fewer \n     contributors and whose only hope of obtaining the visibility \n     necessary to run a serious campaign may come from the backing \n     of a few large contributors or from their own funds. Thus,\n     rather than assure fair and free elections, the proposal \n     would likely operate to the benefit of those in power and to \n     the disadvantage of those challenging the political status \n       quo.Additionally, the wording of the proposed amendment \n     would actually permit Congress to set a different limit on \n     incumbents versus challengers, wealthy candidates versus \n     those without vast personal funds to mount a campaign, or \n     candidates from underrepresented groups versus those who are \n     well represented, as long as these were justified on a \n     rational basis. The First Amendment properly prevents the \n     government from making these kinds of distinctions, but S.J. \n     Res. 35 would enable Congress to set these limitations \n     notwithstanding currently existing constitutional \n     understandings. Some of the dangers to the First Amendment \n     are most apparent when S.J. Res. 35 is viewed from that \n     perspective.\n       Finally, as an amendment subsequent to the First Amendment, \n     the existing understandings about the protections of freedom \n     of the press would also be changed, thereby empowering \n     Congress to regulate what newspapers and broadcasters can do \n     on behalf of \n      [[Page S2637]] the candidates they endorse or oppose. A \n     candidate-centered editorial, as well as op-ed articles or \n     commentary, are certainly expenditures in support of or in \n     opposition to political candidates. The amendment, as its \n     words make apparent, would authorize Congress to set \n     reasonable limits on the involvement of the media in \n     campaigns when not strictly reporting the news. Such a result \n     would be intolerable in a society that cherishes a free \n     press.\n       Last year, we celebrated the 200th anniversary of the Bill \n     of Rights with speeches, articles, and lessons about the \n     importance of our cherished liberties. This year should not \n     mark the end of that bicentennial legacy by an ill-conceived \n     effort to cut back on freedom of speech and the press. Please \n     reject S.J. Res. 35.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Robert S. Peck,\n                                              Legislative Counsel.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.  Let me just say again, hopefully in conclusion, if \nboth sides are ready to yield back their time--I do not know whether \nthey are not, but if they are, I am prepared to, but let me summarize \nagain that this proposal has the opposition of Common Cause, the \nopposition of the Washington Post, the opposition of the ACLU, and the \nopposition of George Will. That pretty well covers it, Mr. President. \nIt is opposed by people from left to right.\n  I hope that the Senate would support the motion to table I will make \nat such time as we conclude the debate.\n  So, Mr. President, I would just inquire of my friend from South \nCarolina, do we want to yield back and go ahead or have we heard from \nour Cloakrooms?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would like to accommodate the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky. What happens is I have the Senator from Nevada on the \nway.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. All right.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. He is on the way.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, then I will just reserve the remainder \nof my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 10 minutes \n46 seconds.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I enjoy serving with the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky. When he was going down the list of the American \nCivil Liberties Union and the Washington Post and all these liberal \nfolks, he should not get too enthralled with this particular issue, \nbecause somebody will pick up that Record, the way they run campaigns \nnow, and say he is running around with the ACLU. I could see that 20-\nsecond bite right now.\n  I have a good friend. He wanted to contribute to me. He said he could \nget $5,000 from a group, and I said, ``Look, it will take me $50,000 to \n$100,000 to explain that group. I just cannot accept it.''\n  You have to look at elections. It is unfortunate, but that is what we \nare talking about. If you get it back down to where you have a limited \namount in a small State like South Carolina of $1 million, the \nincumbent, I can tell you right now, is at a disadvantage, because I \nhave a record of votes, thousands of votes. What I fear as an opponent \nis some nice, young, clean-cut law graduate, married, with two or three \nchildren and who has never voted on anything. All he has is a picture \nof himself going into church on Sunday. What am I going to argue about?\n  I was lucky in my last race. I had a former Congressman as an \nopponent. I survived by the skin of my teeth because they zeroed in \nwith lots of money and lots of TV. Money talks. Money talks. If we can \nstart limiting that money in these campaigns, we will get it back to \nthe people.\n  The expenses are just absolutely unheard of. For example, the average \ncost of winning a Senate seat in 1980 was $1.2 million, but by 1984 it \nrose to $2.1 million, and by 1986 it skyrocketed to $3.1 million--this \nis the average--in 1988, to $3.7 million, and last year the average \nseat was $4.1 million.\n  This past year Ollie North in Virginia spent $19.8 million. Senator \nRobb spent $5.4 million. Mr. President, $19.8 and $5.4 million--that's \na total of $25.2 million.\n  You can go down the list. I do not really want to make a public \nrecord because I know the sensitivities of Senators. Frankly, it is \nembarrassing what we all spend. I know my opponent, for example, spent \njust as much as I did and tried to report it differently.\n  When are we going to correct this thing? Here is an opportunity to do \njust exactly that. We have a wonderful opportunity. Whatever the \nSenator from Kentucky says I want to consider it, because he and I have \nbeen on the same side against public financing: The public now \ncontributing to politics. You would never get anybody out up here if \nthat were the case. That is really where the incumbents can spend all \ntheir time prissing and preening and actually getting absolutely \nnothing done. In fact, that is the way we are. We are on a treadmill to \nmake absolutely sure that nothing gets done.\n  How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 2 minutes \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate resumes the joint resolution at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, the \npending business be the Bingaman amendment re: supermajority, and that \ntime on that amendment prior to a motion to table be as follows, and \nthat no second-degree amendments be in order prior to the motion to \ntable: 45 minutes under the control of Senator Bingaman, 15 minutes \nunder the control of Senator Hatch.\n  I further ask that following the conclusion or yielding back of time \nthe majority leader or his designee be recognized to make a motion to \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, will the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah please repeat the first part of the \nrequest for unanimous consent? If he does not mind? I apologize.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nthe joint resolution at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, the pending business be \nthe Bingaman amendment re: supermajority, and that time on that \namendment prior to a motion to table be as follows, and that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order prior to the motion to table: 45 minutes \nunder the control of Senator Bingaman, 15 minutes under the control of \nSenator Hatch.\n  I further ask that following the conclusion or yielding back of time \nthe majority leader or his designee be recognized to make a motion to \ntable.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, would that be presuming that this will be \nthe final vote of the evening, on the Hollings amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. This is going to be the final vote.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I do not object and I yield the floor and thank the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the disposition of the Bingaman amendment, Senator Wellstone \nbe recognized to make a motion to refer, and the time on that motion be \nlimited in the following fashion prior to a motion to table, and that \nno amendments be in order to the motion prior to the tabling motion: 45 \nminutes under the control of Senator Wellstone, 15 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator Hatch.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the conclusion or \nyielding back of time, the majority leader or his designee be \nrecognized to make a motion to table the motion to refer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been authorized to tell the Senate \nthat following the vote on the amendment of the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina there will be no more rollcall votes this evening. \nBut we will have those two rollcall votes first thing in the morning \nstarting after the debate at 9:30 and after the second debate at that \ntime.\n  I am wondering if both sides would be willing to yield their time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Just in a few minutes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the testimony of the \ndistinguished Lloyd N. Cutler before the Senate Judiciary Committee be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S2638]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Statement of Lloyd N. Cutler Before the Senate Judiciary Committee, \n            Subcommittee on the Constitution, March 17, 1988\n\n       My name is Lloyd N. Cutler. Along with Senator Nancy \n     Kassebaum of Kansas and Mr. Douglas Dillon, I am a Co-\n     Chairman of the Committee on the Constitutional System, a \n     group of several hundred present and former legislators, \n     executive branch officials, political party officials, \n     professors and civic leaders who are interested in analyzing \n     and correcting some of the weaknesses that have developed in \n     our political system.\n       One of the most glaring weaknesses, of course, is the \n     rapidly escalating cost of political campaigns, and the \n     growing dependence of incumbents and candidates on money from \n     interest groups who expect the recipient to vote in favor of \n     their particular interests. Incumbents and candidates must \n     devote large portions of their time to begging for money; \n     they are often tempted to vote the conflicting interests of \n     their contributors and to create a hodgepodge of conflicting \n     and indefensible policies; and in turn public frustration \n     with these policies process.\n       A serious attempt to deal with the campaign financing \n     problem was made in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974 \n     and the 1976 amendments, which set maximum limits on the \n     amounts of individual contributions and on the aggregate \n     expenditures of candidates and so-called independent \n     committees supporting such candidates. The constitutionality \n     of these provisions was challenged in the famous case of \n     Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, in which I had the honor of \n     sharing the argument in support of the statute with Professor \n     Archibald Cox. While the Supreme Court sustained the \n     constitutionality of the limits on contributions, it struck \n     down the provision limiting expenditures for candidates and \n     independent committees supporting such candidates. It found \n     an inseparable connection between an expenditure limit and \n     the extent of a candidate's or committee's political speech, \n     which did not exist in the case of a limit on the size of \n     each contribution by a non-speaker unaccompanied by any limit \n     on the aggregate amount a candidate could raise. It also \n     found little if any proven connection between corruption and \n     the size of a candidate's aggregate expenditures, as \n     distinguished from the size of individual contributions to a \n     candidate.\n       The Court did, however, approve the Presidential Campaign \n     Financing Fund created by the 1976 amendments, including the \n     condition it imposed barring any presidential nominee who \n     accepted the public funds from spending more than a specified \n     limit. However, it remains unconstitutional for Congress to \n     place any limits on expenditures by independent committees on \n     behalf of a candidate. In recent presidential elections these \n     independent expenditures on behalf of one candidate exceeded \n     the amount of federal funding he accepted. Moreover, so long \n     as the Congress remains deadlocked on proposed legislation \n     for the public financing of Congressional campaigns, it is \n     not possible to use the public financing device as a means of \n     limiting Congressional campaign expenditures.\n       Accordingly, the Committee on the Constitutional System has \n     come to the conclusion that the only effective way to limit \n     the explosive growth of campaign financing is to adopt a \n     constitutional amendment. The amendment would be a very \n     simple one consisting of only 46 words. It would state merely \n     that ``Congress shall have power to set reasonable limits on \n     campaign expenditures by or in support of any candidate in a \n     primary or general election for federal office. The States \n     shall have the same power with respect to campaign \n     expenditures in elections for state and local offices.''\n       Our proposed amendment would enable Congress to set limits \n     not only on direct expenditures by candidates and their own \n     committees, but also on expenditures by so-called independent \n     committees in support of such a candidate. The details of the \n     actual limits would be contained in future legislation and \n     could be changed from time to time as Congress in its \n     judgment sees fit.\n       It may of course be argued that the proposed amendment, by \n     authorizing reasonable limits on expenditures, would \n     necessarily set limits on the quantity of speech on behalf of \n     a candidate and that any limits, no matter how ample, is \n     undesirable. But in our view the evidence is overwhelming by \n     now that unlimited campaign expenditures will eventually grow \n     to the point where they consume so much of our political \n     energies and so fracture our political consensus that they \n     will make the political process incapable of governing \n     effectively. Even the Congress has found that unlimited \n     speech can destroy the power to govern; that is why the House \n     of Representatives has imposed time limits on Members' \n     speeches for decades and why the Senate has adopted a rule \n     permitting 60 senators to end a filibuster. One might fairly \n     paraphrase Lord Action's famous aphorism about power by \n     saying, ``All political money corrupts; unlimited political \n     money corrupts absolutely.''\n       Finally, Mr. Chairman, I would not be discouraged from \n     taking the amendment route by any feeling that constitutional \n     amendments take too long to get ratified. The fact is that \n     the great majority of amendments submitted by Congress to the \n     states during the last 50 years have been ratified within \n     twenty months after they were submitted. All polls show that \n     the public strongly supports limits on campaign expenditures. \n     The principal delay will be in getting the amendment through \n     Congress. Since that is going to be a difficult task, we \n     ought to start immediately. Unlimited campaign expenditures \n     and the political diseases they cause are going to increase \n     at least as rapidly as new cases of AIDS, and it is high time \n     to start getting serious about the problem.\n       Mr. Chairman, on three past occasions we the people have \n     amended the Constitution to correct weaknesses in that \n     rightly revered document as interpreted by the Supreme Court. \n     On at least two of those occasions--the Dred Scott decision \n     and the decision striking down federal income taxes, history \n     has subsequently confirmed that the amendments were essential \n     to our development as a healthy, just and powerful society. A \n     third such challenge is now before us. The time has come to \n     meet it.\n       For a fuller discussion of the case for a constitutional \n     amendment, I am attaching an article written shortly before \n     his death by Congressman Jonathan Bingham, my college and law \n     school classmate and, in my view, one of the finest public \n     servants of our times.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in the process of completing the \nthought, to raise the kind of money necessary now in races the average \nSenator must raise over $14,000 a week every week of his or her 6-year \nterm. Overall spending in congressional races increased from $403 \nmillion in 1990 to more than $590 million in 1994; a 50 percent \nincrease in 4 short years.\n  Mr. President, with $50,000-plate dinners, with $11 million evening \nfundraisers, it is going up, up and away. This amendment is not just \nspasmodic or spurious or unstudied. I went to the Parliamentarian, Mr. \nDove, and asked if it would confuse a constitutional amendment on the \nbalanced budget. He said the way I had it written it would be engrossed \nseparately and be voted on by the States separately. Thereupon, I \nincluded language in the first section to make sure that it would not \ncause confusion and that it would be voted on separately. Of course, \nhaving agreed to the time--and I thank the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer--the distinguished Senator from Kentucky having agreed to a \ntime limit, I appreciated the time given.\n  This certainly was not intended for delay. It is a serious amendment. \nIt is a wonderful opportunity for all of us to say what we mean and \nmean what we say by voting in the affirmative for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the remainder of the \ntime?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in conclusion, let me remind everybody \nthat on this proposal offered by the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina, Common Cause, the Washington Post, the ACLU, and George Will \nall think it is a bad idea.\n  Mr. President, I rest my case. I hope the motion of the Senator from \nUtah to table will be agreed to.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to table the Hollings amendment, and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senator from Texas and I would \nlike to take a moment in morning business to congratulate the League of \nWomen Voters on their 75th anniversary.\n  Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the \nLeague of Women Voters on their 75th anniversary. The League is a \nquintessentially American institution--one that has served this country \nvery well.\n  The league's accomplishments are many. I am particularly proud of the \nleadership the league provided in the 72 year struggle to give women \nthe right women to vote. A struggle the league finally won when the \n19th amendment became a part of the U.S. Constitution.\n  In 1919, Carrie Chapman Catt founded the league in Chicago, at the \nConvention of the National American Women's Suffrage Association. While \nthe fight for women's right to vote helped create the league, however, \nits mission has always been much larger. Seventy-five years ago, Carrie \nChapman Catt said that ``Winning the vote is only an opening wedge * * \n* but to learn to use it is a bigger task.''\n  That statement is as true today as it was when the League was \nfounded--and the league's continuing work is perhaps the best evidence \nof that truth. The league continues to educate and inform citizens and \nget people involved in their communities; it plays a critical role in \nhelping to make government work better. League members work at the \ngrossroots to build citizen participation in the democratic process, \nand to promote positive solutions to community issues through education \nand advocacy.\n  While the league can be justifiably proud of its many \naccomplishments, league members are not content. They know there is \nstill much work that remains to be done. In 1995, there are still far \ntoo many Americans who are not registered to vote and who do not \nparticipate in the democratic process. This is the focus of the \nleague's most recent ``Take Back the System'' campaign. Its goal is to \nmake voter registration more accessible, to provide voters with \ninformation on candidates and issues, and to restore the voters' \nconfidence and involvement in the system.\n  The campaign has been very successful. Its crowning achievement came \nlast year, when the Congress passed the National Voter Registration \nAct. Motor-voter has begun to enfranchise millions of Americans who \nhave been shut out of the political process, because it makes voter \nregistration more uniform and more accessible. In the past month since \nthe statute has been in force, tens of thousands of new voters have \nsigned up to register and participate in the political process. This is \nvery positive. I am hopeful that my State of Illinois will implement it \nas well.\n  The league has played a large role over the years in many other \nissues related to increasing participation in the democratic process. \nAfter the Brown versus Board of Education Supreme Court decision, local \nleagues began to work in the community to discuss the issue of \ndesegregation. Their goal was to promote calm, reasonable discussions, \nto diffuse the tension the decision had caused, especially in the \nSouth. At that time, the leagues in the South were representative of \nwomen in the South. Local leagues held\n forums and talks on the issue. Their efforts at providing education \nand building consensus were successful. In 1956, the Atlanta league \nmade headlines when it voted to strike the word white from its bylaws \nrestricting membership to white women. The league has provided \nleadership on behalf of the enfranchisement and civil rights of all \nAmericans.\n\n  And the league has been very involved in preserving civil liberties \nand protecting the privileges written into the Bill of Rights. In 1947, \nPresident Truman initiated his Loyalty Program, whose purpose was to \nroot out spies in the Federal Government. Anyone whose loyalty came \nunder question was required to testify before a loyalty board, and was \noften denied due process. During this period, the league developed a \nprogram to educate citizens about individual rights. In 1955, League \nPresident Percy Maxim Lee, testified before the House Un-American \nActivities Committee against Senator McCarthy's abuses of congressional \ninvestigative power. She emphasized that:\n\n       Tolerance and respect for the opinions of others is being \n     jeopardized by men and women whose instincts are worthily \n     patriotic, but whose minds are apparently unwilling to accept \n     the necessity for dissent within a democracy.\n\n  Today, the league is working in the emerging democracies of Eastern \nEurope to promote grassroots political education. League members have \nspent time in Poland and Hungary training people about how to make \nlocal government more responsive, and how to increase citizen \nparticipation in the democratic process. They have also brought people \nto the United States to\n learn how local leagues promote positive solutions to community issues \nthrough education and advocacy.\n\n  The league's programs are always unbiased and nonpartisan. They never \nsupport or oppose candidates for office. Although the message is \npolitical--the mission is to influence public policy--the goal is to \npromote an open, representative, and accountable government which has \nthe confidence of the American people.\n  I have been a member of the League of Women Voters' Illinois chapter \nand Chicago chapter for 15 years. As a member of the league, I invite \nall of my colleagues, as well as all the people listening at home on C-\nSPAN, to involve yourselves with this grassroots organization. Across \nthe Nation, there are over 100,000 members and supporters that build \nthe strength of the league. Our members include people of all colors, \ncreeds, and both genders, and we embrace new members with open arms. In \nthe words of Susan Lederman, a former president of the league, ``Our \nenergy, experience, and enthusiasm will be contagious. Our democracy \nwill be stronger and better for the effort we make.''\n  Mr. President, again, I wish to congratulate and commend the league \nand its members for their continued efforts in behalf of keeping our \npolitical and governmental institutions vital ones. Their role in \nprotecting and promoting democracy in this country, frankly, has been \nunparalleled.\n  I know Senator Hutchison has a statement, as well.\n  I just wanted to take this moment to wish the league and its members \na \n [[Page S2640]] happy 75th anniversary--and there will be at least 75 \nmore years--and that I join them in this celebration for the tremendous \ncontribution they have made to the people of this great country.\n  I would like now to yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2639-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS ON ITS 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would just like to follow my \ndistinguished colleague from Illinois in talking just for a minute \nabout the League of Women Voters. I think all of us agree that the \nLeague of Women Voters has made a great contribution to this country. \nToday, Valentine's Day, marks the 75 anniversary of the league's \nfounding.\n  The league's first and most widely recognized success was its role in \nthe 19th amendment's ratification. In the wake of this historic \nvictory, however, the League realized that an even more formidable \nchallenge remained ahead--the task of actually bringing the millions of \nnewly enfranchised American women into the realm of politics.\n  Over the course of 75 years, the league launched ambitious programs \nto increase voter participation and to enhance public understanding of \nmajor policy issues. At the same time, the league continued its \ncampaign to improve the legal status of women. In my home State of \nTexas, the league worked to secure secret balloting and won the battle \nto allow women to serve on juries in Texas.\n  As time has progressed, the success of league endeavors has become \nincreasingly apparent; in government and politics today, the presence \nand influence of women are stronger than ever. And though the league \nwas founded out of the struggles for women's suffrage, its vision and \nlegislative agenda have broadened over the years to encompass much more \nthan voting rights and women's issues. State and local leagues have \npursued public policy matters ranging form the environment to \ninternational cooperation.\n  Most importantly, Mr. President, the league has never wavered from \nits commitment to nonpartisanship nor its grassroots origins. In its \ntown hall meetings and candidate forums in thousands of local \ncommunities across the country, the league has endeavored to ensure \nthat voters are presented with balanced information that reflects the \ndiverse viewpoints of its membership.\n  It is with much admiration and gratitude, Mr. President, that I \nrecognize this uniquely American organization and the pioneering women \nwho founded it and strengthened it through the years. We have all \nbenefitted tremendously from their first 75 years of service to our \ncountry. I look forward to another 75 years of great league \nachievements.\n  I think it is very important that all of us realize the great \ncontributions that the League of Women Voters has made to our country \nand to the awareness of our opportunity and responsibility to vote. I \nthink the League of Women Voters should be commended today on the 75th \nanniversary of their founding, and I am very proud to be part of the \ngroup that is recognizing that important date.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2640-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the 75th anniversary \nof the League of Women Voters.\n  For many of us, America in the early 1900's is recalled mostly \nthrough the grainy, black and white images of newsreel footage. We are \ntoo young to remember American life back then, but the old films are \nportholes on the past. We laugh at the clothes, marvel at the cars, and \nwonder about the celebrities of the times whose names have long since \nbeen forgotten. We've seen newsreels of the suffragists, too, marching \nand protesting for the right to vote. Yet it is easy to forget that \nthese are more than distant, cellulose images--that these are real \npeople, with deep-felt passions about the precious right to vote.\n  But the League of Women Voters has not forgotten. The league, in \nfact, grew out of the suffrage movement and the fight to ratify the \n19th amendment to the Constitution. In my home State of Minnesota, the \nLegislature ratified the 19th amendment on September 8, 1919. The \nfollowing month, on October 29, 1919, the Minnesota League of Women \nVoters was formed. For the three-quarters of a century since its \nfounding, the Minnesota league--like its national partners--has \nbalanced a dual mission of voter education and advocacy.\n  Even in its earliest years, the Minnesota League of Women Voters took \na leading role in nonpartisan voter education services. A 1922 booklet \nof Minnesota election laws--``State Election Laws Clearly Stated for \nthe First Time!''--was an early league project, and such outreach \ncontinues today with annual Voter Guides and Election Information \nHotlines. The League's election-year televised debates have become a \ncritical source of candidate information for hundreds of thousands of \nMinnesota voters.\n  I enjoy the unique perspective of having seen the League of Women \nVoters at work from both sides of the political fence--as a journalist \nasking questions on the panel of a League debate, and as a candidate \nanswering questions during my 1994 U.S. Senate campaign. I remain \nimpressed by the league's ability to reach out to Minnesotans on all \nlevels, as evidenced by its 2,500 local members in more than 100 \nMinnesota communities.\n  The League of Women Voters has earned my respect and gratitude for \nits 75 years of urging Americans to get involved, to vote, to take a \nstand on issues. A great deal has changed in this country since the \nnewsreel days, but the league's dedication to encouraging citizen \nparticipation in their government has not. I join my Senate colleagues \nin saluting the League of Women Voters and its membership on their \nanniversary of service.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2640-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2640-S2645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of the \n75th anniversary of the founding of the League of Women Voters. Across \nthe country, the League of Women Voters has presented women the \nopportunity to study national, State, and local issues without the spin \nof outside interest groups of one kind or another. A nonpartisan \norganization, the league has played a historic role in not only the \nwomen's suffrage movement, but in a variety of issues including child \nlabor law, education, and environmental concerns.\n  As a woman from the State of Kansas, I believe it is important to \nrecognize the league's efforts to reach out to women from rural areas. \nProviding a forum for honest discussions, with a concentration on the \nfacts rather than prejudiced thought, the league has proven an \ninspiration and an awakening for many. The league encourages women to \nthink analytically and independently, creating opportunities to lead \ndiscussions, present the pros and cons of an issue, and learn practical \nuse of parliamentary principles. As a result, the league has instilled \nin many women the belief that their contributions and opinions can and \ndo make a difference. More importantly, however, is the realization \nthat world issues, no matter how complex, can be understood and \ndiscussed by ordinary people.\n  Our current political climate includes and welcomes the participation \nof women at all levels of national debate and government. This is a \nsharp contrast from the early days of the League of Women Voters. \nToday, I imagine that many young women find it difficult to comprehend \nthat women's suffrage was even an issue at the time. And, although I \nbelieve this means we have made progress, I also feel it is important \nto remember our history. We owe a debt of gratitude to the League of \nWomen Voters for encouraging women everywhere to help bring this about. \nFreeing women of all educational backgrounds to believe they could \nstudy significant issues is a gift the league has given to women all \nover America.\n           the 75th anniversary of the league of women voters\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, February 14, 1995, marks the 75th \nanniversary of the founding of the League of Women \n [[Page S2641]] Voters of the United States, a nonpartisan organization \nwith more than 1,100 chapters and 150,000 members throughout the \ncountry.\n  In 1848, the first national convention for women was held in Seneca \nFalls, NY, to discuss the conditions and rights of women in America. \nThe suffrage movement grew out of this meeting, and in 1890 the \nNational American Woman Suffrage Association was formed. In 1920, this \norganization became the League of Women Voters.\n  Due to the efforts of the National American Woman Suffrage \nAssociation and later the League of Women Voters, the 19th amendment to \nthe Constitution was declared ratified by the legislatures of 36 of the \n48 States. This amendment, which declares that the rights of citizens \nof the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the \nUnited States or by any State on account of sex, was first proposed to \nthe State legislatures for ratification by the 66th Congress on June 5, \n1919. My own State of Maine was the 19th State to ratify the amendment \non November 5, 1919.\n  Fortunately for the millions of Americans over the last 75 years who \nhave benefited from the work of the league, the vision of Carrie \nChapman Catt, the league's founder, was much larger than the single-\nminded achievement of the ratification of the 19th amendment. She \nenvisioned an organization which would continue to educate and motivate \nAmericans for citizenship and responsible voting. And the league has \ndone an excellent of achieving this vision.\n  For example, in my own State of Maine, the Maine League of Women \nVoters has over 400 members, with local branches in Portland, \nBrunswick, and Mount Desert Island, in addition to many members-at-\nlarge. One very important objective of the Maine League is to \nunderstand and improve the way Maine's government works. I am \nparticularly proud of the way the Maine League carefully analyzes \nissues to develop consensus and follows that with strong advocacy \nefforts. Issues studied recently include health care, families at risk, \nand the environment.\n  I would like to submit for the record two very informative articles \nwhich were recently printed in the Brunswick Times Record. One article, \nwritten by Julie D. Stevens, discusses the history of the National \nLeague of Women Voters, while the other, written by Nan Amstutz, \ndiscusses the history of the Maine League of Women Voters. Together, \nthese articles illustrate the profound impact of the league on Maine \nand America, and I ask unanimous consent that these full articles be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                 [From the Times Record, Feb. 10, 1995]\n\n             The League of Women Voters of Maine--75 Years\n\n                            (By Nan Amstutz)\n\n       ``If only one woman in Maine wants to vote she should have \n     that chance,'' Governor Carle Millikan argued in November \n     1919 when he opened the special session of Maine's \n     legislature called to ratify the 19th amendment to the United \n     States Constitution. Although the amendment giving women the \n     right to vote was ratified in Maine with only a few votes to \n     spare, it was the successful culmination of a long struggle \n     by the Maine Woman Suffrage Association. Within a year, the \n     Association would hold its last meeting and be replaced by a \n     new organization, the Maine chapter of the League of Women \n     Voters.\n       The road to equal suffrage in Maine had not been a smooth \n     one. Success had appeared near when the legislature in 1917 \n     amended the state constitution to allow women to vote, only \n     to have the measure overturned at the polls several months \n     later by a vote of almost two to one. Some of the parties on \n     both sides of the debate bear names which are still familiar \n     today. One bill to give women the right to vote had been \n     introduced by Senator Guy Gannett and Representative Percival \n     Baxter, both of Portland, and women's suffrage had been \n     supported by most of the state's newspapers, including the \n     Brunswick Record. In few other states, however, had women \n     anti-suffragists played so conspicuous a role as in Maine, \n     arguing that most women didn't want to vote and that \n     participation in political life was inimical to women's \n     natural role. Giving active support to this view was Miss \n     Elizabeth McKeen of Brunswick.\n       Many of the same women who had been active in the suffrage \n     movement now became active members of the new League of Women \n     Voters of Maine, which began with some 60 to 75 members. Its \n     principle legislative interest in the early years concerned \n     the welfare of women and children, and it supported aid to \n     dependent children, strengthened child-labor laws, improved \n     adoption procedures, and better court treatment of juvenile \n     offenders. Today the Maine League has over 400 members, with \n     local branches in Portland, Brunswick, and Mt. Desert Island. \n     As a rural state, Maine has many members-at-large, too \n     scattered to belong to a local branch, although they \n     sometimes gather as an informal unit as has happened in \n     Ellsworth. Issues studied by the state League today, health \n     care, families at risk, and the environment, are as relevant \n     to contemporary problems as were the issues studied in 1920 \n     to concerns of that era.\n       Throughout its almost 75-year history, the League of Women \n     Voters of Maine has retained as a major focus, understanding \n     and improving the way Maine's government works. This has \n     meant taking on issues that are important, studying them \n     carefully, reaching a consensus among members, and then \n     undertaking concerted advocacy. It has meant studying such \n     subjects as jury selection, better ways to reapportion the \n     legislature, lengths of term in office, the state tax \n     structure, and how to finance education. An early example of \n     the League's focus on state government was its long and \n     successful effort to interest the public in the need for a \n     merit system in Maine government, an effort which culminated \n     in the passage of the 1937 Personnel Law.\n       In promoting the active and informed participation of \n     citizens in government, the League's goal is to train it's \n     members to become leaders, although, as a non-partisan \n     organization, it can not support them if they run for \n     political office.\n       A number of League members are in the present state \n     legislature. Rep. Jane Saxl of Bangor, a former state League \n     president, sees the League as a training ground which gave \n     her background and information on local and state issues and \n     also provided her with confidence to run for office. ``I met \n     elected officials and discovered they weren't all that \n     different from the rest of us. Then when I read the Wisconsin \n     League's publication, See Jane Run, I knew it was meant for \n     me.'' Saxl served first on the local school board and later \n     on the Bangor City Council, before running for the state \n     legislature. ``My one claim to fame on the City Council, \n     curbside recycling was a direct result of my League \n     experience. Where else would I have studied subjects such as \n     waste management or water quality?''\n       On February 14, members of the League throughout Maine will \n     celebrate the national League's 75th birthday at the State \n     House in Augusta during the League's annual ``Keys to the \n     Capitol'' program. As Nancy Neuman, keynote speaker at the \n     celebration, has written, ``The purpose of the League is as \n     relevant today as it was in 1920. Making a success of \n     American democracy is a never-ending commitment, requiring \n     tenacity, patience, and a sense of humor.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n                 [From the Times Record, Jan. 27, 1995]\n\n          League of Women Voters, at 75, Is Still Going Strong\n\n                         (By Julia D. Stevens)\n\n       On Feb. 14, 1995, the League of Women Voters of the United \n     States and of the state of Maine will celebrate 75 years of \n     promoting the active informed participation of citizens in \n     government.\n       Although the League was not officially founded until \n     February 1920, on the eve of final ratification of the 19th \n     Amendment to the Constitution giving women the right to vote, \n     its roots had begun almost 75 years earlier. In 1848 the \n     first national convention for women was held in Seneca Falls, \n     N.Y., to discuss the social, civil, religious conditions and \n     rights of women. The women at this meeting decided to fight \n     for the right to vote, but it was not until 1890 that the \n     National American Woman Suffrage Association was formed. In \n     1920, this organization became the League of Women Voters.\n\n\n                           mighty experiment\n\n       Carrie Chapman Catt, the League's founder, designed the \n     League to be ``a mighty political experiment''--``an anomaly, \n     we will be a semi-political body--we want political things; \n     we want legislation; we are going to educate for citizenship \n     . . . we have got to be nonpartisan and all-partisan.''\n       Seventy-five years later, the League is still an anomaly in \n     American politics. It is non-partisan and political. It \n     educates and advocates. Its members are feminist, but the \n     League describes itself as a citizens' organization. It \n     trains women and men leaders, but it cannot support them if \n     they run for public office.\n\n\n                            social reformers\n\n       The founders of the League were social reformers, concerned \n     with protecting the rights of working-class women and \n     advancing the status of women in American society. The first \n     League program included: protecting women factory workers \n     against sweatshop conditions; promoting pay based on \n     occupation, not gender; maternal health and child welfare; \n     independent citizenship and equal property rights for married \n     women; uniform marriage and divorce laws; jury service for \n     women; election law reform; a Women's Bureau in the \n     Department of Labor; pure food laws; prevention of venereal \n     disease; a merit system at all levels of government, and \n     compulsory education.\n                     [[Page S2642]] voter education\n\n       Voter education has always been a central focus of the \n     League. Before every election, the League provides voters \n     with nonpartisan information about candidates and issues. In \n     its early days, citizenship schools to study basic principles \n     of government were conducted across the country, and women \n     voters were instructed how to register and vote. Nonpartisan \n     voters guides were distributed and many state and local \n     Leagues held candidates meetings. In 1923, ``Know Your Town'' \n     questionnaires were developed to help new Leagues study \n     conditions in their own communities.\n       Nonpartisanship, consensus on issues, and concerted \n     advocacy are central to the League's philosophy. The League \n     thoroughly researches and studies issues before it arrives at \n     a public position. After weighing the pros and cons of policy \n     choices, League members discuss areas of agreement and \n     disagreement, eventually arriving at a consensus.\n                            changing issues\n\n       During World War II the League educated the public about \n     the importance of American democracy and was a vocal advocate \n     for the formation of the United Nations.\n       The 1950s were years of growth in membership--by 1958, the \n     League had 128,000 members. The League was active in water \n     resources issues and through its ``Freedom Agenda'' took a \n     visible leading role in opposing McCarthyism.\n       In the 1960s, the League was involved in apportionment, air \n     and water pollution control, equal access to education, \n     employment and education, civil rights and the women's \n     movement.\n       During the 1970s, the League was active in issues such as \n     campaign finance, voting rights, international trade, land \n     use, solid waste, urban policies and presidential debates. In \n     1974 the League admitted men as full voting members. \n     Membership peaked in 1974 at 177,838 members, with 1,340 \n     local and 50 state Leagues.\n       The 1980s were years of involvement in social and \n     environmental issues, fiscal policy, arms control, \n     reproductive choice and agriculture. In the 1990s the League \n     has established positions on health care and gun control, and \n     has been instrumental in the passage of ``motor voter'' \n     legislation.\n\n\n                           middle of the road\n\n       Within the American political system, the League is a \n     moderate organization: It has been attacked by the left as \n     too conservative, by the right as too liberal. Maud Wood \n     Park, the League's first president (1920-24) noted that the \n     League: ``has chosen to be a middle-of-the-road organization \n     in which persons of widely differing political views might \n     work out together a program of definite advance on which they \n     could agree. . . . It has held to the belief that no problem \n     of democracy is really solved until it is solved for the \n     average citizen.''\n       For 75 years the League has prodded the nation to fulfill \n     its promises. Making a success of American democracy is a \n     never-ending commitment, requiring tenacity, patience and a \n     sense of humor. In the next 75 years, the League intends to \n     continue its efforts to educate and motivate citizens. The \n     League plans to further diversify its membership, programs \n     and approaches to better meet the needs of U.S. citizens. The \n     League welcomes any citizen over 18 years of age to become a \n     member, either as active participants or as supporters.\n       The League's 75th birthday party will take place on Feb. 14 \n     at the State House in Augusta during the League's annual \n     ``Keys To The Capitol'' program.\n           the 75th anniversary of the league of women voters\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the League of Women \nVoters which is celebrating its 75th anniversary today. On February 14, \n1920, in anticipation of the ratification of the 19th amendment \ngranting women the right to vote, this group was formed to educate \nthese new voters about politics. By encouraging informed and active \nparticipation in government, this organization continues to play an \nimportant role in American politics. The league deserves both thanks \nand recognition for its efforts.\n  The fight for women's suffrage is a part of our history that, in my \nopinion, doe not receive enough attention today. We would all do well \nto reflect on the incredible courage and strength the women of that era \ndemonstrated in their quest for the right to vote. The battle for \nwomen's suffrage lasted generations, and many forget that women were \njailed and physically punished simply because they believed that women \nwere created equal to men. The suffragists hoped that by winning a say \nin their Nation's affairs, they could better the conditions of all \nAmericans. They were right, and the continued work of the League of \nWomen Voters is testament to that fact.\n  Carrie Chapman Catt, founder of the National Woman Suffrage \nAssociation, proposed ``a League of Women Voters, nonpartisan and \nnonsecretarial, to finish the fight and aid in the reconstruction of \nthe nation.'' By encouraging the participation of all citizens in \ngovernment, the league has adhered to that charge, and remains a \npowerful force for productive change.\n  Today, the league is composed of both men and women who work together \nto strengthen the democratic process and to seek positive solutions to \nthe problems of our time. Their efforts to increase citizen \nparticipation and educate voters exemplify the spirit that makes \nAmerican government unique in the world. Eleanor Roosevelt, one of the \nleague's more famous members, once said: ``Life was meant to be lived, \nand curiosity must be kept alive. One must never, for whatever reason, \nturn his back on life.'' These words accurately describe the league's \nongoing activities. On issues ranging from agriculture to arms control, \nthe league has been a tireless voice, and it continues to influence the \ncourse of our Nation.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the members of \nthe League of Women Voters in my home State of Connecticut. Their work \nis indicative of the broad range of activities the league is now \ninvolved in nationwide. In addition to the many local voter education \nprojects, Connecticut members have been extremely active working behind \nthe scenes to gain passage of numerous pieces of crucial State \nlegislation. They have also participated in several recent \ninternational fellowship programs. This past summer, the Connecticut \nLeague of Women Voters hosted two Hungarian fellows in the interest of \npromoting the exchange of democratic ideas worldwide. It is this type \nof information exchange that embodies the work league members have \naccomplished during the past 75 years.\n  Through its efforts, the League of Women Voters demonstrates that \npolitics need not be partisan, and that increased participation in a \ndemocracy is always a change for the better. I congratulate and commend \nall members, both past and present, who have worked on these efforts. \nWe should all take time to reflect upon the womens' suffrage movement \nthat brought the league into existence and the vital work this \norganization continues to do today.\n           the 75th anniversary of the league of women voters\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to congratulate \nthe League of Women Voters as it turns 75 years old today. Many \ncongratulations are certainly in order for this outstanding \norganization that has done so much over the decades as ``a voice of \ncitizens and a force for change.''\n  The League of Women Voters is a nonpartisan political group which \nencourage the informed and active participation of citizens in \ngovernment, works to increase understanding of public policy issues, \nand influences policy through education and advocacy. Every American \nhas benefited from the league's many contributions at the local, State, \nand national levels of government during its 75 years.\n  In 1976, the league sponsored the first Presidential debates since \nthose famous ones in 1960. This capped a nationwide petition drive to \nhave candidates for Nation's highest office ``Meet in public debate on \nthe issues facing the country.'' The league also sponsored debates \nduring the general election campaigns of 1980 and 1984, and during the \nprimaries of 1988 and 1992.\n  Most of us know the league through our local chapters, since it is \norganized in more than 1,000 communities, in all 50 States, the \nDistrict of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Its \neducation fund, founded in 1957, provides local and State leagues with \ninformation and educational services on elections and on current public \npolicy issues. It is renowned for its ability to make complex and \ncontroversial issues accessible to the average citizen in a clear and \nbalanced way.\n  There is no more important civic duty we have as Americans than \nexpressing ourselves through informed, consistent voting. I am proud to \ncommend and congratulate the League of Women Voters for helping to \nfoster that civic expression for 75 years.\n\n\n    commemorating the 75th anniversary of the league of women voters\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today we celebrate an important \norganization in the modern history of American politics. The League of \nWomen Voters, a \n [[Page S2643]] nonpartisan organization which encourages informed and \nactive participation in the political process, celebrates its 75th \nanniversary.\n  The League of Women Voters is open to all of American voters. The \nLeague of Women Voters is an established grassroots organization; \nencouraging and enabling individuals to become true participants in the \nimportant public policy and political debates of our time.\n  The League of Women Voters has an active presence in each of the 50 \nStates. In North Dakota, the League of Women Voters has had an active \npresence for the past 45 years. The North Dakota League of Women \nVoters' activities include preparing voters' guides which explain \nballot measures, helping communities draft governing documents, and \nsupporting bills before the State legislature. The North Dakota League \nof Women Voters is a valuable asset to my State.\n  Mr. President, I join my Senate colleagues and the American people in \ncongratulating the League of Women Voters on its remarkable \nachievements. I wish the League of Women Voters many years of continued \nsuccess.\n           the 75th anniversary of the league of women voters\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, 1995 is the 75th anniversary of the \npassage of the 19th amendment, which granted women the right to vote. \nThe year 1995 is also the 75th anniversary of the founding of the \nLeague of Women Voters. I want to commend the league for its efforts to \nencourage the informed and active participation of citizens in \ngovernment. I particularly want to recognize the activities of the \nLeague of Women Voters in New Mexico.\n  In 1924, 4 years after the formation of the national league, the New \nMexico League started its first chapter in Albuquerque. The league \nconcentrated upon informing citizens on legislation before the New \nMexico House and Senate. By 1949, three league chapters were active in \nAlbuquerque, Los Alamos, and Las Vegas, NM. By 1953, two more chapters \nhad been added in Las Cruces and Santa Fe, and members were being \nrecruited for chapters in Tucumcari and Gallup. As membership grew, \nlocal league chapters began to work on local and federal issues in \naddition to issues before the State legislature.\n  Today, before every general election, local leagues publish voters \nguides and hold candidate forums and debates. Between elections, the \nleague publishes Who's Who pamphlets listing the names of local elected \nofficials and holds seminars on issues important to New Mexicans. \nIssues including health care, transportation, and children and youth \nhave been the topics of recent seminars. These publications, forums, \nand seminars are valuable resources for citizens.\n  I would like to salute the New Mexico league for its untiring efforts \nto inform citizens about State, local, and national issues. I would \nlike to particularly recognize five members of the New Mexico league \nwho will be honored by our Governor Gary Johnson on February 24: Trula \nJohansson, Jessie Rudnick, Marjorie Burr, Barbara Bell, and Elizabeth \nPlatts. Trula Johansson joined the New Mexico league in 1948 and was \npresident of the Albuquerque/Bernalillo County chapter; Jessie Rudnick \nstarted a league-sponsored farmers market in Los Alamos; Marjorie Burr \nwas a founder of the Las Cruces chapter; Barbara Bell organized a \nmember-at-large league in Grants; Elizabeth Platts is past president of \nthe Santa Fe league. These five women are outstanding examples of the \ncontributions the league has made to New Mexico.\n  I also want to recognize the efforts of those who helped New Mexican \nwomen gain the right to vote. The New Mexico Federation of Women's \nClubs and the Congressional Union, an organization of suffragettes, \nwere instrumental in pressing the New Mexico State Legislature to \nratify the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Mr. President, I \nrequest that an article that better describes women's suffrage in New \nMexico be inserted into the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Mr. President, I salute those who worked to give women the right to \nvote. I salute the members of the New Mexico League of Women Voters and \nthe principles in which they believe and support. The league believes \nin representative government and in the individual liberties \nestablished in the Constitution of the United States, that democratic \nGovernment depends upon the informed and active participation of its \ncitizens, and that responsible government should be responsive to the \nwill of the people. The league's education and advocacy activities in \nsupport of these principles have served all New Mexicans well by \nhelping them better exercise their right to vote. On behalf of all New \nMexicans, I want to express my appreciation for the hard work and \ndedication of the members of the League of Women Voters.\n      [From The League of Women Voters of New Mexico, Winter 1995]\n\n                         Suffrage in New Mexico\n\n                (By Shelly Shepherd, President, LWV/ABC)\n\n       I recently spoke before the Federal Aviation Administration \n     for Women's Equality Day on the topic of Women's Suffrage in \n     New Mexico. I am particularly interested in this topic, as we \n     are approaching the 75th Anniversary of Passage of the 19th \n     Amendment and the 75th Anniversary of the National League of \n     Woman Voters of the United States.\n       I was surprised to find that little has been written about \n     the Women's Movement in New Mexico. I learned that most \n     people, including myself, have little or no knowledge about \n     the efforts that were made and who made them. Older accounts \n     of Women's Suffrage in the west omit New Mexico because it \n     was the only western state without Women's Suffrage by 1914. \n     I thought I'd share a few historic facts that I have \n     uncovered in my research.\n       The first organized pressure groups for Women's Suffrage in \n     New Mexico came during the Constitutional Convention of 1910. \n     Before 1900, Hispanic and Anglo support was insufficient to \n     make suffrage a real issue. In 1910, the National Women's \n     Suffrage Association (NAWSA) had only two subscribers to its \n     publication on suffrage. One name had ``dead'' scribbled \n     after it, and the other person was in a Silver City \n     sanatorium. This was hardly a suitable base for an active \n     women's movement.\n       Letter from Ada Morley to the Congressional Union reporting \n     on the campaign to have the New Mexico delegation support \n     passage of the Susan B. Anthony Women's Suffrage Amendment in \n     Congress, together with other letters in the National Women's \n     Party Papers in the Library of Congress, indicate the \n     existence of an active women's movement in New Mexico during \n     the early 20th Century.\n       During the first decade of the 20th Century, several \n     hundred New Mexico women organized into nine clubs in which \n     women could work together on civic, educational, and cultural \n     affairs. In 1909, women's clubs federated into a state \n     organization. In 1910, the president of the federated \n     organization presented a petition to delegates of the State \n     Constitutional Convention in support of women's suffrage. Of \n     three published memoirs, only two mention women's suffrage. \n     One says, ``Members compromised on women's sufrage'' while \n     the other notes, ``The very nature of New Mexico's background \n     was against giving women the voting privilege with men.''\n       The 1910 Constitution gave women the right to vote in \n     school district elections and made them eligible to hold \n     public office as superintendent, director, or member of a \n     local board of education. However, Article VII restricted the \n     right of women to vote for these officials if enough men \n     objected.\n       In addition, the constitutional compromise protected the \n     elective franchise of Hispanic males, through whatever \n     mechanism it might be achieved and `make it virtually \n     impossible to amend\n     the Constitution to give women the right to vote.'' To amend \n     the franchise provision, three quarters of the voters in each \n     county had to approve; and this made it exceedingly difficult \n     to achieve voting rights for women. Ada Morley wrote to the \n       Congressional Union, ``Federal action is our only hope.Amid \n     the celebrations of new statehood, a small group of women \n     were dissatisfied with their disenfranchisement. At first, \n     some of the club women worked through the National American \n     Women's Suffrage Association (NAWSA) which attempted to \n     expand its activities in New Mexico between 1912 and 1915. \n     Deane Lindsey, an active club woman and former teacher from \n     Portales, became State Chairman. NAWSA offered little \n     incentive for New Mexico to become politically active, \n     however, because it had begun to focus on suffrage \n     referendums that were inappropriate in New Mexico.\n       More important than NAWSA for fueling the engine of women's \n     discontent in New Mexico was the National Federation of \n     Women's Clubs (NFWC) with which the New Mexico Federation of \n     Women's Clubs (NMFWC) became affiliated in 1914.\n       When the Congressional Union sent their first organizer to \n     New Mexico in 1914, New Mexico club women were ready to act. \n     A splinter group under the leadership of Alice Paul that \n     separated from NAWSA in 1912, the Congressional Union (CU), \n     had adopted the militant and sophisticated pressure tactics \n     of the ``British Suffragettes,'' as the British called their \n     campaigners. The group of women that the CU pulled together \n     in New Mexico launched its first campaign in 1915, \n      [[Page S2644]] continued to mobilize during the war, and \n     remained the most active organization during the ratification \n     battle. Once the state network was set up, CU organizers \n     planned the type of pageant that the CU had made famous--a \n     mass meeting, a parade, and a deputation to Senators Thomas \n     Catron and Albert Fall.\n       The woman who rallied to the CU were not representative of \n     various regions of New Mexico, ethnic groups, or classes. \n     They were predominantly Anglo elite centered in Santa Fe, \n     Albuquerque, and other northern cities. An overwhelming \n     number of the members' husbands identified with the \n     Republican Party, the dominant party in the state at the \n     time.\n       Ella St. Clair Thompson, CU organizer in New Mexico in \n     1915, made efforts to recruit daughters of Hispanic \n     politicians. Thompson had leaflets printed in Spanish and \n     English. Although the CU records only mention six Hispanic \n     women as participants, these six were key players. Aurora \n     Lucero, daughter of the Secretary of State, joined, as did \n     three nieces of Solomon Luna, including 34 year old widow \n     Adelina Otero-Warren, who became the most influential woman \n     in the CU.\n       If any woman could be credited as being the ``Susan B. \n     Anthony of New Mexico,'' it would be Adelina Otero-Warren.\n       Beginning as a timid woman unwilling to speak in public, \n     Adelina gradually became a political force. Her uncle, \n     Solomon Luna, the powerful and popular head of the Republican \n     Party, had died in 1912; but her father was still active in \n     politics. And other Otero males were moving into positions in \n     the Republican Party. In 1917, Otero-Warren was appointed \n     school superintendent in Santa Fe, and in 1918 she defeated a \n     male opponent to retain this elective position. Otero-Warren \n     guided the last phase of the campaign to pry the amendment \n     out of Congress. She accepted leadership of the New Mexico CU \n     and was soon skillfully evaluating local tensions among \n     factions. She stated, ``I will keep out of local fuss but \n     will take a stand and a firm one whenever necessary.'' Otero-\n     Warren kept the group intact through the war and only \n     resigned from the CU to become chair of the Women's Division \n     of the Republican State Committee for New Mexico.\n       The women in the CU realized, after storming the office of \n     US Senator Catron (Senior congress Member) on the suffrage \n     matter, that he would not budge from his anti-suffrage \n     position. ``He thinks all we are good for is to stay home, \n     have children, have more children, cook and wash dishes,'' a \n     suffragette complained bitterly after Catron rebuffed one \n     delegation. Other U.S. Congressmen from New Mexico were \n     unwilling to openly endorse suffrage as long as Catron \n     opposed it.\n       Republican women moved into action by nominating another \n     candidate to Catron's seat. They were unsuccessful in urging \n     the Republican party to nominate pro-suffrage candidate Frank \n     Hubbel in 1916. That year, for the first time, parties in New \n     Mexico supported the suffrage amendment.\n       The CU maintained its bipartisan stand in the election of \n     1916, opposing Democrats who would not endorse suffrage and \n     refusing to campaign for Republicans. Both Hubbell and \n     Hernandez (Republicans) were defeated in the Wilson landslide \n     of 1916. The 1916 election placed two pro-suffrage Democrats \n     from New Mexico in Congress--William Walton and Andreius \n     Jones.\n       Senator Jones, who replaced Catron in Congress, moved into \n     the chair of the Senate Committee on Women's Suffrage. He \n     proved his support by visiting CU militants jailed for their \n     Washington protests.\n       When Senator Walton began to waiver on suffrage, Otero-\n     Warren turned up the political heat. This last minute \n     pressure steadied Walton so that he voted for the 19th \n     Amendment that passed the House of Representatives in \n     January, 1918. The Senate voted favorably in June, 1919.\n       With the federal amendment out of Congress, political focus \n     now shifted back to New Mexico where the Legislature had to \n     approve the amendment. Suffragettes were so confident that \n     the amendment would easily pass in the January, 1919 session \n     that the new head of the state CU, now calling itself the \n     National Women's Party (NWP), made the mistake of leaving for \n     California. Otero-Warren lobbied among the Hispanics, and the \n     amendment passed the House early. New Mexico was predicted to \n     be one of the first states to ratify the amendment. However, \n     in the Senate a Republican member sidetracked the\n      amendment by substituting a state referendum measure which, \n     as everyone knew, could not pass. This defeat bitterly \n     disappointed women and national suffrage leaders.\n       Women knew that the longer the ratification process took, \n     the more the opposition would organize against its passage. \n     Anti-suffragists began labeling those supporting suffrage as \n     disloyal and Bolshevik agents. Suffrage leaders were \n     compelled to spend time refuting claims of the ``anti's'' \n     that women would vote socialist once they were enfranchised \n     during this ``red scare'' period. The National Women's Party \n     was militant in its activism during the war, even picketing \n     the President. This distressed more moderate suffragists. The \n     two major suffrage groups thus became divided because the \n     leadership believed in different tactics.\n       Early in 1920 Arizona and Utah ratified after governors \n     from these states promised their support. Governor C.A. \n     Larrazolo of New Mexico promised the NAWSA and NWP leaders \n     passage of the amendment at a special session called for \n     February 16, 1920. If New Mexico ratified as the 32nd state, \n     only 4 more would be needed for passage of the 19th \n     Amendment.\n       Final victory in New Mexico resulted from coalition work by \n     NWP and Republican Women. Otero-Warren swung into action in \n     January, lining up Republican leaders behind the amendment. \n     Republican anti-suffragists hoped to convince Hispanics that \n     women's suffrage was against their interests and convince \n     them to vote it down. Anglo politicians could then blame \n     Hispanic males for the defeat of a law Anglos did not want \n     enacted.\n       Suffragist women packed the Senate galleries to hear the \n     final debate, and Republicans shifted support to the \n     amendment. On February 19, 1920, the Senate ratified the \n     amendment by a vote of 17 to 5. On the last day of the \n     struggle, February 19, 1920, after the Senate had ratified \n     and the House had balked at passing the amendment, Otero-\n     Warren spent three hours in a Republican caucus. Dan Padilla \n     withdrew his referendum proposal; Republican leader R.I. Baca \n     shifted to support the amendment; and the House ratified the \n     amendment 36 to 10. New Mexico became the 32nd state to \n     ratify.\n       Oklahoma, Washington, and West Virginia followed New \n     Mexico. The final battle was fought in Tennessee, where anti-\n     suffragists were accused of buying votes and instigating \n     opposition of every sort. On August 15, 1920, Tennessee \n     ratified! After almost a century of talk about suffrage and \n     more than a decade of campaigning in New Mexico, women had \n     the right to vote. We owe a great vote of thanks to Adelina \n     Otero-Warren and all those who worked with her for so many \n     years. I only hope that we can have this type of dedication \n     to work toward favorable resolution of issues which face the \n     League and our country both now and in the future.\n             the 75th anniversary of league of women voters\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am proud to join today with my colleagues in \ncelebrating the 75th anniversary of an organization that has focused on \nbringing women into the political system:\n  As people who are informed.\n  People who ask questions.\n  People who take an active role.\n  People who can make a difference.\n  People who would become U.S. Senators.\n  I believe that it is fair to say that the League of Women Voters, not \nalone, but with others, has served as the backbone, a sort of \ngrassroots engine moving women forward, not only as activists, but as \nleaders.\n  The league was founded in 1920 at the Chicago convention of the \nNational American Woman Suffrage Association, 6 months prior to passage \nof the 19th amendment granting women the right to vote. On the eve of \nits establishment, Carrie Chapman Catt, its founder said:\n\n       Winning the vote is only the opening wedge, but to learn to \n     use it is a bigger task.\n\n  And thus, for 75 years the league has been teaching its membership \nand all citizens how to use the power of the vote. The league fought to \nmake candidate debates part of campaigning for elective office.\n  At the national level, it has educated and engaged women in the \ndebate over foreign policy and organized the grassroots on domestic \nissues--the equal rights amendment, the Voting Rights Act, voter \nregistration reform, and campaign reform to name a few.\n  At the local level, the league has served to educate the electorate \nabout important public policy issues by sponsoring forums for candidate \ndebates, and providing guides to the issues on the ballot, and more.\n  In the February 1995, issue of ``Today's Voter'' a newsletter put out \nby the League of Women Voters of San Bernadino, CA, the organization's \npresident, Jan Green, said there are four kinds of bones:\n  She said, and I quote:\n\n       The body of a club or group is made of four kinds of bones: \n     the wishbones, who spend all their time wishing someone would \n     do all the work; the jawbones, who do all the talking but \n     very little else; the knucklebones who knock everything that \n     everybody else tries to do; and the backbones who get under \n     the load and do the work as they enjoy the fun of fellowship \n     that come with it.\n\n  These words were obviously prodding the membership of the \norganization toward greater participation in the work of the league. \nBut I believe that these words provide something even more for both \nelected officials and the electorate.\n  For elected officials, it is a call for quality representation. \nLeadership not filled with a lot of talk--political rhetoric on \npartisan bickering. It is a call for leadership that respects the \npolitical process, and the institutions that have served this country \nwell for over \n [[Page S2645]] 200 years and hopefully long in the future.\n  For the electorate, it is a call to greater engagement in the \npolitical process and the decisions that will shape our future. To go \nbeyond the surface of soundbites and look deeper to the heart of the \nissues. And most importantly, to vote on election day.\n  While the influence of the League of Women Voters in shaping the role \nof women in politics cannot be overstated, I believe their role in the \ncoming years will be equally as important, if not more important. \nImportant victories have been won for women, in terms of the number of \nelected officials at the national, State, and local levels, and in \nterms of the legislative victories that have resulted.\n  In this session, alone critical issues for women are on the table--\nresearch for women's health, reproductive choice, welfare reform, and \nequal opportunity to name a few. The role of the league becomes vital \nin preserving those gains, whether it be by energizing women voters on \nelection day or galvanizing their forces behind important issues on the \nlegislative agenda.\n  I want to thank the League of Women Voters for the valuable work it \nhas done for 75 years and for it continued work on issues important to \nwomen, in particular, and the electorate at-large.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\nthe 75th anniversary of the league of women voters of the united states\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today marks the 75th anniversary of the \nfounding of the League of Women Voters. It is with pleasure on this \nauspicious anniversary to salute this organization that has become an \nAmerican institution.\n  Founded in 1920, the League of Women Voters was born out of the \nwomen's suffrage movement, just 6 months before the 19th amendment \ngranted women the right to vote. During its 75-year history, the league \nhas made unparalleled contributions to the advancement of public policy \nand to groundbreaking legislation that changed the Nation.\n  Across the United States, the League of Women Voters has worked \ntirelessly to educate citizens about their rights and responsibilities, \nand to increase voter participation in the political process. \nInitiatives such as the public policy forums, candidate debates, voter \nguides and courses in the schools are just a few examples of the \ncontributions by the league to the best of the American political \ntradition.\n  Through its membership, the league has played an essential role in \npromoting the involvement of citizens at all levels of government. Its \nsuccess in mobilizing voters and improving the\n policymaking process is evident in the history of this Nation's most \nsignificant legislation. The Social Security Act, the Clean Air Act, \nand the National Voter Registration Act are examples of the league's \npolicy and legislative accomplishments.\n\n  In Massachusetts, the league has been a valuable and respected \npresence. The League of Women Voters of Massachusetts was founded in \n1920 as one of the first leagues in the country, and continues to have \nthe largest number of local league chapters in the United States.\n  The Massachusetts league has been vigorous in the achievement and \nprotection of basic advances in reproductive rights, gun control, \neducation, and civil rights. It has worked hard to prevent and treat \nchild abuse and neglect, and to combat domestic violence against women \nand children. It has also had a significant impact in the struggle to \npreserve and protect our environment, and has been an effective leader \non issues such as recycling and hazardous waste collection.\n  I commend the League of Women Voters for its success, and for its \noutstanding contributions to the Nation. It has been an honor to work \nwith the league over the years, and I look forward to working closely \nwith the league in the years ahead.\n           the 75th anniversary of the league of women voters\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today we celebrate 75 years of achievement \nby the League of Women Voters.\n  In the 75 years since women won the vote and the League of Women \nVoters was founded, the league has enabled millions of women and men to \ncast an informed vote through political education. The League of Women \nVoters in my home State of California, while excelling at that worthy \ngoal, also has been a leader in the effort to promote equality, involve \ncitizens in shaping their government, and build a better California for \nour children.\n  From filing a brief advocating a minimum wage in 1923, to producing \naward-winning environmental videos in the 1990's, the League of Women \nVoters of California has had a long and distinguished history.\n  In 1992, the League of Women Voters of California held their first \nconvention at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco, and 70 delegates \nattended. Today, the California league has over 70 chapters around the \nState and over 10,000 members.\n  In 1935, the league of California spoke out in support of \nunemployment insurance and they worked for tougher child labor laws in \n1942. In 1969, the league helped pass stronger water pollution laws, \nand then in 1976, they helped pass the Coastal Act Initiative to \nprotect California's coastline. In 1987, the league registered \nthousands of high school seniors to vote. In the 1990's, the league in \nCalifornia has spoken out and provided crucial information to voters on \nissues ranging from hazardous waste to reproductive choice.\n  Most important, the efforts of the League of Women Voters to ensure \nequality at the ballot box, in our schools, and in the workplace, have \nhelped open up opportunities for women to succeed at all levels of \nAmerican life. The league has inspired millions of women to learn the \nissues, get involved, and vote.\n  The past 75 years have been filed with both struggles and \naccomplishments. As I look back at the rich history of the League of \nWomen Voters, I can only hope that future generations of women will \nhave the league to educate them, inform them, and motivate them to \nbecome involved in their communities.\n           the 75th anniversary of the league of women voters\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this morning in honor of the 75th \nanniversary of the League of Women Voters of the United States.\n  Founded in 1920, out of the Women's suffrage movement, the leagues \nhas served 75 years educating voters about the most complex public \nissues of the day.\n  The league has an impressive history. It has a long tradition of \nproviding voters information--from the first national radio broadcast \nof a candidate forum in 1928, to its Emmy-Award-winning 1976 debates \nbetween former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford.\n  The league encourages citizen participation in the democratic \nprocess. The organization has educated and advocated on issues ranging \nfrom--passage of the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution giving \nwomen the right to vote--to the passage of the motor-voter law in the \nlast Congress.\n  And, the leagues doe not shy away from taking on the issues. For \nexample, in 1955, the league's president testified against Senator \nJoseph McCarthy's abuse of congressional investigative powers.\n  Organized in thousands of communities throughout the Nation, the \nleague emphasizes the need for government to be representative, \naccountable, and responsive.\n  Mr. President, the League of Women Voters is an excellent \norganization and I am proud to honor the league's 75th anniversary \ntoday.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2640-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2645-S2646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HALEYVILLE, AL, EMERGENCY 911 DAY\n\n  Mr. FORD.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the resolution (S. Res. 78) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n   [[Page S2646]] The resolution (S.

Res. 78\n\n       Whereas 27 years ago a new era of providing emergency \n     service was ushered in with the creation of the emergency 911 \n     service;\n       Whereas the first emergency 911 service in the United \n     States was developed by the independent Alabama Telephone \n     Company, a member of the Continental system;\n       Whereas the Alabama Telephone Company chose Haleyville, \n     Alabama, as the site of the first emergency 911 service in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas Haleyville, Alabama, became the birthplace of \n     emergency 911 service on Friday, February 16, 1968, when a \n     demonstration call was made from Alabama Representative \n     Rankin Fite of Hamilton, Alabama, at the Haleyville City \n     Hall, to United States Representative Tom Bevill of Jasper, \n     Alabama, at the Haleyville Police Department;\n       Whereas the historic first call began service that now \n     serves the entire United States and has saved thousands of \n     lives during the past 27 years; and\n       Whereas numerous men and women in the Haleyville area have \n     conscientiously answered thousands of emergency phone calls \n     during the past 27 years and have provided fast assistance as \n     well as needed assurance to victims of accidents, crime, and \n     illness: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the President is requested to issue a \n     proclamation designating February 16, 1995, as ``Haleyville, \n     Alabama, Emergency 911 Day'' and calling on the people of the \n     United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies \n     and activities.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2645-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          IS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? THE VOTERS HAVE SAID YES\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the incredibly enormous Federal debt is a \nlot like television's well-known energizer bunny--it keeps going and \ngoing--at the expense, of course, of the American taxpayer.\n  A lot of politicians talk a good game--when they are back home--about \nbringing Federal deficits and the Federal debt under control. But so \nmany of these same politicians regularly voted in support of bloated \nspending bills during the 103d Congress--which perhaps is a primary \nfactor in the new configuration of U.S. Senators.\n  This is a rather distressing fact as the 104th Congress gets down to \nbusiness. As of Monday, February 13, 1995, the Federal debt stood--down \nto the penny--at exactly $4,805,964,501,071.04 (or $18,243.52 per \nperson).\n  Mr. President, it is important that all of us monitor, closely and \nconstantly, the incredible cost of merely paying the interest on this \ndebt. Last year, the interest alone on the Federal debt totaled $190 \nbillion.\n  Mr. President, my hope is that the 104th Congress can and will bring \nunder control the outrageous spending that created this outrageous \ndebt. If the party now controlling both Houses of Congress, as a result \nof the November elections last year, does not do a better job of \ngetting a handle on this enormous debt, the American people are not \nlikely to overlook it in 1996.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2646-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

During this time, he was the architect of \nChicago's 1984 development plan, which became a national model for \nequity-oriented local municipal development. Mier's approach emphasized \njobs, neighborhoods, and equitable distribution of resources and \nopportunities as a means to combat urban crime and poverty. During his \nChicago tenure, Mr. Mier also spearheaded efforts to fight plant \nclosings, and he worked toward empowering neighborhoods to spur \ndevelopment.\n  [[Page S2647]] Mr. Mier joined the faculty of the University of \nIllinois in 1975, specializing in teaching and research on community \neconomic development, social policy planning and methods of \nimplementation. As founder of the University of Illinois' Center for \nUrban Economic Development, Mier prepared future generations in a \n``bottom up'' approach to dealing with the problems facing our cities. \nThe center continues today to provide technical assistance to \ncommunity-based development organizations and policy research on local \ndevelopment.\n  More recently, Mr. Mier focused on writing and teaching, while still \nremaining active in developing urban economic programs in Chicago, as \nwell as Los Angeles, Denver, and Belfast, Ireland.\n  Robert Mier's passing leaves a great void that will be felt not only \nby his family, friends, and colleagues, but by the world as well. His \nlife is a sterling example of an activist leader of an important cause, \nwhose insight and commitment will inspire generations to come.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2646-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS\n\n  The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and \nwere referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated:\n\n       POM-31.

A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to provide more \nflexibility to producers, and more effective mitigation, in connection \nwith the conversion of cropped wetland, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                      wetlands reform legislation\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in 1985, as part of the farm bill, \nCongress enacted landmark legislation to protect America's wetlands. \nThe swampbuster provision, as it is called, significantly reduced \nartificial incentives to drain agricultural wetlands.\n  In 1990, Congress reauthorized the farm bill. In the process, it \nevaluated problems that emerged from the implementation of the \nswampbuster provision and modified the law to meet those concerns.\n  It is now time for Congress to pass a new multiyear farm bill. Once \nagain, this exercise provides an opportunity to address legitimate \nproblems in wetlands policy.\n  Let me be clear. America's agricultural producers understand the need \nfor wetlands conservation. Farmers accept that agricultural wetlands \nprovide critical habitat for birds, animals and plants, and supply a \nmix of other benefits such as water storage, water purification and \naesthetics that often decline when wetlands are altered.\n  But farmers are also rightfully concerned about the arbitrary way in \nwhich certain wetlands regulations are enforced by the USDA. And so am \nI.\n  I've spoken with farmers all across South Dakota who are deeply \nfrustrated by the inflexibility of certain USDA wetlands regulations. \nI've heard horror stories about farmers who have been slapped with huge \nfines--ruinous fines--for unintentional and accidental violations of \nthe law.\n  I've looked into many of these claims and found the complaints to be \nlegitimate. Farmers have been penalized unfairly because of the \ninflexibility of agricultural wetlands policy. And some of the problems \nare a result of a lack of agreement between various Federal agencies \nregarding the intent of the swampbuster legislation.\n  The vast majority of farmers are doing everything they know how to \npreserve wetlands. They understand it is in their interest to do so. \nBut no one can comply with regulations if they cannot understand them, \nor if the agencies responsible for enforcing them can't agree on \npolicy.\n  The bill we are introducing today establishes a simpler, more \nflexible agricultural wetlands policy. It provides a reasonable, \ncommonsense approach to real problems that farmers face while at the \nsame time protecting our Nation's precious wetlands.\n  Our legislation addresses three major problems. First, it simplifies \nthe rules under which farmers may mitigate wetlands.\n  Second, it reforms the penalty system to distinguish between \ninadvertent or accidental damage and willful destruction of wetlands.\n  And third, it provides farmers who voluntarily agree to conserve \nwetlands with a fair return from their land.\n  Under the current law, farmers are allowed to move and replace an \nexisting wetland, but only if they agree to restore a wetland that had \nbeen drained prior to December 31, 1985. This process is called \nmitigation.\n  The new law extends this option to agricultural wetlands that are \nfrequently farmed but were not drained before 1985. It will add \nflexibility for producers by giving them another option to choose from \nwhile still protecting valuable wetlands.\n  That's the first section of this bill.\n  The bill also makes a distinction between accidental and willful harm \nto wetlands. As many of you know, the penalties for wetlands \nviolations--even minor violations--sometimes are so harsh that they can \nliterally force farmers out of business. I spoke with one South Dakota \nfarmer, for instance, who was going to be fined $97,000 because someone \nelse had driven a tractor through a wetlands area on his farm without \nhis knowledge or consent. The tractor had caused deep ruts and altered \nthe condition of the wetland.\n  Fortunately, the USDA agreed to reduce the fine if the farmer \nrestored the property to its original condition. However, he still had \nto pay a fine of $2,000 for a violation he did not commit.\n  This bill reduces the penalty for first-time violations if--and only \nif--the producer acted in good faith. Instead of being subjected to \nhuge fines, the farmer would be required to restore the wetland to its \nformer condition. The proposal would still deal firmly with repeat \nviolators by subjecting them to graduated fines up to $10,000. And \nthose who willfully destroy wetlands would face repayment of program \nbenefits and expulsion from future farm programs.\n  Finally, this legislation gives farmers who voluntarily retire some \nof their acreage a fair return for their land by permitting them to \nenroll wetlands in the Federal Conservation Reserve Program. Farming is \nrisky business that often operates on narrow profit margins. Farmers \ncannot afford to retire productive acreage without receiving some \ncompensation.\n  Mr. President, our proposal is based on the original intent of the \nSwampbuster legislation, which was to encourage producers to do the \nright thing, not to drive them out of business. We can protect \nAmerica's fragile wetlands without ruining producers financially or \npunishing them unjustly. The key is sensible, flexible regulations that \nmotivate, rather than discourage, compliance. This legislation meets \nthat test, and I hope that the appropriate congressional committees \nwill give it timely and serious consideration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 399\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for appropriate remedies for prison \nconditions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   the stop turning out prisoners act\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.\n   Mr. President, I have introduced a bill today called the STOP Act. \nThe purpose of the STOP Act is to keep our Federal courts from taking \nover State prisons. Many States today are operating at over 100 percent \ncapacity. In my State of Texas, however, the Federal courts have ruled \nin the Ruiz case that on any given day 6,100 beds, 14 percent of total \nspace available in Texas, are vacant. This Ruiz settlement has forced \nmany of our State prisons to maintain a permanent vacancy rate of 11 \npercent.\n\n  What has happened, Mr. President, is that there has been release of \nviolent criminals early. They are serving an average of 2 months for \nevery year of their sentence in my State to comply with a ruling that \nis patently unreasonable.\n  This is actually a compromise. This bill will curb the ability of \nFederal courts to take over the policy decisions of State prisons, \nparticularly when they do not have any responsibility to pay for these \nadded costs. A massive construction program in Texas that will be \ncompleted within the next year will give the State of Texas an official \nprison capacity of 146,000. But if we could eliminate the effect of \nthis case, we could add 6,000 more people who would serve their \nsentences and would not be going out on the streets of Texas murdering, \nraping, and injuring the people of my State.\n  In fact, Mr. President, I have to say that one of my friends from \ncollege, a wonderful person, was murdered by one of these early-release \nprisoners. It was a stunning thing to happen. Unfortunately, that was \nnot the only time it has happened in my State.\n  Our present system today is operating and constructing prisons with a \nbudget of $3.75 billion and is expected to grow to $4.4 billion for the \nnext 2-year period beginning September 1 of this year. What we are \ngoing to try to do with this bill is pare back the ability of Federal \njudges to substitute their judgment for that of State governments who \nare required to keep the people safe and also, of course, to keep the \nprisoners in prison. It is their job to pay for it; it is their job to \nimplement criminal law in their States.\n  The bill will set out the right for prisoners to live as comfortably \nas possible. But that will not be more important than the right of the \nvictims, the right of the people to live safely in their neighborhoods. \nIt is a matter of prioritizing what the rights are.\n  I think it is very important that we speak to this issue, and I am \nvery proud that the House of Representatives has already done so. \nCongressman Bill Archer sponsored this bill in the House and has put it \non as an amendment to a bill that will be coming to the Senate shortly. \nI think it is important that I have introduced the bill today, because \nwhat has happened in my State is so stark and we are spending billions \non prisons because of this onerous decision which was not appealed. I \nhad urged that it be appealed but it was not. So we are building these \nextra prisons because of a ruling that I think could have been appealed \nand would have been overturned at the appellate level. It will give \nstanding to local officials and State government officials to step in \non a case when they think that the Federal courts have gotten out of \nline.\n  We need relief and many other States in this country need relief. \nAfter all, the Federal prisons are operating at approximately 160 \npercent of capacity. Yet, in my State, it is lower than 90 percent \ncapacity. We certainly need those extra beds. What has happened is, of \ncourse, our counties are burgeoning with prisoners that they cannot \nsend up to the State prison system because there is no space under this \nonerous ruling. So I have introduced this bill today. I hope we can get \nswift enactment and, most especially, I hope if the bill comes over \nfrom the House, that we will be able to make sure that is also in the \nSenate bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 401. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe excise tax treatment of hard apple cider; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n               hard apple cider tax treatment legislation\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing tax legislation \ndesigned to stimulate the apply industry in the United States. I am \npleased that my friend from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, is joining me as \nan original cosponsor of this bill.\n  In recent years, hard apple cider or apple cider with an alcohol \nlevel at or below 7 percent has emerged as a popular alternative to \nbeer. Current tax law, however, unfairly taxes hard apple cider at a \nmuch higher rate than beer despite the two beverages similar alcohol \nlevels. The bill I am introducing today will correct this inequity.\n  Present law taxes hard apple cider regardless of its alcohol level as \na wine, subject to a tax of $1.07 per wine gallon. My legislation would \nclarify that hard apple cider containing not more than a 7-percent \nalcohol level be taxed as beer, subject to a tax of approximately 22.6 \ncents per gallon. The legislation would continue taxing small domestic \nproducers of hard apple cider at a reduced rate.\n  I believe this small tax change would allow hard apple cider \nproducers to compete fairly with beermakers. As hard apple cider grows \nin popularity, applegrowers and processors across the country should \nprosper because hard apple cider is made from culled apples, the least \nmarketable apples. I have received letters from the Vermont Department \nof Agriculture, the New Hampshire Department of Agriculture, the Maine \nDepartment of Agriculture, and the New York Apple Association in \nsupport of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 401\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CLARIFICATION OF TAX TREATMENT OF HARD APPLE \n                   CIDER.\n\n       (a) Hard Apple Cider Containing Not More Than 7 Percent \n     Alcohol Taxed as Beer.--Subsection (a) of section 5052 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to definitions) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(a) Beer.--For purposes of this chapter (except when used \n     with reference to distilling or distilling material)--\n       ``(1) In general.--The term `beer' means beer, ale, porter, \n     stout, and other similar fermented beverages (including sake \n     or similar products) of any name or description containing \n     one-half of 1 percent or more of alcohol by volume brewed or \n     produced from malt, wholly or in part, or from any substitute \n     therefor.\n       [[Page S2650]] ``(2) Hard apple cider.--The term `beer' \n     includes a beverage--\n       ``(A) derived wholly (except for sugar, water, or added \n     alcohol) from apples containing at least one-half of 1 \n     percent and not more than 7 percent of alcohol by volume, and\n       ``(B) produced by a person who produces more than 100,000 \n     wine gallons of such beverage during the calendar year.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Subsection (a) of section 5041 \n     of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to imposition \n     and rate of tax) is amended by striking ``wine)'' and \n     inserting ``wine, but not including hard apple cider \n     described in section 5052(a)(2))''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply on and after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 402. A bill to provide for the appointment of one additional \nFederal district judge for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              the wisconsin federal judgeship act of 1995\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I introduce the Wisconsin Federal \nJudgeship Act of 1995, which would create an additional Federal \njudgeship for the Eastern District of Wisconsin and situate it in Green \nBay, where a district court is crucially needed. Let me explain how the \ncurrent system hurts--and how this additional judgeship will help--\nbusinesses, law enforcement agents, witnesses, victims, and individual \nlitigants in northeastern Wisconsin.\n  The four full-time district court judges for the Eastern District of \nWisconsin currently preside in Milwaukee. Yet for most litigants and \nwitnesses in northeastern Wisconsin, Milwaukee is well over 100 miles \naway. Thus, litigants and witnesses must incur substantial costs in \ntraveling from northern Wisconsin to Milwaukee--costs in terms of time, \nmoney, resources, and effort. Indeed, driving from Green Bay to \nMilwaukee takes nearly 2 hours each way. Add inclement weather or a \ndeparture point north of Green Bay--such as Oconto or Marinette--and \nthe driving time alone often results in witnesses traveling for a far \nlonger period of time than they actually spend testifying.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, as is the case all across America, Federal \ncrimes are on the rise in northeastern Wisconsin. These crimes range \nfrom bank robbery and kidnapping to Medicare and Medicaid fraud. The \ntrials for these crimes are held in Milwaukee, requiring victims and \nwitnesses to travel a substantial amount of time, and passing on to the \ntaxpayers the expenses for transportation, board, and housing.\n  Mr. President, many manufacturing and retail companies are located in \nnortheastern Wisconsin. These companies often require a Federal court \nto litigate complex price-fixing, contract, and liability disputes with \nout-of-State businesses. But the sad truth is that many of these cases \nare never filed--precisely because the northern part of the State lacks \na Federal court.\n  Prosecuting cases on the Menominee Indian Reservation causes specific \nproblems that alone justify a Federal judge in Green Bay. Under current \nlaw, the Federal Government is required to prosecute all felonies \ncommitted by Indians that occur on the Menominee Reservation. The \nreservation's distance from the Federal prosecutors and courts--more \nthan 150 miles--makes these prosecutions problematic. And because the \nJustice Department compensates attorneys, investigators, and sometimes \nwitnesses for travel expenses, the existing system costs all of us.\n  Mr. President, the creation of an additional judgeship in the Eastern \nDistrict of Wisconsin is clearly justified on the basis of caseload. In \n1994 the Judicial Conference, the administrative and statistical arm of \nthe Federal judiciary, recommended the creation of additional Federal \njudgeships in 16 different judicial districts. In determining where to \nplace these judges, the Conference looked primarily at ``weighted \nfilings,'' that is, the total number of cases filed per judge modified \nby the average level of case complexity. In 1994, new positions were \njustified where a district's workload exceeded 430 weighted filings per \njudge. On this basis, the Eastern District of Wisconsin clearly merits \nan additional judgeship: it tallied more than 435 weighted filings in \n1993 and averaged 434 weighted filings per judge between 1991-93. In \nfact, though our bill would not add an additional judge in the Western \nDistrict of Wisconsin, we could make a strong case for doing so because \nthe average weighted filings per judge in the Western District was \nalmost as high as in the Eastern District.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is simple, effective, and \nstraightforward. It creates an additional judgeship for the Eastern \nDistrict, requires that one judge hold court in Green Bay, and gives \nthe Chief Judge of the Eastern District the flexibility to designate \nwhich judge holds court there. And this legislation would increase the \nnumber of Federal district judges in Wisconsin for the first time since \n1978. During that period, more than 252 new Federal district judgeships \nhave been created nationwide, but not a single one in Wisconsin.\n  And don't take my word for it, Mr. President, ask the people who \nwould be most affected: each and every sheriff and District Attorney in \nnortheastern Wisconsin urged me to create a Federal district court in \nGreen Bay. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from these law \nenforcement officials be included in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks. I also ask unanimous consent that a letter from the U.S. \nAttorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, Tom Schneider, also be \nincluded. This letter expresses the support of the entire Federal law \nenforcement community in Wisconsin--including the FBI, the DEA, and the \nBATF--for the legislation I am introducing. Perhaps most importantly, \nthe people of Green Bay also agree on the need for an additional \nFederal judge, as the endorsement of my proposal by the Green Bay \nChamber of Commerce demonstrates.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, having a Federal judge in Green Bay \nwill reduce costs and inconvenience while increasing judicial \nefficiency. But most importantly, it will help ensure that justice is \nmore available and more affordable to the people of northeastern \nWisconsin. As the courts are currently arranged, the northern portion \nof the Eastern District is more remote from a Federal court than any \nother major population center, commercial or industrial, in the United \nStates. For these sensible reasons, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation and its House companion, H.R. 362, introduced by my \ngood friend Representative Toby Roth.\n  We hope to enact this measure, either separately or as part of an \nomnibus judgeship bill the Judiciary Committee may consider later this \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 402\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADDITIONAL FEDERAL DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN \n                   DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Wisconsin \n     Federal Judgeship Act of 1995''.\n       (b) In General.--The President shall appoint, by and with \n     the advice and consent of the Senate, 1 additional district \n     judge for the eastern district of Wisconsin.\n       (c) Tables.--In order that the table contained in section \n     133 of title 28, United States Code, shall reflect the change \n     in the total number of permanent district judgeships \n     authorized under subsection (a), such table is amended by \n     amending the item relating to Wisconsin to read as follows:\n\n``Wisconsin:\n    ``Eastern.........................................................5\n    ...................................................................\n    ``Western......................................................2''.\n\n       (d) Holding of Court.--The chief judge of the eastern \n     district of Wisconsin shall designate 1 judge who shall hold \n     court for such district in Green Bay, Wisconsin.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                   August 8, 1994.\n     Senator Herb Kohl,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: We are writing to urge your support for \n     the creation of a Federal District Court in Green Bay. The \n     Eastern District of Wisconsin includes the 28 eastern-most \n     counties from Forest and Florence Counties in the north to \n     Kenosha and Walworth Counties in the south.\n       Green Bay is central to the northern part of the district \n     which includes approximately one third of the district's \n     population. Currently, all Federal District Judges hold court \n     in Milwaukee.\n       [[Page S2651]] A federal court in Green Bay would make \n     federal proceedings much more accessible to the people of \n     northern Wisconsin and would alleviate many problems for \n     citizens and law enforcement. Travel time of 3 or 4 hours \n     each way makes it difficult and expensive for witnesses and \n     officers to go to court in Milwaukee. Citizen witnesses are \n     often reluctant to travel back and forth to Milwaukee. It \n     often takes a whole day of travel to come to court and \n     testify for a few minutes. Any lengthy testimony requires an \n     inconvenient and costly overnight stay in Milwaukee. Sending \n     officers is costly and takes substantial amounts of travel \n     time, thereby reducing the number of officers available on \n     the street. Many cases are simply never referred to federal \n     court because of this cost and inconvenience.\n       In some cases there is no alternative. For example, the \n     Federal government has the obligation to prosecute all felony \n     offenses committed by Indians on the Menominee Reservation. \n     Yet the Reservation's distance from the Federal Courts and \n     prosecutors in Milwaukee poses serious problems. Imagine the \n     District Attorney of Milwaukee being located in Keshena or \n     Green Bay or Marinette and trying to coordinate witness \n     interviews, case preparation, and testimony.\n       As local law enforcement officials, we try to work closely \n     with other local, state and federal agencies, and we believe \n     establishing a Federal District Court in Green Bay will \n     measurably enhance these efforts. Most important, a Federal \n     Court in Green Bay will make these courts substantially more \n     accessible to the citizens who live here.\n       We urge you to introduce and support legislation to create \n     and fund an additional Federal District Court in Green Bay.\n       Gary Robert Bruno, Shawano and Menominee County District \n     Attorney.\n       Jay Conley, Oconto County District Attorney.\n       John DesJardins, Outagamie County District Attorney.\n       Douglas Drexler, Florence County District Attorney.\n       Guy Dutcher, Waushara County District Attorney.\n       E.

You point \n     out a number of facts in your letter:\n       (1) Although \\1/3\\ of the population of the Eastern \n     District of Wisconsin is in the northern part of the \n     district, all of the Federal District Courts are located in \n     Milwaukee.\n       (2) A federal court in Green Bay would be more accessible \n     to the people of northern Wisconsin. It would substantially \n     reduce witness travel time and expenses, and it would make \n     federal court more accessible and less costly for local law \n     enforcement agencies.\n       (3) The federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over \n     most felonies committed on the Menominee Reservation, located \n     approximately 3 hours from Milwaukee. The distance to \n     Milwaukee is a particular problem for victims, witnesses, and \n     officers from the Reservation.\n       I have discussed this proposal with the chiefs of the \n     federal law enforcement agencies in the Eastern District of \n     Wisconsin, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \n     Federal Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, \n     Tobacco and Firearms, Secret Service, U.S. Marshal, U.S. \n     Customs Service, and Internal Revenue Service-Criminal \n     Investigation Division. All express support for such a court \n     and give additional reasons why it is needed.\n       Over the past several years, the FBI, DEA, and IRS have \n     initiated a substantial number of investigations in the \n     northern half of the district. In preparation for indictments \n     and trials, and when needed to testify before the Grand Jury \n     or in court, officers regularly travel to Milwaukee. Each \n     trip requires 4 to 6 hours of round trip travel per day, plus \n     the actual time in court. In other words, the agencies' \n     already scarce resources are severely taxed. Several federal \n     agencies report that many cases which are appropriate for \n     prosecution are simply not charged federally because local \n     law enforcement agencies do not have the resources to bring \n     these cases and officers back and forth to Milwaukee.\n       Nevertheless, there have been a substantial number of \n     successful federal investigations and prosecutions from the \n     Fox Valley area and other parts of the Northern District of \n     Wisconsin including major drug organizations, bank frauds, \n     tax cases, and weapons cases.\n       It is interesting to note that the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in \n     the Eastern District of Wisconsin holds hearings in Green \n     Bay, Manitowoc, and Oshkosh, all in the northern half of the \n     district. For the past four years approximately 29% of all \n     bankruptcy filings in the district were in these three \n     locations.\n       In addition, we continue to prosecute most felonies \n     committed on the Menominee Reservation. Yet, the \n     Reservation's distance from the federal courts in Milwaukee \n     poses serious problems. A federal court in Green Bay is \n     critically important in the federal government is to live up \n     to its moral and legal obligation to enforce the law on the \n     Reservation.\n       In summary, I appreciate and understand your concerns and I \n     join you in urging the creation of a Federal District Court \n     in Green Bay.\n                                              Thomas P. Schneider,\n             U.S. Attorney, Eastern District of Wisconsin.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. \n        Inouye, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 403. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \nthe organization and administration of the Readjustment Counseling \nService, to improve eligibility for readjustment counseling and related \ncounseling, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n\n\n       the readjustment counseling service amendments act of 1995\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, in behalf of myself and Senators Daschle, \nWellstone, Inouye, and Jeffords, I am today reintroducing legislation I \noffered in the last Congress that would make numerous improvements in \nthe organization, policies, and programs known as the vet center \nprogram. The Readjustment Counseling Service Amendments of 1995 is \nsimilar to legislation I introduced in the 103d Congress, S. 1226, the \nReadjustment Counseling Service Amendments of 1994, which the Senate \nunanimously approved last March. The bill I am introducing today is in \nfact identical to S. 1226 as reported by the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee on November 3, 1993.\n  As my colleagues know, vet centers are storefront, community-based \ncenters operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA] that, in an \ninformal, user-friendly environment, offer counseling services to \nreturned Vietnam-era veterans and post-Vietnam combat veterans. Since \nthe program was first authorized in 1979, it has grown from 87 \nfacilities to 202 today, operating in all 50 States. Together, these \ncenters have helped more than 1.1. million veterans successfully \nreadjust to civilian life, including 94,686 last year. In the process, \nthe vet center program has established leadership in such areas as \npost-traumatic stress disorder, homelessness, disaster assistance, \nsexual trauma, alcohol and substance abuse, suicide prevention, the \nphysically disabled, and minority veterans.\n  The Readjustment Counseling Service Amendments of 1995 attempts to \nensure that the program remains viable, relevant, and responsive to the \nneeds of today's veterans. It hopes to accomplish these goals by \nachieving two general aims. On the one hand, it would preserve that \nwhich is best in the vet \n [[Page S2652]] center program by codifying and improving its \norganizational structure and those administrative practices which have \nhitherto made the program uniquely effective. On the other hand, it \nwould enhance the ability of vet centers to undertake new challenges by \nexpanding eligibility to new categories of veterans and encouraging VA \nto explore the potential of vet center-based health care and benefits \nservices.\n  Specifically, my legislation would: Codify the current organizational \nstructure of RCS and require that funding for the program be \nspecifically identified in the budget; raise the director of RCS to the \nAssistant Chief Medical Director level; expand eligibility for Vet \nCenter services to all combat veterans, regardless of period of \nservice, and authorize services for all other veterans on a resource-\navailable basis; authorize bereavement counseling provided through vet \ncenters for the families of veterans who died in combat, and authorize \nsuch counseling to survivors of veterans who died of other service-\nrelated causes on a resource-available basis; establish a statutory \nAdvisory Committee on the Readjustment of Veterans; require VA to \ndevelop a plan to assign additional employment, training, and benefit \ncounselors at vet centers; require a report on the feasibility and \ndesirability of collocating vet centers and VA outpatient clinics; and, \nundertake a pilot program authorizing the provision of limited, primary \nhealth care services at veteran centers.\n  Mr. President, the provisions of my bill have been variously endorsed \nby the major veterans service organizations, RCS field staff, and the \nDepartment itself at hearings on S. 1226 conducted by the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee during the last Congress. Indeed, the full Senate \neffectively endorsed the provisions of the bill I am offering today \nwhen it passed S. 1226 early last year.

A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nprovide that a monthly insurance benefit thereunder shall be paid for \nthe month in which the recipient dies to the recipient's surviving \nspouse, subject to a reduction of 50 percent in the last monthly \npayment if the recipient dies during the first 15 days, to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             social security pro-rate amendment legislation\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto correct an inequity that exists in our Social Security system.\n  Currently, when a Social Security beneficiary dies, his or her last \nmonthly benefit check must be returned to the Social Security \nAdministration. This provision often causes problems for the surviving \nspouse because he or she is unable to financially subsidize the \nexpenses accrued by the late beneficiary in their last month of life.\n  Current law makes an inappropriate assumption that a beneficiary has \nnot incurred expenses during his or her last month of life. I know that \nmy colleagues have heard, as have I, from constituents who lost a \nhusband or wife toward the end of the month, received the Social \nSecurity check and spent all or part of it to pay the bills and then \nreceived a notice from Social Security that the check must be returned. \nFor many of these people, that check was the only income they had and \nthey are left struggling to find the money to pay back the Social \nSecurity Administration and pay the rest of the expenses their spouse \nincurred in their last month.\n  Therefore, my legislation would allow the spouse of the beneficiary \nwho dies in the first 15 days of the month to receive one half of his \nor her spouse's regular benefits, and the spouse of the beneficiary who \ndies in the latter half of the month to receive the full monthly \nbenefit.\n  I believe this is a fair and direct approach to an unfair situation. \nI hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 407. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction from gross income for home care and adult day and respite \ncare expenses of individual taxpayers with respect to a dependent of \nthe taxpayer who suffers from Alzheimer's disease or related organic \nbrain disorders; to the Committee on Finance.\n  S. 408. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax incentives relating to the closure, realignment, or downsizing of \nmilitary installations; to the Committee on Finance.\n  S. 409. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ndefense contractors a credit against income tax for 20 percent of the \ndefense conversion employee retraining expenses paid or incurred by the \ncontractors; to the Committee on Finance.\n  S. 410. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make the \ndependent care credit refundable, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                     defense conversion legislation\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I introduce a package of legislation \nthat will guide the Federal Government in a role that is becoming more \nand more important to communities across America--defense conversion. \nIn today's economic climate, the American people are demanding greater \naccountability for every dollar spent, so that even as we reduce \nspending we do so wisely, and in a way that does not compromise our \nNation's economic security. The legislation I will introduce today will \nhelp the Federal Government live up to its defense conversion \nresponsibilities by reassigning and consolidating coordination of our \nefforts to the Executive Office of the President; providing tax credits \nfor training and defense conversion efforts, and ensuring that economic \ndevelopment tools are available first to communities and industries \nhardest-hit by defense base closings.\n  With the end of the cold war and the disintegration of the Soviet \nmilitary threat to Western Europe, the new environment of international \nsecurity makes it possible to reduce the level of defense spending. I \nbelieve that any defense reductions must be made, however, in a careful \nand thoughtful manner because we must keep in mind the unrest in \nregions from Bosnia to Chechnya has threatened this fragile peace.\n  I believe that sound defense planning must be focused on the level of \nmilitary capability this Nation would need in wartime. While an austere \ndefense posture may seem adequate in peacetime, even a limited \ninternational crisis can upset these perceptions almost overnight.\n  It has been more than 5 years since the collapse of the Berlin Wall \nand the end of the cold war. The dramatic change in superpower \nrelations has permitted the United States to make significant cuts in \ndefense spending. That has led to a debate about how much to cut from \nthe defense budget, and along with many of my colleagues, I believe \nthat defense spending has been cut too much, too fast. Since 1987, the \nDefense Department's procurement budget has been cut by 47 percent. \nThis will be the 12th year in a row that inflation-adjusted defense \nspending has declined, and the first year that defense spending was \nexceeded by another area of America's budget, spending on entitlements \nand human services.\n  Even as we reduce the defense budget, however, the Federal Government \nstill has a responsibility to help the industries, communities, and \nindividuals adversely affected by these drastic cuts in defense\nspending and by the closure or major realignment of military \ninstallations across the country. The challenges of successful defense \nconversion are enormous. And as we address these enormous challenges, \nwe must provide the economic policies, tools, and incentives needed to \n  stimulate both the economy and defense conversion initiatives.My home \nState of Maine has endured a great deal of hardship brought on by cuts \nin defense spending. Defense-related enterprises in Maine span the \nspectrum of defense activities, ranging from the large Brunswick Naval \nAir Station and Kittery-Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, to smaller bases \nsuch as Cutler Naval Telecommunications Station and the Listening \nStation at Winter Harbor. Maine is also proud of the numerous large and \nsmall private companies that do business with the Pentagon. These range \nfrom the State's largest private employer--Bath Iron Works--to smaller \nfirms such as Saco Defense and Fiber Materials.\n  And we must not forget the hundreds of subcontractors and vendors \nthat do business with these bases and companies. It is these smaller \nfirms that are often overlooked when defense conversion is discussed. \nThe fact is that defense-related jobs reach into every county in my \nhome State of Maine. Every one of those jobs is important--military or \ncivilian, large company or small. And whether in Maine or across the \nNation, defense-related industries provide good jobs for hundreds of \nthousands of workers.\n  The closure of Loring Air Force Base this past September 30 \nexemplifies the defense conversion challenge facing Maine. Loring's \nclosing resulted in the loss of nearly 20 percent of the employment, 14 \npercent of the income, and about 17 percent of the population of \nAroostook County. At the other end of the State, Kittery-Portsmouth \nNaval Shipyard has seen its workforce cut almost in half since the fall \nof the Berlin Wall, from over 8,000 employees to just 4,100. And Bath \nIron Works has seen its employment drop from a peak of 12,000 to just \nunder 9,000 as a result of cuts in the defense budget. These stark \nnumbers graphically illustrate the importance of successful defense \nconversion to the long-term health of Maine's economy.\n  Successful defense conversion does not happen overnight, and this \nlegislation reflects that understanding. We \n [[Page S2655]] must also realize that successful defense conversion \ncannot be imposed from the top down by the Federal Government. Instead, \nthe Federal Government must work with industries and communities in \ncrafting defense conversion strategies and options that can help those \nsame industries and communities in their efforts to overcome the severe \neconomic consequences of defense downsizing.\n  The Department of Defense has always been the dominant government \nagency involved in defense conversion. Yet virtually every one of its \ndefense conversion programs were imposed upon it by either the \nPresident or the Congress, not designed by the Pentagon itself.\n  My legislation proposes to change this relationship, and consolidates \nresponsibility for most of the Federal Government's defense conversion \nactivities squarely where it belongs: within the Executive Office of \nthe President. Companion legislation that I am introducing today would \nalso, in effect, establish a defense conversion czar, a high-level \nexecutive official who is directly responsible to the President for the \nimplementation and coordination of this critical effort.\n  The simple fact of the matter is that of all the agencies within the \nFederal Government, the Defense Department is institutionally unsuited \nto direct such a crucial government venture. The central purpose of the \nDefense Department is to provide, equip and train the military forces \nneeded to ensure the security of the Nation, to deter war, and to fight \nand win wars if deterrence fails. These institutional goals run counter \nto the basic premise of defense conversion--to help people, \ncommunities, and industries become less dependent on defense spending.\n  A report issued last year by the General Accounting Office \nunderscored that the Pentagon and defense conversion are fundamentally \nmismatched. That GAO report cited an evaluation by the Defense \nDepartment's own Inspector General of the department's defense \nconversion programs. After closely examining one of those programs, the \ninspector general found that ``ineffective planning and oversight had \nresulted in implementation problems.''\n  Implementation problems. I don't believe that the working people of \nMaine who depend on wise defense conversion for their jobs and \nlivelihood will understand implementation problems. I don't believe \nthat the communities of Maine and America will tolerate implementation \nproblems. This is why we must consider the advice of the congressional \nmandated Defense Conversion Commission, which 3 years ago took a hard \nlook at the Federal Government's defense conversion efforts. Along with \nother Members of Congress whose State and districts have a big stake in \nthe success of defense conversion efforts, I appeared before the \nCommission, and closely followed its findings.\n  In its final report, the Commission made an even stronger case for \ndecreasing the influence of the Defense Department. The Commission \nnoted that:\n\n       While the Department of Defense has a large role to play, \n     overall direction for defense conversion and transition \n     actions must come from the Executive Office of the President.\n\n  I agree with the Commission's conclusion.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will consolidate America's \ndefense conversion efforts within the Executive Office of the \nPresident--a step that, based on this sort of unequivocal report, \nshould have been taken long ago. The thousands of Maine workers who \ndepend on defense-related industries for their livelihoods, the \nmillions of Americans who are watching our actions today, and indeed, \nall of our citizens need to know that the Federal Government will \nwisely consider conversion efforts. Americans should know that one \nindividual, reporting directly to the President, is responsible for the \neffective implementation and coordination of our overall defense \nconversion strategy.\n  I have long believed that tax credits can provide an excellent \nincentive to encourage economic development and growth. Two of the \nbills that I am introducing today utilize this concept. The first \nprovides tax credits to help give employers the inventive to hire \nworkers who have lost their jobs through either the closure of a \nmilitary installation or from reductions-in-force at a military \ninstallation. It will also provide those same tax credits to employers \nwho have hired laid off workers from a defense contractor or major \nsubcontractor. The second bill will provide tax credits to defense-\ndependent industries to invest in worker retraining and retooling in \norder to help them diversify into commercial markets.\n  Finally, the Economic Development Administration [EDA] within the \nDepartment of Commerce is actively involved in numerous successful \ndefense conversion efforts throughout the country. The legislation I am \nintroducing today amends the fiscal year 1991 Defense Authorization \nAct, which has served as the guidance for the EDA's defense conversion \nduties when utilizing funds authorized in defense bills.\n  Under current law, the EDA does not give any special preference to \ndefense conversion projects. This legislation specifically directs \nthat, when funds are authorized for use by the EDA through the Defense \nAuthorization Act, the EDA will ``ensure that [these] funds are \nreserved for communities identified as the most substantially and \nseriously affected by the closure or realignment of a military \ninstallation or the curtailment, completion, elimination, or \nrealignment of a major defense contract or subcontract.''\n  Mr. President, defense conversion ultimately boils down to another \nform of economic development--albeit one which affects the livelihoods \nof millions of Americans. Our mission is to ensure that the Federal \nGovernment makes successful defense conversion a reality. We must give \nour citizens the tools they need to literally turn swords into \nplowshares. While this will take a great deal of time and hard work, I \nbelieve that a partnership between private enterprise and government \nwill make it a reality. The legislation that I introduce today will \nhelp move that effort along. As I said on the Floor of the House in \n1991, our responsibilities to the American people do not end with the \nbase closure process. Instead, our responsibilities are only beginning.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this package of \nlegislation to ensure sound defense conversion policies into the \nfuture.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 411. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the treatment of long-term care insurance, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   the long-term care improvement act\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, long-term care means different \nthings to different people. It means home-health care for those who \nneed some help, but do not require round-the-clock care. It means \nrespite care so those families who are struggling to keep a loved one \nat home can have a short break and some time to themselves. And it \nmeans nursing home care for those in need of institutional services.\n  As we continue the debate on health care reform this year, it is \nimportant that we all remember that any major reform of our health care \nsystem will be incomplete if it does not address some of the problems \nfacing our long-term care system. I am introducing legislation today \nthat addresses four areas that are in need of change: setting standards \nfor private long-term care insurance; changing the tax code to make \ninsurance more affordable; providing respite care tax credits for \nfamily caregivers; and providing a tax credit to those who care for \nAlzheimer's victims at home.\n  Private insurance coverage for long-term nursing home care is very \nlimited with private insurance payments amounting to 1 percent of total \nspending for nursing home care in 1991. In 1986, approximately 30 \ninsurers were selling long-term care insurance policies of some type \nand an estimated 200,000 people were covered. As of December 1991, the \nHealth Insurance Association of America [HIAA] found that more than 2.4 \nmillion policies had been sold, with 135 insurers offering coverage.\n  HIAA estimates that the long-term care policies paid $80 a day for \nnursing home care and $40 a day for home health care; they had a \nlifetime 5 percent compounded inflation protection; a 20-day deductible \nperiod and a 4-year maximum coverage period. These policies had an \naverage annual premium in \n [[Page S2656]] December 1991 of $1,781 when purchased at the age of \n65, and $5,627 when purchased at the age of 79.\n  We need to make sure that these policies are not only affordable, but \nthat they deliver the benefits they promise. The National Association \nof Insurance Commissioners [NAIC] has produced standards for long-term \ncare policies which cover the spectrum of issues--from disclosure to \nclearly defining the benefits, cost and time period covered. The \nFederal Government should require that all States meet this standard in \nany long-term care policies sold in their States. My bill would put the \nNAIC standards into law.\n  There is general agreement that we need to change the tax code to \ntake away any disincentives to purchasing long-term care insurance. In \naddition, the change may encourage employers to offer long-term care \npolicies as an optional benefit, as they would be able to deduct the \ncost, too. This bill will treat private long-term care insurance \npolicies like accident and health insurance for tax purposes. It would \nalso define a dependent as any parent or grandparent of the taxpayer \nfor whom the taxpayer pays expenses for long-term care services. This \nchange will allow children and grandchildren to deduct the long-term \ncare expenses they pay. Current law requires that an individual must \npay 51 percent of the expenses for a dependent before they can be \ndeducted.\n  Over 80 percent of disabled elderly persons receive care from their \nfamily members, most of whom are their wives, daughters, or daughters-\nin-law. Family caregivers provide between 80 and 90 percent of the \nmedical care, household maintenance, transportation and shopping needed \nby older persons. Numerous studies have found that family caregivers \ngive up their jobs,\n have reduced their working hours or have rejected promotions in order \nto provide long-term care to loved ones.\n\n  My bill will expand the dependent care tax credit to make it \napplicable for respite care expenses and make the credit refundable. A \nrespite care credit would be allowed for up to $1,200 for one \nqualifying dependent and $2,400 for two qualifying dependents. This \nmoney could go, for example, toward hiring an attendant for an elderly \ndependent during the work day, or for admittance to an adult day care \ncenter. The credit for respite care expenses would be available \nregardless of the caregiver's employment status.\n  Such a respite care credit will save dollars for both caregiving \nfamilies and the Government by postponing, or even avoiding, expensive \ninstitutionalization.\n  Finally, this legislation will provide tax deductions from gross \nincome for individual taxpayers who maintain a household which includes \na dependent who has Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder. It would \nallow deductions of expenses, other than medical, which are related to \nthe home health care, adult day care and respite care of an Alzheimer's \nvictim.\n  In most cases of Alzheimer's disease, families will bear the brunt of \nthe responsibility of care. Many caregivers of dementia victims spend \nmore than 40 hours a week in direct personal care. These families are \ntrying to cope with the needs of a dependent older Alzheimer's victim \nwith little or no financial or professional help.\n  In the face of the continued and intense involvement of the family \ncaregiver, services that provide respite from the ongoing pressures of \ncare become essential in the caregivers' ability to support the \nAlzheimer's victim at home. Home health care, adult day care and long-\nterm respite care all provide opportunities to free caregivers from \ntheir caregiving responsibility and are crucial in enabling employed \ncaregivers to continue working. Most caregivers willingly provide care \nfor dependent and frail elderly family members. Even so, the presence \nof these supportive services can be a crucial factor in continued \ncaregiving activities.\n  It is important to provide some tax relief for those expenses related \nto their continued care in the home. Perhaps by such action we can \ndelay the institutionalization of dementia victims. Surely we can \nprovide some financial relief to their caregivers.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Cohen):\n  S. 412. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nmodify the bottled drinking water standards provisions, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                THE BOTTLED WATER STANDARDS ACT OF 1995\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today, I, along with Senator Cohen, \nam introducing legislation designed to make the regulatory process for \nbottled water more efficient and responsive, while expanding health \nprotections for the consuming public.\n  This bill, the Bottled Water Standards Act of 1995, requires the FDA \nto publish final regulations for a contaminant in bottled water no more \nthan 6 months after EPA has issued regulations for that same \ncontaminant in public drinking water. It may come as a surprise to some \nSenators that public drinking water and bottled water are regulated by \ndifferent agencies of the Federal Government. But in fact, the FDA has \nthe responsibility for ensuring the safety of bottled water, while EPA \nmaintains separate authority for regulating public drinking water \nsupplies.\n  Unfortunately, the FDA has not always been timely in issuing its \nregulations for bottled water after EPA publishes its standards for tap \nwater. On December 1, 1994, FDA published a final rule of 35 \ncontaminants in bottled water. Nearly 4 years earlier, however, in \nJanuary 1991, the EPA regulations for these contaminants have already \nbeen issued. In the interim period, bottled water producers and \nconsumers were left in limbo. Their product was subject to industry \nsafety standards and various State rules, but the Federal standards \nthat provide an important additional assurance for bottled water had \nnot been completed. This circumstance was very unfair to both producers \nand consumers of bottled water and we should not let it continue.\n  My bill will ensure a more expeditious response in the future. In \naddition to the 6-month deadline for new contaminants, the FDA will be \ngiven 1 year to issue final regulations for contaminants that the EPA \nalready regulates, but that have not yet received new FDA standards for \nbottled water. If the FDA fails to meet either the 6-month or 1-year \ndeadlines, the existing EPA standard is automatically implemented for \nbottled water.\n  In some cases, FDA may determine that a particular contaminant \nregulated by EPA does not occur in bottled water. My bill would allow \nthe FDA to simply issue such findings in the Federal Register before \nthe deadline periods expire.\n  The bill also stipulates that in all cases, the FDA standards for \nbottled water must be at least as stringent as the EPA's standards for \npublic drinking water. The bill does reserve the FDA's right to issue \nmore stringent standards, however, adding an extra measure of public \nhealth protection if necessary.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that this legislation will prompt the \nFDA to coordinate its regulatory activities for drinking water \ncontaminants with the EPA. The bill would therefore have the effect of \nimproving the efficiency of the Federal regulatory process--something \nall of us agree is necessary--while enhancing health protections for \nconsumers. It represents a clear win-win proposition for our \nconstituents.\n  The bottled water industry generates sales in the billions, and it \nserves millions of American consumers. Surely, these producers and \nconsumers alike deserve the kind of consideration from their Government \nthat my bill guarantees. Last year, Members in both the House and the \nSenate agreed with this commonsense approach. Language very similar to \nthat found in my bill was included in the House and Senate versions of \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act reauthorization bills considered last year, \nand it was included without controversy. I hope that the Bottled Water \nStandards Act of 1995 will enjoy similar support in the Senate this \nyear.\n Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nfrom Maine, Senator Snowe, today to introduce legislation that will \nhelp to ensure public safety and consumer confidence.\n  More and more Americans are drinking bottled water every day. \nCompanies \n [[Page S2657]] such as Poland Spring in Maine, have grown tremendously \nin recent years. Unfortunately, because of a jurisdictional quirk, all \ntoo common in our Federal Government, bottled water is not currently \nrequired to meet the same safety standards that we have placed on tap \nwater.\n  Tap water is regulated by the Environmental Protection \nAdministration, which sets rigorous and comprehensive standards to \nensure the safety of our Nation's drinking water. Bottled water is \nconsidered a food item and is therefore regulated by the Food and Drug \nAdministration. In carrying out its responsibility to regulate bottled \nwater, the FDA has failed, for whatever reason, to keep pace with EPA's \ndetailed tap water regulations. Consequently, tap water must meet \nhigher standards than bottled water.\n  I want to make it clear that the bottled water industry firmly \nbelieves that their product is as safe, if not safer than tap water. \nBut because bottled water is not required to meet tap water standards, \nthe industry cannot adequately defend itself against allegations about \nthe quality of bottled water.\n  In an effort to resolve this dispute, the legislation being \nintroduced today would simply require the FDA to publish regulations \nfor a specific contaminant in bottled water no more than 6 months after \nthe EPA has issued regulations for that same contaminant in tap water. \nIf that contaminant is not a risk for bottled water, then FDA must \nformally make such a determination. If the FDA fails to meet this 6 \nmonth deadline, the EPA regulations would then apply to both tap water \nand bottled water.\n  I believe this proposal is a very reasonable and workable solution to \nthis problem. I think both consumers and the bottled water industry, \nwhich welcomes this bill, would benefit from the changes this \nlegislation attempts to achieve. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues toward the passage of this bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Pell, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Simon, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 413. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nincrease the minimum wage rate under such act, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                 the working wage increase act of 1995\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, generations of Americans have been raised \nto believe that hard work is a virtue and that if you work hard, you \ncan get ahead and share in the American dream. But for many Americans \ntoday, putting in 40 hours per week will not ensure that they will be \nable to buy their own home or send their children to college.\n  In fact, for some workers, a full-time job doesn't even pay enough to \nkeep their families out of poverty.\n  Workers who earn the minimum wage have seen their standard of living \ndecline dramatically since the 1970's. Even with an adjustment for \ninflation, the minimum wage is now 27 percent lower than it was in \n1979.\n  Looked at another way, the minimum wage is at its second lowest level \nin four decades. And if it remains at $4.25 per hour, its buying power \nwill continue to erode.\n  As the value of the minimum wage has fallen, the number of working \nfamilies living in poverty has increased. I'm sure that many Americans \nwould be shocked to learn that more than 11 percent of families with \nchildren where the householder is employed have incomes below the \npoverty line.\n  That an individual could work 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year \nand still not provide for his or her children goes against our most \nbasic notices of fairness and equity.\n  This startling fact becomes even more important as the Nation turns \nits attention to the issue of welfare reform. Most Americans--Democrats \nand Republicans alike--feel strongly that we must break the cycle of \ndependency upon public assistance and require those who are able to \nwork.\n  But the simple truth is this. We can't encourage people to work if \nthe wages they earn will not even pay for their most basic needs and \nthe needs of their children.\n  So we must find a way to make work pay.\n  Raising the minimum wage is not the sole solution to this problem, \nbut it is a good first step.\n  And for the 36 percent of minimum-wage workers who are the sole \nbreadwinners in their families, it is a very meaningful first step.\n  The legislation I am introducing today with Senators Kennedy, Pell, \nDodd, Simon, Harkin, Mikulski, Wellstone, Leahy, Kerry, and Lautenberg \nwill help to restore the earning power of the minimum wage. Modeled on \nthe last increase in the minimum wage--which passed with overwhelming \nbipartisan support and was signed by President Bush--the bill calls for \na 45-cent increase in July, followed by a second 45-cent increase next \nyear.\n  This modest increase will not fully compensate for the erosion in the \nvalue of the minimum wage since the 1970's. However, when combined with \nthe 1993 expansion of the earned income tax credit, this increase will \nensure that minimum-wage workers and their families remain above the \npoverty level.\n  The American public understands that men and women should be paid a \nliving wage for their labor. In a poll conducted by the Wall Street \nJournal and NBC, 75 percent of those polled support an increase in the \nminimum wage.\n  Despite the broad public support for an increase, some Republican \nleaders have expressed their opposition, arguing that requiring \nbusinesses to pay higher wages will lead to overall job loss. However, \nrecent studies by some of the Nation's leading labor economists have \nconcluded that when the minimum wage is at a low level, a modest \nincrease will not effect employment negatively.\n  In 1992, for example, New Jersey raised its minimum wage by 80 cents \nper hour, from $4.25 to $5.05. Economists found no reduction in \nemployment opportunities as a result of this increase.\n  Paying workers a living wage is not a Democratic or Republican issue. \nIt is an issue of fairness and equity. It's my hope that Senators and \nRepresentatives on both sides of the aisle will join together to do \nwhat is right for low-wage workers.\n  I think a recent editorial in the Huron, SD, Plainsman said it best: \n``Taking home $5 per hour is hardly making a living. But those on the \nlower end of the pay scale * * * deserve at least that much.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 413\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Working Wage Increase Act of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE RATE.\n\n       Section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 206(a)(1)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(1) except as otherwise provided in this section, not \n     less than $4.25 an hour during the period ending July 3, \n     1995, not less than $4.70 an hour during the year beginning \n     July 4, 1995, and not less than $5.15 an hour after July 3, \n     1996;''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \nlegislation increasing the minimum wage because I see it as one of our \nbest tools to reform welfare by making work pay.\n  Nearly everyone recognizes the need to overhaul our welfare system to \nencourage work and responsibility. We must institute work requirements \nand provide job training to make work possible. But we must also take \nconcrete action to make work more attractive than public assistance.\n  The current minimum wage is simply inadequate. If you work full time \nfor $4.25 an hour, your annual income is only $8,500 a year. That is \nwell below $12,500, which is the poverty level for a family of three.\n  The minimum wage continues to lose ground as a percentage of average \nhourly wages--in fact, by next year the minimum wage will be at it \nlowest point since the Eisenhower administration. A recent survey in \nBaltimore found that 27 percent of the regulars at city soup kitchens \nand food pantries were working people with low-wage \n [[Page S2658]] jobs. It is clear that the minimum wage is not a living \nwage, and it's time for us to do something about it.\n  Many opponents claim that most minimum wage earners are middle-class \nhigh school students. That is simply not true. Two-thirds of the \nNation's 4.2 million minimum-wage workers are adults over the age 21. \nThe average minimum-wage earner brings home about half of his or her \nfamily's annual income.\n  Another claim frequently made by critics of the minimum wage is that \nit destroys entry-level jobs. This argument is repeated so frequently \nthat it has become a mantra, but recent economic analysis suggests it \ndoesn't hold up. Several recent economic studies have found that the \nlast two increases in the minimum wage had an negligible impact on \nemployment.\n  After surveying the literature on the subject, Harvard labor \neconomist Richard Freeman concludes that ``at the level of the minimum \nwage in the late 1980's, moderate legislated increases did not reduce \nemployment and were, if anything, associated with higher employment in \nsome locales.''\n  In the past, increasing the minimum wage has been a broadly \nbipartisan issue. In 1989, the vote to increase the wage was 382-37 in \nthe House and 89-8 in the Senate. The public has clearly spoken about \nthe issue. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that 75 percent of \nthe public supports increasing the minimum wage, while only 20 percent \noppose it.\n  I hope that we can put our partisan differences aside to provide \nmillions of hard-working Americans with a modest boost they very much \nneed and reduce welfare dependency at the same time.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Mr. Hatfield):\n  S. 414. A bill to amend the Export Administration Act of 1979 to \nextend indefinitely the current provisions governing the export of \ncertain domestically produced crude oil; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs\n\n\n           the alaska north slope oil export ban act of 1995\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom Oregon, Senator Hatfield, in reintroducing legislation that will \nextend indefinitely the restrictions on the export of Alaska North \nSlope crude oil. Twenty years ago, Congress passed legislation that \nenabled oil to be produced on the North Slope. That legislation \ninvolved a careful balancing of a variety of interests. Foremost was \nour national energy security. In the face of a heavy reliance on \nimported oil, Congress determined that any oil produced from the North \nSlope should be used by American consumers unless the President found \nand Congress agreed that it was in the national interest to export all \nor any portion of that oil. Of equal importance, Congress was deeply \nconcerned about the Alaska environmental impacts of North Slope oil \nproduction. Knowing that the Alaskan tundra and the wildlife would be \nendangered by oil pipeline construction and oil production, Congress \nsaw no sense in facing these risks for the sake of supplying oil to \nforeign nations.\n  By 1977, ANS crude was flowing through the Trans-Alaska pipeline \nsystem to the lower 48 States and Hawaii. From the pipeline's terminus \nat Valdez, AK, it moved by U.S.-flag Jones Act tankers to ports in the \nStates of Washington and California. In both of these States, \nrefineries were either built or modified to handle the surge of oil, \nwhich immediately reduced west coast reliance on imported crude. In \nOregon, as well as in California and Washington, shipyards expanded to \nhandle the construction and repair of more than 50 ships that carried \nANS crude. A pipeline was built across Panama to provide an efficient \nmeans of transporting ANS crude that could not be sold on the west \ncoast to gulf coast ports. Shipyards in the gulf benefitted from new \ntanker construction and repair business. The U.S. merchant marine was \nalso a beneficiary of ANS crude, with the creation of over 2,000 jobs \nand the maintenance of a U.S. flag tanker capacity that would not have \nexisted if ANS crude had been exported. This merchant marine capability \nnot only created jobs, it helped to bolster our national defense by \nproviding tankers flying the U.S.-flag that could be--and subsequently \nwere used--in times of national emergency. In the early years of ANS \ncrude production, west coast consumers enjoyed lower prices at the pump \nbecause of the abundant supply of Alaska oil. Above all, ANS crude \nreduced our reliance on imported oil and, together with a national \nenergy conservation effort, helped to prevent our reliance on imported \noil from being used against us as a foreign policy weapon.\n  Mr. President, we in the State of Washington are directly affected by \nthe congressional policy of restricting exports of Alaska oil. With ANS \ncrude exports, we would have an influx of large foreign-flag tankers \noffloading crude oil to smaller ships along our coast so our refineries \ncould be supplied with the oil we need. This offloading is an \nenvironmental hazard that we can ill afford. Thousands of jobs in \nrefineries and related industries have been created in our State, and \nmany Washingtonians perform ANS tanker repair work in the port of \nPortland.\n  In this Congress, as they have done many times in the past, my \ndistinguished colleagues from Alaska, Senators Stevens and Murkowski, \nhave proposed legislation that would eliminate the ANS export \nrestrictions. Their goal is understandable. Every barrel of ANS oil \nthat is exported increases that State's severance tax revenues. \nHowever, I remind my colleagues that the law says that exports should \nbe permitted only if they are in the national interest, not just the \ninterest of the State of Alaska.\n  Indeed, that question is an important one for the Senate to keep in \nmind as it considers this issue. Congress has also passed other laws \nthat place nearly identical national interest restrictions in the \nexport of all oil from any State, as well as from offshore areas and \nthe naval petroleum reserves. My distinguished colleagues from Alaska \nare asking for an exemption from a policy that applies to every other \nState where oil if produced.\n  At a time when our reliance on imported oil has reached a historic \nhigh, and when the Commerce Department has found that the level of oil \nimports poses a national security threat, Congress should not be \npermitting exports of ANS crude. Our energy security demands that the \nnational interest restrictions on exports remain in place. Equally \ncompelling is our need to protect the environment. Every barrel of \nAlaska oil that is exported must be replaced by a barrel of foreign oil \nthat will come to the United States on large foreign-flag tankers. That \nwould amount to a reckless endangerment of our coastal environment.\n  Aside from increasing the tax revenues of the State of Alaska, the \nprimary beneficiary of Alaska oil exports would be British Petroleum, \nthe largest producer of ANS crude. This foreign-owned oil company will \nbe able to reduce its oil transportation costs and, thus, increase its \nprofits. None of us should be lulled into the false belief that British \nPetroleum's increased profits would mean increased production in \nAlaska. The North Slope fields are producing at their maximum level \ntoday. They are now old fields whose production has inevitably gone \ninto decline, but continue to produce 25 percent of our Nation's oil.\n  Nor will taking ANS crude from its west coast markets increase \nCalifornia oil production. The refineries that process Alaska oil can't \nhandle the additional volumes of heavy grade of oil produced in \nCalifornia. They will replace any lost Alaska oil with foreign oil. In \naddition, Alaska oil sells on both the west and gulf coasts at world \nprice levels. The only price impact of exports would be to permit \nBritish Petroleum to gain the power to set higher prices for the \nsmaller amounts of ANS crude that would remain available to the west \ncoast. If that price is passed through, it will harm consumers. The \nintegrated oil company refineries--including those who are able to use \nsupplies of oil they produce in Alaska--will be able to absorb any \nprice increase. However, west coast independent refiners are in a poor \nposition to absorb increases in the price of their crude oil stocks \nbecause their profit margins will not permit it. In addition, these \nindependents do not have the docking facilities to handle large \nforeign-flag ships, nor do they have the storage tanks to handle \nsupplies of this \n [[Page S2659]] size. Inevitably, ANS exports\n will endanger the continued existence of independent refineries and \nthe thousands of men and women who depend on these refineries for their \nlivelihood.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, there is the issue of ships. The fleet that \ncarries Alaska oil is aging. Within the past few days, the U.S. Coast \nGuard has launched an investigation to determine if existing regulation \nof these tankers is adequate. Their action comes on the heels of the \ndiscovery of four structural failures in ships that carry ANS crude to \nthe west coast ports within the past month alone. Congress has already \ndealt with the issue of tanker safety in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, \nwhich requires the gradual phase-in over the next few years of new, \ndouble-hulled tankers that will present far less danger to our \nenvironment. The proposal to export Alaska oil stipulates the U.S.-flag \nships be used. There is a significant difference between a U.S. flag \nand a Jones Act ship. Jones Act ships must be built and repaired in the \nUnited States, while U.S.-flag ships can be foreign vessels that are \nplaced under U.S. registry. To replace its aging fleet on ANS tankers, \nBritish Petroleum would under current law be required to enter into \nlong-term charters ranging from 10 to 15 years in order to guarantee \nthe financing and the construction of these ships. However, if it is \npermitted to use foreign-built vessels, British Petroleum can engage in \nshort-term hires of existing, single-hulled vessels whose age does not \nrequire replacement under OPA90 for several years. British Petroleum \nshould be constructing new Jones Act ships now. That would be the \nresponsible and prudent policy to follow. Instead, they are continuing \nto use aging ships that pose a threat of structural failures. In \naddition, British Petroleum and its allies in Congress seek to deprive \nUnited States shipyards of much-needed new construction work. Jobs that \nwould have been created by this work will be lost at the same time as \nour environment is endangered.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that the State of Alaska and British \nPetroleum will benefit from Alaska oil exports. However, it is equally \nclear that these are the only beneficiaries of exports. Our national \nenergy security, our environment, and the jobs of U.S. workers will be \nplaced in jeopardy. Maintaining the restrictions on ANS exports is good \npolicy for America. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the legislation I \nam proud to introduce today.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Patty \nMurray in introducing legislation to extend the current restrictions on \nexports of Alaskan North Slope crude oil contained in section 7(d) of \nthe Export Administration Act. In previous years, Congress has \nexpressed strong bipartisan support for these restrictions. I am \nconfident that Congress will again affirm its commitment to promoting \nnational energy security by passing this important legislation.\n  Since the Alaskan oil export restrictions were first exacted by \nCongress in 1973, they have provided enduring benefits for our Nation. \nWe now have an efficient transportation infrastructure to move crude \noil from Alaska to the lower 48 States and Hawaii. In addition, these \nrestrictions have helped limit our reliance on OPEC and unstable \nPersian Gulf oil supplies. Furthermore, we have been able to enhance a \ndomestic merchant marine that continues to help supply the essential \noil requirements of our domestic economy and our military.\n  Despite the lessons of two major oil crises and the Persian Gulf War, \nwe foolishly continue to rely on foreign oil as a major energy source. \nU.S. oil imports now exceed half of our daily oil requirement. \nGovernment and private estimates now predict that by the year 2010, \nimports will equal 59 percent.\n  Permitting the export of any Alaskan North Slope crude would only \nexacerbate this already serious problem. By allowing the export of \nAlaskan oil to Japan and other Pacific rim countries, we would further \nincrease our dependency on Middle Eastern oil, increase consumer \npetroleum costs on the west coast, threaten the vitality of our \ndomestic tanker fleet, and cause net Federal revenue losses. Moreover, \nAlaskan oil exports would cause job losses in the maritime and related \nship-supply industries on the west coast. Mr. President, these are \ncosts which this Nation simply cannot afford.\n  Our ability to withstand future energy crises will certainly be \ntested if we fail to take the appropriate steps now to protect our own \nenergy resources. By extending indefinitely the current export \nrestrictions on Alaskan crude oil in section 7(d) of the act, we will \nreaffirm the policy of keeping this country on the right path toward \nenergy security.\n  I commend Senator Murray for her leadership. I look forward to \nworking with her, members of the Senate Banking Committee, and other \ninterested Senators, as this proposal moves forward.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Graham, and Mr. \n        Bingaman):\n  S. 415. A bill to apply the antitrust laws to major league baseball \nin certain circumstances, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n         the professional baseball antitrust reform act of 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation that, \nif and when it becomes law, will bring about an end to the baseball \nstrike. In fact, the players have already voted to end their strike if \nthis bill becomes law.\n  Unlike other legislation that has been proposed, my bill would not \nimpose a big-government solution. On the contrary, it would get \ngovernment out of the way by eliminating a serious Government-made \nobstacle to settlement. Seventy-three years ago, the Supreme Court \nruled that professional baseball is not a business in interstate \ncommerce and is therefore immune from the reach of the Federal \nantitrust laws. This ruling was almost certainly wrong when it was \nfirst rendered in 1922. Fifty years later, in 1972, when the Supreme \nCourt readdressed this question, the limited concept of interstate \ncommerce on which the 1922 ruling rested had long since been shattered. \nThe Court in 1972 accurately noted that baseball's antitrust immunity \nwas an aberration that no other sport or industry enjoyed. But it left \nit to Congress to correct the Court's error.\n  A limited repeal of this antitrust immunity is now in order. Labor \nnegotiations between owners and players are impeded by the fact that \nbaseball players, unlike all other workers, have no resort under the \nlaw if the baseball owners act in a manner that would, in the absence \nof the immunity, violate the antitrust laws. This aberration in the \nantitrust laws has handed the owners a huge club that gives them unique \nleverage in bargaining and discourages them from accepting reasonable \nterms. This is an aberration that Government has created, and it is an \naberration that Government should fix.\n  The legislation that I am introducing would provide for a limited \nrepeal of professional baseball's antitrust immunity. This repeal would \nbe limited to the subject matter of major league labor relations. It \nwould not affect baseball's ability to control franchise relocation, \nnor would it affect the minor leagues. It also would not affect any \nother sport or business.\n  This legislation would not impose any terms of settlement on the \ndisputing parties, nor would it require that they reach a settlement. \nRather, it would simply remove a serious impediment to settlement--an \nimpediment that is the product of an aberration in our antitrust laws. \nIn short, far from involving any governmental intrusion into the \npending baseball dispute, the legislation would get Government out of \nthe way.\n  I am pleased to report that this bill has bipartisan support. \nOriginal cosponsors include Senators Moynihan, Graham, and Bingaman.\n  I am even more pleased to report that the baseball players have \nalready voted to end their strike if this bill becomes law. There will \nbe a full 1995 baseball season if Congress acts quickly on this long \noverdue measure.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate and the House to support this \nlegislation.\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of the Professional Baseball Antitrust Reform Act of 1995, a \nbill drafted by the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Hatch. I hope \n [[Page S2660]] this legislation will help to facilitate negotiations \nin--and settlement of--the professional baseball strike that has gone \non for 6 long months now.\n  This bill is designed to be a partial repeal of major league \nbaseball's antitrust exemption. It would leave the exemption in place \nas it pertains to minor league baseball and the ability of major league \nbaseball to control the relocation of franchises.\n  On January 4, 1995, the first day of the 104th Congress, I introduced \nmy own legislation on this subject. My bill, S. 15, the National \nPastime Preservation Act of 1995, would apply the antitrust laws to \nmajor league baseball without the exceptions suggested by my friend \nfrom Utah.\n  In 1922, the Supreme Court of the United States, in Federal Baseball \nClub versus National League, held that ``exhibitions of base ball'' \nwere not interstate commerce and thus were exempt from the antitrust \nlaws. Fifty years later, in Flood versus Kuhn in 1972, the Court \nacknowledged that in fact baseball is a business engaged in interstate \ncommerce, but declined to reverse Federal Baseball, citing a half \ncentury of congressional inaction on the matter.\n  Clearly baseball is a business engaged in interstate commerce, and \nshould be subject to the antitrust laws to the same extent that all \nother businesses are. But the greater point is that the strike must be \nsettled through good-faith bargaining between the parties. I will \nsupport this and any other effort that will move the parties forward \ntoward a collective bargaining agreement--and the resumption of \nbaseball in America as soon as possible.\n  I thank my friend from Utah for inviting me to cosponsor this \nlegislation, and hope other Senators agree with us that the time has \ncome to act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. THURMOND (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 416. A bill to require the application of the antitrust laws to \nmajor league baseball, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n         THE MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL ANTITRUST REFORM ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Major \nLeague Baseball Antitrust Reform Act of 1995 to repeal the antitrust \nexemption which shields major league baseball from the antitrust laws \nthat apply to all other sports. I am pleased to have Senator Leahy, the \nranking member of the Antitrust, Business Rights, and Competition \nSubcommittee which I chair, join me in introducing this bill.\n  The Thurmond-Leahy legislation addresses baseball's antitrust \nexemption, but is not specially drafted in an attempt to solve the \ncurrent baseball strike. Although the ongoing strike raises questions \nabout the antitrust exemption, major league baseball's problems go far \ndeeper than this one strike. Baseball has suffered a strike or lockout \nevery time a contract has expired during the last quarter century. \nBaseball has had eight strikes or lockouts in a row, the worst work \nstoppage record of all professional sports. Removing the antitrust \nexemption will not automatically resolve baseball's problems, but I \nbelieve it will move baseball in the right direction.\n  Despite our interest in seeing the players return to the field, we \nmust be ever mindful of the need to limit Federal Government \nintervention into matters best left to private remedies. The Congress \nshould determine how much Federal involvement, if any, serves the \npublic interest in this area. But as long as the special antitrust \nexemption remains in place for baseball, the Congress is involved. The \nCongress has an impact on the sport by simply permitting the special \nexemption to remain long after the factual basis for it has \ndisappeared.\n  It is now well-known that baseball's antitrust exemption is \nessentially a historical accident. The exemption was established in \n1922 by the Supreme Court--not the Congress--when the Court held that \nprofessional baseball was not interstate commerce and therefore could \nnot be subject to the Federal antitrust laws. Since that time, the \nSupreme Court held that baseball is, of course, interstate commerce, \nbut the Court refused to end the exemption. Instead, the Court held \nthat it is up to the Congress to make any necessary changes in the \nexemption. In light of the Supreme Court decisions in this area, we \nmust recognize that responsibility has shifted to the Congress to \naddress the exemption and whatever effects it may have on major league \nbaseball's problems.\n  Some Members of Congress believe that we should not get involved \nduring the current strike, while other Members have asserted that in \nthe absence of a strike there is no need for the Congress to take \naction on this issue. Whether there is a strike or not, it is my belief \nthat it is proper for the Congress to consider this antitrust issue as \na matter of public policy. The Congress has considered baseball's \nantitrust exemption in the past, including serious attention by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee last year, prior to the current strike. I \nintend to\n continue working on this issue, even if the strike were to end today.\n\n  As a practical matter, there is no guarantee that any legislation on \nthis subject will be enacted promptly, despite our best efforts, given \nthe press of other business in both the Senate and the House. Thus, \nthis legislation ought to have little impact on baseball's \nnegotiations. The players and owners certainly should continue to work \nto settle their differences without assuming that congressional \nintervention will occur.\n  The Thurmond-Leahy legislation would repeal baseball's antitrust \nexemption, while maintaining the status quo for the minor leagues. \nProtecting the current relations with the minor leagues is important to \navoid disruption of the more than 170 minor league teams which are \nthriving throughout our Nation. This is a priority which other Members \nand I have clearly expressed. The Thurmond-Leahy bill also makes clear \nthat it does not override the provisions of the Sports Broadcast Act of \n1961, which permits league-wide contracts with television networks.\n  Nor does the Thurmond-Leahy legislation affect the so-called \nnonstatutory labor exemption. The nonstatutory labor exemption shields \nemployers from the antitrust laws when they are involved in collective \nbargaining with a union. Court interpretations of the nonstatutory \nlabor exemption are somewhat unsettled. But there is no doubt that, at \na minimum, repealing baseball's special exemption would permit \nantitrust challenges in the absence of a collective bargaining \narrangement, and would place baseball on the same footing as other \nprofessional sports and businesses.\n  I am also concerned about the issue of franchise relocation, a \nsubject on which I held hearings in the mid-1980's while serving as \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee. Relocation is a significant issue \nto baseball, as well as other professional sports. If the antitrust \nlaws need adjustment in this area, we should consider this matter in \nthe context of all professional sports. Thus, the Thurmond-Leahy bill \ndoes not address franchise relocation, but separate legislation is \nbeing considered to protect objective franchise relocation rules in all \nprofessional sports.\n  Mr. President, I join the millions of Americans who are anxious for \nthe 1995 baseball season to begin, and encourage the owners and players \nto resolve their differences. But again, I believe the proper role for \nthe Congress is to repeal the Court imposed antitrust exemption. This \nwill restore baseball to the same level playing field as other \nprofessional sports and businesses. By removing the antitrust \nexemption, the players and owners will have one less distraction \nkeeping them from developing a long-term working relationship, and the \nCongress will no longer be intertwined in baseball because of the \nspecial exemption.\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Thurmond \nto introduce the Major League Baseball Antitrust Reform Act of 1995. As \nchairman and ranking Democrat on the Senate's Antitrust Subcommittee, \nwe will be participating in hearings later this week into the exemption \nfrom the Federal antitrust laws enjoyed by major league baseball. Our \nantitrust laws are intended to protect competition and benefit \nconsumers. No one is or should be above the law. Yet for over 70 years, \nmajor league baseball has operated outside our antitrust laws. I think \nthat should be reviewed and corrected.\n  Last summer, the Senate Judiciary Committee had an opportunity to \nright this situation when we considered a bill to repeal baseball's \nantitrust exemption that was very similar to the \n [[Page S2661]] bill we are introducing today. While Senator Thurmond \nand I supported the measure, some of our colleagues blinked and the \nmeasure was defeated.\n  Soon thereafter negotiations between major league baseball owners and \nplayers disintegrated. We have since witnessed a preemptive strike, the \nunilateral imposition of a salary cap, failed efforts at mediation, the \nloss of one season and likely obliteration on a second, and pleas from \nall corners to resolve the current impasse going for naught.\n  In my view, major league baseball's exemption from Federal antitrust \nlaws has significantly contributed to the problem that confronts us all \ntoday. Had Congress repealed that out-of-date, judicially proclaimed \nimmunity from law, I believe that this matter would not be festering. I \nhope that we will, at long last, take up the issue of major league \nbaseballs' antitrust exemption.\n  Baseball has been the national pastime. It has served to bind parent \nto child. It teaches important values including the benefits of \nteamwork and doing ones best. It is part of our history. The game's \ncurrent caretakers are about to cost the American people another year \nwithout baseball.\n  Seniors who look forward to the joys of spring training and to \nfollowing their favorite teams on radio or television will have to do \nwithout. Youngsters looking for positive role models, contemporary \nheros, and a sport to span generations or Americans will be \nshortchanged.\n  Cities and towns that have invested millions in facilities to support \nmajor league baseball will be cheated. Vendors and others who rely on \nbaseball for jobs that help them scratch out a living for themselves \nand their families will be hit, again.\n  There is a public interest in the resumption of true, major league \nbaseball. The current situation derives at least in part from \ncircumstances in which the Federal antitrust laws have not applied, \nCongress has provided no regulatory framework to protect the public, \nand the major leagues have chosen to operate without a strong, \nindependent commissioner who could look out for the best interests of \nbaseball. Thus, competing financial interests continue to clash, with \nno resolution in sight.\n  In my view, the burden of proof is on those who seek to justify \nbaseball's exemption from the law. No other business or professional or \namateur sport is possessed of the exemption from law that major league \nbaseball has enjoyed and abused.\n  I look forward to our prompt hearings and to move ahead thoughtfully \nto consider whether major league baseball, as it is currently \norganized, is entitled to exemption from legal requirements to which \nall other businesses must conform their behavior. It is time to forge a \nlegal framework in which the public will be better served. Since the \nmultibillion-dollar businesses that have grown from what was once our \nnational pastime are now big business being run accordingly to a \nfinancial bottom line, a healthy injection of competition may be just \nwhat is needed.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 417. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with \nrespect to the eligibility of veterans for mortgage revenue bond \nfinancing; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              MORTGAGE REVENUE BOND FINANCING LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I reintroduce legislation that will \nhelp Wisconsin and several other States extend one of our most \nsuccessful veterans programs to Persian Gulf war participants and \nothers. This bill will amend the eligibility requirements for mortgage \nrevenue bond financing for State veterans housing programs.\n  Wisconsin uses this tax-exempt bond authority to assist veterans in \npurchasing their first home. Under rules adopted by Congress in 1984, \nthis program excluded from eligibility veterans who served after 1977 \nor who had been out of service for more than 30 years. This bill would \nsimply remove those restrictions.\n  Wisconsin and the other eligible States simply want to maintain a \nprinciple that we in the Senate have also strived to uphold--that \nveterans of the Persian Gulf war should not be treated less generously \nthan those of past wars. This bill will make that possible.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. \n        Baucus):\n  S. 418. A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to extend, \nimprove, increase flexibility, and increase conservation benefits of \nthe conservation reserve program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n         the conservation reserve program extension act of 1995\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I introduce the Conservation \nReserve Program Extension Act of 1995. I am pleased to be joined in \noffering this legislation by Senator Daschle, Senator Wellstone, and \nSenator Baucus.\n  Established in the 1985 farm bill, the Conservation Reserve Program \n[CRP] is one of the most popular programs ever offered by the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. Its objective, as stated in the 1985 farm \nbill, was ``to assist owners and operators of highly erodible cropland \nin conserving and improving the soil and water resources of their farms \nor ranches.''\n  Several factors led to the creation of the program: The United States \nhad accumulated large surpluses of agricultural commodities; commodity \nprices were extremely low; the agricultural economy was in a \nprecipitous downturn; the cost of agricultural programs was increasing, \nand soil erosion was actually increasing in some areas of the country. \nThus, Congress decided to initiate a program to reduce surplus \ncommodities by retiring cropland, increase prices, boost producer \nincome, and just as important, sharply reduce soil erosion.\n  Although the program's goal of maintaining higher prices was not as \nmeasurable as producers in my State would have liked--a goal which is \nobviously affected by other factors--the program was well-received and \nachieved positive results. Between 1986 and 1989, farmers were given \nnine opportunities to enroll land in the CRP, and they enrolled 33.9 \nmillion acres. As a result, the program returned normalcy to the \nagricultural sector and, along with conservation compliance \nrequirements of the 1985 farm bill, helped reduce soil erosion \nsubstantially.\n  Conditions were different during the debate over the 1990 farm bill, \nand the CRP was modified to meet those conditions. The CRP was \nbroadened to include more environmentally sensitive lands. Bids were \naccepted on the basis of an environmental benefits index that measured \nthe potential contribution to conservation and environmental program \ngoals that land would provide if enrolled. Seven goals were set for the \nprogram. The goals included surface water quality improvement, \npotential ground water quality improvement, preservation of soil \nproductivity, assistance to farmers most affected by conservation \ncompliance, encouragement of tree planting, enrollment in hydrologic \nunit areas identified under the water quality initiative, and\nenrollment in conservation priority areas established by Congress. \nThese changes broadened the scope of the program, helping it achieve \n  positive, measurable results.Although initially mandated to research \n40 to 45 million acres, according to USDA's Economic Research Service \nthe CRP now includes 36.4 million acres through 375,000 contractual \nagreements. This represents about 8 percent of total U.S. cropland. The \nCRP has reduced soil erosion by 700 million tons per year, a reduction \nof 22 percent compared with conditions that existed prior to the \nprogram. In addition, the program has produced enormous benefits for \nwildlife, both game and nongame species. It is no surprise that \nreauthorization of the CRP is the primary legislative goal of nearly \nevery wildlife organization.\n  The CRP has had a significant impact on North Dakota agriculture. \nConsider the following statistics provided by USDA's Agricultural \nStabilization and Conservation Service:\n\nNumber of bids...................................................26,600\nNumber of contracts..............................................18,520\nAcres contracted..............................................3,180,569\nAverage rental rate.................................................$38\nTotal annual rental........................................$121,998,974\n\n  Commodity base acres involved include:\n\nWheat.........................................................1,138,046\nCorn............................................................134,417\n[[Page S2662]] Barley...........................................580,059\nOats............................................................263,683\nSorghum...........................................................1,837\n                                                             __________\n\n  Total base acres............................................2,118,042\n\n  Total annual erosion reduction: 45,842,990 tons.\n  The future of this program is central to the debate over the 1995 \nfarm bill in my State.\n  The legislation we are introducing today represents our effort to \naddress the questions of participants in our States and many others who \nhave concerns about the future of CRP: farm implement dealers, \nfertilizer and pesticide companies, local business people, lenders, \nconservationists, ranchers, hunters, and various other parties.\n  Recently, the U.S. Department of Agriculture made two significant \nannouncements that signal its intentions over the future of the CRP. On \nAugust 24, 1994, USDA announced 1-year contract extensions to \nparticipants whose contract expires on September 30, 1995.\n  On December 14, 1994, USDA announced that action would be taken to \nmodify and extend all CRP contracts and to improve the targeting of the \nCRP to more environmentally sensitive acres.\n  As a result of these announcements, the Congressional Budget Office \n[CBO] adjusted its baseline projections for CRP spending. However, the \nnew baseline suggests that the new CRP will shrink to less than half \nits size, about 15 million acres.\n  I believe a 15-million acre CRP is insufficient to maintain the broad \nbenefits of the program. Passage of this legislation is necessary to \nmaintain program benefits.\n  First, environmental benefits will be lost. As I noted, he CRP \nprovides outstanding improvements in water quality, soil quality, and \nwildlife habitat. Even more benefits could be gained through enactment \nof our bill. A mistake was made once before in allowing a similar \nprogram, the soil bank, to expire. From 1956 to 1972, USDA managed the \nsoil bank, to divert cropland from production in order to reduce \ninventories, and to establish and maintain protective vegetative cover \non the land. In 1960, there were 28.7 million acres under contract. \nAlthough many forces were at work in ending the program such as \ncommodity prices in the world market, by the mid-1970's most land had \nreturned to crop production. Many of those acres are now enrolled in \nthe CRP.\n  Second, commodity prices will likely fall. As CRP contracts expire, \nseveral surveys have shown that a majority of farmers will return the \nland to production, increasing stocks and depressing prices. According \nto USDA's Economic Research Service, wheat prices would fall 9 percent; \ncorn prices would fall 5 percent. Lower prices and increased acreage \nreceiving payments would increase total deficiency payments 21 percent.\n  Third, the debate over the 1995 farm bill could become an \nincreasingly difficult budget fight. Some members of Congress \ncontinually suggest that Federal farm programs should be cut \nsignificantly to solve our budget deficit. I disagree. Agriculture \nspending has been cut significantly in recent years. If other Federal \nprograms had taken the same reductions agriculture has, our deficit \nproblem would be much less serious, if not solved. If we fail to fully \nextend the CRP, the budget pressures on agriculture will very likely \nincrease dramatically, threatening farm income that is already at \ninsufficient levels.\n  Fourth, the combination of lower prices and the loss of rental \npayments will have serious financial implications for producers and \nlandowners in North Dakota and many other States. If, as some of my \ncolleagues have suggested, the CRP is significantly downsized at the \nsame time farm programs are eliminated, the combined impact would \nseriously erode land values, and hurt rural schools, businesses and \ncommunities, and lending institutions.\n  I believe that is the wrong approach to Federal agriculture policy. I \nbelieve the CRP is an important part of a long-term strategy to \nmaintaining a sound rural economy. The bill I am introducing would lead \nus in that direction by accomplishing the following:\n  Requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to offer current contract \nholders the option of renewing their current contract for 10 years upon \nexpiration. Acreage not reenrolled would be required to follow a basic \nconservation plan.\n  Requiring the Secretary to use a bidding system to enroll new acres \ninto the CRP with cost-share assistance available for carrying out \nconservation measures and practices. Three criteria shall be used by \nUSDA to determine new enrollment: water quality, soil quality, and \nwildlife habitat.\n  By moving forward on such a policy, it is my belief that we will be \nmaking better long-term decisions for this valuable national resource. \nThe benefits to society in improved water and soil quality and wildlife \nhabitat are real and measurable. Let us not repeat the errors of the \npast when the soil bank was cavalierly eliminated.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2648-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2662-S2663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 12\n\n  At the request of Mr. Roth, the names of the Senator from Colorado \n[Mr. Brown], the Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], the Senator from Utah \n[Mr. Bennett], the Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns], the Senator from \nIdaho [Mr. Craig], the Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], the Senator from \nTexas [Mrs. Hutchison], the Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne], the \nSenator from Florida [Mr. Mack], the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. \nNickles], the Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond], the Senator \nfrom Tennessee [Mr. Thompson], and the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. \nLieberman] were added as cosponsors of S. 12, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage savings and investment \nthrough individual retirement accounts, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 262\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the names of the Senator from Ohio \n[Mr. DeWine] and the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 262, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \nto increase and make permanent the deduction for health insurance costs \nof self-employed individuals.\n\n\n                                 S. 275\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from North \nDakota [Mr. Conrad] was added as a cosponsor of S. 275, a bill to \nestablish a temporary moratorium on the Interagency Memorandum of \nAgreement Concerning Wetlands Determinations until enactment of a law \nthat is the successor to the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade \nAct of 1990, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 285\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from North \nDakota [Mr. Conrad] was added as a cosponsor of S. 285, a bill to grant \nauthority to provide social services block grants directly to Indian \ntribes, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 311\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from North \nDakota [Mr. Conrad] was added as a cosponsor of S. 311, a bill to \nelevate the position of Director of Indian Health Service to Assistant \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, to provide for the \norganizational independence of the Indian Health Service within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 324\n\n  At the request of Mr. Warner, the name of the Senator from New \nHampshire [Mr. Gregg] was added as a cosponsor of S. 324, a bill to \namend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to exclude from the \ndefinition of employee firefighters and rescue squad workers who \nperform volunteer services and to prevent employers from requiring \nemployees who are firefighters or rescue squad workers to perform \nvolunteer services, and to allow an employer not to pay overtime \ncompensation to a firefighter or rescue squad worker who performs \nvolunteer services for the employer, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 348\n\n  At the request of Mr. Nickles, the names of the Senator from \nMinnesota [Mr. Grams], the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], and the \nSenator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] were added as cosponsors of S. \n348, a bill to provide for a review by the Congress of rules \npromulgated by agencies, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                     Senate Concurrent Resolution 3\n\n  At the request of Mr. Simon, the name of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland \n [[Page S2663]] [Mr. Pell] was added as a cosponsor of Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 3, a concurrent resolution relative to Taiwan and \nthe United Nations.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2662-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLU- TION 6--RELATIVE TO MEXICO\n\n  Mr. MACK (for himself, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Bond, Mr. \nFaircloth, Mr. Grams, Mr. Frist, Mr. Brown, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Bennett, \nand Mr. Gramm) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 6\n\n       Whereas Mexico is an important neighbor and trading partner \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas on January 31, 1995, the President announced a \n     program of assistance to Mexico, that includes swap \n     facilities and securities guarantees in the amount of \n     $20,000,000,000, using the exchange stabilization fund \n     established pursuant to section 5302 of title 31, United \n     States Code and the Federal Reserve System;\n       Whereas the program of assistance also involves the \n     participation of the Federal Reserve System, the \n     International Monetary Fund, the Bank for International \n     Settlements, the International Bank for Reconstruction and \n     Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Bank of \n     Canada, and several Latin American countries;\n       Whereas the involvement of the exchange stabilization fund \n     and the Federal Reserve System means that United States \n     taxpayer funds will be used in the assistance effort to \n     Mexico;\n       Whereas assistance provided by the International Monetary \n     Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and \n     Development, and the Inter-American Development Bank may \n     require additional United States contributions of taxpayer \n     funds to those entities;\n       Whereas the immediate use of taxpayer funds and the \n     potential requirement for additional future United States \n     contributions of taxpayer funds necessitates congressional \n     oversight of the disbursement of funds from the exchange \n     stabilization fund, the Federal Reserve System, and the \n     International Monetary Fund; and\n       Whereas the efficacy of the assistance to Mexico is \n     contingent on the pursuit of sound economic policy by the \n     Government of Mexico: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the Secretary of the Treasury should, in conjunction \n     with reports required under section 5302 of title 31, United \n     States Code, by te 30th day after the end of each month, \n     submit a detailed report to the Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Banking and Financial Services of the House of \n     Representatives describing, with respect to such month--\n       (A) the condition of the Mexican economy;\n       (B) any consultations between the Government of Mexico and \n     the Department of the Treasury or the International Monetary \n     Fund; and\n       (C) any funds disbursed from the exchange stabilization \n     fund, including any swap facilities or securities guarantees, \n     pursuant to the approval of the President issued on January \n     31, 1995;\n       (2) each report submitted under paragraph (1) should \n     include, with respect to the month for which the report is \n     submitted--\n       (A) a full description of the activities of the Mexican \n     Central Bank and Mexican exchange rate policy, including the \n     reserve positions of the Mexican Central Bank and data \n     relating to the functioning of Mexican monetary policy;\n       (B) information regarding the implementation and the extent \n     of wage, price, and credit controls in the Mexican economy;\n       (C) a complete documentation of Mexican tax policy and any \n     proposed changes to such policy;\n       (D) a list of planned or pending Mexican Government \n     regulations affecting the Mexican private sector;\n       (E) any efforts to privatize public sector entities in \n     Mexico; and\n       (F) a full disclosure of all financial transactions, both \n     inside and outside of Mexico, directly involving funds \n     disbursed from the exchange stabilization fund and the \n     International Monetary Fund, including transactions with--\n       (i) individuals;\n       (ii) partnerships;\n       (iii) joint ventures; and\n       (iv) corporations; and\n       (3) the Secretary of the Treasury should continue to submit \n     reports under paragraph (1) until the Secretary determines \n     that no further risk exists to United States taxpayers of \n     default by the Government of Mexico on funds provided from \n     the exchange stabilization fund, the Federal Reserve System, \n     or the International Monetary Fund pursuant to the program of \n     assistance approved by the President on January 31, 1995.\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, President Clinton \narranged a financial package for Mexico. The package involves the \nexchange stabilization fund, the International Monetary Fund, the \nFederal Reserve, and other international organizations and governments \nto help Mexico get through its liquidity crisis. There is no doubt that \nthe United States has a great interest in the health of Mexico's \neconomy. We are concerned about Mexico, not only as a trading partner \nbut as a good neighbor. This particular financial package expands that \nrelationship. Indeed, it puts U.S. tax dollars at risk, and Congress \nneeds to play an oversight role.\n  I am concerned that Mexico's problems leading to this financial \narrangement were rooted in bad economic policies. Mexico's central bank \nviolated sound money principles. Excessive money supply growth was the \nroot cause of the devaluation of the peso. Followup policies of wage \nand price controls will drive away private investors and hurt Mexican \ncitizens.\n  My understanding is that Treasury Secretary Rubin has promised the \nHouse and Senate Banking Committees a ``detailed picture of \ndevelopments in Mexico'' so that Congress can be fully informed of \nMexican economic policies and therefore its ability to repay loan \nobligations. The Treasury is currently required to report to Congress \non any disbursements from the exchange stabilization fund. Because of \nthe magnitude of the current commitment, I feel it is necessary for \nTreasury to provide additional information to the Banking Committee \nregarding the condition of the Mexican economy and consultations \nbetween the Government of Mexico and the International Monetary Fund or \nthe United States Treasury Department. That is why I, with several \nother Senators, am introducing the Mexican Loan Compliance Resolution.\n  This resolution will make sure that the information Congress needs to \nevaluate the Mexican loan is the same information that will be provided \nby Treasury. The resolution asks for Treasury to provide: Information \non monetary policy in Mexico, including potential devaluation plans and \ninformation on the Mexican money supply; information on the institution \nof wage and price controls, changes in tax policy, and privatization \nefforts; a list of planned or pending Mexican Government regulations \naffecting the Mexican private sector; and a full disclosure of all \nfinancial transactions directly involving funds disbursed from the \nexchange stabilization fund and the International Monetary Fund.\n  Just as American voters made clear to our government in November that \nthey wanted change, Mexican voters rallied for change in their election \nlast Sunday. The Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], the party of \nPresident Zedillo, that delivered the devaluation of the Mexican peso, \nsuffered a bruising defeat. The people in the Mexican state of Jalisco \nvoted overwhelmingly for candidates from the National Action Party \n[PAN], electing a new governor, achieving a majority in the state \nlegislature, and winning 90 of 124 municipal offices. While only the \nMexican people can determine whether the PAN party will fully reflect \ntheir desire for change, the Mexican people recognized who was \nresponsible for 40 percent of their purchasing power vanishing with the \ndevaluation, and they held their leaders accountable. The new Congress \nelected in November recognizes that it's accountable too. By ensuring \nthat Mexico follows policies that will help the Mexican people and \nstrengthen its economy, we will fulfill our obligation to protect \nUnited States taxpayers whose dollars are on the line.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2663-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2663-S2664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 78--RELATIVE TO HALEYVILLE, AL, EMERGENCY 911 DAY\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, yesterday, Senator Murkowski and I \nintroduced legislation to authorize and direct the Secretary of Energy \nto sell the Alaska Power Administration's two hydroelectric projects \nand terminate the Alaska Power Administration; and to permit the export \nof Alaskan North Slope crude oil carried on U.S. flag vessels. I urge \nmy colleagues to join in support of this legislation.\n  For Senators who are less familiar with the Alaska Power \nAdministration, it is a unit of the U.S. Department of Energy. The \nAlaska Power Administration has had the responsibility for operation, \nmaintenance, transmission, and power marketing for the two Alaskan \nFederal hydroelectric projects, Eklutna and Snettisham, which were \nauthorized to encourage economic and industrial development in Alaska. \nCongress never intended that Snettisham and Eklutna would remain under \nFederal control. And, as this is an issue that I have worked on for \nmany years, I am glad that the present administration supports the \nFederal divestiture of these two projects and the termination of the \nAlaska Power Administration upon completion of the sales.\n  This legislation includes significant improvements over previous \nproposed legislation. The sales of the projects will proceed under the \nterms of two separate purchase agreements that provide and require \ntransition plans for the Federal employees of the projects, including \nbut not limited to Federal employee benefits for Alaska Power \nAdministration employees, delineation of responsibilities of the \npurchasers and the sellers through the transition to new ownership, \nprotection for nonpower users of project lands and water, and \nenvironmental management plans. Additionally, the projects, including \nfuture modifications, will continue to enjoy their exemption from the \nrequirements of the Federal Power Act.\n  Our legislation will also amend the Trans-Alaska Pipeline \nAuthorization Act to permit the export of Alaskan North Slope crude \noil. As I have said before, this vital legislation will create jobs \naround the Nation and increase oil production in Alaska and California. \nIt will also ensure the continued survival of the independent U.S. \ntanker fleet manned by U.S. crews, and thus enhance our national \nsecurity while eliminating an injustice that for too long discriminated \nexclusively against the citizens of Alaska. With the administration's \nsupport, we intend to move this bill as quickly as possible to begin \ncreating jobs, spurring energy production, and preserving our \nindependent tanker fleet.\n  Congress enacted the original export ban shortly after the \ncommencement of the Arab-Israeli war and the first oil boycott in 1973. \nThe original intent of the law was to enhance energy security, but \ntoday it actually threatens our energy security by discouraging energy \nproduction and creating unnecessary hardships for the struggling \ndomestic oil industry. In 1994, for the first time in history, more \nthan half the oil used in the United States was\n imported. Imports in 1994 accounted for 50.4 percent of domestic \ndemand, and it is the decline in domestic production that has led to \nhigher imports. Most North Slope crude oil is delivered to \n[[Page S2666]] the west coast, especially California, on U.S. flag \nvessels. The export ban drastically reduces the market value of the oil \nand creates an artificial surplus on the west coast. This depresses the \nproduction and development of both North Slope crude and the heavy \ncrude produced by small independent producers in California.\n  Our legislation would go a long way toward helping to revive the \ndomestic oil industry, create American jobs, and preserve our U.S. \ntanker fleet. In June 1994, the Department of Energy released a \ncomprehensive report which concluded that Alaskan oil exports would \nboost production in Alaska and California by at least 100,000 barrels \nper day by the end of the decade. The Department also concluded that \nexports of this oil on U.S. flag ships would help create as many as \n25,000 new jobs and generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new \nState and Federal revenues. Our legislation would require the use of \nU.S. flag ships to carry the exports, meaning that, in general, the \nships which carry this oil today will continue to do so in the future.\n  Mr. President, I emphasize that this legislation will increase jobs \nfor Americans. It will help small businesses by permitting the oil \nmarket to function normally. It will help keep U.S. seamen employed in \na U.S. tanker fleet. It will slow the decline of production of North \nSlope crude oil and encourage production in California, which will, in \nturn, help to salvage our energy security. Finally, it will help to \neliminate an injustice which has unfairly discriminated against \nAlaska's citizens for too long. We urge the administration to join with \nus to help move this legislation as quickly as possible.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2665-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       FIRST WOMAN PILOT IN SPACE\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise today to recognize the achievements of Air Force Lieutenant \nColonel Eileen Marie Collins, a native of Elmira, NY. On Friday, \nFebruary 3, Lt. Col. Collins became the first woman to pilot a NASA \nspace shuttle. As pilot on the Discovery, Col. Collins' main duty was \nto operate and maintain the engines, battery-powered hydraulic system, \nand electrical system. As we all saw, the Discovery rendezvoused with \nthe Russian space station Mir, another historic achievement on this \nflight. The Discovery's 8-day flight is the first of eight missions \nNASA hopes to carry out this year.\n  Colonel Collins began taking flying lessons at the age of 19 while \nstudying mathematics and science at Corning Community College, in \nCorning, NY. She holds a bachelor of arts degree in mathematics and \neconomics from Syracuse University. After graduating in 1979 from Air \nForce undergraduate pilot training at Vance Air Force Base in Oklahoma, \nshe became an instructor on T-38 and C-141 aircraft. From 1986 to 1989 \nshe taught mathematics at the Air Force Academy and continued as a \nflight instructor. It was in 1990, while she was attending the Air \nForce Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base in California, that \nNASA selected her to be an astronaut.\n  Now Colonel Collins joins the ranks of other astronauts from New York \nsuch as Mario Runco, Jr., and Ronald J. Grabe. I congratulate her for \nthis great milestone in her career, and wish her success in all future \nendeavors.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2666-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2666-S2667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     THE SURGEON GENERAL NOMINATION\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as most of my colleagues know, I \nhave generally held the view that a President is entitled to the \nnominees of his choice, and the Senate's constitutional role of advice \nand consent is an inherently limited one.\n  At least until the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Robert Bork, it \nseemed to me that matters of ideology and politics should not figure \nprominently into the Senate's calculation when it reviewed a \nPresident's nominees. That standard may have been irrevocably \ntransformed by the still-painful memories of the Bork nomination, but I \nthink it still applies to less consequential presidential nominations.\n  Now that the White House is embroiled in yet another embarrassing \nbattle over one of its nominees, it is attempting to raise the specter \nof unfair, ideologically driven opposition. Caught in a self-made web \nof contradictory statements and blatant falsehoods, the administration \nis now asserting that concerns about Dr. Henry Foster, its nominee for \nSurgeon General of the United States, are motivated entirely by moral \nconservatism, all engineered by the ``religious right.''\n  This smokescreen is an insult to the intelligence of every Member of \nthis body.\n  Since when are ACT-UP and the National Organization for Women \nconsidered rightwing zealots? Yet both these organizations have serious \nreservations about Dr. Foster's record. I imagine that the Democratic \nSenators who have expressed misgivings about this botched nomination \nwould be amused to hear themselves described as hard-line \nconservatives--agents of the religious right, no less. Yet that is what \nthe White House wants us to believe.\n  Perhaps a little history is in order to set the record straight.\n  Ever since the President's nomination of Dr. Foster as Surgeon \nGeneral, we have been subjected to yet another round of White House \ncredibility bingo. When Senator Kassebaum first asked about Dr. \nFoster's abortion practices, the White House responded that he had \nperformed only one. Then Dr. Foster announced that the number was \n``under a dozen.'' Then 55 and 700 abortions popped up in public \naccounts of Dr. Foster's research on abortion-related procedures. Now, \nDr. Foster has called bingo at 39.\n  One doesn't have to be against abortion to find it troubling that a \nnominee can't get his story straight about how many of them he has \nperformed. After all, we're not talking about how many M's the man \nhas eaten in his lifetime.\n  But the White House credibility game gets worse. Last weekend, it was \ndisclosed that Dr. Foster also performed experimental sterilizations on \nseverely retarded women. Leaving aside the serious issues of privacy \nrights and medical ethics which these incident raise, it is again \ntroubling that neither the White House nor its nominee found them \nsignificant enough to mention at the outset. Perhaps they hoped no one \nwould find out.\n  Mr. President, more is at issue here than one nominee. Because of \nthis administration, we are struggling to salvage the public respect \nand dignity of the position of Surgeon General. Over the last 2 years, \nour Nation has been forced to sit and watch as this once-\nrespected office was made an object of ridicule by the actions and \nremarks of the previous appointee. We cannot allow that to happen \nagain--before or after a nominee is confirmed.\n  The White House just can't figure out that the business of the \nSurgeon General is public health--not politics. It is about fighting \nserious diseases and health risks, not promoting some leftwing, \npolitically correct agenda. After the embarrassing controversies and \nultimate removal of Dr. Joycelyn Elders, one would think the White \nHouse had finally learned its lesson.\n  But this is one administration that never quite seems to get it.The \nNation's advocate for public health does not have a large staff at his \nor her disposal, or a large budget. Instead, the primary asset which a \nSurgeon General must use in protecting the public's health is the \npublic's trust. If a Surgeon General is regarded as untrustworthy or \nill-equipped by the public, that Surgeon General will be unable to \nperform his or her job in any meaningful way.\n  That is why the issue of credibility is so fundamental to this \nparticular nomination. And on the question of credibility, this nominee \nhas a serious problem--one which has been compounded by severe \nincompetence at the White House. As stated in a February 10 editorial \nin the New York Times:\n\n       Misleading statements by candidates for high position \n     simply cannot be condoned * * *. [T]he Administration put out \n     false information on the number of abortions performed by Dr. \n     Foster * * *. [B]oth he and the Administration made it look \n     as if their accounts were unreliable or designed to mask a \n     more troubling history.\n\n  Rather than admit the plain facts, the administration now wants to \nturn this nomination into a holy war over abortion. That is a gross \ndistortion of reality and an evasion of the White House's \nresponsibility for its negligent handling of this nomination.\n  [[Page S2667]] A number of Senators, newspapers, and outside interest \ngroups--all of whom could be fairly characterized as pro-choice--have \nexpressed deep concerns regarding this nomination, because of the \ncredibility issue. In fact, I think it is fair to say that this \nnominee's problems have no more to do with abortion than Zoe Baird's \nproblems had to do with antitrust policy.\n  We have had a number of controversial Surgeons General, some of whom \nI have disagreed with vehemently. But I have never seen, at least not \nsince this administration, a Surgeon General who--by their own actions \nand statements--utterly squandered the public trust that is so \nessential to this job.\n  As I said at the outset, it is generally my approach to give the \nPresident wide latitude in appointing the various members of his \nadministration. But with the facts that have come tumbling out about \nthis nominee--many of them in direct conflict with each other--and \ngiven the excruciating history of the last Clinton administration \nofficial to hold this job, I must regrettably join with my colleagues \nwho have called on the White House to withdraw the nomination \nimmediately.\n  Every day that goes by will simply do more damage to a nominee who \nis, by all accounts, a decent and accomplished individual. What is \nmore, every new report of withheld and false information will only \nserve to further erode the credibility of the office of Surgeon \nGeneral, at a time when public esteem for the position is at an all-\ntime low.\n  I think everyone in this body is ready to work with the President to \nfind a new candidate for Surgeon General who would command the public's \ntrust at the very outset. I may not agree with that new nominee on some \nissues, or even on most issues. But the point is to restore the \nintegrity and dignity of the office, and that will require a nominee \nwho comes untarnished by lapses in candor or allegiance to an extreme \npolitical agenda.\n  Playing the abortion card--as the White House is now doing so \nextravagantly--is merely a convenient dodge. The real issue is \ncredibility: the credibility of the nominee, and the credibility of \nthis administration.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2666-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF REAR ADM. JOHN E. GORDON\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, on April 19, 1994, the Senate \nconfirmed the nomination of Adm. Frank Kelso, the Chief of Naval \nOperations, to retire in grade. During the debate on the nomination, a \nnumber of Senators raised issues concerning Admiral Kelso's \naccountability with respect to matters related to the misconduct at the \n1991 Tailhook Symposium. At one point, a Senator indicated that no one, \nother than a victim of the misconduct, lost his or her job as a result \nof Tailhook. In response, I noted that a number of individuals, \nincluding the Secretary of the Navy, resigned as a result of Tailhook.\n  In the course of my remarks, I stated that ``the Navy JAG, the Judge \nAdvocate General, resigned over this.'' I made that statement based \nupon the fact that the retirement of the Judge Advocate General was \nannounced at the time that the Navy made public its initial reaction to \nthe DOD inspector general's report on the Navy's conduct of the \nTailhook investigations. Subsequent to my remarks, I have been informed \nby the Navy that the then-Judge Advocate General, Rear Adm. John E. \nGordon, did not resign in response to the Tailhook report.\n  The Navy has advised me that Rear Admiral Gordon was appointed to be \nthe Judge Advocate General on November 1, 1990, and was immediately \nscheduled for retirement on November 1, 1992, in accordance with prior \nNavy practice. Rear Admiral Gordon formally submitted his request for \nretirement on September 9, 1992, prior to the September 21, 1992 \nissuance of the DOD/IG report, and retired on November 1, 1992, in \naccordance with the date originally set in 1990. The Navy has further \nadvised me that no official adverse action was taken against Rear \nAdmiral Gordon.\n  To put this matter in perspective, the Navy has advised me that in \nthe aftermath of the Tailhook matter, 29 Navy and Marine Corps \npersonnel were punished under article 15 of the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice--nonjudicial punishment--and 3 flag officers received \nletters of censure from the Secretary of the Navy. Sixty Navy and \nMarine Corps personnel received nonpunitive administrative letters and \n19 received informal counseling.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to clarify the record.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2667-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2667-S2668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  MEXICAN LOAN COMMITMENTS RESOLUTION\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am pleased today to cosponsor \nwith Senator Mack the Mexican loan commitments resolution.\n  As I stated on February 8, the President never should have \ncircumvented the will of the American people to bail out a mismanaged \nMexican Government and global currency speculators. I remain outraged \nthat American taxpayers have been forced to do something they did not \nwant to do. The President knew full well that Congress would never \napprove a $40 billion bailout. He never should have submitted to \neconomic blackmail.\n  The President's use of $20 billion from our Exchange Stabilization \nFund [ESF] to bail out Mexico was unprecedented. This fund was intended \nto stabilize the dollar, not the Mexican peso or any other foreign \ncurrency. It is not the President's personal piggy bank. The President \nhas now committed $20 billion of the approximately $25 billion the ESF \nhas available for lending. Are sufficient funds left in the ESF to \nstabilize the dollar's exchange rate in the event of a crisis? What \nhappens if Mexico defaults? Does the President propose to raise taxes \nor cut needed domestic programs to replenish the ESF?\n  The Banking Committee intends to hold oversight hearings on the \nPresident's use of the ESF to bail out Mexico. These hearings will \naddress, among other issues: First, the President's legal authority to \nuse the ESF to provide $20 billion in loans, loan guarantees, and other \nassistance to Mexico; second, the need for such assistance to Mexico; \nthird, Mexico's compliance with the conditions imposed for United \nStates assistance; fourth, the administration's monitoring of economic \nconditions in Mexico during 1994, including whether the administration \nor the International Monetary Fund [IMF] participated in Mexico's \nDecember 20 decision to devalue the peso; and fifth, lessons of the \nMexican peso crisis, including the risk of similar crises occurring in \nother nations.\n  The Mexican loan commitments resolution expresses the sense of the \nSenate that Congress must receive sufficient information to judge the \nsuccess or failure of the President's Mexican adventure. This \nresolution urges the Secretary of the Treasury to provide the Senate \nBanking Committee with monthly information on: First, economic \nconditions in Mexico, and second, Mexico's use of the funds it obtains \nfrom the ESF and IMF. The Secretary now submits a monthly ESF financial \nstatement to the Senate and House Banking Committees.\n  Mr. President, in a February 9 letter to me, Secretary Rubin \nexpressed a willingness to provide some additional information to the \nBanking Committee on Mexico's economic condition, and Mexico's use of \nour assistance. I ask that the Secretary's letter be included in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  The purpose of this resolution is to detail the information that the \nSenate believes the Secretary must submit to allow the Banking \nCommittee to monitor the President's extraordinary use of the ESF to \naid Mexico.\n  The resolution urges the Secretary to provide the Banking Committee \nwith information on:\n  The activities of the Mexican Central Bank, including the reserve \npositions of the Mexican Central Bank and data relating to the \nfunctioning of Mexican monetary policy;\n  The implementation and extent of wage, price, and credit controls in \nthe Mexican economy;\n  Mexican tax policy;\n  Planned or pending Mexican Government regulations affecting the \nMexican private sector; and\n  Any efforts to privatize public sector entities in Mexico.\n  This information will allow the committee to determine whether \nMexico's Government has instituted the tight money and free market \nreforms needed to improve its economy.\n  [[Page S2668]] The resolution further asks that the committee be \nprovided with a full disclosure of all financial transactions, both \ninside and outside of Mexico, directly involving funds disbursed from \nthe ESF or the IMF. This information will allow the committee to \ndetermine whether these funds are being used to strengthen the peso or \nto refinance Mexico's debt. As Senator Bennett urged last week, these \nfunds should be used to extinguish excess pesos not to bail out \nspeculators in Mexican tesobonos.\n  Finally, this resolution asks that the committee be informed of any \nconsultations involving Mexico between the Untied States Department of \nthe Treasury, the IMF, and the Bank of International Settlements. This \ninformation will assist the committee in evaluating the success of the \nmultilateral effort to aid Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I hope my dire predictions about the President's use \nthe ESF to aid Mexico turn out to be wrong. I hope that Mexico \nprospers, and that American taxpayers are not left holding the bag.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge passage of the Mexican loan \ncommitments resolution. The information specified in this resolution \nwill allow Congress to blow the whistle if Mexico fails to life up to \nits commitments--to stop the peso press, to balance its budget, and to \nprivatize. We must protect American taxpayers, not badly run foreign \ngovernments.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                        Secretary of the Treasury,\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 1995.\n     Hon. Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator D'Amato: In your floor statement of February \n     8, you called on the Department of the Treasury to provide \n     the Banking Committee with monthly information on (i) \n     economic conditions in Mexico, and (ii) Mexico's use of the \n     funds it will obtain through our support package. As you \n     know, the Treasury Department presently submits a monthly \n     report to the House and Senate Banking Committees on Exchange \n     Stabilization Fund (ESF) operations. We are happy to \n     supplement this monthly report with the information you \n     requested. The report will also provide a detailed picture of \n     developments in Mexico, as well as an analysis of Mexico's \n     compliance with our agreed economic terms and conditions. \n     This information will enable the Congress and the American \n     people to review actions we are taking in America's interests \n     to deal with Mexico's financial situation.\n       Let me assure you that we fully share your concerns about \n     the need to ensure Mexico's proper use of our support.\n       To that end, Mexico has already agreed to meet a tough set \n     of economic conditions imposed by the IMF as a requirement \n     for accepting support from the Fund. These include strict \n     monetary targets that will hold Mexico to negative real \n     monetary growth, and disciplined fiscal targets that will \n     move Mexico to budget surplus. In addition, the Mexicans have \n     committed themselves to pushing forward with their \n     privatization program and further opening their economy.\n       Our own framework agreement with Mexico will take the IMF \n     program as a base. But we will also require the Mexicans to \n     agree to additional obligations, over and above those imposed \n     by the IMF, to protect our own resources. We will insist that \n     Mexico take steps to assure the independence of its central \n     bank. Moreover, we will require far greater transparency and \n     regular reporting on Mexico's financial condition and \n     policies. We will further ensure Mexico provides us with the \n     data we need to determine independently whether Mexico is \n     complying with our conditions and the IMF's conditions. Let \n     me emphasize to you that we will preserve the right to halt \n     our support program if we conclude that Mexico is not \n     cooperating, or if we judge that Mexico's economic situation \n     is deteriorating.\n       Please let me know if I or my staff can be of any further \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Robert E. Rubin.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2667-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 HOMICIDES BY GUNSHOT IN NEW YORK CITY\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to continue my \nweekly practice of reporting to the Senate on the death toll by gunshot \nin New York City. Last week, 7 people were killed by firearms in New \nYork City, bringing this year's total to 75.\n  With over 16,000 murders by gunshot nationally each year, we \nobviously have a long way to go in our efforts to curb the plague of \ngun violence. To be sure, we've made some progress, particularly with \npassage of the Brady law and the recent ban on semiautomatic assault \nweapons. Unfortunately, there is a powerful lobby working against us. \nIf any one doubts this, they need only look at the most recent \ncongressional elections. The National Rifle Association's $3.2 million \ncampaign to defeat targeted congressional candidates proved successful \nin 19 of 24 races.\n  We must continue to fight the gun lobby. Efforts at the national \nlevel will continue to be difficult, and we must enlist the help of \nStates and localities. Indeed, some States and localities have already \ntaken important steps. Last year, for instance, the city of Chicago \nbecame the first in the Nation to ban the sale of all handgun \nammunition. In addition, as reported in a New York Times article late \nlast year, police departments in two other cities, Indianapolis and \nKansas City, have mounted successful campaigns to rid their streets of \nguns. Simply by vigorously enforcing infractions of the law that give \nthem the legal basis to search individuals, police in these two cities \nhave confiscated an impressive number of illegal guns. In the first 3 \nweeks of the program in Indianapolis, special police teams seized an \nAK-47 rifle, a Mac 10 semiautomatic weapon, a Glock 19 semiautomatic \npistol, and a host of other illegal guns. In Kansas City, which has \nalready completed a 6-month gun-interception experiment, gun-related \ncrimes declined by almost 50 percent in the area in which the program \nwas implemented.\n  These are by no means novel approaches. In fact, New York City's \nPolice Commissioner William Bratton adopted similar methods when he \nheaded the city's transit police. In an effort to crack down on the \nthousands of fare-evaders on the city's subway system each day, Bratton \ndirected sweep teams to apprehend these illegal passengers. As it turns \nout, 1 in 20 of those passengers carried illegal weapons. The resulting \narrests led to a 48-percent decline in subway crimes.\n  I commend the efforts of the cities of Chicago, Indianapolis, and \nKansas City to the attention of Senators, and I hope the Senate will \nconsider gun control and ammunition control legislation in the near \nfuture.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2668-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2668-S2669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS\n\n Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, last Sunday I had occasion to be attending \nchurch at the First Presbyterian Church in Tulsa, OK, which is not \nunusual since I was married in that church 35 years ago. Dr. James \nMiller, who is the head minister there, preached a sermon on Matthew \n28, verses 16 and 17.\n  For somebody who may not remember that last chapter of Matthew, it \nwas after Christ had been crucified and had been resurrected. During \nthat timeframe, there were some women who said that they had seen \nChrist somewhere around the hills above the Sea of Galilee, so they \ntold the disciples to go up there and they could find the living \nChrist, who had surely arisen. So 11 disciples went up. Those 11 \ndisciples saw Christ with their own eyes. They heard him with their own \nears, and still they doubted him.\n  It occurred to me if such incontrovertible truth could have been \ndoubted by the disciples back then, then maybe we have been worrying \ntoo much about the American people. Because certainly if they doubted \ntruth like that, then the American people would see through the phony \nand transparent arguments against the balanced budget amendment.\n  So I went home and I got the Congressional Record out. I do not think \nmany Members of Congress of either House spend a lot of time reading \nthe Congressional Record. I know I do not. But I did that morning. I \nlooked up to find the 11 strongest arguments that were made in \nopposition to the balanced budget amendment.\n  I decided I would have one argument for each of the disciples. That \nseemed to be a reasonable thing. Most of these were arguments that were \narticulated by the very gifted Senator from West Virginia, [Mr. Byrd].\n  I would like to run over these arguments, the 11 arguments, that have \nbeen used over and over and over again in opposition to the passing of \nthe balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  The first one, which I will read verbatim is:\n\n       Proponents have refused to lay out a detailed plan to get \n     to a balanced budget. How can you tell if it will be good for \n     the country if you do not know the details?\n\n  Well, I know we have already voted on that amendment, and we were \nable to successfully table the amendment. But what we can tell and what \nwe do know is that the status quo is bad for the country. Continuing \nbusiness as usual, doing nothing, just keeping on doing the same thing \nwe have been doing for the past 40 years, is not going to work, and the \npublic is not demanding a detailed plan.\n  I think that is very significant. We hear so much about, ``Tell us \nexactly what you are going to do. Tell us where you are going to cut. \nTell us, play by play, what is going to happen in the next 7 years.'' \nThey are not asking about that. That is not what this amendment is all \nabout.\n  What we do not realize, many Members, is that this is really, truly a \nhistoric time in America. When we think about the other historic \ndecisions that were made throughout the history of this country, they \nwere never followed by detailed plans.\n  We can remember so well when John Fitzgerald Kennedy made a \ncommitment that within a decade we would put a man on the moon. Now, I \nthink there may have been some around that time that said, ``Show us \nhow you will do it. We do not want to make that commitment. We do not \nknow what it will cost. We do not know how to do it. We need the \ndetails.''\n  But at that time, the rockets were not built. The astronauts were not \nnamed. There were not any spacecrafts designed. No one could say \nexactly how to do it. Yet, following the same line of reasoning, we \nwould say that we would have expected President Kennedy to have said: \nAll right, on February 20, 1962, we are going to get an astronaut by \nthe name of John Glenn to orbit the \n [[Page S2670]] earth three times. Then, 3 years later, on December 15, \n1965, we will go get a great Oklahoman named Tom Stafford, along with \nWally Schirra, and they are going to achieve the first rendezvous in \nspace between Gemini 6 and Gemini 7. Then, 3 years later, Christmas of \n1968, we are going to have the first manned lunar orbit by Apollo 8 \nspacecraft. Three astronauts are going to go up and they are going to \nread aloud from the Book of Genesis. And then, finally, on July 20, \n1969, we will have two astronauts, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, that \nare going to land and walk on the moon.\n  No one believes that that is a reasonable request, that he should \nhave done that.\n  Some Members in this Chamber are old enough, as I am, to remember \nwhen Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared war in the Axis powers, and \nthat threat that was out there--and there were many people in Congress \nat that time who did object to it, who did not want to go to war, who \ndid not think it was necessary. They actually did ask for the plan at \nthat time.\n  How could he have given any details? Could he have said that on June \n6, 1944, we are going to send 156,000 troops into Normandy onto five \nbeaches? Then, 6 months later, December 26, we will time this to the \nday after Christmas, we will have the Battle of the Bulge, and General \nPatton will send his third army in and do their thing. And then, \nfinally, on August 6, 1945, if you declare war with me, we will drop an \natomic bomb on Hiroshima, and I think we will use a B-29 to do that, \nand we will name it the Enola Gay.\n  Now, all Senators know that that is not reasonable. Yet, that is the \nway we went into war, and there were people expecting more details than \nwe were able to give them at that time. I suggest, Mr. President, that \nthis is war that we are in the middle of now. We have been waiting for \nthis time, this opportunity, for 40 years. It is here. We must seize \nthis opportunity.\n  The second objection that was made by the very distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia was that proponents want to treat people like \nchildren, hiding the hard truth from them.\n  Well, now, I take exception to that, because I have four children. I \nnever hid the hard truth from them. I remember once, when my number two \nchild, whose name is Perry, was a very small child, and he looked a \nlittle bit like this guy here. We got him his first bicycle and we live \nin kind of a hilly neighborhood, and we taught him to balance. He was \nso excited. Finally, he was ready to go all the way around the block, \nand he came back to his home in triumph. He was sweating; he was hot. \nHe came up to me and said, ``Dad, I wish the whole world was \ndownhill.'' So I told him the hard truth is the whole world is not \ndownhill. The world is uphill and downhill.\n And I never hid the truth from them. The hard truth is that continuing \nbusiness as usual will lead to disaster, procrastinating and avoiding \nthe problem, acting like it does not exist. It is time for our country \nto grow up into this stage of maturity where it understands the \nsignificance on what we are to embark. The hard truth is the world is \nnot all downhill, you have to pedal uphill. The balanced budget \namendment is not going to be easy--it will take sacrifice--but we have \n  to do it for our children.The third argument that was made was that \nproponents say they are tired of Washington telling people what to do, \nthe Washington-knows-best mentality, but the balanced budget amendment \nis the ultimate Washington mandate. No, Senator, you have it backward. \nThose who oppose the balanced budget amendment, who have been running \nthings in this town for the last 40 years, they are the ones with the \nWashington-knows-best mentality. They have continued business as usual \nfor the past 40 years, in spite of the fact that 70 to 80 percent of \nthe people in America want a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  You might wonder, why do they want a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution? Why can they not just say, ``Let's elect people who are \ngoing to balance the budget?'' It is because for 40 years we, in this \nbody, have demonstrated very clearly that we are incapable of balancing \nthe budget.\n  I cannot remember one person that I have seen campaigning in the \nyears I have been in politics who said, ``Elect me and I want to go to \nWashington, I am going to spend more money and raise taxes and we are \nalso going to raise the deficit and increase the national debt.'' They \nnever campaign on that. And yet when they get here, that is what they \ndo.\n  That is what the last election was all about. Those who stood up in \nthe last election and caused the revolution of November 8, as it has \nnow become familiar with most of the people, have done so because they \nknow that the time is here and those standing in the way, like the \nSenator that is making these statements, are saying that they know \nbetter than 70 or 80 percent of the people know.\n  In a way, though, he is right, the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution is a mandate, but it is a mandate on Congress that says, \n``Do what you are elected to do but whatever you do, you have to \nbalance the budget by'' a certain date, which happens to be the year \n2002.\n  What this would do is force Congress to do what it should have been \nwilling to do without being forced to do. We had a Congressman in the \nState of Oklahoma that used to take exception to me when I talked about \npassing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. He would say, \n``Why? That is what we are elected to do, we are supposed to do that.'' \nThe point is, for 40 years, we have demonstrated that we are incapable \nof doing it and we have not done it.\n  Argument No. 4 was that proponents of the balanced budget amendment \nare saying swallow the snake oil but do not read the label. In fact, \nthere is no label.\n  The problem, I say to that Senator, is we have been swallowing the \nsnake oil now for 40 years and every year they have been buying votes \nby spending the taxpayers' money on program after program. But where \nwas the label that ever warned that if you keep spending money like \nthis our future generations are going to have to pay for it?\n  The problem is the politicians never told us how their well-meaning \nspending programs would affect the future generations and put us on the \nbrink of bankruptcy. The day is here and the public is demanding \nchange.\n  If anybody has to swallow the snake oil, I rather it be us and not \nour children and grandchildren.\n  The fifth argument that was used is all these Governors who are \nboasting about cutting taxes in their States should know that the \nbalanced budget amendment will require them to impose huge State tax \nincreases.\n  That is simply not true, and we hear this over and over again and \nyet, why do the majority of the Governors of the States throughout \nAmerica want a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution? If what \nthe Senator says is true, they would not, but they know that they are \nin a position to cut tax rates, to encourage economic growth and to \nactually do something about increasing revenue through economic \nactivity.\n  This is exactly what happened in the 1980's. I stood on the floor \ntoday and I watched four Senators refute the fact that in the 1980's we \nincreased revenues by cutting taxes. In fact, they stood up and they \nsaid, ``Look what happened in the 1980's. Reagan came along and he cut \ntaxes and we had huge deficits as a result of it.''\n  Let us look at what happened in the 1980's. In the 1980's, yes, we \ndid cut the tax rate. We had the most devastating cuts that we have had \nin contemporary history. The total revenues after those cuts--keep in \nmind the marginal rate, the top rate, went from 70 percent down to 28 \npercent, and what happened as a result of that? We dramatically \nincreased revenues because people were free to participate in the \nprofits that they could make that they knew the Government was going to \nlet them keep. So we lowered the rate and we increased economic \nactivity and we increased revenues. This all happened in the 1980's.\n  In 1980, the total revenues generated for the Federal Government \namounted to $517 billion. In 1990, after all of these cuts, the total \nrevenues had grown to $1.31 trillion, almost double. And look at the \nincome tax. That is where all the cuts took place, capital gains tax \n [[Page S2671]] and income tax. The total gross revenues that were \nderived from the income tax of 1980 amounted to $244 billion. In 1990, \nit was $466 billion. It almost doubled, and that is after the greatest \ntax cuts in the marginal rates.\n  And yet people in this body will not understand that. They do not \nunderstand that America was founded on a principle that if you go out \nand work harder, you are able to keep that which you have earned and \npass it on to future generations. It is no wonder when you look at some \nof the leaders of this country; look at Laura Tyson. Laura Tyson, in \ncase some are not familiar, was chief economic adviser to the President \nof the United States. Laura Tyson was quoted in 1992 in the Wall Street \nJournal as saying, and I am going to read this quote because I do not \nwant to get it wrong, and I may read it twice because it is hard for \npeople to understand that this actually was a person in this kind of a \nposition who would make this statement. Listen to what she said:\n\n       In direct contradiction to 12 years of Republican ideology, \n     there is no relationship between the level of taxes the \n     Nation pays and its economic performance.\n\n  No relationship between the level of taxation--in other words, you \ncould raise the level of taxation to 100 percent so that a person would \nnot be able to keep anything and that person would end up having to \ntake nothing home and would still be motivated to risk his capital to \ngo out and participate in this great economic system.\n  It is just not true. But we have top leaders in this country that are \nsaying it is true. It is just incredible to believe that this could \nhappen. We had two Senators from North Dakota today that said, ``Look \nwhat happened in this country during the 1980's: We cut taxes and the \ndeficits went up.'' Do you know why the deficits went up, Mr. \nPresident? They went up because people in this body and the body down \nthe hall kept increasing Federal programs, kept spending more money, \nand as more and more money came in, as the revenues doubled between \n1980 and 1990, they still insisted on raising the number of programs \nand Government expenditures to the point where the deficits went on up \nand up and up and up.\n  The balanced budget amendment will require the rate of increase in \nFederal spending to be slowed, we know that, but it does not mean that \nany programs actually have to be cut.\n  And all the scare tactics--they are calling veterans and saying your \nbenefits are going to be cut, your COLA's are going to be cut. They are \ncalling Social Security recipients and telling older Americans--what an \ninhuman thing to do to them--telling them their Social Security is \ngoing to be impaired, their Medicare is going to be impaired and that \njust is not true. Those who are saying it know it is not true.\n  There was a study made a couple years ago and updated the other day, \nthat said if you take the Government programs we have in place today \nand increase these Government programs by 2 percent a year--in other \nwords, put growth caps on--have every Government program increase by 2 \npercent a year, we would be able to balance the budget by the year \n2001, and that is without cutting one program.\n  We know in reality it would not happen that way because there are \nsome programs that are good programs and maybe they should increase, \nbut the average would have to stay down within that growth cap.\n And that is realistic. That is something that can happen. And the \npeople of America understand this. The States understand this. Three-\nquarters of the States right now are just waiting, just waiting to be \n  in a position to ratify this amendment.Objection No. 6 was that the \nbalanced budget amendment is a pig in a giant poke. I am not sure what \nhe is talking about. Maybe you know what it means, Mr. President, but I \nam not sure I know. But if it means that a pig in the poke is something \nbad that is made to look like something good, and if that is true, then \nthe chronic deficits as far as the eye can see are the real pig in the \npoke.\n  I had an experience the other day. I got a call from a young lady who \nis a brilliant intellectual. She instructs at the University of \nArkansas, coincidentally, the home State of our President, and yet she \nis a conservative intellectual scholar. Her name is Dr. Molly Rapert.\n  Anyway, I got a call and she said, ``You know, Senator, I know \nsomething about pigs.''\n  Well, now, for those of you not familiar with Arkansas, it is the \nhome of the Arkansas Razorbacks, and so they kind of use pigs and hogs \nand razorbacks interchangeably. And she said, ``I know something about \npigs. And if there are pigs in a poke, then those pigs are in \nWashington and they are the ones that are at the trough eating all that \nis out there, raising the deficit, increasing spending. Those are the \ntrue pigs in the poke.'' And that comes from someone in academics, a \nvery bright young lady.\n  It is kind of interesting because it was not long ago I had a \nconversation with the young lady and she made a reference that an awful \nlot of people her age are not having families because they know if they \nhave families, those families are going to be born into an environment \nwhere children are going to have to pay, according to the CBO, 82 \npercent of their income in taxes. And I can understand that. Why give \nbirth to someone who is going to be enslaved working for the \nGovernment?\n  The other day at the National Prayer Breakfast, I was entertaining \ninternational visitors that came in, and there was one from one of the \nBaltic States who said, ``How much money can you keep of the money that \nyou earn?'' And I said, ``Well, you keep about 60 percent of it.'' And \nthat was just kind of somebody I grabbed out of the air. He said, \n``That's wonderful.'' He said, ``Did you know in my country we can only \nkeep about 20 percent of it?''\n  Mr. President, if we do not do something to change the course we are \non, the young people like Dr. Molly Rapert are going to give birth to \nchildren who will have to pay 82 percent of their income in taxes, more \nthan in that Baltic country that was represented here at the National \nPrayer Breakfast. But I can say to the Molly Raperts and others around, \ndo not worry about it. It is time to have families because we are going \nto pass this balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and we are \ngoing to downsize Government. The time is here to do it.\n  The next statement that was made by one of the Senators on this floor \nthat I pulled out of the Record was, ``The balanced budget amendment \nwill give the politicians license to cut and slash and burn needed \nprograms.''\n  If you change one word in that sentence and substitute the word \ncourage for the word license, it would read this way and I would agree \nwith it: ``The balanced budget amendment will give the politicians \ncourage to cut and slash and burn programs that we are currently paying \nfor.''\n\n  You stop to think about the amount of money that is thrown around in \nthis Government that we could save. Right now we are talking about \nbailing out Mexico. We have a President of the United States who \nunilaterally said that we are going to spend as much as $40 billion \nbailing out Mexico. And then we find out that most of the money is not \ngoing to go to Mexicans when they need it; it is going to go to \ncreditors.\n  It happens that the President of Mexico prior to this President, \nCarlos Salinas, did a very fine job; he did a lot to stabilize the \neconomy, so all of a sudden we had European investors, multinational \nbanks--we had investors from all over the world that heretofore would \nnot invest, would not buy Mexican debt and now they are doing it. And \nthey are getting paid high interest rates for it. All of a sudden \nsomething happened to the economy down there. They looked at dear old \nAmerica, and we have a President--I just heard something today. That \nfigure dropped down to $20 billion. It may be back up to $40 billion of \nour taxpayers' money could be impaired to bail out Mexico.\n  How many people in America know that it was not long ago, the 21st of \nOctober, that the President of the United States unilaterally said to \nNorth Korea, we are going to offer up to $4 billion of our American \ndollars to help you with a light water reactor because you promise you \nare going to get out of the nuclear business and we want to help you do \nit--$4 billion. In the meantime, until you get it built, we are going \nto give you $25 million worth of crude oil between now and the time \nthat it is built. This is taxpayers' \n [[Page S2672]] money we are talking about. How recklessly it is \nhandled.\n  Back in the real world, I had a number of businesses. I was in real \nestate development, insurance, and I was also in aviation, and here a \ncouple years ago I had the honor of becoming the first Member of \nCongress--I was serving in the other body at that time --to fly an \nairplane around the world--at his own expense. And so I did, and we \nwent across, to follow the tracks of a very famous aviator from \nOklahoma. His name was Wiley Post. Some may remember, Mr. President, he \nwas the one with the patch over one eye and you wonder how could he be \nsuch a good pilot with one eye.\n  Anyway, he flew the Winnie Mae around the world, and we were \ncelebrating in Oklahoma, since he was one of our two famous Oklahomans \nthat we are very proud of. I was going to retrace his tracks, and I \ndid. We went across Siberia, at a very unique time in history, that is, \nwhen it was still the Soviet Union but the wall was down so we were \nable to go places that no one from the United States had been in 60 \nyears since Wiley Post was there 60 years ago.\n  One place right here was Sovetski, Sovetski in Northwestern Siberia. \nSovetski is so remote that in northwestern Siberia they still harness \nreindeer as their primary mode of transportation. I landed there. I saw \none man who had not seen an American in 60 years since he saw Wiley \nPost there 60 years ago. And I spent a night there. They live in the \ncommunes we hear about. It was a beautiful, big, log structure. They \nall not only slept in the same big room; they ate in the same kitchen \nat the same table out of the same bowl. We think, well, how barbaric \nthat is by our standards. These are the happiest people I ever saw. It \nis so remote in Sovetski that they never got into anti-American \npropaganda. They did not know we were ever bad guys.\n  And so we rejoiced together, made new friendships, and I spent the \nnight in that same room, ate from the same bowl with them. I never saw \na happier bunch of people in my life up in Sovetski in northwestern \nSiberia. That was in July and the snow was on the ground then.\n  We got back, and it was not more than a month later we had a bill \nthat was going to take care of the housing needs in Russia, in that \nformer Soviet Union. I looked at it, and I saw that a lot of that money \nwas going to a little village called Sovetski in northwestern Siberia \nto help them with their housing needs.\n  Now, first of all, how presumptuous of us to say that those people in \nSovetski would want to change and adopt our way of life. They are \nperfectly happy doing what they have done for a thousand years there, \nand they were doing quite well, I thought. And yet we are going to \nspend thousands and thousands of American taxpayer dollars to help \nthose poor people in Sovetski that were so happy.\n  Wiley Post was the one who was flying the airplane when the other \nfamous Oklahoman, Will Rogers, was killed. It crashed at Point Barrow, \nAK.\n  I think that Will Rogers is one of the great philosophers of history \nand I will read a quote from Will Rogers. Keep in mind, this was in \n1934. He said: ``Lord, the money we do spend on Government. And it's \nnot one bit better than the Government we got for one-third the money \n20 years ago.''\n  Do you know what the total budget was that year, in 1934? Mr. \nPresident, $6.5 billion is what it cost. And that was three times more \nthan it was 20 years before that. So we keep growing and growing and \nspending and spending and we do not have to do that.\n  There is no group that comes into our office that tells us to spend \nless money. A study was made the first year I was in the other body, \nwhich was 1987. And they analyzed and they talked to everyone when they \ncame in the door of one particular Representative's office, and they \ndid that for the entire year. They found out that 95 percent of the \npeople who walk across the threshold of a congressional office are \nwalking across to talk to the Congressman or the Senator to convince \nhim or her to spend more money on a program. There is nobody out there \ncoming in saying we want you to spend less money; it is to spend more \nmoney. So the people who stay here in Congress year after year and \ndecade after decade, they get to thinking those are real people who are \ncoming in. They do not realize the people out in America, real America, \ndo not want that type of thing.\n  It is not the lobbyists and the individuals who come in who want \nmoney for a particular cause that are destroying us. It is the \nCongressmen in the House, and Senators in the Senate, who are voting \nfor these massive increases.\n  The balanced budget amendment will work. In the State of Oklahoma it \nworked. We put it in in 1941. I went back and read some of the debate \non the floor of the State senate in Oklahoma when we were installed, \nand some of the same arguments we are using here today they were using \nin 1941 in the State legislature. While liberals in the State \nlegislature fight it every time, every year they try to figure out ways \nto get around the balanced budget amendment in Oklahoma, they cannot do \nit.\n  Several of my liberal friends came up to me over in the other body \nwhen we were considering this a couple years ago. They said, ``You \nknow, Inhofe, I have to vote against the balanced budget amendment but \nI sure hope you get it passed.''\n  I said, ``Why is that?''\n  They said, ``That gives us an excuse so when people come in and they \nwant me to vote for a program that I know I should not vote for, I can \nsay, ``If it had not been for those guys passing the balanced budget \namendment I would do it.'''\n  I know it is difficult to cut down the size of Government. One of my \nheroes in politics--and I think many Republicans share my notion about \nthis man--was Ronald Reagan. I remember a speech that Ronald Reagan \ngave way back in 1964. I have often said that speech should be required \nreading for young people who are coming into the marketplace and into \nthe society. One of the things he said in that speech I remember so \nwell was, ``Immortality--there is nothing closer to immortality on the \nface of this Earth than a Government program once installed.''\n  That is true, because Government programs come along, at least \ntheoretically, to take care of problems that exist in the country. If \nwe have an environmental problem they form a Government agency and that \nGovernment agency comes in and says we are going to go ahead and take \ncare of this problem. Then, when the problem goes away, the Government \nagency stays.\n  I had an experience many years ago, back in 1978. I was elected to be \nmayor of the city of Tulsa, a city of about a half-million people. I \ndecided to conduct an experiment. Those cities that were large cities--\nthey used the benchmark of 250,000 people--large cities at that time \nhad a tendency to double in size every 5 years. I thought, why is this? \nWhat is the very nature of the bureaucracy? Bureaucracies want to grow.\n  I was on a radio talk show tonight and they talked about zero-based \nbudgeting. Sure, great idea. The problem is, your bureaucrats will \nmerely take a zero base, justify the budget they spent last year, and \nthen come up and say why they need to spend more this year. It is a \nstatus symbol for bureaucrats to grow. They do not want to get small; \nthey want to grow.\n  Anyway, I was the mayor of the city of Tulsa and I remember I was \ngoing to try to cut down the size of government. I knew there was a lot \nof waste so I found people who were inefficient or were not performing \na function and I would fire them. A couple of weeks would go by and I \nwould see the same people in the elevator. I would say ``I thought I \nfired you,'' and they would say, ``Well, you did, but I have been \nreinstated.''\n  Back then I found you cannot fire people for inefficiency in \ngovernment. I developed a program and started defunding agencies and \ngot them all. It worked beautifully.\n  No. 1 was a public television station. I never will forget, when I \nwas first elected a guy came up to me and said, ``Congratulations, \nMayor Inhofe, on your overwhelming victory. We are looking forward to \nhaving you as mayor of the city of Tulsa. When would you like to have \nInhofe Hour? Every month? Or every week? Or every day?''\n  I said, ``What is Inhofe Hour?''\n  He said, ``That is when we take your programs and we put it on \ntelevision, \n [[Page S2673]] on cable. We have designated a time for that purpose, \nand the people out there can know what your program is, what you are \ntrying to do as mayor of Tulsa.''\n  I said, ``You are using taxpayers' money to propagandize the \ntaxpayers.''\n  They said ``I guess it's that way.''\n  I said, ``I do not want the Inhofe Hour every month and I do not want \nthe Inhofe Hour every week or every day. As a matter of fact, I am \ngoing to defund you.''\n  And I will never forget, across that screen for several weeks was, \n``Call the mayor's office. They are trying to shut the doors of \ngovernment.''\n  But you see, we did it anyway and it worked. We went through 5 years \nof holding government stable in terms of the size and the cost of \ngovernment and expanding services at the same time. If you can do it in \nTulsa, OK, and you can have a balanced budget amendment in the State of \nOklahoma, you can certainly do it in our Federal Government.\n  The eighth statement that was made was, ``Senators are sent here to \nmake intelligent and well-informed decisions on the people's behalf. \nHow can they do that without the details?'' They are bringing up that \nsame argument again and again.\n  They do it by looking at the record of the last 40 years. Nobody gave \nus the details when 40 years ago we started spending money that future \ngenerations are going to have to pay back. No one give us any details \nwhen we ran up a debt of $4.8 trillion. All they told us was the great \nthings they were doing by opening the Federal Treasury, time and time \nagain. Now we find a crisis which threatens the future, especially that \nof our children.\n  The balanced budget amendment is not a fly-by-night thing. It is not \nsomething that just was thought of recently. It is something that has \nbeen with us for a long time. I think someone may have already said \nthis on the floor during this debate. Keep in mind, we are in the 12th \nday of debating the balanced budget amendment, the same one that passed \nthe other body over there in 2 days.\n  Someone, I think, already mentioned the fact that a great Democrat, \nThomas Jefferson, many years ago was not here, as many thought he was, \nduring the construction of the Constitution. I believe he was in France \nat the time. When he got back over here he made a statement and said \nthat if I could have one thing I would improve in this great document, \nthe Constitution of America, it would be a mechanism that would \nprohibit Government from borrowing money. That was Thomas Jefferson.\n  It has been around for a long time. The first time I was exposed to \nthe balanced budget amendment was many years ago when there was a very \nconservative and well-known U.S. Senator from the great State of \nNebraska by the name of Senator Carl Curtis. Carl Curtis had an idea. \nCarl Curtis said, ``What we need to do is get the point across to the \npeople in Congress, in both Houses of Congress, that Americans want to \nhave a balanced budget amendment.'' He said, ``I have devised a way to \ndo it and, State senator out in Oklahoma, I want you to help me.'' He \ncame out in Oklahoma and this is what we did. We put together a program \nwhere we would preratify--since it takes three-quarters of the States \nto ratify the Constitution--we would preratify it by passing a \nresolution saying we are ratifying it the second it passes the U.S. \nCongress.\n  We started the first one in Oklahoma. I introduced the resolution. It \nsays: We hereby ratify the balanced budget amendment that will be \npassed in the U.S. Congress. In fact, this is the first one that was \nthere. There was a guy, Anthony Kerrigan, who was a syndicated \ncolumnist at that time. He wrote a column--this is 22 years ago. He \ncalled it ``A Voice in the Wilderness.''\n\n       Way out in Oklahoma the State senators have found a way to \n     balance the Federal budget.\n\n  By the way, that was 1972. The total debt in 1972 was $240 billion. I \nremember when the National Taxpayers Union, or one group like that, \nthey had an ad on television. They were trying to impress upon the \npeople of America how significant $240 billion was. That was our debt \nat that time. Today it is $4.8 trillion. It was $240 billion. So they \ntook $100 bills and started stacking them up until they were the height \nof the Waldorf Astoria. That was a high building in those days. That \nwas to impress upon people how significant it was that our debt had \nreached the level of $240 billion. The deficit that year, by the way, \nwas $15 billion.\n  I hope that if nothing else is accomplished from the debate that is \ntaking place in both bodies on the balanced budget amendment, that the \npeople of America are now so much better informed as to what is really \ngoing on when we talk about the deficit and the debt. We are talking \nabout two different things. They are hardly related to each other \nbecause the deficit increases the debt.\n  Let me get to the ninth argument. I want to expand on that in just a \nminute. This was a rather long argument that was made. Argument No. 9:\n\n       The proponents talk of the balanced budget amendment, talk \n     about the public opinion. Years ago Talleyrand said, ``There \n     is more wisdom in public opinion than is to be found in \n     Napoleon, Voltaire, or all the ministers of state, present or \n     to come.''\n\n  But this is true only to the extent that public opinion is informed \nopinion. In the case of the balanced budget amendment public opinion is \nnot informed. Even Senators do not know the details.\n  I see this as an insult to the people of America because people are \ninformed. But you know, he was right when he said that there is more \nwisdom in public opinion than there is to be found in all of the great \nleaders. But this is not about details. This is about responsibility. I \nwould submit that Talleyrand was right. There is more wisdom in public \nopinion than is to be found in the President, the Vice President, the \nentire Cabinet, and all of the rest of the ministers of the Clinton \nadministration along with the Democratic Party who are all out lobbying \nagainst the passage of the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  The fact is the public is informed. People know that we cannot get \nserious and have a discussion about details unless we first make the \ncommitment that we are going to pass a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, and that we cannot spend more money than is coming in.\n  I am glad that the Senator brought up Talleyrand because he was a \nbrilliant guy. If you remember, Talleyrand was the French foreign \nminister during the Napoleonic stage. One of the quotes was, ``It seems \nto me, sir, to be the beginning of the end.''\n  You know, I think he was right. I think this is the beginning of the \nend of big spenders in Congress in America.\n  He said, ``Speech was given to man to disguise his thoughts.''\n  I have seen a lot of that around here, too. I have seen a lot of \nSenators and Representatives making statements about all the bad things \nthat were going to happen and all the trauma that would exist if we \npassed the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Yet they know \nbetter. They know this has to be done.\n  Talleyrand also said, ``Throw mud, throw mud. Some of it may stick.'' \nWe have seen a lot of that in the last 12 days. Throw mud and hope some \nof it will stick.\n  But lastly, Talleyrand said--I kind of like this one; this is neat. \nHe said, ``The wine is drawn. The wine is drawn. It must be drunk.''\n  I think what he was saying there is there comes a time when action \nhas to take place. That time has come. The wine is drawn, it must be \ndrunk. There are some partisan Republicans who have come up to me, and \nI probably should not divulge this. They said, ``If you were half as \nsmart, you would let the Democrats defeat the balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution. Then in 1996, we would wipe out everybody in \noffice who voted against you.'' I guess looking at it from a purely \npartisan perspective, maybe that is the right way to do it. I do not \nbelieve that. I believe the Democrats and Republicans alike are going \nto respond to the people who are out there. But it is time. We cannot \ngo any longer. We are going to have to do something.\n  There was a very famous person 150 years ago that came over to the \nUnited States of America. His name was Alexis de Tocqueville. A lot of \npeople do not know this. But de Tocqueville came over here to study our \nsystem. When he got here he was so impressed with the \n [[Page S2674]] wealth of this Nation, with the fact that people could \nwork and take home the products of their own labors, and that that had \nproduced an incredible wealth that had not been dreamed of any time in \nthe history of the world. It was all happening right here in this new \nworld. But he was a very intelligent man. And de Tocqueville wrote a \nbook about the wealth of this country. I am paraphrasing. He said once \nthe people of this country find they can vote themselves money out of \nthe public trust, the system will fail.\n  Are we almost there now? Yes, we are. They say that when that moment \ncomes, it is when you have the majority of people on the receiving end \nof government and the system will fail because productivity will be \ngone.\n  The 10th argument that has been used by the well-meaning Senators, \nthose who are very articulate, is one that I hope you will listen to \nvery carefully, Mr. President. They said:\n\n       The 1990 and the 1993 budget deals worked. The way to deal \n     with the deficit is to continue the successful deficit \n     reduction efforts of the last 5 years.\n\n  This is a Senator saying this on this floor.\n\n       Since 1990, we have achieved over $900 billion in deficit \n     reduction. We did not do it with a balanced budget amendment. \n     But we did it with two major budget agreements, detailed \n     blueprints which raised revenues, cut expenditures, and made \n     hard choices. These budgets were on the table. All the \n     details were fully debated.\n\n  Remember they said the 1990 and the 1993 budget deals worked, the \nsuccessful deficit reduction efforts of the last 5 years.\n  This is the big problem we have in America. A lot of people believe \nthat stuff. We have a President of the United States who stood up in \nthe State of the Union Message and talked about all of this deficit \nreduction. Yet, while he is in there, every day the debt goes higher \nand higher and higher. Please do not think I am disrespectful when I \ntalk about our President.\n  Teddy Roosevelt said:\n\n       Patriotism means stand by your country. It does not mean \n     stand by the President of the United States or any other \n     elected official, save exactly the degree that he stands by \n     his country. It is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the same \n     degree that he by inefficiency or otherwise fails to stand by \n     his country.\n\n  So we have a President who stands up and he passes these things. The \nfirst one we cannot hang on him. That was 1990. George Bush was \nPresident of the United States at that time. Several of us watched as \nhe tried to accommodate the Democrats out at Andrews Air Force Base, \nwhen he had the Budget Committees from the House and the Senate out \nthere saying, if you do not do this, we are not going to go along with \nany of your programs. And, finally, President Bush decided that he \nwould agree to a tax increase, right after he had said in the campaign \n``Read my lips.'' Look what happened. That was the cause of his demise. \nEverybody knows that. He knows it himself. He knows he should not have \ndone that. But it was a judgment call made in good faith, trying to get \nalong, trying to reach a bipartisan agreement on a budget. And he \nagreed to a tax increase when he did not need to do a tax increase.\n  I do not like all of this talk about what they talk about when they \nsay that we cut the deficit. There is an article by the way, Mr. \nPresident. You ought to read it. I bet you have not read it yet. I \nbelieve it was in the December 1993 Reader's Digest, and the name of \nthe article was ``Budget Baloney.'' Then in this article he describes, \nin a better way than I have ever seen it described before, just how we \nare able to tell it to the people at home that we are doing something \nand not let them really know what we are doing. He says, let us say a \nguy who has $5,000 wants a $10,000 car. He says, ``What I really want \nis a $15,000 car. So I will settle on a $10,000 car. I've just cut the \ndeficit by $5,000.'' That is the losing game that we have been playing \naround here. The argument that we have had success in these budget \ndeals is laughable. It has been a dismal failure. Yet, this is the \nstrongest argument that they keep coming up with over and over again.\n  The budget deals were the largest tax increases in this Nation's \nhistory. The one in 1993 passed by one vote in the Senate and one vote \nin the House. It was against overwhelming public opposition. It helped \nlead to the Republican revolution of November 8, 1994. In fact, it was \ncharacterized as the largest tax-and-spend increase in the history of \nAmerica or in public finance in America or any place in the world.\n  Let me repeat that: The largest tax and spend increase in the history \nof public finance in America or anyplace in the world. Those are not \nthe words of conservative Republican Senator Jim Inhofe; those are the \nwords of the Democrat Senator who was chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee. Yet, this is used as an example of how we ought to behave in \nthe future--to continue to pass these tax increases and spending \nincreases and meanwhile the deficits go up and up and up.\n  Let me give you some specific figures. The 1993 Clinton budget deal, \nbetween the years 1994 and 1998, those 5 years, would increase the debt \nby $1.4 trillion. How many people in America know that--with all this \ntalk about deficit reduction--if we do his budget deal from 1994 and \ncarry it through to his projections through 1998, it would increase the \ndebt by $1.4 trillion. If we go on up to the year 2000, it increases \nthe debt by $2.1 trillion. In 1990, the same thing was true at that \ntime. We had a budget deal that was made to go, over a period of 10 \nyears, from 1990 to the year 2000, to $3.5 trillion.\n  Mr. President, this is the last argument that has been used by \nSenators who are opposed to a balanced budget and specifically to the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. The argument is that the \nbalanced budget amendment is nothing more than a slogan, an empty \npromise, and that most Senators who support it will not even be here in \nthe year 2002 when it will take effect. Let me respond by saying that \nif the Senators vote against it, they are not going to be here at the \nend of their term.\n  I would like to, for a moment, give you a profile of those \nindividuals who are opposed to the balanced budget amendment. If you \nlook over here at the chart, we defeated the Right-To-Know Act. These \nare the supporters, the cosponsors. There were 41 cosponsors to the \nRight-To-Know Act. Of those 41 cosponsors, all 41 of them voted for the \n$16 billion stimulus plan, which was the largest single spending \nincrease under one vote, and they also are rated by the National \nTaxpayers Union a ``D'' or an ``F.'' A lot of people do not realize \nthat there are many rating organizations in Washington.\n  I never remember anyone going out and running for office saying ``I \nwant to increase your taxes and increase spending.'' But when they get \nup here, that is exactly what they do. How is a voter to know how they \nare performing? Look at how they are rated. The National Taxpayers \nUnion takes spending bills and says how we are rated in conjunction \nwith the spending bills. If you look at those who wanted to kill the \nbalanced budget amendment by having the right-to-know amendment on it, \nthose individuals, all of them, voted for this $16 billion stimulus \nprogram.\n  Let me just tell you what that stimulus program had in it. That \nprogram was a $16.3 billion increase in spending; $500 million for \nshortfalls in the District of Columbia budget; for Federal agency staff \nincreases; $1 billion for summer jobs; $1.1 billion for programs for \nhousing programs; for AIDS treatment; $1.2 billion for Amtrak \nsubsidies; $2.5 billion for pork-barrel community programs such as \nswimming pools, parking lots, ice rink, warming huts, alpine ski lifts, \nand other pork-barrel projects. That was $3 billion for various rich \nprojects located strategically in various districts of those Members of \nCongress who went along with all of this.\n  Those are the individuals who voted for and who were cosponsors of \nthe Right-To-Know Act. I do not say this in a disparaging way about \nthese people, but you have to know who is opposed to the balanced \nbudget amendment. The other chart we have, I think, addresses what this \nSenator--it happened to be the Senator from West Virginia that said \nmost Members of Congress were not going to be around in 2002. This is \nwhy I say if they do not vote for this, they are not going to be around \nanyway. It does not matter. If you look very carefully, we not only had \nthe spending bill increase, but the 1993 tax increase was the one that \nincluded a $267 billion tax increase and \n [[Page S2675]] still would increase the debt by $1.4 trillion.\n  There are eight Senators who are not here today who were here before. \nAll eight of these Senators voted ``yes'' on the spending bill \nincrease. All eight of the Senators voted ``yes'' on the Clinton tax \nincreases--or seven out of eight of them. All eight of them have a \n``D'' or an ``F'' rating by the National Taxpayers Union. In the House \nof Representatives, the same thing is true there.\n  So the conclusions I come to after having said all of this is that \nthis is a war. This is the chance that we have to change all of this. \nAnd those of us who have been working for a balanced budget, by virtue \nof adding a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, are not just \nconsidering what is happening to us today but to future generations.\n  Every dollar we spend now we are borrowing from future generations. \nThat is why I have this picture. I will introduce you to these two \npeople. This little girl is 21 months old. Her name is Maggie Inhofe. \nThis little boy is 22 months old. His name is Glade Inhofe. They \nhappen, by coincidence, to be my grandchildren. If we do not pass this, \nthe CBO has said that during their lifetime--and there are 10 million \nmore their age in America right now--they will have to spend 82 percent \nof their lifetime income on Government.\n  This is our chance to take them out of their bondage and their \nchains. I really believe now that Talleyrand was right. He said, ``The \nwine is drawn, it must be drunk.'' The time is here to pass a balanced \nbudget to the Constitution and to turn our future generations free.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/14/senate-section/article/S2669-4", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECESS UNTIL TOMORROW AT 9:30 A.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams).
