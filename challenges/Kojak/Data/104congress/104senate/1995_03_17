Mr. President, I wish to thank the able Senator from \nArizona.\n  Earlier this week, the administration announced that Croatia has \nagreed to allow U.N. peacekeeping troops to remain beyond the \nexpiration of the U.N. mandate on March 31. If the United Nations had \nbeen forced to leave, fighting would probably have broken out between \nthe Croatian Government and the Croation Serbs who control the Krajina \nregion of Croatia. This would have reignited the conflict in Croatia, \nand it no doubt would have spread to Bosnia and the rest of the region.\n  I have often been critical of the Clinton administration's inept \ndiplomacy that has produced one foreign policy debacle after another. \nBut in this case the administration deserves credit for persistence in \na very difficult situation. I agree with Vice President Gore that the \nconcession by Croatia's President Tudjman is ``* * * a major step away \nfrom war and toward peace.''\n  We have narrowly averted disaster--for the moment. But let us not \ncongratulate ourselves too warmly or prematurely. If we are not \ncareful, this limited and temporary success may breed a high degree of \ncomplacency, and blind us to the larger, impending crisis in the \nBalkans. As always, we seem to be reacting only to the crisis \nimmediately at hand, instead of thinking ahead. While we still have a \nfew weeks or at most 2 months, we had better start preparing for what \nmay happen in Bosnia. Failure to anticipate and prepare now could lead \nto disaster later on.\n  We are facing two deadlines. The most urgent deadline of course is \nthe expiration of the U.N. mandate in Croatia on March 31. For the \nmoment the situation in Croatia appears under control, even though the \nunderlying problem that led President Tudjman to request the United \nNations departure in the first place has not been solved. That problem \nis a de facto division of the country. The Krajina region, nearly one-\nthird of the country, is under Serb control. Understandably the \nCroatian Government does not want to accept a\n partition that could harden into permanence. Although the continued \nU.N. presence in Croatia gives us some breathing space, it will not end \nSerbian domination of the Krajina or guarantee the end of conflict \nbetween Croatian forces and the Krajina Serbs. After all, there are \nplenty of U.N. troops in Bosnia, and they have not prevented fighting \nbetween the Bosnian Government and Bosnian Serbs.\n\n  The second looming deadline is May 1, the end of the temporary truce \nand current contact group negotiations in Bosnia. The present \nnegotiations may be the last chance for a peaceful settlement. I hope \nand pray they are successful, but I fear this contact group effort may \nprove as fruitless as all the others. Furthermore, May marks the \narrival of warm weather and the traditional resumption of military \ncampaigns. If the people of this troubled region once again choose war \nover peace, we, in the Congress and the administration, are going to be \nfaced with some very difficult choices. We had better start thinking \ndispassionately about those choices now, and not wait until we are \noverwhelmed by the passions of the conflict and terrible images of \nviolence.\n  If a general conflict erupts again across the region, the U.N. \npeacekeeping mission--UNPROFOR--could find itself in extreme danger. \nThe administration has agreed to provide military assistance, including \nU.S. combat troops, to help cover the withdrawal of UNPROFOR if it \nshould prove necessary. I have always opposed a general intervention in \nBosnia with United States ground forces. But an UNPROFOR withdrawal is \nan entirely different situation. With the deepest reluctance I will \nsupport U.S. participation in a NATO mission to cover the withdrawal of \nUNPROFOR.\n  The United States cannot stand idly by if U.N. troops from allied \nnations find themselves in mortal danger. The damage to U.S. \nleadership, honor, prestige, and credibility would be beyond \ncalculation. Some will say that honor, prestige, and credibility are \nonly words, empty words; that they are not worth the lives of young \nAmericans who will have to go into the Balkans. It is true that leaders \noften misuse these words to manipulate public opinion on behalf of \nquestionable causes. But they do have meaning, as ``justice'' and \n``liberty'' are words that have deep meaning, and are\n words that we live by. Credibility, prestige, and national honor are \nstill essential components of national security, as they have always \nbeen. They are especially important if we are to exercise the moral \nleadership expected of the world's only superpower.\n\n  If we want to remain secure in today's violent and chaotic world, we \nmust never permit any doubts in the minds of friends or enemies that \nour word is good, or that we can be relied upon to stand with our \nallies, or that we will keep our commitments. The credibility that \ncomes from demonstrated steadfastness of purpose is a key aspect of \ndeterrence. It is an essential though intangible element of global \npower and of the necessary relations between states. A great nation \ncannot remain great very long without it.\n  Therefore, I will support the participation of U.S. troops in such an \noperation, but only under certain conditions.\n  First, it must be a NATO operation, totally under NATO command. Once \nour troops are committed on the ground and to potential combat, we \ncannot tolerate the so-called dual-key arrangement between the United \nNations and NATO. This violates the most basic principle of sound \nmilitary operations--unity of command. Unless the dual-key relationship \nis completely scrapped and replaced with clear lines of command and \ncontrol under NATO, I will vigorously oppose U.S. participation in the \nwithdrawal.\n  This unified command authority must be established in advance. All \ngovernments with forces involved, and all UNPROFOR officers and NATO \ncommanders at every level, must understand before the operation begins \nthat NATO will be in charge, even in zones where the withdrawal proves \npeaceful.\n  Second, the rules of engagement must not place any limitations on the \nuse of force to protect the withdrawal. It must be clear to all parties \nto the conflict that we will not tolerate any attacks on NATO or on \nUNPROFOR. Any attack must be met with massive, overwhelming force; and \nnot merely on the attacking forces, but on the offending party's \nmilitary and logistical capabilities wherever they may be hit.\n  We must also remember that while the Serbs are the primary aggressors \nand have committed the most atrocities, none of the parties in this \nconflict have clean hands. NATO and U.S. ground commanders must be \nalert to provocations from all sides. They\n must anticipate and respond appropriately to attacks from one party \nintended to blame another, and be careful not to retaliate against the \nwrong party.\n\n  Third, the scope and duration of the withdrawal must be limited. I do \nnot advocate a date certain for ending it. It must end promptly when \nall UNPROFOR and NATO troops are safely out. We must be especially \ncareful not to allow the withdrawal mission to be transformed at some \npoint into peace enforcement or a broadened combat mission that results \nin a general, prolonged engagement with Serbs, Croats, or Bosnians--as \nwe learned to our great cost in Somalia.\n  Fourth, we need to make it abundantly clear that a U.S./NATO rescue \nmission is not a blank check to the United Nations for the future. I \nbelieve the United Nations and our allies have been too eager to commit \nto dubious peace operations. The Bosnian dilemma is a result of such \nill-conceived policies. The United States cannot rush to the rescue \nevery time our allies find themselves in a tight corner because they \ndid not consider the consequences of a misguided peace operation in \nadvance, or took our help for granted. Our diplomacy and statecraft \nmust make sure we are not faced with such a terrible choice ever again.\n  The diplomatic success in Croatia has bought us some time. Let us use \nit wisely, and make sure the Congress and the administration are \nworking together to face whatever crisis may come in the Balkans. Above \nall, let us use it to prepare the American people \n[[Page S4123]] for the possibility that our soldiers may have to go \ninto combat to rescue our allies; and that may not be without risk.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on March 10, the columnist Charles \nKrauthammer had a column in the Washington Post entitled ``Social \nSecurity Trust Fund Whopper.'' The gist of his column, which really was \nan attack on Senator Dorgan and myself for our role in the balanced \nbudget amendment debate, was to suggest that it does not really matter \nwhether you take Social Security trust fund moneys or not.\n  His argument was, in the first case, that Social Security is a pay-\nas-you-go system.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Krauthammer is just flat wrong. Social Security is \nnot a pay-as-you-go system. He must have missed completely the 1983 \nact, because in that legislation Social Security was taken off a pay-\nas-you-go system. It was taken off the pay-as-you-go system because \nthere was a general recognition that we had the baby boomer generation \ncoming along, and that if we stayed on pay-as-you-go--and for those who \nperhaps are not familiar with the language that we use around here with \nrespect to pay-as-you-go, that simply means you raise the amount of \nmoney necessary in any one year to fund the benefits in any one year.\n  In 1983, that was all changed. We took Social Security off pay-as-\nyou-go. We did it for the purpose I earlier described, the purpose of \ngetting ready for the baby boom generation, the time when the number of \nSocial Security eligible people will double in this country. And so in \n1983 we set a course of running surpluses in Social Security. The idea \nwas to save that money in preparation for the time when the baby boom \ngeneration retires. And for that reason, in the most recent year, we \nhave run a $69 billion surplus in Social Security.\n  Obviously, if we were pay-as-you-go, there would be no surplus, but \nthere is a surplus and there are continuing surpluses. If those funds \nare used to balance the operating budget of the Federal Government, \nthen obviously they will not be available when it comes time to pay out \nbenefits to those who have made payments on the promise that they would \nget benefits when they retire.\n  Mr. President, the second major error in Mr. Krauthammer's column is \nhe suggests it does not really matter from where you borrow.\n  It makes a great deal of difference. It makes a difference because \nSocial Security is financed by a dedicated tax, a tax that is levied on \nemployers and employees in this country to fund Social Security. That \nis a regressive tax. It is a payroll tax. Mr. President, 73 percent of \nAmerican taxpayers pay more in Social Security taxes than they pay in \nincome taxes. It matters a good deal whether or not one takes those \nfunds and uses them for other Government expenses rather than saving \nthem for the purposes for which they were intended.\n  The difference it makes, I think, can be most easily explained with a \nsimple example, one perhaps closer to home to Mr. Krauthammer himself. \nLet us say he works for the Washington Post, gets paid by them, puts \npart of his money into a retirement account, and the Washington Post \nfalls on hard times. It runs into a situation in which they are losing \nmoney. Instead of moving to honestly balance their budget, they go raid \nthe trust funds, the retirement funds of their employees, including Mr. \nKrauthammer. As we say in our answer yesterday in the Washington Post \nto his column, then ``. . . even [Mr.] Krauthammer might understand the \nfallacy of looting trust funds to pay [the] operating expenses [of a \ncompany.]'' Because then he would be directly affected.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na column Senator Dorgan and I wrote in answer to Mr. Krauthammer, that \nappeared in the Washington Post of yesterday.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 16, 1995]\n\n                             Unfair Looting\n\n                  (By Byron L. Dorgan and Kent Conrad)\n\n       Charles Krauthammer's uninformed defense of an indefensible \n     practice [``Social Security Trust Fund Whopper,'' op-ed, \n     March 10] demonstrates that is is possible to be a celebrated \n     pundit yet know nothing of the subject about which one is \n     writing.\n       In attacking us for our position on the balanced-budget \n     amendment, Krauthammer misses the mark by a country mile on \n     two very important points. First, he insists incorrectly that \n     ``Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system'' that ``produces \n     a cash surplus'' because ``so many boomers are working \n     today.'' Second, he ignores the fact that Social Security \n     revenues were never meant to pay for expenses incurred in the \n     federal operating budget. Missing both fundamental points \n     undermines the credibility of Krauthammer's conclusions.\n       Here are the facts:\n       First, Social Security is not a pay-as-you-go system. If it \n     were, Social Security benefits would exactly equal taxes, and \n     there would be no surpluses. But there are. This year alone \n     Social Security is running a $69 billion surplus.\n       Apparently, Krauthammer completely missed the 1983 Social \n     Security Reform Act, which removed the system from a pay-as-\n     you-go basis. In 1983 Congress recognized that in order to \n     prepare for the future retirement needs of the baby boom \n     generation, we should raise more money from payroll taxes now \n     than is needed for current Social Security benefits. We did \n     that because when the baby boomers retire, there will not be \n     enough working Americans to cover Social Security benefits on \n     a pay-as-you-go basis. We will need accumulated surpluses to \n     pay these benefits.\n       Second, Social Security revenue is collected from the \n     paychecks of working men and women in the form of a dedicated \n     Social Security tax, deposited in a trust fund and invested \n     in government securities. This regressive, burdensome tax \n     (almost 73 percent of Americans who pay taxes pay more in \n     social insurance taxes than in income taxes) isn't like other \n     taxes. It has a specific use--retirement--as part of the \n     contract this nation made 60 years ago with working \n     Americans.\n       Because this tax is dedicated solely for working Americans' \n     future retirement, it shouldn't be used either for balancing \n     the operating budget or masking the size of the budget \n     deficit. Krauthammer not only irresponsibly condones the use \n     of the Social Security surpluses to do these things, he \n     thinks we should enshrine this procedure in our Constitution.\n       He apparently does so because he doesn't understand the \n     difference between balancing an operating budget and using \n     dishonest accounting gimmicks to hide operating losses. To \n     illustrate the difference and how it works to loot the Social \n     Security trust funds, let's use an example a little closer to \n     home for Krauthammer.\n       Assume that Krauthammer is paid a lucrative salary by The \n     Washington Post, which puts part of that salary into a \n     company retirement plan. Then let's assume The Washington \n     Post comes upon hard times and starts losing money each year.\n       Here's where honesty matters. The Post has two choices. It \n     could face up to its problems and move to balance its budget. \n     Or it could follow Krauthammer's prescription and disguise \n     its shortfall by raiding the employees' retirement fund to \n     make it appear that the operating budget is balanced. Of \n     course, the retirement fund would have nothing but IOUs in it \n     when it comes time for Krauthammer to retire. At that point, \n     even Krauthammer might recognize the fallacy of looting trust \n     funds to pay operating expenses.\n       Absurd? Sure. But the flawed Republican balanced-budget \n     amendment plan would in the same way keep on looting Social \n     Security trust funds to balance the federal operating budget. \n     instead, we should take the honest course and begin the work \n     now to bring our federal operating budget into balance \n     without raiding the Social Security trust funds.\n       Contrary to Krauthammer's assertion, the only fraudulent \n     point about this issue was his uninformed column.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague from Arizona \nas well for this time. I appreciate his giving me this time this \nmorning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from North Dakota, who \nis still on the floor, I think we have a significant difference of \nopinion here between himself, his other colleague from North Dakota, \nand Mr. Krauthammer. I suggest we set up some kind of debate scenario--\none of the talk shows or one of the Sunday programs. I think it \n[[Page S4124]] would be very valuable to the American people to hear \nboth sides. I am sure Mr. Krauthammer would agree to such a scenario \nand I would be glad to help set it up. Because it is a very important, \nfundamental issue we are discussing.\n  I know the Senator from North Dakota and his colleague from North \nDakota have very strongly held views on this issue. I think, because \nthe balanced budget amendment will come up again, that it is very \nimportant we continue this debate. I yield to the Senator from North \nDakota if he would wish to respond.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. I like \nthat idea. In fact, I think we ought to have a debate about this all \nover the country. I think it would provide a real education to the \nAmerican people as how the finances of Government actually work. I \nthink if people understood that we were talking about putting into the \nConstitution of the United States a policy that would take retirement \ntrust fund moneys and use them to balance the operating budget that \nthey would say that is not a good principle, not a good policy to put \nin the Constitution.\n  Senator Dorgan and I both come from financial backgrounds, as the \nSenator from Arizona knows. It is perhaps for that reason that we are \nmost sensitive to this notion of using trust fund moneys for the \noperating expenses of the Government or the operating expenses of any \ninstitution. If we were in the private sector and anybody stood up and \nsuggested, ``I have a plan to balance the budget of this company. I \nknow we have been running deficits. The answer I have come up with is \nto take the retirement funds and throw them into the pot,'' that person \nwould be on their way to a Federal facility and it would not be the \nCongress of the United States. They would be on their way to jail \nbecause that is fraud.\n  I feel very strongly about this question. I think as the American \npeople have a chance to learn more about this question they will \nconclude that is not the way we want to conduct our business. But that \ndoes not take away for one moment from the need to balance the budget. \nWe have an urgent need to do it, whether or not we have a balanced \nbudget amendment. Frankly, I think a balanced budget amendment would \nhelp if it was properly crafted. But if we do not have one we still \nhave to get about the business of balancing this budget.\n  I know that is something the Senator from Arizona believes. I \nrecognize the Senator from Illinois, who is here, who is the moving \nsponsor of the balanced budget amendment. Nobody is more dedicated, \nmore sincere, or more serious about addressing this problem because he \nrecognizes, as I think the Senator from Arizona does, and as I do, that \nif we do not do it, if we do not balance the budget, we are going to be \nin deep trouble in the years ahead. We are heading for a circumstance, \naccording to the Entitlements Commission, where in the year 2012, every \nnickel of Federal revenue goes for entitlements and the interest on the \ndebt. Obviously we cannot do that.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to in just one second, as soon as I \nrespond to the Senator from North Dakota, if I might say to my friend \nfrom Illinois.\n  I certainly hope the Senator from North Dakota realizes that we \ncannot balance the budget even if we had a balanced budget amendment, \nwhich I believe we eventually will, without a line-item veto for the \nPresident of the United States. I look forward to working with him on \nthis issue.\n  Since the distinguished Democratic leader is here on the floor, I \nwould like to say to him I saw his remarks on C-SPAN this morning. I \nappreciate his spirit of willingness to work together. We want to work \ntogether with the minority leader. I think the minority leader's \nstatement, the statement of the Senator from South Dakota, that we are \nin agreement that a line-item veto is necessary, is a very important \nand helpful statement.\n  I apologize to him if he feels there has not been enough consultation \nwith his side of the aisle. I intend to engage in that consultation as \nwe shape the so-called substitute which will really be the subject of \ndebate next week. I hope he understands that there were some \nsignificant differences on this side of the aisle. My friend from \nAlaska will articulate those in his usual forceful and persuasive \nfashion. So I hope he understands we first had to get a significant \nconsensus on this side.\n  I look forward to working with him as we work toward the goal which \nhe so eloquently stated this morning is important for America and the \nbalanced budget.\n  Before the distinguished minority leader speaks, I think the Senator \nfrom Illinois wanted to make remarks?\n  Mr. SIMON. Yes, Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  If I may, this will sound like a politician talking when I say I \nthink Senator Conrad and Charles Krauthammer each has a very valid \npoint. The point that Senator Conrad makes that we should be balancing \nthe budget without using the Social Security trust fund to do so I \nthink is a very valid point, and it is a point that he and his \ncolleague, Senator Dorgan, have made very forcefully.\n  The point Mr. Krauthammer makes is that the great threat to Social \nSecurity is debt, because we are headed toward monetizing our debt and \ndevaluing our dollar. We are headed down the Mexican route right now. \nThe only way I see of stopping that is the balanced budget amendment.\n  So, what I favor is passing that balanced budget amendment. I hope, \nsomehow, we can get some statutory modifications that can satisfy some \nwho, like Senator Conrad, are very genuinely sincerely concerned about \nthe Social Security trust funds and protecting them. His point is \nvalid. The Krauthammer point, that the real threat to Social Security \nis debt, is also a very valid point.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona for yielding.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is controlling \ntiming.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Illinois \nfor his usual excellent standard of understanding both points of view. \nThat is one of the reasons he has been so helpful in many an issue \naround here.\n  I would say to the Senator from North Dakota, if I may, we are on the \nline-item veto. I know the minority leader is here and the Senator from \nAlaska has been waiting to speak.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I just ask for 30 seconds to make an \nobservation?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Sure. I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I just wanted to say in response to the \nSenator from Illinois, I believe Krauthammer is partially right. Debt \nis a significant threat to Social Security. But there is a second \nthreat. The second threat is raiding the trust funds to cover operating \nexpenses.\n  Just as a financial principle, I do not think we want to put in the \nConstitution that taking trust fund money to pay for operating expenses \nis the right way to go.\n  I agree completely with the Senator from Illinois on the debt being a \nsignificant threat to Social Security as it is to the economic future \nof our country. That is the underlying problem that fundamentally we \nmust address and I think we have an obligation, especially when we talk \nabout the Constitution of the United States, to do it in an honest way.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield for 1 minute?\n  Mr. McCAIN. If my friend from Illinois will promise me that will be \nthe end of this debate on the balanced budget amendment, I will yield.\n  Mr. SIMON. I promise.\n  Mr. President, let me say to my friend from North Dakota that the \nbalanced budget amendment does not get into all kinds of details. The \nbalanced budget amendment does not change one iota from the way we \nhandle the trust funds right now. It does not change our present \npractice. I favor statutorily changing it. I agree with Mr. Krauthammer \nthat the great threat to Social Security is debt. I think any real \nanalysis has to come to that conclusion. But I favor statutory \nprotection along the lines that Senator Conrad suggested.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation as far \nas \n[[Page S4125]] the division of time remaining is concerned?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Arizona \nthat he has 2 hours and 2 minutes under his control and the Senator \nfrom South Dakota has 2 hours and 28 minutes under his control.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the distinguished Democratic leader has \nkindly consented to allow Senator Stevens, who has been on the floor, \nto speak before him. I would like to yield such time as he may consume \nto the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. I \nreiterate to my good friend, the minority leader, that I would be \npleased to recognize his right to the floor if he wishes to take it. I \nwill be happy to defer to the leader, if he wants to proceed. Very \nwell. Thank you very much. I also thank, Mr. President, my friend from \nArizona.\n  Mr. President, next week the Senate will proceed to legislation to \ngive the President a line-item veto over any item that is in an \nappropriations measure. I think the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from Indiana, as I said last night, deserve a great deal of \ncredit for pressing forward on this matter.\n  In the last Congress I voted twice for a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that would support the concept of a line-item veto. If a \ncloture vote is needed to proceed to this bill, I intend to vote for \ncloture on the motion so that the bill may be considered on the floor. \nIt is my hope--I have been expressing that hope rather forcefully, as \nthe Senator from Arizona has indicated, in conferences we have had on \nthe bill--that the bill will be amended to include the other major \nforms of spending of our taxpayers' money: first, entitlements, and, \nsecond, targeted tax benefits. Those two forms of spending, as well as \nappropriations, I think lead at times to items that could be, and \nshould be, eliminated by the President with a line-item veto.\n  I intend to vote for cloture on the bill and for the bill itself if \nit is amended so that it covers the full realm of Federal spending. I \nthink we have to be serious about giving the President new tools to cut \nthe deficit. As a matter of fact, during this very critical period of \nour history, I think the President should have a series of tools so \nthat he cannot put the blame on Congress for an increase in the deficit \nas we have seen in the past.\n  By expanding this bill to allow the President to veto provisions in \nauthorizing bills that create new entitlements and to delete revenue \nmeasures that might give a tax break to individuals or special groups, \nI think we will give the President the ability to stop some of the red \nink that has poured money out of the Treasury through otherwise hidden \nprovisions.\n  According to the President's budget request for 1996, discretionary \ndefense, international, and domestic spending will account for 34 \npercent of the budget. Direct spending through entitlements like \nMedicare, food stamps, Social Security, other mandatory spending \nprograms, will account for 50 percent of the budget. Interest on the \ndebt will be about 16 percent of the budget. If this bill is not \nexpanded to allow the President to veto new entitlement programs or \nadditions to existing direct spending programs, the new tools would be \nlimited, and about 50 percent of the total spending would be put off \nlimits. I have in the past tried to bring about changes so that these \nline-item veto bills would include all areas of spending. I am hopeful \nthat we are coming close to that now.\n  If you look at the income tax area, both personal and corporate, that \naccounts for about 49 percent of the projected revenue base for the \nnext year, 1996. Excise taxes account for 7 percent. Social Security \nincome and the borrowing account for the remainder of the Federal \nrevenue stream. But each time Congress provides a special break for \nsome individual or corporation through a transition rule or target tax \nprovision, it effectively reduces revenue and, therefore, increases the \ndeficit.\n  I believe the President ought to be able to veto special tax breaks \njust like the so-called pork that may be included in the appropriations \nbills.\n  I would like to point out for the record, however, Mr. President, \nthat the Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate have not \nonce in the last 10 years increased spending through what we call \nreprioritization or what some Members and the \npress call pork. As an appropriator now for over 25 years, I believe \nwhat appropriators have done in most instances is reorder the spending \npriorities of the President. The President sends up his budget, and we \nhave changed it in many ways. That is what I think our constituents \nelected us to Congress to do--to represent their view in what \npriorities should be for Federal spending.\n  When Congress decides to spend money for theater missile defense to \nprotect the United States against terrorist attack rather than spend \nthe same money for peacekeeping in Somalia or Bosnia, or to spend money \nto provide access to parks or increase cancer research instead of \nspending money for housing for Park Service employees or to research \ndifferent types of infections, some call it pork. Again, I call it \nreprioritization. When we reprioritize these budget items, that does \nnot increase Federal spending. But they may be the subject of concern \nfor some people.\n  I agree that some of the reprioritizations are a concern. If we are \ngoing to give the President a line-item veto, the President should have \na line-item veto over such changes. All I have asked is that the \nPresident also have authority over the full spectrum of how the \nCongress spends taxpayers' money.\n  Congress has historically given the President less money to spend \nthan he has asked for. We are talking now about annual appropriations \nbills. Those of us who are on those committees are accused of pork \nbarrel politics when we reorder the priorities of the President. If a \nperson would look at article I, section 8 of the Constitution, I think \nit is plain that is what Congress was supposed to do. That is our job. \nThe Constitution gave Congress the power to pay the debts and provide \nfor the common defense and the general welfare of the United States. I \nbelieve that says Congress should set the priorities of where we put \nthe taxpayers' money. And in the final analysis, the President can \nagree or disagree by vetoing the whole bill.\n  If we need to strengthen the President's ability to selectively \ndisagree, through a line-item veto, so be it. But I think it should be \nacross the board.\n  We in Congress also set priorities through tax breaks and direct \nspending. One only needs to look at the highway bill to see what direct \nspending can do. In one bill alone, over $6 billion was earmarked for \ndemonstration projects throughout the country. Those projects could not \nbe changed by the President. He had only the opportunity to agree or \ndisagree with the overall highway bill. To be fair, I think we ought to \ngive the President the power to really do something about that bill \nalso, and I hope that the bill we finally vote on will include all \nforms of congressional spending: appropriations, entitlements, and \nother mandatory spending, and targeted tax breaks.\n  Congress has under the Constitution a balance with the President. We \nwrite the policy. The President carries it out.\n But to keep the President from being a simple servant of the Congress, \nto really give him independence, the Constitution gave the President \nthe power to veto congressional legislation. Now, I agree that in many \nways that power has been limited because there are times when Congress \nwraps up in a bill things a President might delete if he had the same \npower as the Governors normally have in our States, the power of the \nline-item veto.\n\n  It does seem to me that what we need to do is recognize there has \nbeen a change, not only in terms of passage of time but in terms of the \nsize of the problems we face, for both the Congress and the President. \nGiven the current deficit, it is clear that the balance established by \nthe Constitution has not worked as well as it was intended. \nExtraordinary measures, extraordinary tools, are needed to control \nFederal spending.\n  For that reason, I am willing to support a trial period of giving the \nPresident additional veto authority. I only ask that authority apply to \nall forms of Federal spending. And I ask the Senate: What good would it \ndo to give the \n[[Page S4126]] President the power to veto individual items in \nappropriations bills alone when they affect only 34 percent of Federal \nspending? And I believe the record will show Congress only changes \nabout 10 percent of the items the President sends up in any given year.\n  The President, in my opinion, could veto all discretionary spending, \ndefense included, and still not balance the budget. Giving the \nPresident the power, therefore, to have a line-item veto over that 34 \npercent will not really contribute in the long run very much to \ncontrolling the deficit.\n  But, Mr. President, I really speak for fairness. I represent a very \nlarge State with a very small population. There are only three of us \nhere representing Alaska in the Congress. California has 54 people, I \nbelieve, to represent the large population there in California. And \nthose people not only say more when the President is elected, but they \nsay more in terms of the votes in the House.\n  I think the Constitution recognized that difficulty and, through the \nestablishment of the Senate, gave small population States a real voice \nin the outcome of the deliberations of the Congress. The Constitution \nalso imposed checks and balances between the President and the Congress \nto prevent the abuse of authority.\n  If you want to look at the difference between the proposed bill and \nthe amendment I hope to see included, I believe tax breaks and \nentitlements are very important to large States, much more so than \nsmall States. We are very rarely, really, impacted by targeted tax \nexpenditures or by entitlement legislation. Small States such as mine \ndepend upon the priorities Congress sets on the use of discretionary \nspending through the appropriations process.\n  Look at the Coast Guard; look at the FAA; look at the Department of \nthe Interior accounts; look at the Housing and Urban Development \nwastewater treatment accounts. We are very much affected by those \ncontrollable expenditures. All we ask is for a right to help determine \nwhat the priorities should be on the amount that Congress and the \nPresident agree to spend in those areas.\n  I cannot remember increasing an account to reprioritize funds for \nAlaska. Congress, if it gives the President a line-item veto on only \nthe 34 percent that is discretionary spending, would end up by \naffecting the people in small States that rely upon that discretionary \nspending. Entitlement accounts, such as the highway account with its \ndemonstration programs, as I just mentioned, affect very large \npopulation States. I do not remember a congressionally created highway \ndemonstration project in my State. But I do recall a great many \nreprioritized discretionary spending accounts that have affected my \nState.\n  I remember--and I have a memo on this--there was a period of years \nwhere the Park Service had requested additional money for housing for \ntheir people in Alaska. In 1993, the National Park Service requested \n$4.65 million and we fully funded that request. In 1994, the Park \nService requested another $6.377 million for housing for its personnel \nin Alaska. We fully funded that request. In 1995, the Park Service \nrequested $7.023 million for 1995 for additional housing in Alaska. For \nthe third year in a row the Park Service was seeking a multimillion-\ndollar account.\n  At my request, Congress reduced that account in the third year to \n$800,000 and shifted $6.2 million to other programs in Alaska run by \nagencies within the Department of the Interior. In most instances, they \nwere moneys that the agencies had requested but had been stripped out \nby the Office of Management and Budget in the budgeting process.\n  At my request the Congress agreed to reprioritize that money to \nincrease funding for the cadastral survey program. With the largest \namount of Federal lands in the country, we are surveying out the lands \nthat have been ordered by Congress to be given to the Alaska Natives in \nour State, or to our State itself, and that account is falling way \nbehind. It will be 2050 before our land is surveyed at the spending \ncurrent rate.\n  I believe the Appropriations Committees have a right to recommend \nthat Congress reprioritize some of these accounts, and to ask others to \njoin us in doing so. We do not do that alone. Any Member can come to \nthe floor and oppose any of those reprioritizations and I think they \nshould if they disagree.\n  I do believe that there are many who share my views that the bill \nshould be expanded. I am not going to name them here, because I think \nthat would be unfair. I think they should speak for themselves.\n  I am not talking about expanding anything other than the scope of the \nline-item veto and, in my mind, moving it to a consensus where there \nwill include all appropriations bills, all new entitlements or direct \nspending, and all targeted tax benefits and targeted tax rates. When \nthat consensus comes along, I think you will see the same group of \npeople who voted overwhelmingly for the Cohen sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution last year, and likewise the same group of people who voted \nfor the Bradley-Hollings sense-of-the-Senate resolution last year, \nalso.\n  I think it is time to give the President more power to help us \ncontrol Federal spending. If we amend this bill to allow the veto on \nany form of Federal spending, then I intend to support the bill and \nfight for its enactment. As I said, at this time, I intend to vote for \ncloture on the motion to proceed, if such a vote is needed, to give us \nthe chance to do that.\n  And I really do hope and pray I will be able to vote for the final \nbill. I think we all need new tools to reduce this deficit.\n  Mr. President, in closing--and I think I have taken more time than I \nshould--I am hopeful that all Members of Congress will look to the \ntremendous task that faces us this fall when we may be forced to \nincrease the debt ceiling. We already have a debt ceiling of $4.9 \ntrillion. It is my information that the national debt is bouncing up \ntoward that limit now. I do not believe the people of this Nation will \naccept lifting that debt ceiling to $5 trillion or above unless they \nare convinced that we are doing everything we can to create the new \ntools and the new attitudes that are necessary to reduce the deficit \nand ultimately, hopefully, reduce the debt.\n  I am the father of six children and I now have seven grandchildren. I \nhope to have many more. And I hope to be able, while I am still in the \nSenate, to help take action to reduce this debt and reduce the burdens \nthat will be on our children and grandchildren if we do not.\n  Mr. President, again, in closing, I want to thank my friend from \nArizona. He is right about one thing. I think he is as much of a \nfighter for what he believes in as I am for what I believe in.\n  You know, gladiators sometimes contact and almost, apparently, wound \none another, and yet can walk off the floor and be good friends. I hope \nmy friend realizes that.\n  I intend to keep fighting for what I believe and I am sure he will, \ntoo.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank the Senator \nfrom Alaska for not only the friendship that he has displayed to me in \nhis efforts on behalf of the people of Alaska, but also the people of \nmy State.\n  I know of no one who has fought harder for his State, and I know of \nno one who has served as long and as honorably in this body as the \nSenator from Alaska has. I am especially gratified to note that the \nSenator from Alaska is willing and has shown an extreme willingness \nduring some very difficult debate on this issue to compromise, to see \nthe other viewpoint and, frankly, to make some changes that are \ndifficult for him, given his strictly held beliefs and his unique \nposition as representative of the largest State in America \ngeographically, but one of the smallest as far as population is \nconcerned. He has a special obligation due to lack of representation in \nthe other body.\n  I believe that he has contributed enormously as ranking member and \nchairman of the Defense Subcommittee to this Nation's national \nsecurity, a debt that future generations will owe him. I appreciate the \nspirit of comity with which we are addressing this issue. I know there \nwill be issues in the \n[[Page S4127]] future in which the Senator from Alaska and I will \nseriously disagree, but we will do so in a spirit of respect.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska for his statement this morning on \nthis issue. I know he will be involved as we take up the substance of \nthe bill in the future.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, will the Senator from Arizona yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. COATS. I would like to gather the attention of the Senator from \nAlaska for just a moment, if I could. I want to second the comments of \nmy colleague from Arizona relative to the Senator from Alaska.\n  One of the tests I used to judge the character of individuals that I \nserve with is what I call the foxhole test. If I am in a foxhole \nsurrounded by the enemy and the situation is desperate, who would I \nwant there back by my side?\n  I know of no individuals that are as tenacious, and who I would \nrather have by my side in a desperate situation, than the Senator from \nArizona and the Senator from Alaska. I respect them both, even when \nthey differ. I respect their tenacity. I respect the strength of their \nconvictions.\n  I just want to say to the Senator from Alaska that he has made an \nenormous contribution to this effort which we are undertaking. It was \nthe Senator from Alaska's perseverance on the issue of the standard, \nthe reach of the line-item veto to include not only discretionary \ndomestic spending, which the Senator has labored mightily to restrain \nand to be responsible, but to extend that reach to other accounts.\n  It is solely on the basis of that Senator's persistence that we \nopened up the discussion again. We are now in the process, and I think \nvery, very close, to crafting an even better and more effective bill.\n  I very much appreciate the efforts of the Senator from Alaska, his \nspirit in which he pursued the issue and then his spirit in working \nwith Members to define the issue. I think we will have a stronger \nproposal shortly before the Senate, and a great deal of credit goes to \nthe Senator from Alaska. I thank him.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, may I also add it has enlivened some \notherwise dull and dreary meetings the Senator and I have been \nattending.\n  I know that the distinguished minority leader is coming to the floor \nfor his statement, unless the Senator from Illinois wishes to speak.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I will consume.\n  Mr. President, I sympathize a great deal with the remarks of Senator \nStevens. I want to have a line-item veto that I can vote for.\n  I also agree with Senator Stevens that we ought to be looking not \nonly at appropriations, we ought to be looking at tax breaks. I \npersonally would like to give the President, in theory what I would \nlike to do is maintain a good balance of power. But there are \nconstitutional problems with doing that.\n  I, in theory, would like to give the President authority to have a \nline-item veto or to reduce an appropriation, and that it would take a \nspecific vote of a majority of the House and a majority of the Senate \nto override that. That forces a vote on our part. That way we cannot \nhave some of these abuses that we hear about.\n  But I think probably more significantly, the ability to reduce an \nappropriation would save more dollars, frankly, than just the ability \nto line-item veto something. Senator Stevens is correct. The majority \nof years Presidents request more money than we appropriate. The \nAmerican public would be surprised to learn that. Six of the eight \nReagan years, for example, the President requested more money than we \nappropriated. So Congress has been responsible in this area. The \nPresident ought to be able to force a vote on some of these things.\n  A very practical problem we faced in Illinois, the State library made \na technical error and Illinois libraries were going to lose $11 million \nin Federal funds. I looked around for a bill I knew the President would \nsign, and I tacked that on.\n  Now, what I favor is a system where if the President did not approve \nthat, he could force Members to vote. Frankly, if I cannot get 51 \nMembers of the Senate or a majority in the House to support it, it \nshould not pass. I think that is the direction that we ought to go.\n  The difficulty with that is, apparently to do that statutorily, we \nrun into a constitutional impediment. That is why my former colleague \nfrom Illinois, Senator Dixon, and I, had a constitutional amendment \nwhich would have made that possible. I still favor that idea. The \ndifficulty with the proposal by my colleagues, Senator Bradley and \nSenator Hollings, of having separate bills for every item is, first, it \nwill be a lot of paperwork; second, it does not deal with the problem \nof reductions in appropriations; third, Congress is going to be very \ncreative and we will lump sum a lot of things together so we do not \nhave as many lines in all that. I hope we can get something worked out.\n  Senator Stevens is correct, also, in saying the total amount saved is \nnot going to be large. My guess is if we get something that is worked \nout, we will be fortunate if we save $5 or $6 billion a year. That is \nno small amount, but with a $200 billion deficit, that is nowhere near \nthe kind of money that we need. That is why we need the balanced budget \namendment so we look more comprehensively.\n  I hope again, Mr. President, we can work something out. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to \nspeak on behalf of the line-item veto.\n  Most Members--as a matter of fact, 66 of the Members of this body--\nwere willing to express a strong preference for a balanced budget \namendment just a few weeks ago. Someday, we will get the 67th Member \nand have a balanced budget amendment. It is because the American people \noverwhelmingly endorse the concept of a balanced budget that I rise \ntoday to discuss extending the line-item veto authority to the \nPresident.\n  The truth is that a balanced budget amendment is a statement of an \naspiration or a goal. It is an objective. The line-item veto, however, \nis something different. It is one of the ways that we can achieve the \naforementioned goal. It is the mechanism by which we achieve that end.\n  The line-item veto then is a tool which will allow us to achieve a \ngoal, and the goal is fiscal integrity. Fiscal integrity is very \nimportant. As a matter of fact, the dramatic events that followed our \nvote on the balanced budget amendment, as it related to the value of \nthe dollar, demonstrate that the world understands the importance of \nfiscal integrity. When the U.S. Senate failed to pass the balanced \nbudget amendment, the value of the dollar on international markets \nplummeted. We need to put our fiscal house in order. One important way \nto do that is to put the line-item veto in the hands of the President \nof the United States.\n  The line-item veto, then, is a tool. It gives the President the \nauthority to do what needs to be done to knock those items out of the \nbudget that we simply do not have the resources to afford. Of course, \nalong with any authority goes responsibility. If we give this authority \nto the President of the United States, we should call upon him to \nexercise that authority and if, in fact, he does not exercise that \nauthority, then the people can hold him accountable.\n  Too much of our problem in the budgetary universe right now is finger \npointing. The President points to the Congress and says, ``They \nappropriated it, and I couldn't veto part of it. I had to take all or \nnone of it, so I took it all.'' So the President does not accept \nresponsibility. Then, the Congress says to the President, ``Well, you \nsigned the budget; it's your fault.''\n  We need to endow the President of the United States with both the \nauthority and the responsibility to knock things out of the budget \nwhich we simply cannot afford understanding our present resources.\n  Mr. President, one of the reasons I speak with so much confidence \nabout the line-item veto is that I spent 8 years as Governor of the \nState of Missouri. There, we had both the goal and the aspiration of a \nbalanced budget because our State constitution requires it. These, \nthen, were the tools that \n[[Page S4128]] made it possible for the Governor to implement and \nachieve his goal.\n  Having this authority meant that it was my responsibility to look at \nour budget and to eliminate those things which we could not afford, to \ndefer those things which we could not afford. I guess I want you to \nknow that I believe that frequently legislators and governmental \nofficials have aspirations and eyes that are bigger than their \nresources. When I was a boy, my mom used to say to me, ``Your eyes are \nbigger than your stomach. You are loading up your plate and you are not \ngoing to be able to finish the meal.'' The truth of the matter is, when \nwe load up our plate with more spending than we have resources to pay \nfor them, somebody ought to be able to take that back off our plate or \nelse we are placing ourselves, or by extension the Nation, in serious \njeopardy. Not only as a military power, but as a financial power; not \nonly as intellectual leaders, but as leaders in terms of fiscal \nintegrity.\n  Mr. President, our eyes have been bigger than our pocketbooks, and we \nneed to give the President the right to take some of the stuff off our \ncongressional plate. During my 8 years as Governor, we did just that. \nWe had to knock things off the plate. I remember having to veto special \nservices to prisoners, not because the services to the prisoners were \nparticularly bad. I had to veto those items because we could not afford \nthem. I remember when the general assembly wanted to increase funding \nfor the State fair to elevate our capacity to showcase the wonderful \nhand crafts and industrial and agricultural products of our State. But \nI had to say, ``Well, that would be a great thing to do and I \nunderstand how much you considered that and how important that was, but \nI had to draw a line through that item because we couldn't afford it.''\n  One of Missouri's biggest industries is tourism, especially with the \nadvent of Branson, the new country music capital of the world. We \nwanted to promote tourism in the State. We wanted to welcome people \naggressively when they came to Missouri.\n  I remember being a part of a number of those programs. I remember \ngoing to a tourist information center and washing cars for tourists one \nday to show them how important we thought they were in coming to the \nState of Missouri. But when a couple of tourist information centers \nshowed up on the budget that we did not have the money for, I \nregrettably had to draw the line through those things. It was not a \nmatter of saying those things were not good. It was not a matter of \nsaying the legislature did not have the right motivation. It was a \nmatter of exercising the fiscal discipline necessary to balance the \nbudget.\n  It was not popular when I looked at the budget one year, and we were \nnot having a good year--the legislature passed a substantial increase \nin the salaries of State employees. They worked hard and I respected \nthem. I said, ``We simply can't make those increased salaries due to \ninsufficent funds. I have to exercise the line-item veto.'' The point \nis that there are times when you simply want things, but you have \ninadequate resources with which to pay for them.\n  Mr. President, these efforts on behalf of the American taxpayer are \nnot unique to me. Forty-three States give their Governor the authority \nand responsibility of the line-item veto. Forty-three different \nGovernors do it. It is something that is expected. It is done \nsuccessfully.\n  Mr. President, every kitchen table in America has a line-item veto. I \nhave a chart which illustrates what happens with ordinary families. \nThey sit down and figure out what they would like to have, and then \ncalculate whether or not they have the money and resources to do. The \nthings you can afford to do, you do; and the things you cannot afford \nto do, you eliminate. In short, you set priorities.\n  You know you are going to pay your rent. But if things are not going \ntoo well, the trip to Disney World is probably a candidate for the \nline-item veto. When you say you cannot afford the trip to Disney \nWorld, that is not necessarily indicating that it is bad to go to \nDisney World. You are simply indicating that financial considerations \nmay find you at an out-state park, instead of Orlando.\n  Mr. President, you are also going to have to pay the taxes. You would \nlike to have the retirement fund, but you might not commit as many \nfunds. The new car probably gets cut. Cable television may lose the \npremium channels. Boy, it would be hard to cut off ESPN's analysis of \n``March Madness.''\n  In the end, you have to set priorities. The average kitchen table in \nAmerica does it; 43 Governors do it; why shouldn't the U.S. Congress \ngive the President the authority to do it?\n  Now, Mr. President, there are some things that are far less worthy \nthan the things I just listed. Some of the things that wind up in the \nFederal budget are nothing more, nor less, than people simply \nallocating resources to favored interests in their own State. That is \nwhat people outside the beltway call pork; and that is what the \nPresident of the United States should have the authority to eliminate.\n  One of the reasons this out-of-control spending must stop is that we \nhave a $4.5 trillion debt; $4.5 trillion is a lot of money, but it is \nsomewhat hard to comprehend. But simply put, it is almost $18,000 of \ndebt for every man, woman, and child in America. Consequently, for a \nfamily of four--if my mathematics are correct--their share of the \nFederal debt amounts to $72,000.\n  Of course, the average family would probably have a real problem \nconsidering any new spending if they were forced to labor under an \nextra $72,000 of debt that had to be paid off. One of the problems with \nthis amount of debt is that it adds yet another big expense that is not \nlisted on this table--and that is interest.\n  Now, Mr. President, if your household's interest payments get to be \nquite large, they impair you from being able to do the things you would \notherwise want to do. In the United States, our $4.5 trillion Federal \ndebt is requiring the Government to spend money on interest instead of \nthe other essential services and programs the American people have \nindicated they want. Things which are as essential to Government as \nbraces would be for a child, or maintenance and repairs would be to a \nhouse, or a retirement fund would be to a person's future.\n  Mr. President, there has been a great deal of talk about Social \nSecurity on the floor of the Senate. However, the biggest single threat \nto Social Security is the national debt which is consuming our ability \nto pay for the things we really need. And if the national debt \ncontinues to increase, our corporate retirement fund in America--Social \nSecurity--is going to be impaired. Not because we do not have some \nlanguage in a law, but because we have spent our--and the next \ngeneration's resources--recklessly.\n  It is with that in mind that I rise to support the concept of the \nline-item veto. It is a needed tool in the hands of those that the \nAmerican people call upon to manage our Government responsibly. We must \nagain establish fiscal integrity in the public sector. We must show \nthis Nation and others that our Government can be responsible.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I wish to thank the Senator. He brings credibility to \nthis debate, having served as Governor of a large and very important \nState.\n  One of the arguments that is used and will be used in the Chamber \nagainst the line-item veto is that the President of the United States \nwill somehow use the line-item veto to coerce and blackmail individual \nMembers of the Legislature into doing things that they otherwise would \nnot do, in fact even alleged in violation of their principles. I do not \nwant the Senator to take too long because there are many questions, but \nthat is one of the most often used arguments against using the line-\nitem veto. I wonder if the Senator from Missouri would give an answer \non that particular aspect of the line-item veto.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Arizona for posing the \nquestion.\n  Let me just go to the bank of experience--which is the best teacher. \nWe have 43 States with the line-item veto, and if the kind of abuse the \nSenator describes were really available to a person wielding the power \nof a line-item veto, I would expect to know of at least one State where \nsomeone was seeking to repeal the line-item veto. If it were \n[[Page S4129]] subject of great abuse--and was subject to such \ntremendous arbitrary and capricious misuse, or even political \nretribution or punishment--you would think there would be an outcry \nacross the country among the States that have it now.\n  But, it is because the way the line-item veto is working in the \nStates that have it now which is in turn making the Nation want it. \nCitizens across the country see how it works well in their home State. \nSo the Governors, I do not think, have been labeled as having abused \ntheir power under the line-item veto.\n  Let me point out why I think it is true that the Governors do not \nabuse the power, Mr. President. It is because no State Governor--and no \nPresident of the United States--can put a single dollar into the \nGovernment's budget. Most State constitutions--and that of the United \nStates of America--require that revenue measures commence in the House \nof Representatives or its equivalent in the legislative branch.\n  The President or a Governor will have projects that he knows are \nimportant to him and that he will want to be included in the budget. \nBut the President knows if he operates arbitrarily and capriciously \nwith the legislative branch, then he cannot rely on the legislative \nbranch to include his projects and priorities. When there is that kind \nof mutuality of reliance to get good projects done, neither of the \nparties in the process can afford to be capricious, arbitrary, or \nunreasonable in the way they handle their responsibilities.\n  I emphasize that Presidents have legislative packages they think need \nto be undertaken. They cannot pass them or enact them themselves. They \nrequire individuals in the legislative branch to do that for them. If \nPresidents were to abuse the legislative branch by arbitrarily or \ncapriciously wielding the line-item veto, there would be more recourse \nthan they would want to endure emanating from the legislative branch.\n  So let me note two things, Mr. President. In theory, there is really \nno sound basis for the argument that there would be abuse of the line-\nitem veto by the President. But second, we do not have to rely on \ntheory alone. We can look to the real life example of about 43 States \nwhere the line-item veto is successfully used by the executive over and \nover again, and where there is real negotiation between parties of \nfragmented political power--meaning the legislature and the executive \nbranches of Government. Neither have power to do everything \nthemselves--they must negotiate between them--and those negotiations \nresult in government being carried on.\n  The key difference between the States, where you have the line-item \nveto, and the Federal Government, where you do not have the line-item \nveto--and there is one key difference, Mr. President--is that we now \nhave balanced budgets in the States. We do not have a balanced budget \nin the Federal Government.\n  So I do not fear an inappropriate use of the line-item veto by the \nPresident. If he were to use it inappropriately, I think the \nlegislative branch would say to him ``you are not going to have our \ncooperation when you need it because you have acted inappropriately.''\n  Of course, there is an ultimate arbiter of the conduct of the \nPresident of the United States: That is the American people. If they \nsaw the President of the United States abusing his power in such a \nmanner, he would not be President for long.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Missouri for an \neloquent statement, not only on that particular aspect of the issue but \non the entire line-item veto.\n  I do not know of anyone who brings more credibility to this debate \nthan a person who has had his most recent experience as Governor of a \nState that is doing very well and, I might add, to state the obvious, \nhas its budget balanced and, I might add, was running surpluses for the \n10 years under the Governor, which Senator Ashcroft was.\n  May I ask the time remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona controls 1 hour and \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic side controls 2 hours and 24 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we do not want to end up in a situation \nthis afternoon where all time on this side has been used and none of \nthe other side. I do have speakers who wish to speak, but at this time, \nuntil we get more balance in the time remaining, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum, understanding the time will be taken from both sides \nduring the quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand we are under a time \nagreement. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for whatever time I \nmay consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I noticed some snickers at the chart I \nbrought to the floor today, which is surprising to me because the chart \nis a color chart and I think you will find it an interesting chart.\n  I have been listening this morning to the discussion on the floor of \nthe Senate about a column that was written by Mr. Krauthammer in the \nWashington Post. My colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, came \nin discussed it a bit today and discussed the response that appeared in \nthe Washington Post yesterday to that column. I have also heard some \ndiscussion this morning about the line-item veto. I wanted to try to \ndiscuss both of them, and do so in a manner that relates to the two of \nthem.\n  One of the things that I think is important, as we addressed what we \nknow to be the critical issues facing our country, is that we do so in \na straightforward way and honest way, and when we talk about fiscal \npolicy and budgeting, and Federal spending deficits. It seems to me \nthat there seems to be a lot of discussion that is not quite square or \nright on the mark. Carpenters call it a half bubble off plumb. When you \nhear some of the things that are discussed around here, you kind of \nwonder how all that adds up.\n  I thought maybe I would bring a chart to describe the discussion I \nhave heard on the floor the last several weeks and in the Krauthammer \ncolumn in the Washington Post to describe how it does not add up.\n  Let me just recreate the circumstances of the discussion with respect \nto balancing the Federal budget, and with respect to the protection of \nthe sanctity of the Social Security trust funds. We had on the floor of \nthe Senate a proposal to change the Constitution of the United States \nto require a balanced budget. Of course, everyone understands that will \nnot have changed the Federal deficits. If we amended the Constitution 1 \nminute from now requiring a balanced budget, we would still have the \nsame budget deficit then as we have now because the only way to reduce \nthe Federal budget deficit is to make individual decisions about taxing \nand spending. That is the only way the budget can be brought into \nbalance.\n  There is, I think, no disagreement among Members of the Senate about \nthe value of balancing the budget. There are certain virtues it seems \nto me in life that are timeless truths, and one of them is you cannot \ncontinue to spend more than you have. Our Federal Government is at a \nfiscal policy that spends more than it has. The result is it charges in \nthe form of Federal deficits these deficits and debts to its kids and \ngrandkids.\n  A proposition was brought to the floor of the Senate to amend the \nConstitution, as I said. The way the proposition was written, it was \nthat all expenditures and all receipts are counted for the purpose of \nwhether the budget was brought into balance. Senator Conrad, I, and \nsome others raised some questions about that because we felt that was \nin conflict with another legislative goal that we had established \nbeginning in 1983, over 10 years ago. We wanted to save in the Social \nSecurity trust fund by accumulating surpluses \n[[Page S4130]] so that we would have money in surplus after the turn of \nthe century when the baby boomers retired.\n  The result was, for example, in this year by a determined policy as a \nresult of something we had previously decided, we would have a surplus \nof $69 billion in this year alone in the Social Security account. Why? \nBecause when the America's biggest baby crop retires, when the war \nbabies retire, after the turn of the century--we are going to have some \nproblems in the Social Security account. We decided to save for that \ntime. We decided to raise more revenue from Social Security, more \ndedicated taxes than we need now, put it in a trust fund, and save it. \nTherefore, this year, $69 billion more than is necessary to expend \nSocial Security will be raised, and that will be put in a trust fund.\n  It is raised as a dedicated tax from paychecks of American workers \nand the businesses who employ them. That dedicated tax goes from the \npaychecks into a trust fund. It is not a tax that is collected from \nworkers in this country to pay for defense, to pay for foreign aid, to \npay for roads, to pay for schools. It is not a tax for that. It is a \ndedicated tax to be used only for one purpose: To put in a Social \nSecurity trust fund because we are going to need that money.\n  Those who defended a constitutional amendment to balance the budget \nsaid we have no intention of taking the money out of the Social \nSecurity trust funds.\n They announced that they had no intention of using those Social \nSecurity trust funds or raiding or looting the Social Security trust \nfunds.\n\n  They repeated that time after time on the floor of the Senate. And \nthen of course, we got into some discussion off the floor of the Senate \nand the same people who said we have no intention of using those Social \nSecurity trust funds to balance the budget said to us, ``Look, fellas, \nlet's all be honest about this. We can't balance the Federal budget \nwithout using the Social Security trust funds.''\n  And in the room behind me about 10 feet away, we were presented with \na sheet of paper, handwritten by the proponents of the constitutional \namendment, something that said we will stop using the Social Security \ntrust funds to balance the budget in the year 2012. A subsequent \nproposal was, we will stop using the Social Security trust funds in the \nyear 2010. And, finally, we will stop in the year 2008. Thirteen years \nfrom now, we will stop doing something we proclaim we had no intention \nof doing.\n  Well, I figured that, because it is hard to explain, maybe I could \ntake just the year 2002, which was the year in which the budget is to \nbe in balance either by the constitutional requirement that would have \nbeen imposed had that amendment passed or by statute if we pass a \nstatute. In the year 2002, the budget is to be in balance.\n  In that year, alone, just for that year, we have decided that we \nwould accrue a surplus or accumulate a surplus in Social Security, and \nit is estimated that the surplus will be $111 billion, because we are \ngoing to need that money later. So we put some savings away in Social \nSecurity and we are going to use it later. That is the year 2002.\n  With the constitutional amendment to balance the budget, all \nexpenditures and all receipts would be included, which means that $111 \nbillion in the year 2002 would then be included in the receipts. So \nwhat you had was a Hobson's choice in the year 2002. Look at this \nchart. Either you say you had a balanced Federal budget, which would be \nthis--we have in the year 2002, under this seesaw accounting approach, \nwe have a zero balance. In other words, we have eliminated the Federal \ndeficit.\n  But, of course, what you have done is, rather than have the $111 \nbillion surplus in the Social Security account, you have taken that \n$111 billion and used it here to get to zero. Or, if you say no, we \nhave no intention of using that--our position, incidentally, is that \ncannot be used and should not be used.\n  If you do not use that money in the year 2002 what happens? You do \nnot have a zero budget balance. It is a fraud to say you have balanced \nthe budget. You have a $111 billion deficit. Yes, you do have the $111 \nbillion surplus in Social Security. That is the surplus that you \npromised people who paid the tax in would exist. But you now have a \n$111 billion operating budget deficit.\n  The constitutional amendment which would have required this kind of \naccounting would have done one of two things. It would have either used \nthis, the Social Security surplus, to balance the operating budget \ndeficit, which means that the surplus effectively does not exist, so \nyou have broken a promise to workers and to retired people; or, you \nwould have retained the promise of the surplus and not balanced the \nbudget. You cannot do it both ways.\n  You know, Mr. Krauthammer and others might have gone to a different \nschool than we did, but double-entry accounting does not mean you can \nuse the same money twice. In some cases, there are criminal sanctions \nfor that. That is not what double-entry accounting means. You cannot \nsay, yes, we have savings and, yes, we are using that over here to show \na balanced budget. That is not honest accounting. That is dishonest \nbudgeting and everybody knows it.\n  And that is the point that the Senator from North Dakota, Senator \nConrad, was making and it is a point I wanted to make. And I think is a \npoint probably best made using a seesaw accounting illustration here to \ndemonstrate that you cannot have it both ways. You cannot use a tenth \nof $1 trillion in two different accounts at the same time.\n\n\n                             Line-Item Veto\n\n  Mr. President, I also wanted to talk about the next debate we will \nhave, which will be on the line-item veto. The line-item veto is an \nimportant issue and I believe the Senate will pass the line-item veto \nand I will support line-item veto legislation.\n  I listen to the discussion on the floor of the Senate about the line-\nitem veto. Once again, its proponents are overselling it. There is some \nnotion that if there were a line-item veto in place today, we would not \nhave a problem with the budget deficit.\n  I happen to think we ought to have a line-item veto, because I think \nit is good public policy. But frankly, I do not think it will make much \nof a difference at all with respect to the budget deficit. The line \nitem veto in S.4 would apply to appropriations. But the fact is that we \nhave capped appropriations, by law, and they are therefore not growing \nvery much. This budget deficit is driven by increases in entitlement \nspending, especially health care price increases, that are not voted \non. They are entitlements whose costs ratchet up every single year in \ndramatic ways.\n  I heard a previous speaker say, you know, the Congress comes here and \nspends all this extra money. Well, what happens is, the health care \naccounts in Medicaid and Medicare are exploding on us, skyrocketing. \nThere is not even a vote on those increases. Those are entitlements. \nThe increases are automatic. We simply pay the bill for Medicare for \nthose that are entitled.\n  When doctors charge more, hospitals charge more, when technology \nincreases and you have breathtaking new capabilities of saving lives \nand when, in some months, 200,000 new Americans become eligible for \nMedicare, you can see what is happening to those accounts in the \nFederal budget. They are rising substantially, and nobody casts a vote \non whether to do it or not.\n  Until and unless we get a handle on the skyrocketing health care \ncosts, we are not going to be able to solve this gripping Federal \ndeficit problem. So we must do both. We must solve the deficit problem \nand we must do it, in part, by getting a handle on skyrocketing health \ncare costs.\n  So I just want to say, I do not think that people ought to believe \nthose who would oversell the line-item veto. It will not control the \nbudget deficit.\n  Will it, in some cases, soak some of the wasteful projects out of \nsome of the appropriations bills? I think that possibility exists. I \nthink that it would be a useful instrument to have. Most Governors have \nit. Frankly, I think the President should have it.\n  The debate we are going to have in the coming weeks will be: What \nkind of a line-item veto shall this Congress and this Senate adopt?\n  I believe the appropriate line-item veto is one that we will \nintroduce next Tuesday. It is similar to S. 14, which has been \npreviously introduced in the \n[[Page S4131]] Senate. It provides that the President shall be able to \nrescind, or send back for review, any single line in an appropriations \nbill and send it back to the Congress and, by a majority vote of the \nHouse and Senate, both of which are required to vote, the House and \nSenate will make a determination upon the President's rescission or \nveto.\n  Second, I think that we would make a mistake if we pass a line-item \nveto and deal only with expenditures. Most of us understand that there \nare a couple of ways that Congress deals with spending and taxing and \ndeficits. One is to determine the amount of money spent and the second \nis to determine what kind of a tax system is imposed to collect the \nrevenues.\n  I believe very strongly that we also ought to include tax provisions \nin the line-item veto. The fact is, some come to the floor and propose \ntax expenditures, some propose direct expenditures, others propose tax \nconcessions that result in effectively reducing the tax base and \nspending tax revenues we otherwise would have had. I think that also \nought to be subject to a line-item veto.\n  A line-item veto bill that includes only spending but does not \ninclude tax concessions is, I think, a weak bill, one that says, let us \ndo something, but let us not do enough; let us move part of the way, \nbut let us not move all the way to exhibit some control and some \nresponsibility.\n  So I really think that it will be a mistake if this Senate turns next \nto the line-item veto and decides the only vetoes by Presidents of \nlines in legislation that we are going to respond to will be \nappropriations and not tax provisions. I believe that line-item veto \nlegislation should allow Presidents to single out individual lines in \nappropriations bills and individual provisions in tax legislation and \nforce the Congress to own up to those expenditures and those tax \nconcessions.\n  When we do that, if we do that, if we provide, in combination, in a \nline-item veto bill that covers both expenditures and tax expenditures, \nI think we will have served a useful purpose for the American people. I \nthink we will have contributed to more responsible legislation, both in \nexpenditures and also in our Tax Code.\n  Some would say, ``Well, we would like a line-item veto that deals \nonly with spending in appropriations bills and would require a two-\nthirds vote in both the House and the Senate to essentially overcome \nthe Presidential veto.''\n  I think, frankly, a majority vote in the House or the Senate is more \nappropriate. But I think it is even more important to pass legislation \nthat includes, as I said, tax concessions or tax expenditures along \nwith regular expenditures in the appropriations bill, as well.\n  We will have that debate, I think, at the end of the day. The \nAmerican people will find that the Congress, both the House and the \nSenate, will support a line-item veto. I expect a line-item veto bill \nto go to the President for signature this year, and I think it will \nadvance the national interest by leading to more responsible \nlegislation.\n  I do not think it will do very much about the Federal deficit. I wish \nit would. I wish I could oversell it like some do. But it will not. The \nonly way we will get a handle on the Federal deficit, and we must, is \nif all Members, in a serious, honest way, decide to embark on the same \njourney together.\n  I was on the floor of the Senate yesterday expressing some surprise \nthat those in the Senate who were the loudest about wanting to amend \nthe Constitution to require a balanced budget were back, and they came \nback with their charts showing what the pollsters had recently told \nthem.\n  The pollsters said--no surprise to me--that tax cuts are now popular. \nPoll the American people and say, ``Would you like a tax cut?'' They \nsay, ``Oh, yes; I would like a tax cut.'' That elicits a pretty \npredictable answer. We had charts all over the back of the Chamber \nshowing the results of the latest polls. The American people support \ntax cuts.\n  Well, that is not a revelation to me. But it is interesting to me \nthat those same people who said that we have a responsibility to \nbalance the budget, and they wanted to change the Constitution to \nrequire it be done, are now saying that the next step they want to take \nis to cut the Federal Government's revenue.\n  I think our next step is an obvious one to everybody, conservatives \nand liberals alike: We must cut Federal spending, and we must use the \nmoney to cut the Federal deficit. When we have done that job, and only \nthen, when we have completed that work, then we can talk about tax \ncuts.\n  But to suggest when we have the kind of Federal deficit we have and \nan accumulated $4.7 trillion Federal debt, that our next step is to do \nthe popular thing, to be human weather vanes, to find out what people \nthink and rush off to start cutting taxes might be popular, but frankly \nit is not right.\n  Everybody here in this Chamber who is serious about reducing this \ncrippling budget deficit and putting this country back on the right \ncourse toward expansion, economic hope, and opportunity once again \nought to join hands and say, ``Our job now is to cut spending, use the \nsavings to cut the deficit, and resolve this crippling deficit and debt \nissue for this country. When we have completed that job, then our task, \nin unison, in a bipartisan way, is to find out how we can relieve the \ntax burden on middle-income families.'' But let Members not put the \ncart before the horse, even if it may be popular to do so.\n  Mr. President, having spoken a bit about the constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget and the line-item veto and some thoughts about \nthe most recent popular proposals in tax cuts, I do want to say that \nwhat we have had, I think, is a troubling series of years in American \npolitics recently in which we have fractured the spirit of cooperation. \nWhen I say ``we,'' I think everybody in this country has been involved \nin that in one way or the other.\n  The fact is, our country is involved in tough-spirited international \neconomic competition, the winners of which will see economies with \nexpansion and opportunities, and the losers of which will suffer the \nBritish disease for a century--low economic growth, less opportunities, \nless expansion.\n  I think the American people expect of Members, and I think will \ndemand of all Members of all political persuasions, that we understand \nthat we play on the same team; we represent the same interests and \nought to fight for the same goals.\n  No one in this Chamber can believe that our current fiscal policy \nhelps this country. Our current fiscal policy of spending more money \nthan we have, consistently, is one that weakens our country. We must \njoin together, whether it be through a line-item veto approach or \nthrough budget initiatives that should come by the middle of the next \nmonth, to begin correcting this country's fiscal policy problems in a \nserious and honest way.\n  I pledge, as one Member of this side of the aisle, to be as \nconstructive as I can in marching toward those solutions, hopefully, in \na bipartisan way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as if in morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/17/senate-section/article/S4123-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4131-S4132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ABOLISHING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in recent days three of the announced \ncandidates for President on the Republican side have announced their \nintention and commitment to eliminate the Federal Department of \nEducation if they are elected. In my view, Mr. President, that is a sad \ncommentary on the priorities that some of those in leadership positions \nhave in this country today.\n  I remember when President Reagan ran in 1980, part of his platform \nwas to eliminate the Federal Department of Education. I thought the \nsuggestion was misguided at that time. I strongly believe that it is \neven more misguided here in 1995. This is the last decade of \n[[Page S4132]] the 20th century, the information age, and yet there are \nthose who are falling over themselves trying to take education off the \nnational agenda.\n  This retreat from leadership in perhaps the most critical area of our \nnational interest--education--is clearly wrongheaded. Overwhelmingly, \nAmericans tell pollsters that education is one of their major concerns. \nOver 80 percent of Americans say they support a Federal Department of \nEducation. And it is not surprising that they do. Americans recognize \nthat education is central to the strength of our Nation, especially as \ninformation becomes the most valuable currency in the world.\n  When ``A Nation At Risk,'' the report issued by former Secretary of \nEducation under President Reagan, Terrel Bell, appeared in 1983 it \ncommented on the poor state of American education by observing, ``If an \nunfriendly foreign power had imposed our schools upon us, we would have \nregarded it as an act of war.''\n  The analogy to national security was appropriate then, and I believe \nit is still appropriate. Our security, whether you define it in \neconomic terms or in military terms, is absolutely dependent upon the \nquality of the education that we provide to our children and to our \ncitizens.\n  How can we have a national interest in agriculture but not in our \nchildren? How can we talk about our industrial strength and not talk \nabout the education of our work force? We do not question the \nDepartment of Defense, but what about the know-how that our people need \nto staff that Department?\n  Still, as we approach this new century, there are those who say that \neducation is purely a State and local matter; let us get the Federal \nGovernment out of it; let us eliminate the Secretary of Education, get \nthat person out of the President's Cabinet.\n  Mr. President, I have seen in the last few years the proposed \nelevation of the EPA to Cabinet status, which I have supported. The \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs we now have in the Cabinet; clearly, I \nsupport that. That is an important priority for the country.\n  I now read in the paper that we are going to have the CIA in the \nPresident's Cabinet. That also may be an appropriate thing to do. But \nto suggest that we should have each of those individuals in the Cabinet \nnext to our President to set national policy but not have a Secretary \nof Education there to speak up for the future of our children is, I \nthink, misguided.\n  Clearly, there is a priority here which we should not dissipate among \nvarious and sundry departments and agencies around the Federal \nGovernment. We need a central focus for leadership in education in this \ncountry. The Secretary of Education fulfills that role.\n  What is that role? Ask the 7 million students who attend colleges and \nuniversities thanks to loans and grants provided through Department of \nEducation programs. The Department supplies 75 percent of all post-\nsecondary student aid, continuing a national commitment dating back to \nthe GI bill.\n  Or ask the 6 million disadvantaged students who each year receive \nhelp through Federal programs to meet higher academic standards. Ask \ntheir parents. Ask their teachers. Scores on the National Assessment of \nEducational Progress, the national test administered by the States and \nthe Department of Education, show that the gap between the achievement \nscores of white and black students has decreased by about 40 percent \nsince 1975. The narrowing of that gap coincides with the very \nsignificant Federal investment in K-12 education for the disadvantaged.\n  The combination of the Federal investment in these students plus \nleadership from the department which has sought for several years, from \nSecretary Bell through our current Secretary, Secretary Riley, to \nencourage high standards for all students in our schools--that \ncombination is bringing about more equality of educational results and \nimproved results for all of our students.\n  Ask the teachers and the administrators in the States about the value \nof Department of Education's work. Its research and dissemination of \nthe results of that research are immensely helpful to local schools and \ndistricts. Now that schools are coming on line and becoming \ntechnologically more sophisticated, teachers can access information \nabout the newest techniques, materials, and research, straight from \ntheir own desks or their own faculty rooms and obtain that information \nto a large extent through the Department of Education.\n  Ask American business whether they want national leadership to \nimprove education in this country. I have heard business leaders in my \nState say over and over again that there is an unbreakable link between \nour Nation's economic competitiveness and the quality of our \neducational system. Our global competitors are doing a better job in \nmany cases of preparing their young people for this new technologically \nrich and information-laden future than we are. We obviously need \nnational leadership to help States provide their students with what it \ntakes to compete in this new world.\n  As we go into the next century we face numerous challenges. We will \nhave a growing population of young people as we hit the echo from the \nbaby boom. We will continue to have many young immigrants. Many of the \nchildren I am speaking about will be born into poverty. They will speak \nlanguages other than English. Technology will continue to change the \nway that people work and the way people learn. The increased demands of \na global economy will make it imperative that we provide high standards \nto our children and assessments to measure their progress toward \nmeeting those standards.\n  States want and deserve Federal help and Federal leadership to meet \nthese challenges.\n  I am especially aware of the need for strong Federal leadership in \nthe area of technology for education. Only through leadership at the \nnational level can we have a coordinated effort to bring the benefits \nof telecommunication and the computer revolution to all our schools and \nall our students.\n  States are struggling with these issues. They welcome the help and \nexpertise the Department of Education has been able to bring.\n  I just went through a campaign this fall. I traveled all over my \nState of New Mexico. I talked to many thousands of people. I heard lots \nof complaints about the Congress, complaints about the Federal \nGovernment, and about State government, and about local government, and \nmany other things people found objectionable. But I did not hear the \nvoters saying they wanted less attention to education, less funding for \neducation, less of a Federal role or less priority given to that \nimportant area. I heard quite the opposite. The American public sees \neducation as having been neglected at all levels of government.\n  As I have traveled around New Mexico during the last several years--\nnot just in the last campaign--I have asked folks at town hall meetings \nto express their opinions as to how much of our Federal budget they \nbelieve is committed to improving education. Usually people in the \naudience guess somewhere in the 10 to 15 percent range. Mr. President, \nthey would guess that 10 to 15 percent of our Federal budget is \nprobably committed to education. When I tell them that less than 2 \npercent of our Federal resources each year goes to support education at \nthe national level, it is something of a surprise and a disappointment \nto a lot of the people in my State.\n  If some want to walk away from the Federal responsibility for \neducation they certainly have that option, but I believe taking \neducation off our national agenda and taking the Secretary of Education \nout of the President's Cabinet, will be sending exactly the wrong \nsignal not only to the people of this country but throughout the world. \nThat is the wrong message.\n  Our future lies with our young people. I know that is a cliche but it \nis the truth. A Federal Department of Education can help us prepare our \nyoung people for that future. It is the right priority for this country \nas we approach this new century. I hope very much we will retain the \nDepartment of Education for a very long time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to make a couple of brief comments \nabout the line-item veto, and what the \n[[Page S4133]] real, fundamental principle is. The fundamental \nprinciple about the line-item veto is requiring of a two-thirds \nmajority of both Houses to override a President's veto. Anything less \nthan that is a sham and meaningless.\n  It is my understanding there is serious consideration being given on \nthe other side of the aisle to a proposal which would require a \nmajority vote in one House in order to override the President's veto. \nThe American people will not be fooled by that facade. The American \npeople will not be cajoled or deluded to believe that a majority vote \nin one House would be sufficient to override a Presidential veto. It \nonly took a majority vote in one House to put the pork in to start \nwith. What we are seeing here is a reluctance to take the issue head \non, but to water it down so it is meaningless.\n  In the course of negotiations with my friends on this side and on \nthat side, I accepted the separate enrollment. We looked at the \nexpansion to entitlements. We looked at targeted tax benefits. And all \nof that is negotiable. It is not negotiable to the American people to \ndilute the two-thirds majority aspect of the line-item veto. Without \nthat this is meaningless.\n  I understand there are various proposals being considered for an \nalternative suggested by the Democrats. I strongly recommend that \nwhatever they propose does not drop the two-thirds majority. It is \nclear on this side of the aisle, because of the internal debate we went \nthrough, the overwhelming majority on this side of the aisle will stick \nto and adhere to a two-thirds majority in order for the President's \nveto to be overridden. That is the meaning of the word veto. That is \nwhat it all is about in the 43 States in America, where Governors have \nthe line-item veto. We will accept nothing less.\n  If people on the other side of the aisle or anywhere support such a \nweakening of the line-item veto, I warn them: The American people will \nnot be fooled.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/17/senate-section/article/S4132-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         WASHINGTON POST STORY\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, on Monday we are going to move to the line-\nitem veto. I want to congratulate Senators McCain, Coats, Domenici, \nLott, Stevens, and members of my staff and others who have been working \ntrying to bring us together on the Republican side. I think now that we \nare in fair agreement on this side.\n  I want to congratulate my colleagues, particularly Senators McCain \nand Coats, who have been at this year after year after year, for their \nefforts. They have not given up and they have stuck to it and have hung \nin there. Now we may be able to pass this legislation.\n  Just as we had the debate on the balanced budget amendment which lost \nbecause six of my colleagues on the other side, who voted for a \nbalanced budget amendment 1 year, voted against the identical--or \nalmost identical--bill the next year.\n  This line-item veto has the overwhelming support of the American \npeople. It will receive the overwhelming support of Republicans on this \nside of the aisle. I know that this legislation is opposed by some and \nby many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I know that \nthey will do what they can within the rules to block passage.\n  But let me say that the line-item veto, in my view, is a little \ndifferent than the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. In \nthe House, it passed by a vote 294 to 134. Strong bipartisan support. \nIt has also been voted on a number of times in the Senate over the past \nyears. We have had support from Republicans and Democrats, including \nSenator Biden, Senator Exon, Senator Heflin, Senator Hollings, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Leahy, Senator Nunn, and Senator Pell.\n  The bottom line is that here in the Senate a vote will be taken, and \nthe American people will know where we stand. That is how this process \nworks.\n  But will they know where President Clinton stands? That is the big \nquestion. Where does President Clinton stand?\n  For a long time, it was hard to tell where he stood on the balanced \nbudget amendment. It was not until the final weeks of the debate that \nhe finally did what he could to defeat the amendment, although he \ncontinued to say he understood why Americans so strongly supported it. \nAbout 80 percent supported it.\n  [[Page S4134]] As a Governor and a candidate for President, he said \non countless occasions that he supported the line-item veto. But \nlately, the President seems intent on opposing anything that comes out \nof the Republican Congress.\n  It is a right he has. It is a right he has, but I am not certain how \nhe explains it to the American people or how he can say in one breath \nhe supports the line-item veto and maybe in another breath say, ``Oh, I \nhave doubts about it.''\n  So I guess if given the choice between passing something he has \nalways supported, or denying Republicans a legislative victory, then \nthe line-item veto will probably be sacrificed on the altar of \npolitics.\n  If that happens, there is not much we can do about it on this side. \nAs long as we furnish the votes to shut off debate--and I think we will \nhave every vote on this side of the aisle, so we only need 6 out of 46.\n  So I think if the President truly supports the line-item veto, he \nshould not wait any longer and let the American people know. I know he \nis struggling to be relevant in the process of things. But he can be \nrelevant in this process. He does not have to stand in a schoolyard \ndoor or to some school lunch meeting to show how compassionate and how \nsensitive he is; or how he has, in effect, given up any effort to \nprovide us any leadership in deficit reduction.\n  I hope the President would let our colleagues on both sides of the \naisle know that he feels strongly about the line-item veto, just as \nstrongly as he did when he was running for President and when he was \nGovernor. If he does that, we will have a big, big bipartisan victory. \nAnd the President can certainly claim all the credit, he and my \ncolleagues on the other side, and we will be happy to join with them in \na celebration for the American people.\n  We debated this issue time after time after time. We have had \nhearings time after time after time.\n  So this is not going to be one of these 20-day procedures in the \nSenate. This is going to happen, if we can make it happen, next week. \nWe have had plenty of debate on this issue. We do not need 300 \namendments from the other side. We are going to do our best to shut off \ndebate. We believe the American people expect us to shut off debate. \nThey are frustrated, our colleagues are frustrated, and I know maybe \neven it is time the leader gets a little frustrated. Maybe the \nDemocratic leader gets frustrated, too.\n  But I would just challenge the President. I would say:\n  Mr. President, you can do this today. You can make this so easy. This \nbill will disappear next week. It will pass with a big margin, if you \nreally believe what you have been telling the American people you \nbelieve for the last 2 years. If you do not believe it, well, tell us \nthat, too. But if you do believe it, Mr. President, now is the time to \nspeak up. Do not wait until the last minute. Do not wait until next \nFriday or next Thursday or next Wednesday. Do it this weekend. Make the \nAmerican people feel good this weekend for a change. Let the American \npeople know that you support what 75 to 80 percent of them support, to \ngive you, Mr. President, not us, but to give you, the authority and the \npower, Mr. President, that if Bob Dole or somebody sticks something in \na bill that does not belong there, you could take it out.\n  We are giving the power to a Democratic President, a Republican \nCongress. Some say we ought to have our heads examined. But we are \nprepared to do that because we believe it is good policy. It is good \npolicy.\n  If the Democrats do not trust their President, I cannot help that. If \nthey do not trust a Democratic President, that is their problem.\n  We are prepared to trust President Clinton with this authority. And \nif we are defeated by Democrats in the Senate with a Democrat in the \nWhite House, that is going to be hard to explain. Now, some liberal \nmedia will figure out a way to do it, but not many. That is a hard one. \nI do not know how I would explain that. I would have to think about it \na lot.\n  So, Mr. President, we are Republicans. We are prepared to give you \nthis authority, but we are afraid, without your strong support, it is \nnot going to happen.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I had the opportunity to listen to the \nremarks made by the distinguished majority leader.\n  Let me say, I have just come from a meeting with the President --not \nabout this issue, but another issue--and I do not think there is any \nquestion that the President is prepared today, tomorrow, or at any time \nto reiterate what he said all along. He supports the line-item veto. It \nis that simple. There is no question about it. We do not have to make \nthis a political issue. We do not have to try to put words in his \nmouth. He does not need that. He can do that for himself. The fact is, \nPresident Clinton supports the line-item veto. Period.\n  The fact is, so do most Democrats. I have supported a line-item veto \nsince coming to the Congress. I did 15 years ago and I do today. I \nalways have. I believe that it is an important aspect of good \nlegislating.\n  I recognize that 43 States have already done what we would like to do \nhere. Forty-three States have already acknowledged that Governors ought \nto have an opportunity to review and send back for further review items \nin legislation. Regardless of how many times it takes, if a Governor, \nor a President for that matter, thinks that a line item ought to be \nreviewed, he ought to have the right to send it back. That is the \nissue.\n  Line-item rescission, as it really is properly called in this case, \nis something an overwhelming majority of Democrats and Republicans \nsupport. The trouble is defining what it is we are referring to when we \nsay line-item veto or line-item rescission. That is the issue.\n  I do not think there is any doubt that Democrats and Republicans \ncould come together this afternoon and agree upon an approach, if you \ntake our past positions and acknowledge that on the Republican as well \nas the Democratic side there is a consensus about the need for a line-\nitem veto.\n  Unfortunately, what has happened over the course of the last several \ndays, in spite of the fact that two bills were reported out of \ncommittee, in spite of the fact that there has been, as the \ndistinguished majority leader said, a great deal of consideration given \nto the line-item veto in the past, there has been a backroom deal cut. \nIn the closet somewhere, in the Cloakrooms or in the back rooms, some \nof our Republican colleagues have decided that whatever versions have \nbeen considered in the committees are not good enough; that they wanted \nto come up with a bill that we have not seen.\n  I remember so well the complaints raised last year by many of our \ncolleagues on the other side about not having been consulted, about \nwanting our cooperation, but not having the opportunity to even see a \ndraft of a health bill and, as a result, they said, they vehemently \nopposed many of the provisions in health bills that were offered time \nand again on the Senate floor. ``We were not consulted,'' they said. \n``That is not a good legislative process,'' they said. ``We ought to \ntake the committee process and make it work,'' they said.\n  Well, they were making some arguments that, frankly, I shared. In \nfact, I thought we had consulted, but certainly not to their \nsatisfaction in some cases.\n  But the point was made over and over that we simply had not reached \nout adequately to them and for that reason they were unwilling to \ncooperate with us.\n  Well, now I hear the majority leader and others say that they hope \nthey can get Democrats to cooperate on this issue; that they can find a \nway to ensure that we get a number of Democrats to support this version \nof line-item veto that nobody has seen. It is a line-item veto proposal \nthat, to the best of our knowledge, takes a good idea to the extreme, \nand, frankly, from a constitutional and a practical point of view, is \nmuch in need of consideration and review as we go through the next \nseveral days.\n  Mr. President, I think that just about every Democrat would like to \nsupport the bill that was offered originally by the chairman of the \nBudget Committee \n[[Page S4135]] and the ranking member, Senator Domenici and Senator \nExon. That a bill that has received a good deal of consideration and, \nas I understand it, has support on both sides of the aisle.\n  We would like to take that bill and say, ``Let Members begin with \nthis.'' This is a piece of legislation that obviously has merit. It is \na piece of legislation that is broad in scope. As introduced, it would \ninclude not only appropriations but taxes. It would give Members an \nopportunity to review more than just the appropriations process. It is \na bill, as I understand it, that Majority Leader Dole has cosponsored, \nI have cosponsored, a number of other legislators have cosponsored in \nthe past that contains all the needed protections against an imbalance \nof power between the President and the Congress, something that we \nwant, if we are going to do this right, to ensure that the balance \nbetween the executive and the legislative branch is maintained. It \noffers an approach that we all can support, something that we all \nrecognize is needed. That balance is critical on a whole range of \nissues, not just appropriations.\n  Most importantly, we want to protect Social Security. We want to take \nthat off the table. Obviously, there is legislation pending that would \ninsist that we take Social Security off the table when it comes to \nbalancing the Federal budget over a period of time.\n  We also want a piece of legislation that will not permit a minority \nin Congress to hold a majority hostage, that does not overturn the \ncentral principle of democratic government: majority rule.\n  It is amazing to me how many times we find both sides of the aisle \nlamenting how we are captive of the minority, how we cannot do the \npeople's work in part because a small group of people is holding \nhostage a certain piece of legislation. Holding the majority hostage, \nand keeping us from doing the kind of things that we know we should be \ndoing.\n  In essence, we want legislation, Mr. President, that allows Members \nto do that, that protects majority rule, that protects the principles \nenshrined in the Constitution, proven by 200 years of practice in \nlegislating, and providing the balance that we have all wanted between \nthe executive and the legislative branches.\n  The Domenici-Exon approach creates a fast-track procedure to make \nsure Congress does not ignore the President's desire to review a \ncertain provision not to finance a particular project. That is another \nconcern. We want to be sure that when a President comes up with his \nlist of rescission items, that it is not ignored as it is today. Under \nthe bill, Congress would have the opportunity to review in a very \ncareful way each and every one of these items, with the understanding \nthat they will be reviewed within a specified, delineated period of \ntime. This would force the Congress to act, and ensure an open and \npublic debate and vote on particular projects within a designated \nperiod.\n  Spending would then be dependent on the merits of that particular \nproposal. Supporters will be held accountable. That is what I think all \nadvocates of line-item veto have argued is the central principle here. \nThat when we isolate out a given item, not buried in the paragraphs and \npages of thick bills in the future, that supporters will have to come \nforth and say, ``I believe that it is in the best interests of the \ncountry to support this particular item, and we are willing to have a \nvote on it. We are willing to put it under the light of day.''\n  We should have an all-out debate on whether it merits majority \nsupport. If it does, then obviously it ought to be enacted into law. I \nthink that is what the American people want: Accountable, open \nGovernment, but Government that allows Congress in a more meaningful \nway to specify with great authority those things we want from those \nthings we do not.\n  The line-item authority the President has under current law is too \nweak. Everyone appreciates that because Congress can ignore the \nPresident's proposal to cancel spending. There is nothing right now \nthat requires the Congress to act when a President rescinds something.\n  We are really in a situation that is untenable, frankly. The \nPresident knows there are things within a bill that he is unwilling to \nsupport, and yet he is faced with the dilemma of either supporting it \nor vetoing the entire piece of legislation. He can rescind items, be \nignored by Congress, and nothing ultimately is accomplished, adding to \nthe public cynicism, and adding to the extraordinary difficulties we \nhave in making things work better, legislating with an understanding \nthat there has to be a better way. Spending goes forward, no money is \nsaved, cynicism goes up, and ultimately the system breaks down.\n  Since 1974, Presidents have proposed to cancel $72.8 billion in \nspending. Congress has canceled only $22.9 billion of those requests. \nIn addition, Congress cut $70 billion out on its own.\n  That is an interesting point and I think people have to understand \nthat issue. The fact is that the Congress has cut more in the aggregate \nfrom its appropriations than what the Presidents over the last 20 years \nhas proposed. We actually have a better budgetary record when it comes \nto overall spending than what the Presidents have proposed in their \nrescissions. The problem is we cannot agree on which line items ought \nto be reduced or eliminated. Because we cannot agree, nothing is done. \nWe cut, the President proposes cuts, but those Presidential proposals \nmore times than not are ignored entirely.\n  The Domenici-Exon bill corrects the weakness in current law. First of \nall it forces the Congress to vote. The President has 20 days to notify \nCongress; 2 days later a bill with the President's proposals has to be \nintroduced; 10 days later the Congress must vote. That is what it says. \nThe President proposes within a 20-day timeframe what specific \nrescission items he believes the Congress must review and act upon. Two \ndays later, a bill with all of those Presidential proposals is \nintroduced, and within the next 10 days the Congress is forced to vote \non each and every one of these items.\n  That, to me, is what the American people have said they want. That is \nexactly what I think Democrats and Republicans probably could agree \nupon, a process by which there would be a certain review, a certain \nvote, and a reaction to the President's specific requests at a time \nthat I think most people would consider to be fair.\n  Second, it prevents filibusters of rescission proposals entirely. As \nI said, this is a fast-track approach. The Senate gets 10 hours to \ndebate. And an equivalent time limit is imposed on the House. There is \nno way to drag this out. We would have the certainty, the confidence in \nknowing that when the President sends down his rescission message, the \nCongress must act, and act within a certain period of time. When that \ncomes to the floor, there is 10 hours of debate, and it is over. We \nhave made our decisions.\n  We have enforced the deal and defended each and every one of these \nitems. Most importantly, it is done with the confidence in knowing that \neveryone will have their opportunities either to defend or oppose these \nrescission items in a time certain.\n  Third, it puts all the savings into deficit reduction. That is \nanother thing I think the American people say they want. Let Members \nnot take spending from one side of the ledger and put it into something \nelse. Let Senators recognize that, indeed, if we are going to do what \nwe said over 5 weeks we are going to do when we had our debate on a \nbalanced budget amendment, everyone said they would recognize the need \nfor a glidepath, and are unwilling, of course, to put in writing a \nblueprint, at least to date. That is, our Republican colleagues have \nbeen unwilling to show just how they will do it.\n  I think I have heard a number of our colleagues advocate certainly if \nwe are going to save money, it ought to be dedicated to deficit \nreduction. Unfortunately, I hear my colleagues on the House side argue \njust the opposite, that, indeed, we ought to have a $600-plus billion \ntax cut and find ways to offset that tax cut with cuts in spending. \nThat has been the debate ongoing for several weeks over on the House \nside.\n  The combinations of time certain, with the realization that \neverything we do would be dedicated to deficit reduction, prohibiting \nCongress to cancel spending on some unnecessary project and turning it \naround and using it for tax cuts or some other purpose, is exactly what \nI think this Congress and \n[[Page S4136]] what the American people would like to see done.\n  The combination of these provisions make present law into a real \nline-item veto power for this President and for all future Presidents. \nCongress has to defend all of its questionable spending openly. Current \nlaw gives Presidents only the opportunity to propose canceled spending, \nbut nothing to make Congress respond. That is the problem we have \ntoday. The President proposes, and the Congress ignores.\n The Congress ignores and ultimately nothing gets done.\n\n  (Mr. SMITH assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this bill is going to change business as \nusual. There will be less ability to sneak things in, less opportunity \nfor people late at night to put little provisions in the bill that we \nonly understand later to have consequential effects both budgetarily \nand otherwise.\n  It gives the President the chance to highlight questionable spending \nand force the authors to defend it publicly, discourages questionable \nprojects if authors know they may be forced to defend them in public.\n  So there is no doubt the legislation that many of us support, the \noriginal Domenici-Exon bill is strong, it will work. Unfortunately, it \nought to be the bill that we are debating today, but we are not. We are \nnot because, for some reason, the Republicans have chosen to come up \nwith a new concoction, some other provision that does not have the \nprovisions that I just described, despite the broad bipartisan support \nfor a bill that throughout the process has shown to have the kind of \nbipartisan support necessary to move this legislation along.\n  Mr. President, I wonder what the real motivation may be. Is the \nmotivation the desire to pass meaningful line-item veto legislation or \nthe motivation to try to embarrass the President or the Democratic \nMembers of the Senate? I do not know. I hope it is, as the majority \nleader has indicated, a true desire to resolve this issue, to move this \nahead, to bring to the Senate, and ultimately to the President, a bill \nthat he can support, a bill that would do the kind of things that I \nhave outlined are necessary if, indeed, we are going to have a \npractical, constitutionally sound piece of legislation that enjoys \nbroad bipartisan support.\n  The Republicans have arrived at a consensus to promote what I \nunderstand is a completely different line-item veto than anything we \nhave seen so far called separate enrollment. As I have indicated, to my \nknowledge, no Democratic Senator was invited into the Republican \ndiscussions on this approach, even though some prominent Democratic \nSenators have been strong supporters of this version of the line-item \nveto.\n  The approach that I am told the Republicans are going to offer has \nnot been considered in any committee of this Congress, no hearings have \nbeen held, no committee has voted on it. Both S. 14 and S. 4, by \ncontrast, were voted out of the Budget Committee and the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. Hearings were held earlier this year. Democrats, in \nthe course of those hearings, have offered to work with our Republican \ncolleagues. Unfortunately, in response to that offer, the unilateral \ncompromise made on the other side apparently has been achieved without \nany participation by Democrats.\n  As I understand it--and again we will have to wait until it is \nproposed in order to know for sure just what the Republicans have in \nmind, and we will have that opportunity next week--but as I understand \nhow separate enrollment would actually work, the approach requires that \neach individual item of any appropriations bill passed in Congress be \nbroken up by the enrolling clerk into separate bills to present to the \nPresident. The President would be able to veto any of the bills.\n  Take a bill, any one of the appropriations bills that we have had in \nthe past. This one is a good example. It is Public Law 103-316 passed \nin the 103d Congress, the Energy and Water Development Appropriation \nAct fiscal year 1995. This bill has approximately 20 pages with \nhundreds and hundreds of line items. Line items that are listed here \ninclude emergency funds for purposes of transportation; uranium supply \nand enrichment activities; flood control and coastal emergencies; line \nitems for the Tucson diversion channel, $2.5 million; the Jefferson-\nJacksonville, IN, line item. It does not say what in particular that \nline item is for.\n  The Wallisville Lake, TX, plant, $1 million. Line item by line item, \nit has hundreds of specific line items listed one by one in this bill. \nBut as I understand, the Republicans are suggesting that we take each \none of these line items, separately enroll it, and send it on to the \nPresident.\n  So what this bill did when we passed it in 1994--the Congress passed \nthe legislation, it went to the enrolling clerk, one bill with all of \nthese line items in it. The enrolling clerk then sent it to the \nPresident. The President has the ability to take this bill, veto it, \nsend it back to Congress, or sign it into law, if he so chooses.\n  If he vetoes it and sends it back to Congress, the Congress could \noverride it and it could become public law. If the Congress failed to \noverride it, of course, it fails to pass and it is put in the trash \ncan, and we start all over. That is how a bill becomes a law. It is \npretty simple. It has five steps; that is it. That is all it is. \nEnrolling, signing, vetoing, or overriding and the enactment into \npublic law. That is a pretty simple process and one that, as advocates \nof paperwork reduction, we could all support. Keeping it simple is what \nwe all want.\n  This is what the Republicans are proposing. This is the separate \nenrollment version of this bill. Each one of these line items, every \nsingle one of the line items listed here--Red River emergency bank \nprotection; Red River below Dennison Dam levee; West Sacramento, CA; \nSacramento River flood control project; Savannah Harbor deepening in \nGeorgia; Casino Beach, IL; Lake Pontchartrain; Lake Saint Geneva, MO; \nHackensack Meadowlands, NJ; Salem River, NJ--every one of these would \nbe separately enrolled. The Congress would pass it. It goes to the \nPresident. The President would sign each one of these line items into \nlaw; he would veto some of the others. Congress, in every single case, \nwould either have to accept this as public law or consider each one of \nthese line items as a veto and repeat the process over and over and \nover and over again, hundreds and hundreds and thousands and thousands \nof times over the course of several weeks, I am sure, in order just to \npass this appropriations bill. That is what we are talking about.\n  This chart really does not depict it all. Here is what it would take. \nI did not think we would want to spend all the money on the charts \nrequired for that one appropriations bill, but it will take this piece \nof paper with another chart on it, this one, this one, this one, and we \ncan just go right on down the list, Mr. President, page after page \nafter page. It would take 85 of these charts to detail what would \nhappen to one energy and water appropriations bill. I can probably find \nsomething here for South Dakota, if I looked hard enough.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand how somebody who would \nadvocate paperwork reduction would want all of us to go through this \nevery single time we pass an appropriations bill, and we are not even \ngetting to another issue that I wanted to bring up, and that is a tax \nbill.\n  So, Mr. President, I know that sometimes back-room coordination and \ncompromise produces some interesting product, but I have to say, this \nshows a real sense of imagination.\n  I am really excited to see how over the course of the next several \ndays our Republican colleagues will give us an opportunity to \nunderstand how this works.\n  We are turning this process upside down. We are turning it upside \ndown and inside out, and taking what is a very simple, streamlined \nprocess that has worked for 200 years and turning it into an absolute \nnightmare, a paperwork jungle, the likes of which is going to take more \nforests than we can count to produce one appropriations bill.\n  I hope we are into recycling because you could take one \nappropriations bill and print several Bibles the next year. I mean, it \nis going to take a long time for us to consider the enrollment \npotential here for each and every one of these items to go on to the \nPresident. The one thing it will do is keep the President in the White \nHouse. You will not see him going out making many speeches because he \nis going to have to do a lot of signing here, and with each \n[[Page S4137]] signature, we have an opportunity to come back and have \na free-for-all when it comes to considering each one of these items, \none by one, as separately enrolled bills.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned about that, obviously, and I will not \nbelabor the point today, but we will get into this again later on.\n  I am also concerned about another provision of this approach. We are \nnot just dealing with the impracticality here. What troubles me is that \nwe would be putting the power in the hands of the minority, requiring \none-third of one House of the Congress to sustain a veto over any one \nof these provisions. This Congress is run by majority rule. This \nCongress has worked well under majority rule for a long time. We have \nfor purposes of closer examination the right to filibuster, and both \nsides of the aisle have defended their right to extend debate on many \noccasions. Democrats have used it most recently, but we have all had \nthat opportunity.\n  Do we really want to go even further than that and lock into law for \nall perpetuity the right of even a smaller minority to hold hostage \nevery one of these public laws, every one of these specific line items? \nDo we really want one-third of the Senate to keep us from doing our \nwork in a meaningful way? Why would we want to do that? Why would we \nwant to require that supermajority on something with this kind of \ncomplexity?\n  Mr. President, I hope that as we consider the propriety of all this, \nwe also understand how important it is we not just limit ourselves to \nappropriations here.\n  I could be accused of making the other side of the argument here, but \nI am going to do it anyway because I think that what is fair is fair. \nIf we are going to do this, what I do not understand--and I guess the \nonly thing that the Republicans may be able to give as an answer to why \nwe are limiting this to appropriations is at least we would save a \ncouple of forests if we did not get into other scope questions like \ntaxes. We would not have to cut down all the trees of South Dakota to \nproduce a tax bill. But I believe a tax bill ought to be subject to the \nsame review. I believe a tax bill ought to have the same opportunity to \nbe considered--but certainly not like this.\n  Certainly if our Republican colleagues argue that review is good, I \ndo not understand why they say review of tax provisions is not good. \nThat just defies my ability to respond. I understand why we would want \nto review appropriations. I am not sure what the position of our \ncolleagues on the other side would be on entitlements. I personally \nwould have no objection to that. But I do believe that if we are going \nto look at all spending, we certainly ought to look at tax expenditures \nas well. We ought to be looking at tax breaks just like we are looking \nat those unique little deals that we put in appropriations bills.\n  As I understand it, our Republican colleagues, if they are willing to \ndo anything, are willing to only put in tax breaks affecting fewer than \n100 people. Do you know how many tax breaks that actually includes? \nWhat they want to do is exclude most every consideration of tax \nlegislation for reasons that are not entirely clear.\n  As the majority leader has said, this is not the first time we have \ndebated this issue. This separate enrollment proposal came up in 1985. \nIt was 10 years ago. I do not know if it had any more consideration in \n1985 than it has had in the committees in 1995, but I do know that it \nwas the subject of a great deal of debate. In fact, a successful \nfilibuster was led at the time by the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Hatfield, who, coincidentally, is chairman again.\n  At that time, Senator Hatfield described it as ``one of the most \ndangerous proposals that has come before this Senate in my 19 years.'' \nHe called it ``a mad piece of legislation,'' which he took great pride \nin having stopped. Senator Hatfield eloquently described what would \nresult.\n\n       General appropriations measures might be converted into \n     literally hundreds of separate bills.\n\n  True to his conservative nature, he was not as literal as I was. I \nthink it is thousands.\n\n       The President would be swamped with paper and would have \n     difficulty keeping track of things. . . We should be equally \n     concerned that legislative intent may be completely \n     overridden when items intentionally linked and sequenced \n     together are enrolled.\n\n  That was Senator Hatfield. That was the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee in 1985. Senator Hatfield, as he always is, \nwas eloquent, perceptive, and, thank goodness, successful in bringing \nthis Senate to its senses in dealing with this exact proposal 10 years \nago. Sometimes, it takes more than once to kill a bad idea. But this is \na bad idea. I thought it was killed 10 years ago, but it has reared its \nugly head apparently, and we are going to have to deal with it again. \nBut I hope the same vision and the same commitment and the same \nappreciation of the magnitude, the enormity of the problem, will be \njust as evident as we debate the issue this time.\n  During that same debate, my friend and colleague, Senator Hatch, now \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, stated that the separate \nenrollment approach ``is not good constitutional policy.'' Even the \nClinton administration has expressed concern, and obviously the \nPresident, as I said earlier, has been very supportive of the line-item \nveto. But if I were the President of the United States, wondering how I \nam going to spend my time most productively, I would have to ask: Is \nthis how I wish to do it?\n  I do not know how strong his hand is, but I have to say he had better \nhave a very strong hand if he is prepared to sign into law 1,700 or \n1,800 individually enrolled items each and every time we send an \nappropriations bill to the President.\n  Walter Dellinger, the assistant Attorney General, has written,\n\n       We have not been convinced of the constitutionality of this \n     approach in the past. . . and we continue to question its \n     validity.\n\n  Questions arise because the Constitution is very clear on how the \nveto process works. Article I, section 7, reads in part:\n\n       Every Bill which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a \n     law, be presented to the President of the United States; if \n     he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, \n     with his Objections to that House in which it shall have \n     originated . . .\n\n  That is what the Constitution says,\n   that the President of the United States, if he approves it, he will \nsign it, but if not he will return it, with his objections to that \nHouse in which it shall have originated.\n\n  How do you return a bill when it has been broken into 1,800 pieces? \nHow can we constitutionally ensure we are living up to the letter of \nthe law when we are now going to require the President to put a jigsaw \npuzzle together when it comes to signature, to figure out which pieces \nhe signs and which he does not as separate enrolled items? It does not \nsay he shall sign those parts he approves. He must approve it all or \nnothing.\n  So this proposal seeks to bypass that very clear requirement by the \nsubterfuge of allowing the Clerk of the House to take apart every \nappropriations bill and re-enroll it into separate bills to present to \nthe President. The Constitution grants no such power to Congress. It \nclearly says, ``Every bill which shall have passed the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate . . . .'' Little bits of legislation \nenrolled separately are not what have passed the House and the Senate.\n  So, the other side is proposing changing the current process--rather \nthan sending a single bill down as the Constitution requires. It is a \nvery simple process that our forefathers understood, that frankly works \nin 43 States--no other State has ever tried this, by the way.\n  Mr. President, 43 States have tried this. This works. This is \nsomething that Governors understand. Line-item rescissions work.\n  States do not try this. This does not work. It is impractical. In \nfact, I would go beyond that, it is really a crazy notion that somehow \nwe could take one bill with every individual line item and page after \npage after page, and enroll those separate things and put them on the \nPresident's desk stacked this high every time we send an appropriations \nbill to the President.\n  We will have a lot more time to talk about this next week, but I hope \nthose who may be listening to this debate \n[[Page S4138]] can appreciate the enormity of what our colleagues are \nsuggesting here, the impracticality of what our colleagues are \nsuggesting, the problems it has, not only for appropriations bills, but \nfor any bill we may want to send to the President.\n  I hope they understand, too, that what the Republicans are saying is \nthey are unwilling to subject, to this or anything else, most tax \nprovisions. They do not want to do that. Then, on top of it all, they \nwant to say we are going to give the power to a minority in a minority \nto respond directly to the President's specific line-item vetoes. We \nare going to hold ourselves hostage to a very small minority within the \nSenate.\n  We cannot do that. That is what this debate is all about. It is not a \ndebate about a line-item veto. It is not a debate about whether we \nought to review things and give a second look to those items the \nPresident holds out to be of dubious nature. It ought not be a debate \nabout whether we limit this to appropriations or to taxes. Everything \nought to be on the table.\n  I hope it is going to be a good debate about whether we ought to have \nmajority rule or not. I hope it is going to be a good debate about what \nought to be the most practical way we can have a line-item veto. That \nis what we ought to have the debate about--not separate enrollment. Not \nsomething that is as amazing to me in its complexity as anything that I \nhave had to deal with in 16 years.\n  We will have a good debate about this, but I hope everyone \nunderstands it would not be necessary--I think the vast majority of our \ncolleagues could come to an agreement this afternoon--if there was a \ntrue, bipartisan spirit on how we take up line-item veto, how we \naddress these issues in a meaningful way.\n  If we are accused of holding anything up I will stand ready to be \naccused of trying to do what we can to bring people to their senses \nbefore we do something as crazy as this.\n  I hope we can pass meaningful line-item veto legislation. If we do \nsomething like that, then I am convinced we are going to get a broad \nconsensus and not much debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the minority \nleader. I would like to take this opportunity to respond to those \nremarks.\n  First of all, let me say it is very welcome news to those of us who \nhave been advocating the line-item veto and attempting to get it passed \nfor the last decade--it is very welcome news that the minority leader \ncomes to the floor and says he supports a line-item veto, the concept, \nanyway. It is very welcome news he announces on behalf of the Democrats \nthat, as he said, most Democrats, including himself, support line-item \nveto. That is welcome news because that has not been the case in the \npast.\n  The minority leader stated that the overwhelming majority of the \nDemocrat members of the Budget Committee, the committees that \nconsidered the line-item veto, supported the line-item veto efforts. \nThat is not true either.\n  S. 4, the bill we are debating now, offered by Senator McCain and \nmyself, received the support of only one Democrat on that committee and \nthat was to report the bill out without recommendation. It was not an \nendorsement of the bill. It simply said we do not feel so strongly \nabout it that we want to endorse the bill, but neither do we want to \nhold it up, so it was reported to the Senate floor without \nrecommendation, either for or against it. It is the only way \nRepublicans could get the bill out of committee. So we had to provide \nRepublican support in order to get that accomplished because only one \nDemocrat supported that.\n  On S. 14, that is also news to us. It has just been recent news that \nthe Democrats now support that, because only two members of the \ncommittee voted to report that bill out without recommendation.\n  It is also ironic that for the past several years, as this Senator \nand Senator McCain have time and time and time again offered the line-\nitem veto to the Senate--and we had to offer it as amendments to other \nlegislation because the then-Democrat majority leader refused to bring \nit up, and the then Democrat-controlled committees refused to report it \nout--we, time and time and time again offered it as an amendment for \nconsideration by this Senate. And of course it failed time and time and \ntime again because we were unable to secure the necessary votes--not \nfrom Republicans but from Democrats. In 1993, on March 10, on Senate \nvote No. 27, the McCain amendment which Senator McCain and I offered, \nonly five members of the Democrat Party voted with us. And we lost that \nvote by a vote of 45 for and 52 against. Senator Feinstein, Senator \nGraham of Florida, Senator Kohl, and Senator Robb voted with \nRepublicans. Senator Shelby voted with Republicans. He was then a \nDemocrat. We have since welcomed him to the Republican Party.\n  So, to make the assertion that the Democrats have always been for \nthis and surely we can get together and come up with something just \nflies in the face of the facts, not only with regard to past history \nbut also with regard to this current attempt to achieve a line-item \nveto.\n  It is only just in the last couple of days that we have seen a \nrenewed interest in the line-item veto on the part of our friends \nacross the aisle. We welcome that, and we trust and we hope that it \nwill lead to the passage of a line-item veto that truly changes the way \nthat this Senate and this Congress do business.\n  As the majority leader said just a few moments ago, the House of \nRepresentatives, in bipartisan fashion, overwhelmingly passed the \nversion that Senator McCain and I have offered with modest \nmodifications. Overwhelmingly they passed it, achieving 290 votes for \nand only 135 against, and that obviously included a significant number \nof Democrats that supported that effort. So all we are really asking \nour Senate colleagues, the Democrats, to do, is to join their \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives in giving us the necessary \nvotes to achieve line-item veto.\n  I think equally telling here is the fact that some of the most vocal \nopponents of line-item veto have been absent from this debate.\n  We were promised a vigorous filibuster. It has not occurred yet. We \nhope it does not. We hope we have a genuine debate on this issue. I \nthink the Senate deserves that. But there really has been very little, \nand so far only token, opposition to the attempts by this Senator and \nby Senator McCain and others to debate this issue. There has been very \nlittle opposition to that effort. We hope that this is a positive \nsignal that we are truly forming a consensus in support of the line-\nitem veto.\n  Mr. President, the minority leader also said that he hears that \nRepublicans are trying to put together some new concoction. Having \nexpressed his concerns about our current proposal, things he does not \nlike about it, he says now they are trying to put something new \ntogether. He called it a ``new concoction.'' It makes me ask the \nquestion. What does the minority leader want? He does not like our old \nconcoction, the one that has been before this body and debated. He \nlisted his reasons why he does not like it. So while we are attempting \nto put together a new proposal, he says now suddenly behind closed \ndoors the Republicans are trying to put together a new proposal. My \nquestion is, Where does he want us to go? Does he want us to stay with \nthe old one, or does he want us to go to the new one?\n  Let me tell you why we are proposing a new one. Because some of our \nMembers have suggested, I think rightly so, that we take the basic \nheart and core of the McCain-Coats proposal and we expand it so that \nits coverage includes more areas of spending and more areas of past \ncongressional abuse of the spending process and puts more elements of \nthe budget under the scrutiny and under the authority given to the \nPresident under this line-item veto proposal. That is good. The more we \ncan bring in and the more we can highlight the abuses of the process, \nwhether it is appropriations or whether it is tax expenditures, the \nbetter off we are.\n  In almost the same paragraph, the minority leader says that the \nenrollment process--which is taking the appropriations bills and \nseparately turning each line-item, so to speak, into a separate bill, \nis something that should \n[[Page S4139]] not be followed. Yet some very prominent Members of his \nown party are the ones who have proposed this, and there is a \nhistorical record for that. The Senator from South Carolina, Senator \nHollings, has been a proponent of this new concoction. He has been so \nfor more than a decade. Senator Bradley in the last Congress offered \nthe separate enrollment procedure. It was supported by Republicans, and \nby a number of Democrats under Senator Bradley's leadership. Senator \nBiden, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has offered it.\n  So this new concoction is not a new concoction. It is a method used \nto try to attempt to give the President line-item veto authority to \ncurb the excessive spending of Congress that has been proposed by some \nof the most prominent members of the minority leader's own party. It \nhas been talked about and discussed since 1985. So there really is not \na whole lot new about it.\n  The minority leader's suggestion that the substitute that we are \nlooking at does little to restore the President's authority to withhold \nspending, which he enjoyed prior to 1974, needs to be discussed. At \nthat time, Congress decisively grabbed the absolute power of the purse. \nThey were reacting to then-President Nixon's impoundment power. They \nsaid under the Budget Act the President no longer could impound funds. \nHe now may only propose rescissions.\n  That is exactly where the minority leader wants to take us back to. \nThe so-called Democrat alternative that the minority leader says the \nDemocrats will introduce, and that ought to be the bill we put on the \nPresident's desk, has very little teeth and cannot be in the same \nbreath called a line-item veto because it is not a line-item veto. A \nveto is two-thirds. A veto requires more than normal to override the \nPresident's decision. It requires a two-thirds vote to override the \nPresident's decision.\n  We want to make it tougher to spend the taxpayer dollars, not easier. \nWe do not want to just keep the same level of requirement necessary to \npass legislation. But what the minority leader proposes is that we \nsimply endorse--require the same number of votes to continue the \nspending habits of Congress as the spending measure received in the \nfirst place. How does that make spending any tougher? Under the current \nprocess that is used by this Congress, we have a dismal record. The \nPresident sends up his rescissions, but they are never enacted, or very \nfew are enacted.\n  In 1976, 86 percent of the President's suggestions to rescind moneys \nthat Congress appropriated but he did not think was necessary to \nspend--86 percent--was rejected. In 1983, 100 percent of President \nReagan's suggestions about unnecessary spending were rejected by the \nCongress. In 1986 and 1987, 95 percent and 97 percent respectively.\n  So the minority leader's suggestion that we are somehow going to \neliminate pork barrel spending, that we are somehow going to \ndramatically change the way the Congress now does business--a process \nthat so upsets the American taxpayer--that will not happen under the \nminority leader's bill. The truth is that that proposal is endorsed by \nthose who basically want to continue the status quo. It has very little \nchange in it. As history shows, very little will change under that \nprocedure. If we want to get at the egregious abuse of the spending \npower that Congress now currently has, we need to make it harder to \nspend. We need to give the President some authority to highlight and to \nspotlight the abuses of Congress. We need to do something that will \ngive us fiscal discipline.\n  It was Harry Truman, a Democrat President, who wrote that, ``One \nimportant fact in the Presidential veto power, I believe, is the \nauthority to veto individual items in appropriations bills. The \nPresident must approve the bill in its entirety or refuse to approve \nit. It is a form of legislative blackmail.''\n  That is exactly the issue we are dealing with here on the line-item \nveto. The legislature which has the power of the purse blackmails the \nPresident. It blackmails the President because it sends to him massive \nappropriations bills, massive pieces of legislation in the form of \ncontinuing resolutions, which contain important have-to-pass items in \norder to continue the functions of government, in order to provide \nflood relief, as in the case of California, or hurricane relief for \nFlorida, or to provide needed defense spending to cover contingency \noperations, or to provide for the efforts such as those we undertook in \nDesert Storm and Desert Shield, things that Congress knows the \nPresident has to sign. Those are the bills which receive all the little \ngoodies, all the stuff that appears later in Reader's Digest and on the \nnightly news. And the taxpayers not only scratch their heads in \nbewilderment saying, ``How in the world do you think that is an \nappropriate expenditure of my hard-earned dollars?'' But they shake \ntheir fist in rage at this institution, and thankfully went to the \npolls on November 8, 1994, and said, ``Enough. We are tired of the \nrhetoric. We are tired of the promises. We are tired of the same old \n`same old'. We want a change in the way you do business. We want \nsomething that has teeth in it. We want something that will make a \ndifference. We do not want some fine little tuning of the way you have \nbeen doing business for the past few decades that we know will not \nresult in any dramatic difference. We want action. We want bold action. \nWe want dramatic action.'' And that is the line-item veto. That is why \nwe are proposing the line-item veto.\n  The minority leader also talked about the complexity of the \nenrollment process. He put up the fancy charts. This is the age of the \nfancy charts. The Republicans have used them also. That was a concern \nof ours, frankly; take a piece of legislation, and you say, ``Now you \nwill have to break this down into separate pieces of legislation for \neach item that the bill itself specifies for an expenditure.''\n  How is that process going to work? Is not that going to just \ncomplicate the process beyond imagination? Is it not going to just \nrequire hundreds of hours of the work of dozens of clerks to begin to \nkeep up with the process? We were concerned about that.\n  So I called up the enrolling clerk of the Senate and asked if I could \ngo down and speak with him about it. I asked if he could show me what \nwas involved. The minority leader, I believe this morning in his news \nconference, said we are going to have to drive Mack trucks up to the \nWhite House in order to carry the paperwork created by the complexity \nof the enrollment process. So I went down and talked to the attending \nenrolling clerk and asked him about it. He smiled and said, ``That is \nwhat it would have been in the past.''\n He said, ``Because we would have had to probably detail some people \nover from the Government Printing Office and we would have to sort of \nset up a back room operation.'' It was a mechanical process. But he \nsaid, ``You know, this is not the age in which we have to do things by \nhand any more.''\n\n  All the Senators have these quill pens at their desks. It is a kind \nof anachronism. Nobody ever uses them. But it is a reminder of the way \nthe Senate used to do business.\n  We have an inkwell here and a little powder to dry the ink. It is \njust one of those holdovers from the past.\n  But, lo and behold, the computer age has also reached the U.S. Senate \nand the U.S. Congress.\n  So the enrolling clerk pointed to a machine about 18 inches high and \nabout 24 inches wide, a computer sitting at his desk. It was a \nMicrocomp printer. Then he pulled out a little disk called the Xywrite \nsoftware package.\n  He said, ``This is especially designed for the enrollment process. \nAll I do is take this disk and put it in the computer.'' He said, \n``What used to take days and days and days and days and dozens and \ndozens of people now is done in a matter of minutes or a matter of \nhours.''\n  That is something that some of our generation have a hard time \nunderstanding. Our kids understand it. They start learning that in \nelementary school. My kids are as familiar with the computer and as \nunintimidated by the computer as I am by the telephone or sitting down \nand writing a letter. It is just second nature to them.\n  And so the Senate is caught up with the information age and the \nSenate enrolling clerk and the House enrolling clerk, which also has \nthe same system. It has a Pentium hard drive, by the way. We did not \nbuy the defective Pentium chips. Ours work beautifully.\n  [[Page S4140]] And, as the enrolling clerk told me, ``It is at least \n1,000 times faster than the old system. It is state of the art. They \ncan now do in an hour or 2 what used to take days.''\n  ``In fact,'' he said, ``it will be easier and faster to separately \nenroll an appropriations bill with today's technology than it was to \nenroll a single appropriations bill 5 years ago.''\n  Then I asked him to do a trial run. ``Yes,'' I said, ``OK, good. \nMechanically we can do that. But isn't it just going to pour out reams \nand reams and reams of paper? Aren't we going to have to back a truck \nup to the Senate in order to cart it down to the White House? Isn't the \nPresident just going to be overwhelmed with what we dump on his \ndoorstep?''\n  So I said, ``Would you take the largest bill that we passed in the \nlast Congress''--which was the Commerce, Justice, State, and judiciary, \nand related agencies appropriations. Here it is. It is about maybe an \ninch thick. This is the most comprehensive bill that we passed.\n  I said, ``If we had to take this and separately enroll it''--now, if \nyou look at the minority leader's chart, you would come away with the \nconclusion that this was going to be an absolute nightmare, and it \nwould, as he said this morning, take a Mack truck to cart it down to \nthe White House.\n  So here is what it ended up being if it is separate enrollments. It \nis a pile of paper. But it would fit in my grandson's Mack truck. He \nhas a little Mack truck, a little miniature Mack truck, and it would \neasily fit in the back of that.\n  So visions of massive 18-wheelers backing up to the enrolling clerk's \noffice and detailees from the Government Printing Office shoveling \nbushel baskets full of paper on the back and dumping them on the front \nlawn of the White House are slightly exaggerated.\n  This is what we are going to send the President instead of this.\n  But, in doing so, guess what is going to happen? All the little pork-\nbarrel stuff, all the stuff we discover months later--half a million \ndollars for the Lawrence Welk boyhood home restoration, money for the \ngrant that went to study the well-being of America's middle-class \nlawyers.\n  Boy, that one went over well with my constituents. They were really \ninterested in the well-being of America's lawyers. They thought that \nwas a terrific expenditure of their tax dollars. All the studies for \nthe reproduction of the South American bullfrogs, the money that went \nto fund a school in France--all the little stuff that adds up to \nbillions and billions of dollars, sometimes tens of billions of \ndollars, all the stuff we hear about months later that are tucked into \nthese bills, they are each going to have their own separate page.\n  The President is going to be able to say: ``That looks like something \nsomeone slipped in in the dark of the night, thinking that I have to \npass this bill and so I will sign it and it will slip through. I think \nI will just take this red veto stamp''-- ``veto''--``and send it \nback.''\n  And here is another one, a funding memorial or a tribute for maybe a \nformer Member of Congress or somebody that needs a special favor back \nhome. ``I think I will veto that one.''\n  What is going to happen is that the light of exposure is going to be \nshined on the darkroom, the backroom, late-at-night practices of the \nCongress, which slips this stuff through in all these bills that they \nknow the President has to sign.\n  Then it is going to be sent back to the Congress. And when it is sent \nback to the Congress, if the Member that slipped that in there wants it \nfor his district, he is going to have to bring it to the floor and he \nis going to have to stand up and talk about it. He is going to have to \nconvince two-thirds of the Congress that the President made a mistake \nor that the President was wrong in vetoing his particular item. The \npress is going to be able to write about it. Each Member who votes on \nit is going to have their vote recorded on that item.\n  No longer will we be able to go home and say, ``Well, that was for \nfunding of the judiciary and for the Commerce Department and for the \nState Department. As you know, there is a crisis in `Xcelania' right \nnow and, by gosh, if we cut off their funds, we might not be able to \nsolve that problem.'' Or, ``I had to vote for that. I did not realize \nthat one of my colleagues slipped something in there. I certainly would \nnot have done that had I known that.'' Or, ``Even though I knew there \nmight be some stuff in this, it was so important that we get that \nfunding for this emergency''--as we just passed the emergency \nsupplemental. That was another one of those trains. That was funds for \nour military expenditures in Haiti, Rwanda, and Somalia. A lot of us \nhere did not necessarily support those decisions of the President, but \nonce our troops were there, the money was spent, and we had to pay for \nit somehow. So that was an emergency.\n  And so Members go home and say, ``Well, I could not jeopardize that \nfunding. I could not shut down functions of the military.'' And that is \nwhat you have to accept if that is what you are going to do.\n  That practice ends because the emergency funding can go forward, the \nessential funding can go forward. The funding for needed functions of \nGovernment can go forward, but the little line-item stuff that adds up \nto billions of dollars gets kicked out, and the President does not have \nto accept or reject the entire bill.\n  That will do two things: One, it will give the President a check and \nbalance against the abuses of spending by this Congress. It is a \npractice everybody here worth their salt knows how to do. We are \nprobably all guilty of it. It is time it stopped. We ought to do this \nto save ourselves, if nothing else. It is time to stop. Now is the time \nto stop, and to stop real legislation, not with the same number of \nvotes it took to pass it in the first place, but a veto, a real veto, \nthat has teeth in it, a veto that will make a difference.\n  So, we are going to save billions of dollars because the President \nwill be able to veto that stuff out. But the other thing is, what we \nwill save is an amount of money nobody can calculate because it will \nchange the spending habits of Congress. Members are no longer going to \nsay, ``I will carry this list around and when I see a popular bill go \nthrough I will slip it in and get something for the special interest \nfolks,'' or do a favor for a friend, or do a favor for a lobbyist, or \ndo a favor for a special interest. We will never know the amount of \nmoney we save for items that will not be put in these new bills for \nfear of exposure. Because the President has the line-item veto, it will \nchange the way we put the bills together in the first place. Members \nwill say, ``I will not slip that one in because I do not want to suffer \nthe potential embarrassment of the President vetoing that particular \nitem.''\n  Mr. President, we have a lot to debate today and Monday and next \nweek. The minority leader says, ``Why do we want to put the power in \nthe hands of the minority--one third?'' I think it is the other way \naround. I think it is the other way around. I think we want to put some \npower in the hands of the two-thirds that will require two-thirds to \noverturn a check and balance against the spending abuses of this \nCongress.\n  In answer to why, why do we need to do this? A $4.8 trillion \ndeficit--that is why; a Congress that refuses to make structural \nchanges in how it does business. We rejected, to my great dismay, the \nbalanced budget amendment, which I think was a change in the status quo \nand a change in the way we do business. It was absolutely essential to \nour ability to get control of spending.\n  This is the second tool. Will this balance the budget? No. There is \nnot one Member who supports the line-item veto who contends that it \nwill balance the budget. We keep hearing that argument. People still \nthink it balances the budget. No. It is a poor second to the \nconstitutional amendment, but at least it is a second. It is a second \nway, a second tool.\n  I cannot imagine why Members would want to first defeat a balanced \nbudget amendment, then second say, well, we are not going to do \nanything else except we will summon up the will. We have not summoned \nup the will in 40 years for this budget. And we have seen all kinds of \npromises and commitments to do that. It just did not happen. The debt \nmounts and the interest mounts and now we are at $4.8 trillion and \ngrowing.\n  We will show how the enrollment bill that we will present is \nconstitutional. \n[[Page S4141]] Presidents throughout time have asked for the line-item \nveto. They were not afraid of our having to bring a bigger bill down. \nRecent Presidents have all asked for it, and this President has asked \nfor it. We are tired of having to pass bills that hold the President \nhostage. It is not Congress that is held hostage to the minority, it is \nthe President that is held hostage to the Congress, as Harry Truman \nsaid, blackmailing him, take it all or nothing.\n  It is clear that under article I, section 5, each House of Congress \nhas unilateral authority to make and amend rules governing its \nprocedures. Separate enrollment speaks to the question of what \nconstitutes a bill. It does not erode the prerogatives of the President \nas the bill is presented. Under the rulemaking clause, our procedures \nin defining and enrolling a bill are ours to determine alone.\n  Mr. President, I know others are waiting to speak. I will save some \nof my arguments relative to the constitutionality of this for a time \nwhen there is a break in the process. I note that the Senator from \nWyoming is on the floor. I am happy to suspend at this point. If we \nhave additional time, I will pick up from there. The Senator from \nAlabama is waiting to speak.\n  Mr. President, let me first ask the clerk how much time remains on \neach side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nineteen minutes for the Senator from Indiana \nand 46 minutes on the other side.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to address these issues. When we are in prolonged debate, one \ncould say everything has been said. We go on because everyone has not \nyet said it. Nevertheless, this is an issue that is very important, and \nwe do need to have a process in which the issue will be brought fairly \nto the Senate for the Senate to act upon.\n  Let me talk just a little bit in more general terms. The gentleman \nfrom Indiana has spelled out very eloquently and very completely the \ndetail of a line-item veto. It is not a new issue. It has been talked \nabout for years.\n  It was talked about, as a matter of fact, in developing the \nConstitution. Many constitutional scholars from time to time have \nargued that there is no need for a line-item veto; that, in fact, the \nlanguage of the Constitution provides that. Unfortunately, the Court \nhas never agreed to that idea even though it clearly does give the \nPresident the opportunity to return bills to the Congress.\n  So it is not a new issue. Neither is it a new issue in terms of \nhaving been tried. It is done in many States. It is done in my State of \nWyoming, and done very successfully, I might add. From time to time, \nthe legislature overrides the Governor's veto. More often, I suppose, \nthey do not. I suspect that that is an indication that that element of \nthe bill should not have prevailed.\n  We are really here to talk about change: change in procedure and \nchange in structure, structure in the operation of Congress, that will \nresult in changes in the product of Congress.\n  I think the most compelling truism is that if we as citizens have not \nbeen happy with the performance of Congress over time we cannot expect \nany different results if we continue to do the same thing.\n  If there was one clear message that came, certainly, from this past \nelection, it was that people wanted change, wanted structural change, \nwanted procedural change. Now we have an opportunity in this Congress \nfor the first time in a very long time, an opportunity to rethink some \nthings, an opportunity to look at new ideas, an opportunity to actually \ndo some of the things that have been talked about for a very long time.\n  There is reason to do that. We have had a history in recent years of \ncontinuing to simply do the same thing, and the Congress would \nappropriate more money to show that, if we had more money, we could \ncause it to happen. The fact is, that many of the programs have failed, \nare failing. Welfare--welfare is not doing the thing that it is \ndesigned to do. Welfare is designed to provide help for the needy, to \nhelp them get back into the marketplace. It is not doing that.\n  How many years have we had a war on poverty? And the fact is that \npoverty is more prominent now than it was when we started the war.\n  These programs are failing. Financial responsibility--certainly one \ncannot look at the size of Government, one cannot look at the deficit \nand suggest that the effort for financial responsibility has been \nsuccessful. It has not. Pork barrel? Of course, we have pork barrel.\n  So we need structural changes, and this is one of them. There were \nseveral and they are talked about often because I think they are very \nimportant and should, indeed, be talked about: Balanced budget \namendment, the proper thing to do. And really, there are a lot of \ndetails one can go through but you really start with the basic \nquestion. In that instance, the question is, Is it morally right, is it \nfiscally right to balance the budget, to not spend more in outlays than \nyou take in, in revenues? And the answer is almost unanimously yes, of \ncourse, it is right.\n  Then you deal with the issue of how do you accomplish it, how do you \nget there. Unfunded mandates--something that has been needed for a very \nlong time--has finally been accomplished, not as thoroughly as some \nwould like, but, nevertheless, accomplished, and very important. If we \nare to begin to downsize Government and to begin to shift some of the \nresponsibilities to States, there needs to be the protection against \nunfunded mandates.\n  Accountability, it is almost unbelievable that the Congress had a \nbill saying Congress has to live under the same laws as everybody else. \nI cannot believe that has not always been true, but it has not.\n  Line-item veto is a structural change that needs to take place. It is \nnot going to balance the budget, of course, but what it is going to do \nis to change the way we look at budgeting. It is going to give the \nPresident--by the way, he is really the only political person that has \na broad enough base to reach into bills and veto things that should not \nbe there.\n  I guess my greatest example is in the House, when we had a highway \nbill, a highway bill that everybody wanted to pass, of course, \neverybody wanted it so we could go forward with the highway program, \nand in it was the Lawrence Welk Museum, half a million dollars for the \nLawrence Welk Museum. Never would it have passed on its own merits. Had \nit been an individual bill, it never would have passed, but we had no \nway to reach in and get it.\n  I told that story, by the way, in a speech I made in North Dakota. \nThat was the wrong place to do it. They were sort of excited about \nhaving that. In any event, we should have a way to deal with those, and \nthat is what this is all about.\n  So, Mr. President, there will be a great deal of discussion, and \nthere should be. There will be a great deal of talk about details and \nalternatives, and there should be. There can be alternatives, but the \nfact is there is a principle involved here, and the principle is to \nchange the structure so that we can have a line-item veto to help \nbalance the approach to financing and to budgets.\n  I rise in strong support for passage of a line-item veto. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his \nstatement and his support and contributions as a new Member of the \nSenate. He certainly brings a perspective from the grassroots, having \njust spent a great deal of time in the cafes, marching in the parades, \nand talking with the people where they live and work. He brings that \nperspective, and we certainly appreciate his support.\n  Mr. President, I inquire how much time is remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator has about 11 minutes \nunder his control.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield 7 of those 11 minutes--I believe we \nhave one other speaker coming to the floor--to the Senator from New \nHampshire, and I believe the minority side on this issue has agreed to \nallow him an additional 10 minutes of their time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \n[[Page S4142]] for an additional 10 minutes from the minority side. \nThis has been agreed to by the minority side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleagues on the \nminority side, as well.\n  Mr. President, this has been a very interesting debate, as we have \nheard from the other side. The same arguments that had been used by our \ncolleagues on the balanced budget amendment are now being used against \nthe line-item veto.\n  This debate is really the same. The players are the same. The issues \nare essentially the same. No one expects that we are going to balance \nthe Federal budget with a line-item veto. But if we are going to ask \npeople on Medicaid or Medicare, or some other program, to take a hit to \nhelp us balance this budget, surely we can start with some of these \nridiculous projects that we find tucked away in these appropriations \nbills. I am going to talk a little bit about that.\n  First, I want to commend Senator McCain and Senator Coats for their \nleadership. They have been tenacious in the pursuit of this legislation \nfor a number of years. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of S. \n4, the Legislative Line-Item Veto Act of 1995. I hope that we will pass \nit. We fell short on the balanced budget amendment, but I hope that at \nleast we can pass the second-best effort, which is the line-item veto.\n  I am not surprised really that many of the same forces that lined up \nagainst the balanced budget amendment are also now seeking to kill \nthis, because they are defenders of the status quo. They want to see \nthings remain the same. They want to keep on spending, providing more \npork for their States. Their addiction to wasteful spending has created \na budget deficit crisis that makes these countermeasures so necessary.\n  But in seeking to defend the status quo, the opponents of the line-\nitem veto legislation often cite the checks and balances in the \nConstitution that give the authority to Congress to appropriate the \nmoney, the power that is checked by the authority of the President to \nveto appropriations bills.\n  They say they want to preserve this balance of power between the \nlegislative and the executive branches. Of course, that is an excuse. \nThe Founding Fathers never imagined--never even imagined in their \nwildest dreams--these massive spending bills, often containing core \nunnecessary spending that is then larded with layers of pork. They \nnever expected that.\n  This is a process that has been built up over the years by the \nlegislators and the legislatures, especially in recent history, to help \nthem pass things that would not pass if that Congressman or Senator had \nto stand out on the floor and advocate that kind of a ridiculous \nexpense. They could not face their constituents to do it. They could \nnot face the voters across the country to do it. So they tuck it away \nin these appropriations bills.\n  That is why we need the line-item veto. The President can make that \nchoice between shutting that program down or signing it. He is the \nPresident of all the people. It is easier for him to do it than some \nCongressman or Senator who may not have the courage to do it.\n  So, basically, the President is, in effect, without the line-item \nveto, faced with an all-or-nothing ultimatum. So we get an emergency \nearthquake relief bill, and it is amazing the number of things you find \ntucked away in the emergency earthquake relief bill. There are things \nin there for sewers in Chicago. And we also see dire emergency for \nnatural disasters. There was a $1.3 million add-on to train attorneys \nat Drake University in that. The district of then House Chairman Neal \nSmith in Iowa had some interesting things. So it is crafty wording. It \nis slick, it is easy; it is done in a back room somewhere and nobody \never finds out about it. And that is the bottom line.\n  As Senator Coats has said, they go back home and they say, ``Gee, I \nvoted for emergency earthquake. I didn't know that was in there.'' Of \ncourse, they knew it was in there. Of course, they did. That is the \nwhole issue.\n  Let me give you an example. Sometimes, after looking at the minority \nleader's charts--he showed these very, very complicated charts, as if \nto say this somehow is going to be so much work for the President, he \nwas not going to have time to get out of the White House. He was not \ngoing to have time to do anything except sit at his desk and deal with \nall of these measures that are coming down.\n  Well, first of all, if we pass the line-item veto, there is going to \nbe a lot less of the stuff put in the bill in the first place. That is \nfor sure.\n  Second, if the President and the Congress have to spend a little more \ntime on these things, on the appropriations of the taxpayers' hard-\nearned dollars, so be it. That is the way it ought to be. If the \nPresident has to take a little less time running around the country \nsomewhere and a little more time saving the taxpayers' dollars, so be \nit. If the Senators and Congressmen have to spend a little more time \ntaking care of the taxpayers' dollars instead of running around the \ncountry somewhere, so be it. That is the way it ought to be. That is \nwhat we are here for.\n  Now, this was very complicated. I was in the chair at the time \nwatching the charts that the minority leader had up there, but let me \nmake it simple for those of you out there who are wondering just what \nthis is all about and why we are trying to pass this thing called a \nline-item veto.\n  There are many things in a bill. Sometimes we call it an omnibus \nbill. These are huge, and they are loaded with items, and most of us do \nnot read it. It would take us forever to read them all. But the problem \nis things get tucked in there that do not belong.\n  Here is a very simple example to make you understand. We have all \nbeen to the supermarket. We go to the supermarket. We take the kids \nalong. They are traveling along behind us, and we are pushing the cart. \nWe decide that we are going to get the essentials today. We are going \nto get a loaf of bread; we are going to get some milk, maybe meat and \npotatoes, the essentials, whatever we are going to have for dinner that \nnight or that week. They are the basics. We know what the budget is and \nwhat we are going to do.\n  What are the kids doing? They are trailing along, and while we are \npicking up the loaf of bread, they are over there picking up the Reeses \ncandy or the box of Cheerios and tossing them into the cart while we \nare pushing it along, and we are taking them out and putting them back \nbecause we do not want these things. We do not want our kids to have \nthem; these are the goodies, these are the add-ons.\n  That is exactly what these bills are. We push through the bill, and \nall these Congressmen and Senators are loading it up, hoping that Mom \nand Dad are not going to take those things out, and when they get home \nthey will have the cookies and candy, or whatever else they want.\n  That is exactly what is happening. That is the best way I know to \nexplain exactly what is going on.\n  Now, when we look at some of these examples, in 1995, this year, \nthere is a study called the ``Congressional Pig Book,'' and I suppose a \ngood analogy would be to say there are a lot of things piggybacked on \nthese bills.\n  Now, it is interesting, in these 88 projects that are highlighted in \nthis pig book, what are the criteria to decide whether this is pork or \nnot on these fiscal bills? Well, if it is only requested by one chamber \nof commerce, if it is not authorized specifically, if it is not \ncompetitively awarded, if it is not requested by the President, and it \nexceeds the President's budget request or previous year's funding, and \nit has not been the subject of hearings, I say it is pork. I do not \ncare how good or bad the project is.\n  There are many, many good projects that get put in here. That is not \nthe issue. Should they be in there, in this particular bill? Should a \nsewer in Chicago be on an emergency earthquake relief bill in San \nFrancisco? I do not think so. I do not think that is honest. I think \nthat is dishonest.\n  Now, when we look somebody on Medicaid in the eye and we say, you \nknow, we are all going to have to bite the bullet; we have a $5 \ntrillion debt; it is going to be $6.5 trillion under the President's \nbudget in the next 5 years, and it is going up--not down, up--we look \nthose people in the eye and we say everybody has to pitch in, well, \nwhen I do that, Mr. President--and we are all \n[[Page S4143]] going to have to do it if we are going to bite the \nbullet here and balance the budget--I do not want to have to say to \nthat elderly woman or gentleman who is desperately in need of something \nthat we may have to reduce a little bit, well, you know what, I am \ngoing to cut you, but we are not, Congress is not going to take these \nkinds of things out: $93,000 added in conference for the National \nPotato Trade and Tariff Association; or $294,000 for regionalized \nimplications of farm programs; or $119,000 for swine research at the \nUniversity of Minnesota; or $8,783,000 for miscellaneous projects in \nthe State of Arkansas, including a rice germplasm center in Stuttgart, \nAR; or $1,184,000 for an alternative pest control center at the \nUniversity of Arkansas; or $946,000 for alternative pest control in \ngeneral; or $624,000 for increased staffing at Fayetteville, Stuttgart, \nBonneville, and Pine Bluff for forestry.\n  I do not want to have to look those people in the eye and say we are \nfunding that, and that this Congress does not have the courage to take \nthose items out. Not this Senator. I do not want to have to do that. I \nwish to say, yes, we are going to have to take these hits because it is \nour children who are going to lose, not us. You will get your benefits. \nIt is our children who are going to lose. And I do not want this stuff \nfunded. If you are going to fund it, if you want to come in here and \nsay you want $950,000 for the Appalachian Soil and Water Conservation \nLaboratory, then come down on the floor of the Senate and fight for it \nafter the President vetoes it. Tell the American people you want it, \nand it is in your State, and why you need it. And if you get the votes, \nyou can have it. But come down here and talk about it, fight for it, if \nyou think that is important, if you think that is more important than \nMedicaid or Medicare or national defense or cleaning up a Superfund \nsite. If that is more important, come down here.\n  If you think $200,000 for Appalachian fruit research is more \nimportant than national defense or cleaning up a Superfund, come down \nhere and fight for it. Come down here and say, Mr. President, I am \nsorry you took that out. You should not have vetoed that, Mr. \nPresident. I want that $200,000 for fruit research. That is important. \nBy golly, that is more important than anything else you have out there, \nand I want it.\n  Go ahead. Come down here and fight for it.\n  How about $11 million for an Estuarine Habitats Research Laboratory \nin Lafayette, LA? How about this one: $1 million added in conference \nlast year for construction of Mystic Seaport Maritime Education Center \nin Mystic, CT. Is that more important than Medicaid? Is that more \nimportant than Medicare? Is that more important than giving our troops \nwho are defending us all over the world a 2-percent pay raise? If you \nthink so, come down on the floor and fight for it.\n  That is what the line-item veto does. That is why it is being fought \nover here, and that is why we are running up a debt of over $5 \ntrillion. That is why we are going to keep on running it up, because \nthey would not pass the balanced budget amendment, and now they are not \ngoing to pass this either, because not only do they not want to take \nthe big numbers out, they will not even take the little numbers out, \nthe little projects, because they are all so important to them.\n  That is why we have this debt, and that is why our children and our \ngrandchildren are going to pay for it and suffer for it. That is what \nis wrong with this place. That is what the American people voted for on \nNovember 8, to change it. But what do we do in the Senate? The \n``McLaughlin Report'' calls the Senate the ``killing field''; we kill \nall the good legislation that passes the House. It comes over here and \nwe kill it.\n  Well, my colleagues and American people, take a look at who is doing \nthe killing. Watch the votes. Watch the votes.\n  Now, $750,000 for Hawaiian fisheries development; $15 million for the \nconstruction of a footbridge from New Jersey to Ellis Island. Do you \nknow where that was? That was on an Interior appropriations bill. That \nthing comes rolling in here and everybody says, ``We can't cut the \nInterior appropriations bill. We have to pass it. It is an \nappropriations bill. We will shut down the Government. The Interior \nDepartment will not be able to function.''\n  That is exactly why the $15 million for the footbridge is in there, \nfolks, because they know you are not going to cut it; you are not going \nto stop it. They know you are going to pass it, and they know the \nPresident is going to sign it.\n  If you have the line-item veto, he can sign the bill and he can take \nthat out, and that is why they are showing you the charts over here. \nThis is why they are complicating the process. What is so complicated \nabout that? The President takes a look at the bill, and he says $15 \nmillion for a footbridge? No. He takes the veto pen out.\n  There is nothing complicated about that. If it is complicated, good. \nSo be it. It is worth it. That is $15 million saved for the taxpayers \nand $15 million less for the debt.\n  The national debt is growing at $7,500 per second--not minute, not \nhour, per second. Add it up, if you are listening to this debate, at \nthe time I finish speaking from the time I started, and see how much \nthe debt was added to, how much more we added to it.\n  That is what is wrong with this place. That is why we voted for \nchange. And the status quo is still over here fighting it every inch of \nthe way.\n  The line-item veto; $10,912,000 for foreign language assistance. I do \nnot know what that is, foreign language assistance. I could see \nlearning to speak it. What is foreign language assistance? You have to \ndig in here and find it out. The Senator who put it in here is going to \nhave to come down on the floor and he is going to say, ``Boy, that \n$10,912,000 for foreign language assistance is critical for our \ncountry. The taxpayers have to spend this money, by golly. And if they \ndo not spend it, I cannot imagine what will happen.''\n  And that, again, is what we are faced with. That was on the Labor, \nHHS, Education appropriations bill. If somebody says we want to cut the \nDepartment of Housing or HHS, they will say, ``My goodness, I will lose \nmy $10,912,000 for foreign language assistance.''\n  How about $936,000 for the Palmer Chiropractic School? Lord knows \nwhat that is.\n  I have nothing against chiropractors. I have used them. But do the \ntaxpayers of America have to fund this?\n  Last, but not least, from the ``Pig Book,'' the infamous ``Pig \nBook.'' I encourage my colleagues to take a copy of the ``Pig Book'' \nand read it. It is really insulting to pigs, frankly. They are very \nintelligent creatures, and I think it insults them to use the term \n``pig'' and associate it with this. But there is $400,000--listen to \nthis one--$400,000 for Maui algal bloom crisis. Not for Maui algal \nblooms; there is a crisis out there somewhere in Maui on this algae. So \ncut the Medicaid, cut the Medicare, cut defense, cut the environment, \ncut this--and fund that.\n  You say, ``Come on, you are oversimplifying it, Senator.''\n  If I am oversimplifying it, why are we spending the money? There is \nnothing complicated about it. Contrary to the chart, there is nothing \ncomplicated about it. The fact is, if the President had the line-item \nveto, he could veto it.\n  I thank my colleagues for listening and thank certainly my \ncolleagues, Senator McCain and Senator Coats, for their strong \nleadership. I hope the Senate, finally, will conclude that at least \nsecond best is better than nothing at all and pass the line-item veto.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I was going to inquire if there were any \nother speakers waiting to speak. I see the Senator from Pennsylvania \nhas arrived. I might inform the Senator from Pennsylvania there are \nonly 4 minutes left under the time controlled by the proponents of the \nline-item veto.\n  The minority has consented to allow 10 minutes of speaking time to \nSenator Smith. Since they do not have a speaker on the floor, they may \ndo so for the Senator from Pennsylvania under a unanimous-consent \nrequest. Other than that, because we are under a unanimous-consent \nagreement to quit at 3 p.m., in accordance with the majority and \nminority leaders' wishes, I regret that is the only time I have \navailable for the Senator.\n  [[Page S4144]] Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Indiana.\n  In the absence of any other speaker on the floor, I ask unanimous \nconsent that I might be permitted to speak for up to 15 minutes. I may \nuse less than that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support the line-item veto and have \ndone so consistently in my 14 years-plus in the U.S. Senate. As I have \nobserved the appropriations and expenditures practices of the Congress \nas we have run up enormous deficits year after year and have a national \ndebt which is now approximating $5 trillion, it has been obvious to me \nthat we needed restraints, we needed institutional change in the form \nof the balanced budget amendment, and that we need the line-item veto \nto enable the President of the United States to take a look at the \nbudget and to act in the national interest to strike an item, item by \nitem, without vetoing the entire bill.\n  It has been my legal judgment that the President of the United States \ncurrently has the constitutional authority to exercise the line-item \nveto. I draw that conclusion from learned studies which have been made \non this subject. One very prominent one is by Prof. Forrest McDonald, \nwho traces the history of the relevant constitutional provision and \nnotes that it was based on a provision from the Massachusetts \nconstitution of 1733, where the Governor of Massachusetts has exercised \nthe line-item veto. That constitutional provision has been incorporated \ninto the constitutions of many other States: Georgia, Pennsylvania--my \nown State--where the chief executive officers, the Governors, have \nexercised the line-item veto.\n  In the early days of the Republic, the President of the United States \ntook action which was in effect the exercise of the line-item veto. A \nreview of the history of the Constitution and the comments of the \nFounding Fathers supports the conclusion that the President of the \nUnited States was intended to have line-item veto under clause 3, \narticle I, section 7, of the U.S. Constitution.\n  I have endeavored to persuade the last two Presidents--President Bush \nand President Clinton--that they should exercise the line-item veto. I \nhave had occasion to talk to former President Bush about it on a number \nof occasions. One of the interesting aspects of being a U.S. Senator, \nand one from Pennsylvania, is to have traveled with President Bush on a \nnumber of occasions to Pennsylvania. When we travel on the plane \ntogether there is time for a variety of subjects, not quite as hectic \nand hurried as it is in the regular schedule. On a number of occasions \nI had a chance to talk in a leisurely way to President Bush about the \nline-item veto. He was always interested in the issue but always told \nme the same thing, and that was that his lawyer told him he could not \ndo it.\n  My response to President Bush was that he ought to change lawyers.\n  I immediately followed that suggestion with the request that he not \ntell anybody I had said that, because that might be frowned upon by the \nbar association and who knows, I may be practicing law again one day, \nsooner rather than later.\n  But in a very serious vein, President Bush did not take the bold \napproach and exercise the line-item veto, which I think he could have \ndone under the constitutional authority and which he should have done.\n  In President Clinton's first year in office, I had occasion to travel \nwith him to Ambridge, PA. Again, another plane ride gave us an \nopportunity to talk at leisure about a number of subjects. I made the \nsuggestion to President Clinton that he should exercise the line-item \nveto and gave him a brief statement of what I considered to be his \nconstitutional authority.\n  President Clinton said, ``Send me a memorandum of law.''\n  I did so. He wrote me back a short time later, saying he did not want \nto tangle with congressional leaders on this subject. And I can \nunderstand that, because the congressional appropriation power is \nzealously guarded. And I am one of the appropriators. I sit on the \nAppropriations Committee, which has the authority to allocate the \nspending of $1.6 trillion a year. Notwithstanding that position on what \nmany call the most powerful committee in the Congress, the \nAppropriations Committee, it has long seemed to me that the line-item \nveto would very well serve the interests of the country at large.\n  We had a very dramatic commentary on massive appropriations bills, \nwhere the President did not have the opportunity to even veto one of \nthe 13 appropriations bills side by side when we passed a continuing \nresolution during the administration of President Reagan.\n  A continuing appropriations bill, for those who may be watching on C-\nSPAN 2, if anybody is, is a document which comes at the end of the \nfiscal year shortly before September 30 to authorize continued spending \nand continuing operations of the Federal Government after midnight on \nSeptember 30 into the new fiscal year which begins on October 1. There \nhad been a period of time where we had not passed all the \nappropriations bills and, in fact, had not passed many of them. We sent \nto President Reagan an enormous continuing resolution which was about 2 \nfeet thick. President Reagan, in one of his speeches to a joint session \nof Congress, objected to the continuing resolution which denied him the \npower of not only, as he saw it, to exercise the line item veto but he \ncould not even veto a bill on a major department; for example, the \nInterior bill or the District of Columbia appropriations bill. But they \nwere massive--as many, I think, on some occasions as all 13 of the \nappropriations bills.\n  For illustrative effect, President Reagan brought into the House \nChamber where we had the joint session of Congress the continuing \nresolution which, as I say, was about 2 feet thick.\n  Senator Coats was elected in 1988. Senator Coats was in the House. Of \ncourse, he remembers it. President Reagan had it on the edge of the \npodium. I was sitting closer than I am to the Chair. I became \nimmediately apprehensive that this continuing resolution so bulky was \nin peril of falling over the podium. As the President continued to \nspeak, the situation was more tenuous with each moment.\n  Then, finally I figured out that President Reagan knew exactly what \nhe was doing. He was not only keeping me in suspense but keeping the \ntelevision viewers in suspense that this enormous document might fall. \nIt was, I think, President Reagan's way of dramatizing the effect on \nthis ponderous overwhelming bill which had come to him but could not \neven be managed very well on the podium, let alone managed in terms of \nperusal to see what was in the national interest. He was being denied \nthe opportunity as President to at least veto a single appropriations \nbill.\n  He made it through the speech. It did not fall. But I have remembered \nthat occasion. Further underscoring the interest and the necessity in \nallowing the President to have the power to veto at least an individual \nappropriations bill, and the Congress has done better on that in modern \ntimes--sending the appropriations bills over, really on the need to \nhave the President with the authority to strike individual items.\n  This is an especially timely matter today in the wake of the Senate's \nfailure to pass the balanced budget amendment. I have supported the \nbalanced budget amendment and the line-item veto during my entire \ntenure in the U.S. Senate. It may be that the balanced budget amendment \nwill return to the Senate agenda and by virtue of the motion pending \nfor reconsideration that there may be a change of a single vote, and \nthe matter may come back and we may yet pass the balanced budget \namendment to provide the discipline to have a balanced budget in the \nCongress just as States have constitutional provisions mandating a \nbalanced budget, just as cities do, as counties do, and as individuals \nwe do because, if we do not live within our own means, we will wind up \nin a bankruptcy court.\n  Recently I had the great pleasure of becoming a grandfather. My son \nhad a baby daughter, Silvi Specter, who will be 14 months old on \nSunday. I had always thought about and talked about the impropriety of \nhaving a credit card which attached obligations to our children and to \nour children's children and \n[[Page S4145]] to succeeding generations. But I came into sharp focus \nas I saw this infant and held her in my hands when she was less than a \nday old back on January 20, 1994, and seeing her grow up, and seeing \nwhat is really happening every day as we burden her generation and \nfuture generations on a credit card where we would not consider even \nremotely charging something to her account. But that is in effect what \nwe are doing as a Nation.\n  During the course of the debate on this line-item veto there will be \nmany statements about how the interest rate is mounting. Senator Smith \npointed out in dramatic fashion the increase on a moment-by-moment \nbasis. That is just unfair to the next generation and the generations \nwhich follow.\n  That is why we are working currently on a rescissions bill sent over \nby the House of Representatives just yesterday. The appropriators met \nyesterday afternoon to take a look, to do our job in cutting expenses \non the Federal budget.\n  In my capacity as chairman of the appropriations subcommittee of \nLabor, Health and Human Services and Education, the cut was especially \nonerous, some $5 billion. But I am committed to balancing the budget by \nthe year 2002 which is the target set by the Congress, whether or not \nwe have a balanced budget amendment. I think we have to move on a path \nto reach the balanced budget by that year. I have some differences of \njudgment with what the House sent over. But I am reasonably confident \nthat the Senate will meet that target of the $17 billion rescission.\n  I have concerns, Mr. President, as to cuts which will affect summer \njobs where I think in America today there has been a reliance for the \nyoung people to have activities for the summer where they cannot find \njobs in the private sector, a matter which keeps the lids on our big \ncities and our smaller communities. I have some concerns about cuts in \nthe education line where there will be moneys taken away from drug-free \nschools. But this is a matter of establishing our priorities.\n  I believe that a much, much better job can be done on establishing \nthe priorities for America's spending. If we are not prepared to tax \nfor it, we ought not be prepared to spend for it. If there is one thing \nthat will not pass in the U.S. Senate or the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives today, it would be a tax increase.\n  It is my hope, Mr. President, that we will soon one day take up \nSenate bill 488, which I introduced 2 weeks ago yesterday, which would \nsimplify the tax system in America, which would enable taxpayers to \nfill out their tax returns on a simple postcard.\n  If I may show what could be done under my proposal for a national \ntax, it would be a 20-percent national tax which has been worked out \nvery carefully by Professors Hall and Rabushka of Stanford University. \nIt will allow only two deductions for charitable contributions and for \ninterest on home mortgages, and it would be simplicity personified. Who \nknows?\n  There may be someone in America today watching C-SPAN 2 who is \nfilling out his or her tax return. I know that individual would love \nthe opportunity to fill it out on a single postcard as I would myself. \nThere is an amazing amount of some 5 billion hours spent by Americans \non their tax returns and some $200 billion on the cost of filing \nreturns. But tax simplification is somewhat off the subject. But I \nmention a national tax just in passing.\n  I compliment my colleague in the House of Representatives, Majority \nLeader Dick Armey, who has proposed a similar measure. It is my hope \nthat we will take up the issue of a national tax and tax reform. But I \nbelieve it would be unthinkable to have a tax increase given the mood \nof the American people where the mandate of the last election was very \ndirect and very blunt; that is for smaller Government, for lesser \nspending, and for less taxes.\n  Certainly, the minimum is to have the balanced budget and the line-\nitem veto, which would be a very, very important and significant step \non an institutional change which would provide the mechanism to cut \nspending, which has not really been a priority item, and would help \nlead us on the bath--it might lead us on a ``bath,'' too, which is a \nFreudian slip--on the path to cut expenditures. But the pending line-\nitem veto would certainly give the President the clear-cut authority \nand the confidence to exercise the line-item veto.\n  In the unlikely event that this measure does not pass, I hope that \nPresident Clinton will again review the constitutional authority for \nthe President to exercise the line-item veto under the current legal \nconstitutional provisions.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair announces that all the remaining \ntime is under the control of the minority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/17/senate-section/article/S4134-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO.

Mr. President, I read a rather interesting article--a \nrather shocking article--in the Wall Street Journal yesterday about \naffluent urban farmers getting crop subsidies.\n  Lo and behold, I was absolutely shocked, as I think most Americans \nwill be when they learn, and those that did learn, about Sam. Now I am \ntalking about Sam Donaldson. Let me say right now, Sam, wherever you \nare, come out of hiding. Sam, come out of hiding and give the money \nback.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this Wall Street Journal \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 16, 1995]\n\n As Congress Considers Slashing Crop Subsidies, Affluent Urban Farmers \n                          Come Under Scrutiny\n\n                          (By Bruce Ingersoll)\n\n       Winnetka, IL.--The neighbors on Woodley Road know next to \n     nil about Helen Pinnell, but they assume she is loaded. How \n     else could she afford a multimillion-dollar home here in one \n     of suburban Chicago's most exclusive enclaves?\n       Her neighbor next door, Marlo Brown, is stunned to hear \n     that an heir to the fabled King Ranch in Texas left his $10-\n     million share of the vast cattle-and-oil empire to Mrs. \n     Pinnell more than 20 years ago. ``Isn't that wonderful \n     luck,'' exclaims the elderly Mrs. Brown.\n       Mrs. Pinnell, it turns out, is doubly lucky. As if oil \n     royalties and agricultural revenues from her 87,000-acre \n     spread on the Texas Gulf Coast weren't enough, she collects \n     farm subsidy payments each year from the Agriculture \n     Department. Since 1985, the total payout to her and three \n     Pinnell family trusts comes to nearly $1.5 million, according \n     to USDA payment data.\n       Throughout the country, there are thousands of other \n     absentee landlords in Mrs. Pinnell's city-slicker shoes, \n     including ranch-owner Sam Donaldson of ABC-TV fame, a New \n     York merchant banker, two scions of an antebellum cotton \n     planter, even an unidentified $400,000-subsidy recipient with \n     a distinctly nonrural zip code--90210--in Beverly Hills, \n     Calif.\n\n\n                          antisubsidy backlash\n\n       How long they can count on government checks coming in the \n     mail depends on how much money Congress whacks out of the \n     crop-subsidy programs this year. With the 1995 farm bill \n     debate in full cry, lawmakers already are trying to rescind \n     funds from this fiscal year's Agriculture Department budget. \n     Whipping up an anti-subsidy backlash are environmentalists \n     and conservative Republicans, who contend that the \n     Depression-era farm programs are badly out of date and out of \n     control. While continuing to provide a safety net for \n     struggling farmers, the critics say, the subsidy programs \n     increasingly pad the cushion under already comfortable off-\n     the-farm farmers. For the first time, the Environmental \n     Working Group has documented the extent to which suburban and \n     city dwellers benefit from farm subsidies.\n       ``We have no beef with people investing in farms, but why \n     are taxpayers covering the risks of an absentee North Dakota \n     farm owner living in Manhattan?'' wonders Kenneth Cook, \n     president of the Washington-based watchdog group.\n       Using computerized USDA data, the group has traced the flow \n     of hundreds of millions of tax dollars to off-the-farm \n     farmers--including corporations and partnerships--in the 50 \n     largest U.S. cities since 1985. Chicago's farm owners, for \n     example, collected $24 million over the last decade. But if \n     you add in Mrs. Pinnell's hometown, Winnetka, and other \n     [[Page S4146]] Chicago suburbs, the total swells to $55 \n     million.\n       Mrs. Pinnell was once secretary for a plumbing company. She \n     owes her wealth to a grandson of 19th century cattle baron \n     Richard King, Edwin Atwood, whom she befriended in his old \n     age. In the early 1970s, she took over Mr. Atwood's King \n     Ranch holdings and bought out another heir and a Chicago \n     policeman who had been bequeathed part of the ranch by yet a \n     third heir.\n       In Texas, Mrs. Pinnell has her own cattle brand, a big \n     ranch house, plenty of cattle, a small field of oil wells \n     pumping away and about 30,000 acres rented to cotton and \n     sorghum farmers. Her land is bordered by the late Nelson \n     Rockefeller's 6,000-acre spread, now owned by his two sons.\n\n\n                        ``Take-Charge'' Landlord\n\n       ``She hardly shows up down here,'' says ranch manager Jerry \n     Taylor. But when she does, she takes charge. Says Max Dreyer, \n     a retired farmer in nearby San Perlita, Texas: ``When they're \n     rounding up cattle, she won't even let the helicopter pilots \n     fly over the house.''\n       Here in Winnetka, Mrs. Pinnell and her husband, Curtis, a \n     retired railroad freight agent, stay behind the double doors \n     and two-story Doric columns of their immense brick house. \n     Members of the Women's Garden Club of Woodley Road see them \n     only in passing on the road. In her red Mercedes, Mrs. \n     Pinnell scoots over to an office she keeps in the nearby \n     suburb of Northbrook, sometimes to confer with her attorney, \n     Richard Williams. While his client won't comment, Mr. \n     Williams plays down the amount of the subsidies she gets, \n     which include disaster assistance and conservation payments. \n     ``There are lots of people with smaller farm operations that \n     get more subsidies,'' he says.\n       In New Mexico, Sam Donaldson passes for a big-time rancher, \n     absentee or not. He is the third-largest recipient of wool \n     and mohair payments in Lincoln County, where he runs flocks \n     of sheep and Angora goats on his sprawling spread near Hondo, \n     N.M., according to Allen (Bill) Trammell, the county \n     executive director for the Combined Farm Services Agency. \n     Over the last two years, $97,000 in subsidy checks have gone \n     to Mr. Donaldson's address in the Virginia suburbs of \n     Washington. What's more, under an agricultural conservation \n     cost-sharing program, Mr. Donaldson got $3,500 earlier to \n     defray the cost of watering facilities for his livestock.\n       An assistant to Mr. Donaldson says he isn't available for \n     comment.\n                          fifth avenue farmer\n\n       New Yorker Roslyn Ziff, a retired actress and opera singer, \n     adores her 67-year-old friend Henry Warren. ``He's the only \n     man I know who farms on Fifth Avenue,'' she says. For years, \n     Mr. Warren has seen his psychotherapy patients, lived on the \n     seventh floor of 27-story building at 1 Fifth Avenue and \n     managed a Nebraska farm from afar. Told he was the biggest \n     recipient of farm subsidies on Manhattan--$558,000 since \n     1985--his reply was: ``Good for me!'' But he adds that ``it's \n     good for consumers'' because farm programs help ensure a \n     stable food supply at relatively low prices.\n       This year, the retired Mr. Warren is leasing his land in \n     Holt County for cash, which means he will no longer get \n     subsidy payments. But that doesn't mean he will have to go \n     cold turkey. The Agriculture Department, because of a big \n     corn surplus, is paying farmers to hold their corn off the \n     market. Mr. Warren figures to collect about $6,000 in storage \n     fees this year, just as he got $81,000 in the late 1980s.\n       ``That's outrageous,'' Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney says \n     of her New York constituent's diet of subsidies. ``It points \n     to the hypocrisy of cutting Food Stamps and nutrition \n     programs.''\n       Another Nebraska farm-owning New Yorker is Daniel \n     Lamprecht, an agribusiness deal-maker for ING Capital \n     Holdings Corp.'s merchant banking arm. Living in midtown \n     Manhattan, he has collected $158,000 in payments over the \n     last decade, mostly for keeping his hilly--and highly \n     erodible--cropland in the Conservation Reserve Program. All \n     along, he admits, he has dreaded being found out.\n       ``I'm the fourth generation to own this property,'' he \n     says. ``I'm loath to give it up. It isn't a hobby. It's an \n     economic enterprise.'' It would be unfair, he argues, for \n     Congress to deprive his 1,060-acre farm of subsidies, either \n     because of his off-farm income or his upscale New York \n     address.\n       Far to the south, Jack Northington Shwab and his sister \n     Clara Jane Lovell own 4,000 acres of farm land in Egypt, \n     Texas, where their ancestor, Captain W.J.E. Heard, settled in \n     the late 1840s and built a great plantation. Today, busloads \n     of tourists and history buffs tour the old place and the \n     museum in the rear. Meanwhile, three farmers till the land \n     and share with the landlords rice and corn receipts as well \n     as the subsidy payments. Over the last 10 years, Mr. Shwab \n     and Mrs. Lovell have each collected $344,000, he on Hilton \n     Head Island, S.C., and she on Nantucket Island off \n     Massachusetts, according to USDA payment data.\n       While calling himself ``a retired investor,'' Mr. Shwab \n     still looks after a portfolio of stocks and bonds as well as \n     his Texas land holdings and natural gas wells. He, for one, \n     is becoming alarmed about the antisubsidy rumblings on \n     Capitol Hill. ``I do intend to write my congressman,'' he \n     says. But first he must figure out which one--his \n     representative from South Carolina or his representative from \n     Texas.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I was shocked to learn that Sam \nDonaldson, who happens to be one of the most highly paid journalists in \nthe United States, earning millions of dollars, is collecting welfare--\n$100,000 in welfare payments--from the U.S. Government. That is right. \nIt is called the Wool and Mohair Subsidy Program. It is supposed to \nhelp farmers.\n  Sam Donaldson has received almost $100,000 for a ranch in New Mexico \nwhile he lives right outside the Capitol here in suburban Washington, \nin Virginia. I think it is an outrage. It is wrong. It is wrong and it \nmust be stopped.\n  Does anyone really believe that Sam Donaldson is a real sheep farmer? \nReally? I see him on TV all the time.\n  Sam, do the right thing. You know what that is. Give the money back.\n  Now, there are plenty of other examples of absentee landlords \nreceiving these farm subsidies, but it is particularly glaring that \nmillionaire Sam Donaldson is getting this taxpayers' money.\n  Sam Donaldson, give that money back.\n  It is my understanding that Mr. Donaldson is the third largest \nrecipient of wool and mohair payments in Lincoln County, NM--not \nVirginia, or New Mexico. According to the Wall Street Journal, Mr. \nDonaldson received $97,000 in subsidy checks over the last 2 years. And \nunder another Government agricultural program--this time for \nconservation sharing--Mr. Donaldson got $3,500 to defray the costs of \nwatering facilities for his livestock.\n  And here we have Sam Donaldson, the self-appointed conscience of \nAmerica, who was said to be unavailable for comment. Can you imagine, \nMr. President, if you were unavailable for comment?\n  I can imagine why.\n  Sam Donaldson, come out of hiding and give back to the American \npeople--the taxpayers--that $97,000.\n  There is one other question I would like to pose. This program is \ngoing to be phased out over the next 2 years. I want to know whether \nMr. Donaldson is going to continue to receive those subsidies, or is he \ngoing to stop it? Americans have a right to know.\n  I hope, Sam, you give that money back.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I might first announce that we believe \nthere is just one additional speaker. Senator Heflin will be coming to \nthe floor to speak. I will go forward here, as if in morning business, \nuntil he arrives, and then I will be happy to turn the floor over to \nhim. Then it is my understanding the Senate will stand in recess for \nthe weekend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/17/senate-section/article/S4145-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4146-S4147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RESIGNATION OF WILLIAM A. GALSTON\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I noticed today a small item that appeared \nin the Washington Post, the news that the President's Deputy Assistant \nto the President for Domestic Policy, Mr. William Galston, had \nsubmitted his resignation, effective in May.\n  Mr. Galston is a Democrat. I am a Republican, but I have been an \nadmirer of some of the work that he has done in the past. He played a \nprominent role--I believe he was executive director--in the Progressive \nPolicy Institute, the arm of the Democratic Party that was looking for \nnew and innovative ways to address, in particular, some of the social \nconcerns, of the Democratic Party.\n  Mr. Galston said he is resigning because of his desire to strike a \ndifferent balance between family and career. And I do not doubt that at \nall.\n  Mr. Galston has written eloquently, has done a great deal of \nresearch, and, I think, made a real effort in the administration to \npoint out the importance of the family and American life in our \nsociety. He is going to return to teaching at the School of Public \nAffairs at the University of Maryland, where he is a senior research \nscholar at the university's Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy. \nHe has been a prolific writer, author of five books and \n[[Page S4147]] numerous articles on political philosophy, American \npolitics, and public policy.\n  He served in the Marine Corps, is a graduate of Cornell, with a Ph.D. \nfrom the University of Chicago, and taught at the University of Texas \nfor 10 years before coming to Washington in 1989.\n  Mr. Galston, along with Elaine Ciulla Kamarck, co-authored a policy \npaper criticizing liberal fundamentalism in the Democratic Party. Mr. \nGalston urged the Democratic Party to identify more with ``middle-class \nvalues--individual responsibility, hard work, equal opportunity--rather \nthan the language of compensation.''\n  Those are phrases and words that, obviously, Republicans have been \nusing for some time. We were encouraged when someone from the other \nparty, who occupied an important position in the Clinton \nadministration, used those terms and identified himself with that \nparticular philosophy.\n  Mr. Galston has been, and I am very sure he will continue to be, an \nadvocate of the importance of the family in the development of our \nchildren, an advocate of teaching individual responsibility and \npersonal achievement as the means of success and as the real solution \nto the problems facing our society today.\n  We are at a crossroads, Mr. President. We are at a critical juncture. \nOur problems are great. Our society is laboring under the burden of a \ndisintegrating moral and cultural fabric. To turn this tide, we will \nneed voices of moderation, of reason. Voices such as William Galston.\n  I hope that Mr. Galston's resignation does not signal that voices of \nmoderation, voices of reason, advocates for individual responsibility \nand moral courage are no longer welcome in the Clinton White House. \nThis would be an ominous signal. I trust that is not the case.\n  But I want to wish Mr. Galston the very best and thank him for his \ncontributions and his efforts to try to point out the importance of \nfamily, individual responsibility, the decline of the moral climate in \nthis country, and the need to reestablish and restore the fundamental, \nbasic institutions of our country--family, church, education, community \nservice--that have been so important in transmitting moral values to \nour children and to the next generation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/17/senate-section/article/S4146-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          SAINT PATRICK'S DAY\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, it is interesting to note that St. \nPatrick's Day is a special holiday which is only observed in Ireland \nand the United States. On this day, the color green is traditionally \nworn in both countries, by people from many different nationalities and \nbackgrounds.\n  Ireland and the United States share many other strong bonds in \naddition to their unique celebrations of this day. There is a deep love \nfor individual freedom and liberty today and throughout the history of \nboth countries.\n  In America's early days, another bond which existed between the two \nlands was a common enemy--the English crown. Americans and Irishmen \nexperienced the tyranny of the English king and the oppression of \nBritish troops. Our forefathers removed the yoke of British rule \nthrough the Revolutionary War and eliminated the continuing harassment \nby British through the War of 1812.\n  In 1798, in Ireland, there was a similar revolt. A group of men \nformed a resistance known as the ``united Irishmen.'' To demonstrate \nallegiance to their cause and to each other, they wore the color green. \nWhile this band of Irishmen fought valiantly, they were defeated by the \nmighty army commanded by Gen. Charles Cornwallis.\n  After Cornwallis' victory over the united Irishmen, the British tried \nto break the Irish spirit by declaring the wearing of green against the \nlaw. Many songs and poems were written to protest this tyranny. I \nrecall parts of a poem entitled ``The Wearin' O' the Green'':\n\n     O Paddy dear, an' did ye hear the news that's goin' round?\n     The shamrock is by law forbid to grow on Irish ground!\n     No more St. Patrick's Day we'll keep, his colour can't be \n           seen\n     For there's a cruel law again the wearin' o' the green.\n\n  It is hard to fathom that just as our forefathers were embarking on \nthe greatest experiment in democratic government known to man, and \nenjoying the rights and liberties for which they had fought, men and \nwomen in Ireland were being imprisoned and even executed for wearing \ngreen. Wearing of the green was symbolic of their resistance. Many were \nforced to flee their beloved homeland to escape death, imprisonment, \noppression, and tyranny. They sought freedom in the United States, \nwhere our freedoms of speech, religion, expression, and assembly were \nsecured by the Constitution, and where one of the purposes of \ngovernment was the protection of the individual against government \ntyranny.\n  The final stanza of the poem I quoted from earlier, as\n   paraphrased, reflects the fleeing Irishmen's dreams:\n\n     But if at last our colour should be torn from Ireland's \n           heart,\n     Her sons with shame and sorrow from the dear old isle will \n           part;\n     I've heard a whisper of a country that lies beyond the sea,\n     Where rich and poor stand equal in the light of freedom's \n           day.\n     O Erin, must we leave you, driven by a tyrant's hand?\n     Must we ask a mother's blessing from a strange and distant \n           land?\n     Where the cruel cross of tyranny shall nevermore be seen\n     And where, please God, we'll live and die still wearin' O' \n           the green.\n\n  Although this is an Irish poem, it underscores the love of liberty \nthat characterizes America. Because of the bravery, determination, and \nthe sacrifice of or forefathers, the United States stands today as a \ncitadel of freedom and liberty in a world in which a large part of the \npopulation is still burdened by totalitarianism and oppression. The \ngreen we wear today is also to remember them, wherever they might be.\n  The Irish have contributed so much to the history of our Nation. They \nhave fought in our wars, they have served our communities. They have \nadded to our enjoyment through their stories and funloving spirit, \noften giving light to the darkest days. They have become great \nAmericans who still cherish and revere their Irish roots and heritage. \nThe spiritual descendants of St. Patrick have reminded us of the true \nimportance and value of individual rights and liberties, and have \nalways been in the forefront of defending the rights and liberties that \ndefine this Nation.\n  So, on this St. Patrick's Day, a day when true peace for the Emerald \nIsle seems to be finally in its grasp, let us remember the Irish \nheritage and those who struggle in the old country for freedom and \nliberty. Let us wear the green and remain forever mindful of all that \nit represents. And let us never forget that above all else, we are \nAmericans--Americans strong and free.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/17/senate-section/article/S4147-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

A bill to establish the negotiating objectives and fast-track \nprocedures for future trade agreements; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             THE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION REFORM ACT\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, as the United States enters the 21st \ncentury, we must expand our economic opportunities. It is with this \ngoal in mind that I introduce the Trade Agreement Implementation Reform \nAct.\n  During the recent Uruguay round debate, I pointed out the \nshortcomings of existing fast-track procedures. These flaws \nunnecessarily fed public suspicion and mistrust of trade agreements. \nThese agreements should not be burdened by unrelated legislative \nprovisions.\n  The Senate adopted the fast-track procedure in 1974. This important \ntool has allowed us to enter free-trade agreements with Canada, Israel, \nand Mexico. It has also been used to reduce trade barriers worldwide in \nthe Uruguay round; as well as the earlier Tokyo round. Nations must be \nassured that once they reach an agreement with the United States, it \nwill not be undermined by amendments that violate its provisions.\n  I believe that the basic arguments for a fast-track process are \nsolid. Hence, my bill does not drastically change it except for two \nmajor provisions.\n  First, legislation submitted under fast track should contain only \nprovisions absolutely necessary to implement an agreement. Prior law \nallowed provisions ``necessary and appropriate'' and encouraged deals \nwith special interests in exchange\n for support. I believe that the integrity of the fast-track process \nduring the Uruguay \n[[Page S4149]] round was called into question by amendments not \nrelevant to the agreement itself.\n  Second, although past fast-track legislation has not been amendable, \nwe should make one exception for future trade legislation. Senators \nshould be able to amend or delete provisions which merely serve to \noffset revenue losses from tariff changes. Such provisions in the \nrecent Uruguay round legislation included the controversial pioneer \npreference and pension reform titles. Under the pay/go rules, Congress \nmust find offsets for revenue losses. Since these measures are not \nrelated to the agreement itself, we should be able to amend them, \nsubject to overall time limits.\n  My State of Indiana is more dependent on exports, on a per-capita \nbasis, than all but two other States. As Indiana exports increase, so \ndo job opportunities. Indeed, incomes and job security of all Americans \ndepend on maintaining and expanding U.S. exports. With our first-rate \nlabor force and business climate, the United States can meet global \neconomic competition head-on and create jobs.\n  The bottom line is that increased exports create jobs. Studies have \nshown that every $1 billion in exports supports 20,000 jobs. Our \nfarmers, manufacturers, and service companies can compete in countries \nfrom which they would otherwise have been shut out. Therefore, we must \ncontinue to reduce trade barriers that have kept the United States from \nrealizing its full potential and insist that other countries open their \nmarkets to our products.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the changes I am proposing to existing \nlaw are modest but essential to our cooperation with the administration \non trade agreements. That cooperation, which aims to strengthen \nAmerica's economic performance, has been a good example of bipartisan \nleadership in Congress. It is in that spirit that I propose the Trade \nAgreement Implementation Reform Act.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/17/senate-section/article/S4148-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 105\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from Nebraska \n[Mr. Kerrey] was added as a cosponsor of S. 105, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide that certain cash rentals of \nfarmland will not cause recapture of special estate tax valuation.\n\n\n                                 S. 258\n\n  At the request of Mr. Pryor, the name of the Senator from North \nCarolina [Mr. Helms] was added as a cosponsor of S. 258, a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide additional \nsafeguards to protect taxpayer rights.\n\n\n                                 S. 465\n\n  At the request of Mr. Baucus, the name of the Senator from Colorado \n[Mr. Campbell] was added as a cosponsor of S. 465, a bill to amend the \nSolid Waste Disposal Act to provide congressional authorization for \nrestrictions on receipt of out-of-State municipal solid waste and for \nState control over transportation of municipal solid waste, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 568\n\n  At the request of Mr. Coats, the names of the Senator from Montana \n[Mr. Burns] and the Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 568, a bill to provide a tax credit for families, to \nprovide certain tax incentives to encourage investment and increase \nsavings, and to place limitations on the growth of spending.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/17/senate-section/article/S4149-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, occasionally, there is good news. We \ntend to concentrate on the negative news.\n  I am on the mailing list for the Armenian Information Service \npublication, New Watch, and in their March 8, 1995 edition the lead \narticle is an Associated Press story of March 1, 1995 with that title, \n``Armenia and Turkey Move Towards Conciliation.''\n  I hope that turns out to be reality.\n  That is my hope for the sake of both Armenia and Turkey and stability \nin the region.\n  Everyone ends up a winner if this turns out to be true.\n  I commend the leaders of Armenia and Turkey for moving toward \nreconciliation.\n  And I ask that the item be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n         [From the Armenian Information Service, Mar. 8, 1995]\n\n              Armenia And Turkey Move Towards Conciliation\n\n       Turkey and Armenia seem on the verge of opening a new era \n     in their relations. Turkey and Armenia appear willing to \n     normalize ties, basically for mutual economic benefits, \n     despite a history of diplomatic and historical conflict. \n     ``Turkey is ready to contribute to regional peace with \n     confidence-building measures,'' Ferhat Ataman, the foreign \n     ministry spokesman, said in regard to Armenia. He did not \n     elaborate. But a government official, speaking on the \n     condition of anonymity, said Turkey might consider opening \n     its air space to Armenia ``especially after Armenia's recent \n     gestures to please Turkey.'' The official was referring to \n     Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrossian's decision to close \n     down a major opposition party, the Dashnaks, which demands an \n     apology from Turkey for an alleged genocide and claims \n     territory in eastern Turkey. ``An Armenian envoy told us that \n     Ter-Petrossian and the Armenian people were willing to \n     normalize ties with Turkey,'' Ataman said. Jirair Libaridian, \n     Ter-Petrossian's chief advisor, was in Ankara last week on \n     the invitation of the Foreign Policy Institute, which works \n     closely with the foreign ministry. ``Normalization of ties \n     will be the most natural move,'' Libaridian said then.\n       The roots of Turkish-Armenian conflict go back 100 years. \n     Armenians accuse the Turks of killing 1.5 million of their \n     people during World War I. Turks say about 300,000 Armenians \n     perished during their deportation as a result of killings, \n     famine or disease.\n      Although Armenia has suffered more from Turkey closing its \n     borders and airspace, Turkey also feels the pinch. ``My \n     city is suffering a total economic collapse. If we were \n     allowed to have at least limited border trade with Armenia \n     it would provide some sort of relief,'' said Mayor Tuncay \n     Mutluer from the eastern border city of Kars. Ankara has \n     bigger financial concerns at stake. When Washington threw \n     its support behind a pipeline project from Central Asia \n     through Turkey, it pointed to Armenia as a possible route. \n     Glen Rase, director for international energy policy at the \n     U.S. State Department, told a conference in London this \n     week that ``a route through Armenia might well prove to be \n     the most attractive from a foreign policy standpoint if it \n     had the effect of moving Armenia and Azerbaijan closer to \n     peace.''\n       Turkey's close historical and cultural ties with Azerbaijan \n     remain an obstacle in the process of improving ties with \n     Armenia. Azerbaijan already feels uneasy about a Turkish-\n     Armenian rapprochement. ``It will be a betrayal of Baku,'' \n     said Vefa Gulizade, Azerbaijan's presidential advisor, during \n     a visit to Ankara last week. ``It is necessary to \n     [[Page S4150]] see the realities rather than being \n     emotional,'' Ataman responded. Turkey rules out diplomatic \n     relations with Armenia unless Azerbaijan's territory is set \n     free. But Ankara apparently feels the pressure from \n     Washington for better relations with Armenia. ``On Turkey-\n     Armenian relations, which are so frayed with history, \n     emotion, misunderstanding and conflicting views of history, \n     our view is very simple Your two countries must work \n     together, must find ways to move on to the future,'' Richard \n     Holbrook, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State, said last \n     month.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/17/senate-section/article/S4149-4", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO THE GIRL SCOUTS OF AMERICA\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \norganization that is truly an American institution--the Girl Scouts of \nAmerica.\n  This week we celebrate National Girl Scout Week, in recognition of \nthe founding of the Girl Scout organization on March 12, 1912. \nThroughout the country, Girl Scouts are observing this special week by \nparticipating in numerous community service activities.\n  In my home State of California, where there are 20 Girl Scout \ncouncils, young women participated in the first ever Be Your Best Day \non March 14. All over the State, Girl Scouts contributed their talents, \nenergy, and time to make an impact on their communities. For example, \nthe Girl Scouts in Anaheim, CA, collected over 300 dolls, \nreconditioned them, and distributed them to various local \nagencies.\n  In Placentia, CA, Girl Scouts assisted the staff of the Van Buren \nElementary School by cleaning the school, decorating bulletin boards, \nand pulling weeds. And, in the bay area, the Girl Scouts collected and \ndistributed 750 bags of clothing and other items for Goodwill. These \nare just a few examples of the impressive work that the Girl Scouts do \nevery day.\n  When the Girl Scouts of America was formed in 1912, their mission was \nsimple: To promote character, good conduct, patriotism and service. As \nthey have advanced over the last 83 years, the Girl Scouts have \nsuccessfully changed to meet the needs of our society while maintaining \nthe original spirit and conviction in which the organization was \nfounded.\n  I am proud of the Girl Scouts for their ongoing commitment to serving \ntheir communities and our Nation. I am pleased to offer my sincere \ncongratulations to them for their 83 years of distinguished \nservice.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/17/senate-section/article/S4150-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4150-S4151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          DOWN GOES THE DOLLAR\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I appreciate the column of James \nGlassman, which has appeared on the financial pages of the Washington \nPost twice a week and, I was pleased to see, on the editorial page the \nother day.\n  In a column titled, ``Down Goes the Dollar,'' he suggests that we \nought to be looking at our deficit if we really want to do something \nabout the dollar.\n  Unfortunately, the lesson of recent history is that we will pay \nattention to the deficit for a short time, then other things will \npreoccupy us, and our interest in reducing the deficit will diminish. \nThat is why we need a constitutional amendment.\n  In his excellent column he quotes Alan Greenspan in response to a \nquestion by Representative John Kasich about what would happen if we \nactually moved to balancing a budget. The Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Board, Alan Greenspan, replied ``There would be some strain.'' \nThen, he says, as borrowing fell, so would interest rates, and ``the \neffects would be rather startling.'' Real incomes would rise, and we'd \nbe ensured that our kids would live better than we have, he said.\n  Alan Greenspan's remarks coincide completely with what Data \nResources, Inc., the Congressional Budget Office, and the General \nAccounting Office [GAO] have told us. The GAO report to us in June 1992 \nsaid that two decades after we balanced the budget, the average \nAmerican would have an increased income of 36 percent. That is a \nstartling figure. And they suggest, if we simply stumble along as we \nare doing now, that's what we will do in terms of our standard of \nliving, with a possible slight increase or slight decline; or, as \nappears more likely, the deficit gradually grows, their prediction is \nfor economic chaos.\n  No one should have any illusions. Our failure to address our fiscal \nproblems discourages financial markets in this country and around the \nworld.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the James Glassman column, and I ask \nthat it be printed in Record.\n  The column follows:\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 14, 1995]\n\n                          Down Goes the Dollar\n\n                         (By James K. Glassman)\n\n       Dinner for two at Aubergine in Munich now costs more than \n     400 American dollars (including a half-decent wine), and a \n     room at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo runs $600 a night. But if \n     you aren't planning a trip to Germany or Japan, the recent \n     decline in the dollar won't affect you much. At least not \n     yet.\n       Benign neglect can sometimes solve currency problems, but \n     the dollar is so weak right now that the only way to preserve \n     its status as the world's reserve currency may be a sharp \n     increase in interest rates. ``We fear that the ending of this \n     will not be pretty,'' wrote Ray Dalio, an astute financial \n     analyst, in a fax to his clients last week.\n       Exchange rates are a complicated and emotional subject. No \n     one really knows why they go up and down, but there's \n     certainly a glut of explanations for the latest crash in the \n     dollar:\n       ``The Mexican crisis is almost certainly the single biggest \n     factor,'' said economist John Mueller of Lehrman Bell Mueller \n     Cannon in testimony before a Senate committee.\n       ``It comes down to a lack of confidence'' in the ability of \n     new Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, wrote Hobart Rowen of \n     The Post on Sunday.\n       Charles Ramond, whom runs the currency consulting firm \n     Predex in New York, says that the dollar will keep falling \n     simply because it's too popular, especially in emerging \n     countries--``the best U.S. brand since Coca-Cola.'' And with \n     so many greenbacks floating around the world, the dollar has \n     been cheapened as a ``store of value.''\n       But there's another explanation that's easier to \n     understand: Our twin deficits--in trade and in the federal \n     budget--are forcing us to borrow too much. Through the early \n     1980s, the United States was the world's biggest creditor; \n     now we're the world's biggest debtor.\n       When foreigners lend to us, they have to trade their own \n     currencies for ours. Now, the Japanese, for example, are \n     saying that they'll only part with about 90 yen to buy a \n     dollar, in 1985, they pared with 263 yen.\n       If the dollar keeps falling fast, these lenders my become \n     reluctant to make dollar investments at almost any price \n     (that's what happened with peso investments in Mexico). The \n     only way to lure them will be with higher interest rates.\n       Dalio believes that if the Federal Reserve moves quickly \n     (it meets March 28), then the rate hike may only have to be \n     one percentage point, or two or three. That would probably \n     mean a recession, but if the Fed waits longer, ``the eventual \n     rate hikes and economic damage will have to be more severe.''\n       The truth is that the Fed has shown little appetite for \n     raising interest rates to attract foreigners to the dollar. \n     But the dollar's weakness may force the Fed's hand for a \n     different reason--something economists call ``imported \n     inflation.''\n       To make up for a falling dollar, foreign manufacturers have \n     to raise the prices they charge for goods they import to the \n     United States. Thus, it's likely that Japanese cars, for \n     example, will cost more here. If that happens, U.S. \n     automakers will raise their prices, too, slipping under the \n     Japanese umbrella.\n       In his testimony before the House Budget Committee last \n     Wednesday, Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, admitted that \n     imported inflation could be a problem and that ``it is \n     important to contain such pressures''--which the Fed does by \n     raising interest rates to dampen economic activity.\n       Of course, there's a better way to strengthen the dollar: \n     The government could stop borrowing $200 billion a year by \n     balancing the budget.\n       In fact, the defeat in the Senate of a constitutional \n     amendment to do just that--and the subsequent beatification \n     in the press of Saint Mark Hatfield, the only Republican \n     dissenter--may even have ignited the dollar selloff.\n       If so, then Congress will soon get a chance to show the \n     international markets that it's serious. Tomorrow, the House \n     Appropriations chairman, Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.), is \n     bringing a bill to the floor that will cut spending by $11 \n     billion immediately. That may not sound like much, but\n      it's actually revolutionary. In the past, Congress has used \n     floods and earthquakes as excuses to raise spending in the \n     middle of the year through ``dire emergency'' supplemental \n     bills.\n       Also tomorrow, Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio), the budget \n     chairman, will produce a list of reductions totaling nearly \n     $200 billion. Those cuts would merely pay for the tax \n     reductions in the ``Contract With America,'' but again, they \n     should encourage the markets. Then, in May, Kasich will \n     present what he calls ``The Big One''--the spending cuts to \n     bring the budget into balance by 2002.\n       Even if the tax reductions are trimmed by the Senate--and \n     many House Republicans privately hope they will be--balancing \n     the budget won't be easy. That's why Kasich asked Greenspan \n     for some spine-stiffening words for rubbery members of \n     Congress.\n       ``What would you tell the American people the reasons would \n     be for making some tough \n     [[Page S4151]] choices up front?'' Kasich asked last \n     Wednesday.\n       In the short run, Greenspan replied, ``There would be some \n     strain.'' Then, as borrowing fell, so would interest rates, \n     and ``the effects would be rather startling.'' Real incomes \n     would rise, and we'd be ensured that our kids would live \n     better than we have.\n       ``That's an awesome statement, Mr. Chairman!'' said Kasich, \n     practically bouncing out of his seat.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/17/senate-section/article/S4150-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. COATS.
